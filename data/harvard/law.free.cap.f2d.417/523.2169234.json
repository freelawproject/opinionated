We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-28\">The only question on this appeal is the legality, under the fourth and fourteenth amendments, of the seizure of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-29\">Appellant was convicted of robbery in the second degree upon a plea of guilty in Supreme Court, New York County. Before pleading guilty, appellant moved to suppress the introduction of the seized evidence. A suppression hearing was held at which the following facts were developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-30\">Appellant was on parole from Elmira Reformatory. His parole officer was one Robert H. Campbell. In the discharge of his duties Campbell visited Combs once a month at the apartment where he lived with his mother. Campbell was informed by the New York City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>police of Combs\u2019 arrest on the robbery-charge. He went to Combs\u2019 apartment, accompanied by three New York City detectives and by another parole officer. No attempt was made to obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The five men arrived at Combs\u2019 apartment at 1:45 p. m. In the apartment at that time were Combs\u2019 mother, Mrs. Canton, and two ladies from her church. Mrs. Canton answered the door, and invited the men to come in. Campbell and the others went into the living room and Campbell introduced the others. They all sat down and Campbell told Mrs. Canton that appellant and his brother had been arrested. He asked to see her sons\u2019 room and Mrs. Canton said, \u201cWell, I just made the beds, go in and take a look.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">(Mrs. Canton testified that one of the officers said, \u201cWe have to search your house,\u201d that she replied, \u201cAll right; but where is your search warrant,\u201d and that he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need it.\u201d Campbell testified that nothing was said about a search warrant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Campbell and two of the detectives searched appellant\u2019s room. Mrs. Canton aided in the search. After the search of appellant\u2019s room was completed, Mrs. Canton took one of the officers, a Detective Brady, into her room where they could \u201ctalk privately\u201d so that she would not be embarrassed by having her church friends overhear their conversation. Brady noticed a television set in the room and Mrs. Canton told him that her sons had given her the set.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Brady cheeked the serial number of the television set and told Mrs. Canton that the set had been stolen and that they would have to take it. She said, \u201cTake it out of here because I don\u2019t want anything in my house that is stolen.\u201d The officers left the apartment with the set about an hour and a half after their arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Appellant\u2019s mother testified that she permitted the search because \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to get the impression I didn\u2019t want them to look because it would look like I was hiding something, and I had nothing to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Combs\u2019 motion to suppress the seized evidence, i. e., the television set, was denied. The court found the search to have been \u201clegal and valid\u201d and stated, \u201cI do not believe that there was any request for a search warrant.\u201d The prosecution requested that the record reflect that the court had \u201cmade a factual determination here that there was no coercion used, that the search was consented to.\u201d The court said, \u201cThat was implied\u201d in its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">After the denial of his motion to suppress, appellant pleaded guilty. He then appealed his conviction, as permitted by Section 813-c of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure (McKinney Supp. 1968), challenging the denial of his motion to suppress. The conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division without opinion, People v. Combs, 25 A.D.2d 497, 267 N.Y.S.2d 885 (1966). The New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, 385 U.S. 878, 87 S.Ct. 157, 17 L.Ed.2d 105 (1966). The New York Court of Appeals subsequently denied appellant\u2019s application for reconsideration of his motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">Appellant then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that the denial of his motion to suppress was constitutionally erroneous. The writ was denied and this appeal is taken from the order of denial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the consent given by his mother was invalid because \u201cconsent in the presence of five law officers to avoid embarrassment in front of her church friends cannot be held to have been voluntarily given.\u201d Recognizing that the scope of our review of the state court\u2019s fact findings is limited to that permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (Supp. IV 1965-68), appellant argues that the state court did not apply the proper standard of law in concluding that consent had been given. He relies on Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968), which was decided after the state court and federal district court decisions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In <em>Bumper </em>four police officers came to defendant\u2019s house and were met by his grandmother. One of the officers said, \u201cI have a search warrant to search your house,\u201d and defendant\u2019s grandmother, who did not know about the alleged offense, said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d She was not threatened in any way and did not participate in the search at which a rifle was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In arguing that the search was valid, the state relied on consent by the grandmother; it did not produce a search warrant. The Supreme Court held that no proper consent had been given. It reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cWhen a law enforcement officer claims authority to search a home under a warrant, he announces in effect that the occupant has no right to resist the search. The situation is instinct with coercion \u2014 albeit eolorably lawful coercion. Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.\u201d 391 U.S. at 550, 88 S.Ct. at 1792.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We have no reason to reject the judge\u2019s finding in the present case that the officers made no claim that they had a search warrant or that they were authorized to -search the apartment without a warrant. In our case, unlike <em>Bumper, </em>Mrs. Canton was well acquainted with Campbell and would not have been intimidated by his coming again to her apartment where he had already visited a number of times. In <em>Bumper </em>there was no suggestion that the grandmother had assisted in the search as did appellant\u2019s mother in our case. Mrs. Canton\u2019s participation was indicative of consent. See United States v. Hall, 348 F.2d 837, 843 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 408, 15 L.Ed.2d 355 (1965); United States v. Smith, 308 F.2d 657, 664 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 716 (1963). It is clear that the <em>Bumper </em>case does not rule the ease before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Appellant contends that the consent given by his mother was invalid because of the failure of the officers to warn as to her fourth amendment rights in the manner required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) as to fifth and sixth amendment rights. In support of this proposition he cites two Seventh Circuit cases, United States v. Miller, 395 F.2d 116, 118 (7th Cir.) cert. denied, 393 U.S. 846, 89 S.Ct. 132, 21 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968), and United States v. Nikrasch, 367 F.2d 740, 744 (7th Cir. 1966), and two district court cases, United States v. Moderacki, 280 F.Supp. 633 (D.Del.1968), and United States v. Blalock, 255 F.Supp. 268 (E.D.Pa.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">We reject those cases as did the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Gor-man v. United States, 380 F.2d 158, 164 (1st Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To fulfill the purpose of the fourth amendment \u2014 controlling police conduct \u2014 it is unnecessary to adopt a rule that a search is per se invalid unless it is preceded by warnings as to fourth amendment rights. The courts are competent to determine whether valid consent has been given absent such warnings. A per se rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>undesirable because of its adverse effect on proper law enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that his mother was without authority to bind him by consenting to the search. See Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 740, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969); Bumper v. North Carolina, <em>supra, </em>391 U.S. at 548, note 11, 88 S.Ct. 1788.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">. As appellant followed the procedure established in Section 813-c, New York Code of Criminal Procedure (McKinney Supp. 1968), his plea of guilty does not prevent him from raising his search and seizure claim on federal habeas corpus. United States ex rel. Molloy v. Follette, 391 F.2d 231 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 917, 88 S.Ct. 1812, 20 L.Ed.2d 658 (1968); United States ex rel. Rogers v. Warden, 381 F.2d 209 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\">. While not rejecting outright its statement in <em>'Sikrasch, </em>the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit has described it as being \u201cof dubious propriety.\u201d Byrd v.
