The jury verdict was for Green. Warren appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-26\">Central to this case is the following indemnity provision of a contract between Warren and Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE \u2014 Contractor [Green] indemnifies and agrees to hold Owner [Warren] harmless from any and all liability, claims, demands or judgments for damages resulting from injuries to or death of persons, including Contractor and Contractor\u2019s employees, or any injury to or destruction of the property of others, including the property of Contractor or that of Contractor\u2019s employees, or any damages or losses to the property of Owner while Contractor is performing the work, which arises out of or in connection with the activities of Contractor, Contractor\u2019s servants, agents and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Sidney Elliott was injured at Warren's Gladewater, Texas, plant while there for the purpose of performing welding work for Warren, in connection with the lowering and rerouting of a pipeline. He filed suit against Warren for failure to furnish a safe place to work. Warren tendered defense of the suit to Green, relying on the indemnity agreement. Green refused to defend. The complaint in that case is not in the record, but the pretrial order in the present ease says that Elliott alleged that when injured he was on the premises of Warren to perform work as a subcontractor. What purports to be a copy of the pretrial order in the Elliott-Warren case is in the present record as an unauthenticated attachment to a trial brief. Paragraph 4 of that preterial order is the following stipulation of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">4. That Plaintiff was performing such work as an agent for \u00abs\u00e1es e sab-eeatraot with J. W. Green, who had a contract with the Defendant to perform certain work as requested by Defendant; that the work being performed by Plaintiff in this instance was covered under the contract between Defendant and J. W. Green. [Substitution in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">A jury trial resulted in a judgment in favor of Elliott. Warren again requested Green to take over the defense of the case and upon its refusal paid Elliott $12,750 in settlement. Warren then brought the present action against Green to recover the amount of its payment to Elliott and of its attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred in defending against Elliott\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Elliott had been employed by Warren as its only welder at its Gladewater plant. Warren terminated Elliott\u2019s employment. There was conflicting evidence concerning whether the termination was part of a reduction in work force. At that time Warren told Elliott it wanted to work out an arrangement whereby Elliott would purchase from Warren the truck and welding rig he had been using in his work and continue to do Warren\u2019s welding work on a contract basis. Elliott purchased the truck and equipment. Since company policy forbade Warren\u2019s contracting directly with its ex-employee, Warren talked with Elliott about his \u201cworking through\u201d an independent contractor. Warren suggested the names of several contractors and took an active part in trying to help Elliott make arrangements to \u201cget around\u201d the company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Elliott discussed the matter with one of the contractors named by Warren, but the contractor was not interested because already he had sufficient welders in his work force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Elliott then approached Green, a partnership furnishing labor and equipment to the oil and gas industry. Green had a contract with Warren to furnish labor and equipment to Warren at its Tyler, Texas, plant. After discussion between Green and Elliott, and Green and Warren, the contract at issue in this case was signed by Warren and Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The contract, furnished by Warren, was a form document providing that Warren \u201cmay, but does not obligate it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>self to, request [Green] to supply labor, supervision, expendable supplies, machinery, and tools necessary to accomplish certain work at or in conjunction with [the Gladewater plant].\u201d Green was referred to as an independent contractor. Attached to the form was Green\u2019s list showing twenty different occupational categories of workmen that could be supplied, with a straight time rate and an overtime rate for each, and more than fifty types of equipment\u2014 automotive, tractors, heavy construction, painting, and numerous other types, some with and some without operators\u2014 and the hourly rental rate for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The contract required that \u201cIn furtherance of [Green\u2019s] indemnity\u201d Green would maintain workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, employer\u2019s liability insurance, automotive liability insurance and public liability insurance, and \u201cSuch insur- and shall apply to operations by Contractor or by any subcontractor or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by either of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The scheduled rate provided by the contract for a welder with field equipment was $6.00 per hour. Green and Elliott, whose dealings were oral, agreed that Green would bill Warren at the $6.00 rate for Elliott\u2019s work and Green would pay Elliott $5.00 of this.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Elliott was furnished with a supply of Green\u2019s time sheet forms. When he did Warren\u2019s work he would prepare one of the forms and sign it as \u201ccontractor\u2019s [Green\u2019s] representative.\u201d Green would pay Elliott each week .or two weeks at the $5.00 rate and from time to time bill Warren at the $6.00 rate. Elliott was shown on Green\u2019s books as an independent contractor, and Green did not withhold income tax from him or pay Social Security for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Some of the workers which in the conduct of its business Green furnished to industry were Green\u2019s employees. Others, like Elliott, Green treated differently and considered to be independent contractors, and some of those in this category used Green\u2019s time sheets in the same manner as did Elliott. Green had welders, which it supplied to industry and carried on its records as employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Initially Green attempted to find jobs for Elliott other than the work for Warren. Elliott performed a few such jobs, using his equipment, for other companies with which Green had contracts. For those jobs Elliott used the same type of [Green] time sheets, and Green received the same $6.00 rate and paid Elliott $5.00 thereof. Later Elliott became reluctant to work on any jobs except those for Warren, fearing that someone else would \u201cget his foot in the door.\u201d Ultimately he did Warren jobs exclusively. In practice, Elliott and Warren dealt directly concerning the work Elliott was to do for Warren. Such supervision as Elliott had came from Warren, and Elliott could perceive no difference between the manner and type of work that he performed when on Warren\u2019s payroll and that which he performed when \u201cworking through\u201d Green. Green never exercised or attempted to exercise supervision. Green did not even know of Elliott\u2019s injury until six months after it occurred.<footnotemark>2A</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Green furnished other equipment to Warren under the Green-Warren contract on at least one occasion, and another time supplied to Warren a subcontractor to clean a tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The district court\u2019s view of the case, as reflected in its jury charge and its denial of charges requested by Green, was that Green\u2019s liability as indemnitor turned solely on the characterization of Elliott\u2019s relationship with Green and with Warren. It instructed that if Elliott was found to be a servant, agent or employee of Green when injured the verdict should be for Warren; that if Elliott, when injured, was an employee of Warren or Warren\u2019s special or borrowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>employee, the verdict should be for Green; and that if Elliott was found to be an independent contractor of Green he could not be an agent, servant or employee of Green. Warren, by requested instructions, which were denied, and by its objections to the charge, duly raised the issue of whether the scope of Green\u2019s liability was correctly defined. The jury returned a general verdict for Green and answered a special interrogatory that Elliott was working for Green as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We conclude that the liability of Green for indemnity does not necessarily turn on the characterization of Elliott\u2019s employment or contractual status, and for this reason a reversal is required. We hold also that there must be a determination of the extent to which the judgment in the Elliott-Warren suit established matters which are binding on the parties to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The indemnity agreement arose in the context of a particularized purpose \u2014 making available Elliott\u2019s services to Warren on a contract basis, \u201cworking through\u201d a compensated independent supplier or broker of labor, with Warren to be insulated in at least some degree from injurious consequences of the work arrangement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the Warren-Green contract was to enable Elliott to work at Warren\u2019s Gladewater plant. The insurance requirements, which were imposed \u201cIn furtherance of [Green\u2019s] indemnity,\u201d apply \u201cto operations by Contractor or by any subcontractor or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by either of them,\u201d and they include an undertaking of Green to supply workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. The indemnity paragraph refers to \u201cactivities of Contractor [Green].\u201d Its \u201cactivities\u201d as a labor supplier \u2014 and here as an indemnifying supplier in a very particularized factual context \u2014 are not necessarily limited to the physical acts done by it through Elliott.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The basic question for the jury was the meaning of the indemnity agreement. It might have been intended to mean that Green as a supplier of labor and equipment undertook to indemnify against the consequences of Elliott\u2019s being on the Warren premises and working there, without regard to Elliott\u2019s precise legal status \u2014 employee, agent, servant, independent contractor, borrowed servant, or other capacity \u2014 of either Warren or Green or both of them. Consideration of this possibility was foreclosed by the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">There are other possible constructions of the contract. The jury might find that the contract relates only to what Green does <em>qua </em>the physical actions which its servants, agents and employees carry on in performing work for Warren and does not impose on Green a broader responsibility arising from its undertaking as a supplier of labor to interpose itself between Warren and those supplied as workmen. The jury 'might find that the term servants, agents and employees did (or did not) embrace \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d The meaning of the term, \u201cservants, agents and employees,\u201d and of the terms \u201cactivities of Contractor,\u201d and, in the provision for insurance, \u201coperations by Contractor,\u201d must be ascertained in the light of all the factual circumstances surrounding the contract. <em>See generally </em>13 Tex.Jur.2d Contracts \u00a7 126, at 294-98 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\"> On the few fragments of the personal injury suit record we are unable to determine the effect of the judgment therein on either Warren or Green. Warren, as indemnitee, in an action to recover from its indemnitor amounts paid in satisfaction of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>against it, is bound by all findings without which the judgment could not have been rendered. <em>See </em>Alabama Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Millsap, 71 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1934); Annot., 24 A.L.R.2d 329, 330 (1952). Green, as indemnitor with notice and opportunity to defend, may be bound by the judgment, if obtained without fraud or collusion, to the extent of issues necessary to be litigated therein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because these matters are for the district court in the first instance we do not reach Warren\u2019s contention that Green is bound by the stipulation, apparently made by Warren, that Elliott was acting as Green\u2019s \u201cagent.\u201d Likewise we do not pass on Green\u2019s argument that Warren acted in bad faith in making the stipulation and in failing to urge as a defense to Elliott\u2019s suit that Elliott was an employee of Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Warren-Green contract contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">ASSIGNMENT \u2014 Neither the benefits accruing to nor the obligations assumed by Contractor in undertaking to perform any work pursuant to any request therefore made by Owner may be assigned in whole or in part,nor shall Contractor sublet or subcontract any of the work so requested without Owner\u2019s written consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The effect of this clause has not been briefed by either party. We leave this for consideration by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In summary, the indemnity agreement must be construed under principles applicable to an ambiguous contract, and there must be a determination of whether the indemnity provision as construed covers Elliott\u2019s judgment against Warren. Whether issues have been judicially established in Elliott\u2019s suit so as to bind either or both parties to this case is for the district court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. Warren also discussed with this contractor an arrangement for one of the terminated employees to \u201cwork through\u201d him. Whether the person discussed was Elliott or another terminated employee is unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">. This amount would give Elliott a welder\u2019s normal hourly wages plus pay for his equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2A\">\n<p id=\"b308-13\">. Green billed Warren, and -was paid, for the work being done by Elliott at the time Elliott was injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">.
