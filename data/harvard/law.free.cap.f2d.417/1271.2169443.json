Hawkins and Shelby were jointly tried and convicted. Hawkins appeals from conviction on multiple counts charging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy to commit any offense against the United States), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (aiding and abetting an offense against the United States), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 (forgery of postal money orders). Shelby appeals from conviction of conspiracy and forgery of a money order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of both appellants. Shelby\u2019s testimony contained admissions sufficient to support his conviction. As to Hawkins, there was evidence that he brought together Burks (who had stolen money orders to sell) and Shelby and Key (who were interested in purchasing them). The evidence showed that Key obtained funds to buy the money orders by delivering jewelry to Hawkins, who obtained money for the jewelry and turned it over to Key. There was evidence that when Key was in California on a trip passing money orders he needed new documents to falsely identify him and sought these from Hawkins in Texas. Upon Key\u2019s return to Texas, Hawkins attended a meeting of those engaged in the money order operation and there delivered to Key identification papers bearing the name or names of other persons. At that meeting money order forms were displayed and examined. Also there was evidence that Hawkins received a percentage of the \u201ctake\u201d from passing forged money orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-13\">Government witness Diane Hazelwood, on redirect examination, gave damaging testimony describing how Hawkins had beaten, kicked and pistol-whipped her, inflicting serious injuries, after forcing her, dressed in her nightgown, to his cabin in the woods, where she was required to stay over night. The testimony carried heavy impact, for it tended to show Hawkins to be a brutal and vicious man. But that avails him nothing on this appeal. The incident was opened up by defense counsel who on cross-examination, sought to impeach Hazelwood by showing personal animosity against Hawkins evidenced by her filing a criminal complaint against him. The government, on redirect, elicited the details which gave rise to the complaint, without objection from the defense. The testimony was admissible. Beck v. United States, 317 F.2d 865 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 972, 84 S.Ct. 480, 11 L.Ed.2d 419 (1964). In <em>Beck </em>the judge gave a cautionary instruction. Here none was given, but none was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-14\">Government witness Maxwell testified to a conversation in her presence between Shelby and Key during which Key made known his need for credit cards to serve as means for false identification, and Shelby responded that he had a friend, Hawkins who could supply had a friend, Hawkins, who could supply testimony, Shelby described Hawkins as a \u201cfence.\u201d Objection was sustained to this characterization as hearsay, and the jury was instructed not to consider the testimony as to Hawkins. Motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>mistrial was denied. There is not presented the matter of a codefendant\u2019s confession which- tends to show in a direct way that a fellow defendant is guilty of the offense charged, as in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), but hearsay testimony of a codefendant\u2019s remark which describes his fellow defendant as a \u201cbad man,\u201d which may tend to show guilt but in a much less direct manner. In any event <em>Bruton </em>rests upon the right to confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses. Shelby took the stand and testified at length in a vein largely exculpatory of Hawkins. He was not cross-examined about the remark he was said to have made. <em>Bruton </em>does not apply. James v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 467. Maxwell\u2019s testimony was admissible against Shelby, though somewhat tenuously, going to prove Shelby\u2019s entry into the conspiracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">No reversible error arose from the remarks of the prosecutor in argument. There was evidence that Key had sent $800 to Hawkins. The first prosecutor to argue referred to this as tending to show Hawkins\u2019 guilt. The defense argument was not made a part of the appellate record, but from succeeding remarks we may assume that defense counsel sought to explain the $800 as a repayment of $300 that Hawkins had obtained for Key by selling (or pawning) jewelry that Key had turned over to him. In further argument concerning Hawkins\u2019 guilt, the closing prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ama-dedup-1\">Oh, the Defense Counsel said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know how much it was for those rings.\u201d \u2014 or some such business as that. How much was loaned? What testimony do you have from any source about any lending of any money? Three hundred dollars was mentioned. Three hundred dollars was delivered. Where is there testimony from any other source? There was a man that could have testified to it \u2014 his codefendant here. He took the stand. He could have testified as to what the true bargain was. What did he say about it? Nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">We agree with the trial court that the <em>reference </em>could not be construed as relating to Hawkins. After objection that the remark was a comment on Hawkins\u2019 failure to testify, the court gave the following cautionary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-11\">This is not the Court\u2019s view of what the prosecuting attorney said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-12\">You know \u2014 I\u2019ve explained to you before \u2014 that no inference can be drawn about the failure of the defendant to testify, and no such inference is to be drawn from what this man said \u2014 and this is not an attempt, in the Court\u2019s opinion, to do that. He\u2019s talking about what the Defendant Shelby, who did take the stand, did not say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-13\">So, the objection will be overruled and the motion will be denied, with this instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-14\">Hawkins correctly points out that Shelby was not present at the transaction concerning the jewelry but another person named Lacey was. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s failure to correct this factual error (not pointed out to the judge at the time) does not alter the plain import of the remarks, which, in the context of argument of Hawkins\u2019 guilt, were directed to the lack of explanation by Hawkins\u2019 codefendant who testified. The remark could refer, albeit erroneously, only to Shelby, and not to Hawkins, who could not be his own codefendant and had not taken the stand. Cf. Peeples v. United States, 341 F.2d 60 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 988, 85 S.Ct. 1362, 14 L.Ed.2d 280 (1965); Smith v. United States, 234 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-15\">Other arguments made by the prosecutors referred to the reasons for Shelby\u2019s giving testimony largely exculpatory of Hawkins. The gist of the remarks was that the jury could draw its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>own conclusions as to Shelby\u2019s reasons for admitting the charges against him while seeking to absolve Hawkins. The appellants urge that the remarks are within eases holding it error to charge a defendant with suborning perjury, but we do not reach that issue, because there was no objection and in this instance there was no plain error. Under the evidence the jury was entitled to conclude that Shelby was in fact what was referred to as a \u201cfall guy\u201d for Hawkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">The question to Shelby, \u201cWhy was it that you elected to plead not guilty\u201d was objected to, the jury was instructed not to consider it, and motion for mistrial was denied. It could not have been prejudicial to Shelby because he acknowledged facts which clearly showed his guilt, and, only in the most remote sense could the question attribute any wrong or misconduct on Hawkins\u2019 part. This was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">. The statement was made prior to the beginning of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. Therefore it was not admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule of a statement made during the pend-ency of a conspiracy by one conspirator to be admitted against another.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
