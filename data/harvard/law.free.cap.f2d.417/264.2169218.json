The stevedoring company contended that consolidation, if ordered, should be attended by a jury trial of all factual issues in both cases. The court then ordered consolidation of each pair of cases for trial and directed that all factual issues, other than the issue of counsel fees in the indemnity suits, be tried to a jury. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The disputed question is whether, in the circumstances of these cases, it was proper for the court to require that a jury try the factual issues of an admiralty suit for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Our starting point is the provision of Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution that the judicial power of the national government shall embrace \u201call Cases of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to that Constitutional allocation Congress has vested \u201coriginal jurisdiction * * * of * * * [a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction * * * \u201d in the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The historic fact. is that prior to and since the adoption of the Constitution various principles, rules and procedures have been characteristic of admiralty. Notable among them is the functioning of the admiralty judge as the trier of fact. The Sarah, 1823, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 391, 5 L.Ed. 644; Waring v. Clarke, 1847, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 441, 460, 12 L.Ed. 226; Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 1924, 264 U.S. 375, 391, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748. But the Constitutional vesting of admiralty jurisdiction in the district courts did not require the perpetuation of all historically characteristic principles, rules and practices of admiralty, any more than the vesting of these same courts with equitable powers precluded the subsequent modification of jurisprudence and practice in equity. Thus, in The Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 1851, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 443, 13 L.Ed. 1058, Chief Justice Taney, commenting upon a provision of the Great Lakes Act, 5 Stat. 726, now 62 Stat. 953, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1873, which specifically provided for jury trial in admiralty suits arising on the Great Lakes, observed that \u201c[i]n admiralty and marine cases * * * Congress may * * * give either party right of trial by jury * * at 460.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And much more recently the Supreme Court has reminded us that neither the Constitution nor \u201cany statute of Congress or Rule of Procedure, Civil or Admiralty, forbid [s], jury trials in maritime cases.\u201d Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 1963, 374 U.S. 16, 20, 83 S.Ct. 1646, 1650, <em>10 </em>L.Ed.2d 720. Significantly, the Court added \u201cCongress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in actual decision the <em>Fitzgerald </em>case does no more than to sanction a consolidated jury trial for an admiralty claim for maintenance and cure and a Jones Act claim for damages, both arising from the same injury and asserted by the same plaintiff against the same defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>For present purposes, the <em>Fitzgerald </em>case is important because of its implication that, if the circumstances justify such action, a district court exercising section 1333 jurisdiction over a maritime claim may require that the issues of fact be tried to a jury. <em>Accord, </em>Haskins v. Point Towing Co., 3d Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 737. In this connection it is noteworthy that the dissenting opinion in the <em>Fitzgerald </em>case contended that any change in the mode of trial in admiralty should be effectuated by amending the Rules rather than by decision in a case. Thus, it appears that the interrelation of rule making and decisional law in this context was considered by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">This aspect of the <em>Fitzgerald </em>case is relevant to our present problem because of the arguable impact of applicable Rules in both cases. <em>Fitzgerald </em>was decided at a time when Admiralty Rule 46% provided that \u201c[i]n deciding cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction the court of first instance shall find the facts specially . . ..\u201d Despite this mandate that the admiralty court should be the fact finder and despite the dissenting contention that this procedural matter should be determined by general rule rather than particular decision, the Court found it proper in the circumstances of <em>Fitzgerald </em>to order a jury trial of an admiralty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The present case was decided in the district court after July 1, 1966, the date upon which the admiralty Rules were superseded by the general civil Rules with a few provisions added to cover situations in which special procedure was deemed necessary in admiralty. Rule 46% was not preserved. Instead, the general provisions of Rules 38 and 39, F.R.C.P., concerning jury trials now regulate the trial of factual issues in admiralty as well as factual issues in law and in equity. These rules divide cases into two categories, those in which parties have a right to a jury trial and those in which there is not such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We read these rules as a formula for the assertion and preservation of the right to jury trial. However, they neither create nor preserve any right to a non-jury trial. This does not mean that in the ordinary situation in which there is no right to a jury trial, the trial judge may, within his discretion, reject the traditional mode of fact finding and order a jury trial. For- if so great a change in procedure had been intended, we think the rules would have explicitly conferred such discretion upon the trial judge. However, in the narrow circumstances of a consolidated trial, the trial judge, under Rule 42(a), is given the broad authority to \u201cmake such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.\u201d Thus the order presently contested may reasonably be viewed as within the trial judge\u2019s discretion under Rule 42(a), and not contrary to anything contained in Rules 38 and 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">These observations and the overriding of Admiralty Rule 46y2 in - <em>Fitzgerald </em>lead us to conclude that in special situations of trial consolidation of closely related actions or claims, one attended by a right to jury trial and the other not, a court may, in the interest of the efficient and expeditious administration of justice, require that both be submitted to a jury for decision upon disputed factual issues. <em>Accord </em>Kennedy v. Lakso Co., Inc., 3d Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">This problem is inherent in the exercise of the judicial power of consolidation of actions. Often, as in the present case, it appears that the consolidation of an action at law and an admiralty suit will save trial time and make for consistency and efficiency in the disposition of closely related disputes arising out of the same transaction or mishap. Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., 3d Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 673; and see the persuasive reasoning of the district court on this point in Close v. Calmar Steamship Corp., E.D.Pa.1968, 44 F.R.D. 398, 401-402, which controlled the decision below. Yet, only by the decision of common issues of fact by a single trier of fact can the potential benefits of such consolidation be realized fully. Moreover, jury trial is a matter of right in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>action for damages while only historic practice and the failure of the Rules to make affirmative provision for this situation inhibit the ordering of a jury trial of the admiralty suit. In these circumstances, we think it is reasonable and proper, and a logical extension of the <em>Fitzgerald </em>case, to recognize the exercise of judicial power to order a consolidated jury trial of both proceedings as a proper means of fully effectuating the justifying purposes of Rule 42(a) consolidation. See Close v. Calmar Steamship Corp., <em>supra, </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">. While these provisions undoubtedly were predicated upon knowledge that law and practice as developed in admiralty exhibited distinctive characteristics, nothing was said about their retention or alteration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. <em>Cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 772, now superseded by Rule 39(c), F.R.C.P., authorizing but not requiring district courts \u201csitting in equity for the trial of patent causes\u201d to impanel a jury for the trial of issues of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\">.
