From our examination of the record, we conclude that there was no basis in fact to classify defendant I-A and to deny him conscientious objector status. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The factual background of the case, as revealed by defendant\u2019s selective service file, is briefly as follows: In May, 1965, at age 18, defendant completed his initial classification questionnaire (SSS Form 100) in which he stated that he was pursuing a course of instruction at the Kingdom Hall, Greenville, North Carolina, under the direction of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness denomination in preparation for the ministry. At the same time defendant indicated, by signing in the appropriate place, that he was a conscientious objector and requested a special conscientious objector form. Because he had not at that time completed high school, he was classified I-S(H). In September, 1965, defendant enrolled in an agricultural business course and was thereafter classified II-S.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In October, 1966, the local board mailed to defendant a copy of the conscientious objector form (SSS Form 150). Therein he responded positively that he believed in a Supreme Being. He indicated that he was opposed to participation in war in any form and requested exemption from both combatant and noncombatant service. Defendant stated as the basis of his claim that \u201cI don\u2019t believe in killing or aiding anyone else in killing. The Bible says thou shall not kill.\u201d Defendant further stated that he relied upon his father, who was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, for spiritual guidance, and that \u201cI acquired my belief from my father\u2019s teachings and from the meetings I attended in Jehovah Witness\u2019s homes and from meetings at the Kingdom Hall in the past three or four years.\u201d In answer to the question of under what circumstances, if any, he would sanction the use of force, he replied that he would do so strictly in self-defense, i. e., \u201c[i]f someone attacked me and was going to kill me. Then I still wouldn\u2019t if there was any way to prevent it.\u201d Defendant further stated, \u201cI never like to kill anything or see anyone else kill.\u201d In answer to the query whether he had ever given public expression to his religious views, he answered: \u201cYes. When I was working in Long Manufacturing Company in Tar-boro. At Pitt Technical Institute this year.\u201d Defendant included the names of his father and a friend as individuals who could attest to the sincerity of his views.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The selective service file indicates that in March, 1967, defendant \u201cdropped from full time [educational] program,\u201d whether voluntarily or not is unclear. He was forthwith reclassified I-A. He was subsequently ordered to report for induction on September 6. On that date he refused to be inducted because of his religious beliefs. On September 7, defendant\u2019s file was forwarded to the State Director of Selective Service. A few days later it was returned to the local board with the instruction that it be reopened \u201cfor the purpose of classification.\u201d There is no indication that additional evidence was considered by the local board, which again classified defendant I-A. After a second review, the State Director advised the local board that they should enter defendant\u2019s name on the record of delinquents and that he should be allowed to have a personal appearance within 30 days, if requested. Defendant did request a personal appearance, the local board\u2019s memorandum of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">\u201cRegistrant appeared before the Board for his personal appearance and gave the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aas-dedup-0\">Registrant was asked if he had any new or written information to present to the Board and he said no. He stated that he just does not believe in going into the service at all \u2014 that he does not believe in killing anyone. Registrant was asked by the Board as to whether he is now a member of a religious sect or organization and he stated that he is not. He stated that he attends the Jehoviah\u2019s [sic] Witness and believes in that religion but has not become a member. He stated that there is more to becoming a member than just joining. Registrant stated that he is now working at Carolina Office Equipment Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>is going to night school at Pitt Technical Institute taking Architectural Drafting on Mon. Tue. and Thur. nights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">Registrant had very little to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Two days later defendant was notified that his classification would not be changed. Thereafter, his file was forwarded to the appeal board, which, some three months later, classified him I-A. Defendant\u2019s second order to report for induction proved to be abortive when the local board neglected to process certain forms, but finally, on June 4, 1968, defendant again refused to be inducted, citing his religious beliefs. Trial, conviction, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In determining whether there was a basis in fact for defendant\u2019s classification, we consider at the outset an issue tangentially touched upon by the parties, namely, whether defendant actually submitted sufficient information to his local board to constitute a prima facie case for conscientious objector status, or whether, on the other hand, his claim is frivolous on its face. <em>Cf. </em>Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973, 976 (9 Cir.1967); Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339, 343 n. 13 (9 Cir.1956). We acknowledge in this connection that defendant\u2019s religious views are not set forth at length or articulately. Yet it is perfectly clear that defendant\u2019s timely assertions to his local board, if believed, demonstrate that he was brought up in, and had embraced, the religious tradition of one of his parents, who belonged to a denomination, the members of which have consistently opposed participation in war. Defendant asserted his personal objections, in light of this tradition, to participation in war in any form. He thus presented a prima facie case for exemption. United States v. Bortlik, 122 F.Supp. 225, 227 (E.D.Pa. 1954); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246, 249 &amp; n. 3 (7 Cir.1967). See also, Parr v. United States, 272 F.2d 416, 419 (9 Cir.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">Ever mindful that the conscientious objector exemption has traditionally been considered a matter of legislative grace<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that registrants must carry the burden of demonstrating that they are entitled to that classification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we believe, nevertheless, that not only the articulate may qualify as conscientious objectors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Entitlement to that status is not limited to those registrants who have read United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), and its progeny, and can express their views with them as models, or to\u2019 those registrants who have counsel familiar with selective service law available to assist them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Finally, we deem significant the absence of any indication that the local board considered that defendant\u2019s file contained deficiencies which could be corrected by the submission of further evidence. <em>Cf., </em>United States v. St. Clair, 293 F.Supp. 337, 341 (E.D.N.Y.1968). See also, United States v. Purvis, 403 F.2d 555, 560-562 (2 Cir.1968); De-Remer v. United States, 340 F.2d 712, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>718 (8 Cir.1965). Indeed, there is no indication that the local board even contacted those references which defendant had given in order that his sincerity could be verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We consider then the critical question of whether the record reveals a basis in fact for the refusal to accord defendant conscientious objector status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After thorough examination of the record, we are able to discern no such basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The starting point for analysis of a conscientious objector case remains Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955), in which the Supreme Court concisely stated the interrelation between objective and subjective factors to be taken into account in evaluating conscientious objector claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-8\">\u201c[In conscientious objector cases] the registrant cannot make out a prima facie case from objective facts alone, because <em>the ultimate question in conscientious objector cases is the sincerity of the registrant in objecting, on religious grounds, to participation in war in any form. </em>In these cases, objective facts are relevant only insofar as they help in determining the sincerity of the registrant in his claimed belief, purely a subjective question. In conscientious objector cases, therefore, any fact which casts doubt on the veracity of the registrant is relevant. It is \u2018affirmative evidence * * * that a registrant has not painted a complete or accurate picture * * *\u2019 Dickinson v. United States, supra (346 U.S. 389, p. 396, 74 S.Ct. 152, at p: 157, 98 L.Ed. 132). In short, the nature of a registrant\u2019s prima facie case determines the type of evidence needed to rebut his claim. <em>* * * If, as here, the issue is the registrant\u2019s sincerity and good faith belief, then there must be some inference of insincerity or bad faith.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\"><em>Since Witmer stated his beliefs with apparent sincerity, and since we find no indication anywhere in the record that his demeanor appeared shifty or evasive or that his appearance was one of unreliability, </em>we must examine the objective facts before the Appeal Board to see whether they cast doubt on the sincerity of his claim.\u201d 348 U.S., at 381-382, 75 S.Ct. at 396. (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">To begin in inverse order with the objective facts as revealed by the record in the instant case, counsel for the government candidly conceded on oral argument that the record reveals no basis upon which the local board could have denied conscientious objector status. We fully agree. This is <em>not </em>a case in which religious scruples were first revealed when a registrant\u2019s induction became imminent, or even after notice to report for induction had been received. See, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Stafford, 389 F.2d 215 (2 Cir.1968); United States v. Gearey [1], 368 F.2d 144 (2 Cir.1966); United States v. Gearey [2], 379 F.2d 915 (2 Cir.1967). In the instant case defendant asserted his religious beliefs at the time of his initial contact with his draft board at age 18, and he has demonstrated a history of adherence to those views for several years prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">It is unnecessary that one formally belong to an organized religion or denomination in order to qualify for conscientious objector status. United States v. Hein, 112 F.Supp. 71, 75 (N. D.Ill.1953); United States v. Alvies, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>F.Supp. 618 (N.D.Cal.1953). See, United States v. Seeger, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Corliss, 280 F.2d 808, 813 (2 Cir.1960); Williams v. United States, 216 F.2d 350 (5 Cir.1954). Indeed, in the instant case, we believe that defendant\u2019s candid statements both to his local board and at the trial that he was not formally a member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness sect and that \u201cthere is more to becoming a member than just joining\u201d is an indication of his sincerity, rather than the contrary. In this connection, we note the view of Judge Solomon expressed in a similar case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s claim was rejected because he had not been baptized as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. I do not think this provides a basis in fact for the local board\u2019s action. At the trial, defendant explained that one cannot be baptized until he satisfies himself that he is \u2018strong enough.\u2019 Until baptism, he. is not a true member of the faith. Although defendant studied the Bible and Watchtower Tracts at home, and attended religious meetings, he had not yet convinced himself that he could be baptized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">The time of baptism (and hence membership) is left entirely to the individual. If defendant was not sincere he could have been baptized and would thus have been able to claim membership in his Form 150. Instead, not convinced that he was ready defendant continued to attend religious meetings and study the Bible and Watchtower Tracts at home. It would have been difficult to find evidence more persuasive of defendant\u2019s strict allegience [sic] to the requirements of his religion. The local board cannot rely on defendant\u2019s lack of baptism without some evidence that it should interpret his decision to detract from, rather than add to, the strength of his claim. The file contains no such evidence. * * * \u201d United States v. Harris, 302 F.Supp. 1194 (D.Ore.1968). See also, United States v. Corliss, <em>supra, </em>280 F.2d at 813.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_bR\">Finally, it has long been held that defendant\u2019s belief as to the use of force in self-defense is not \u201cso inconsistent with his claim of conscientious objection as to serve as a basis for a denial of his claim.\u201d Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 389, 75 S.Ct. 403, 405, 99 L.Ed. 436 (1955); United States v. Carroll, 398 F.2d 651, 655 (3 Cir.1968); Annett v. United States, 205 F.2d 689, 691 (10 Cir.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">We come finally to the subjective aspect of defendant\u2019s claim and to the government\u2019s contention that the only inference which remains is that the local board simply did not believe defendant\u2019s protestations of conscience. We do not doubt the general proposition that, in an appropriate case, a local board, on the basis of demeanor evidence, may make a determination that a particular registrant is not sincere in his beliefs. Campbell v. United States, 221 F.2d 454, 457 (4 Cir.1955). But see, United States v. St. Clair, <em>supra, </em>293 F.Supp. at 344-345, where the court reluctantly assumed arguendo the correctness of this rule. However, it has been held that if the local board wishes to rely upon the registrant\u2019s lack of veracity, \u201cthe record must contain some statement of this disbelief if the classification is to be upheld upon judicial review.\u201d United States v. Washington, 392 F.2d 37, 39 (6 Cir.1968). United States v. Lonseth, 300 F.Supp. 857 (D.Ore.1969). See, United States v. Witmer, <em>supra, </em>United States v. St. Clair, <em>supra, </em>293 F.Supp. at 345. We are persuaded that the <em>Washington </em>case correctly states the law. Particularly in an area such as this where \u201c[w]e are dealing * * * with a question of personal liberty,\u201d Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 121-122, 66 S.Ct. 423, 427, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946), we would be reluctant to sanction a decision of a local board when, from the record, we can only speculate that there <em>may </em>have been a basis in fact for the decision. The negative finding upon which our dissenting colleague rests so heavily may just as well be founded upon pure arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>trariness, a misconstruction of law, for example, the necessary elements of a prima facie case, or a determination of credibility. Where the local board\u2019s conclusion may be explainable upon alternate grounds, both legally acceptable and unacceptable, the risk is too great that we would place an imprimatur upon an insupportable basis of decision if we were to accept the government\u2019s contention. See, Sicurella v. United States, <em>supra, </em>348 U.S. at 392, 75 S.Ct. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We are constrained to add that it is <em>not </em>sufficient that the board merely state its disbelief in a registrant\u2019s sincerity, for \u201cto sustain the denial of a claim on a mere <em>ipse dixit </em>of lack of sincerity from the Local Board or the hearing officer would create serious possibilities of abuse.\u201d United States v. Corliss, <em>supra, </em>280 F.2d at 814. In short, there must be a \u201crational basis\u201d for the refusal of the Board to accept the validity of a registrant\u2019s religious claims. Roberson v. United States, 208 F.2d 166, 169 (10 Cir.1953). As recently stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">\u201cTo be precise about it, the disbelief of Selective Service officials will not justify the rejection of a claim for conscientious objector status unless there is some affirmative evidence to support the rejection of the claimed exemption or there is something in the record which <em>substantially </em>(emphasis added [by the Fifth Circuit]) blurs the picture painted by the registrant and thus casts doubt on his sincerity. Batterton v. United States, 8 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 233.\u201d Kessler v. United States, 406 F.2d 151, 156 (5 Cir.1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">To the same effect, see, <em>e.g., </em>United States v. Washington, <em>supra; </em>Fleming v. United States, <em>supra, </em>344 F.2d at 915; Parr v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Batterton v. United States, <em>supra, </em>260 F.2d at 236-237; Riles v. United States, 223 F.2d 786, 792-793 (5 Cir.1955); Williams v. United States, 216 F.2d 350 (5 Cir. 1954); Pine v. United States, 212 F.2d 93 (4 Cir.1954); Annett v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Roberson v. United States, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Gabris, 302 F.Supp. 235 (E.D.N.Y.1968); United States v. Warner, 284 F.Supp. 366, 369-370 (D.Ariz.1968); United States v. St. Clair, <em>supra, </em>293 F.Supp. at 344-345.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Because the record in the instant case thus discloses <em>no basis whatever, </em>objective or otherwise, for doubting defendant\u2019s sincerity in his adherence to his religious views against participation in war in any form, the judgment of conviction will be reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Reversed with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-13\">. We note in passing that this case is similar to Kessler v. United States, 406 F.2d 151, 152 (5 Cir. 1969), in which the court of appeals commented that \u201c[although the record shows without dispute that Kessler was highly religious and had been previously convicted of no offense other than failing to yield the right of way, he was sentenced to the maximum, five years imprisonment.\u201d See also, United States v. Fallon, 407 F.2d 621, 624 (7 Cir. 1969), <em>cert. den., </em>395 U.S. 908, 89 S.Ct. 1749, 23 L.Ed.2d 220 (May 19, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">We intimate no criticism of the district judge in this regard, nor do we propose to interfere with the traditional sentencing discretion of the district courts. We do, however, express the view that, because Congress has, in this area, granted to the district courts broad sentencing discretion in order that punishment may be tailored to the circumstances of individual defendants, it is to -be expected that, in the normal course of events, punishment other than the maximum permissible would be imposed, as circumstances may warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">.

Baker, 1 SSLR 3017, 3018 (E.D.N.Y.1968): \u201cIn determining whether a prima facie case had been made out (for conscientious objector status), the Court, in accordance with generally applicable legal practice, must construe the facts in a way most favorable to the registrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b893-17\">. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Seeger, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. at 184, 85 S.Ct. at 863: \u201cIt must be remembered that in resolving these exemption problems one deals with the beliefs of different individuals who will articulate them in a multitude of ways. In such an intensely personal area, of course, the claim of the registrant that his belief is an essential part of a religious faith must be given great weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">. Defendant argues that the district judge failed to make an independent determination of whether there was a basis in fact for his classification. A reading of the colloquy between the court and counsel at the trial indicates that this matter is in some doubt. It is clear, however, that if the district judge did believe that there was a basis in fact for the classification he at no point intimated what he thought that basis was. In any event, it is fully established that we may make our-own independent examination of the record to ascertain the existence of a basis in fact for the classification. Cox v. United States, 332. U.S. 442, 452, 68 S.Ct. 115, 92 L.Ed. 59 (1947); Tamblyn v. United States, 216 F.2d 345, 347 (5 Cir. 1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. What we hold in the instant case is not inconsistent with the holding in Salamy v. United States, 379 F.2d 838 (10 Cir. 1967). There the court merely held that there was a basis for doubting the registrant\u2019s sincerity when he first applied for conscientious objector status when induction became imminent and after applications for other exemptions had been rejected. Such is not our case. So, also, the decisions in Campbell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and Gaston v. United States, 222 F.2d 818 (4 Cir. 1955) (per curiam), are distinguishable on their facts, for, in each, the court determined that there was a basis in fact for rejection of the exemption, <em>e. g., </em>the imminence of in-Auction before application was first made for conscientious objector status.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">We have no occasion in the instant case to determine if the broad language employed in <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Gaston, </em>as well as United States v. Helm, 386 F.2d 434 (4 Cir. 1967); and United States v. Al-Majied Muhammed, 364 F.2d 223 (4 Cir. 1966), should be refined in the light of United States v. Gearey, <em>supra, </em>to draw a distinction between a registrant whose views about conscientious objection ripened before receiving a notice to report for induction but who failed to assert them, although reasonably he had the opportunity to do so before receipt of the notice, and one whose views did not ripen until after the notice issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b896-11\">ALBERT V. BRYAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aznc\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">In my judgment there was adequate basis for the decision of the Local Board. It was that the registrant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>not proved his claim for classification as a conscientious objector. Concededly, it was his burden; he simply did not carry it.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">There was, too, an altogether adequate finding of this deficiency; it is the plain and fair implication of the Board\u2019s conclusion. A determination arising from absence of proof is as much a finding of fact as a positive one declaring the existence of proof. Here a negative finding was the \u201cbasis in fact for the refusal to accord defendant conscientious objector status\u201d, to quote the court\u2019s clear putting of the issue. I cannot understand how, then, it can be said there is no finding to support the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">That the Board could well have acted on a disbelief of the registrant is acknowledged by the majority. Nevertheless it overrules the Board because it did not put into the record a prim declaration of doubt. A more emphatic pronouncement and demonstration of unbelief than the refusal of the registrant\u2019s request is hardly conceivable, for his claim rested on his oath. The Board\u2019s rejection of his assertion utterly discredited the claimant\u2019s testimony. Surely, so obvious a meaning of Board action does not have to be spelled out to be recognized. Words saying formalistically that the Board doubted the registrant would have been a superfluity. To rely on the omission is to subordinate substance to style to overthrow the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">No matter how positive or unequivocal the evidence of a witness reads in print, the severest analysis for assaying his truthfulness is in observing him \u2014 -his manner of speaking, his attitude, one of frankness or evasion, responsiveness or reluctance, his grasp of the inquiries, and an understanding to distinguish between patriotic and conscience obligations. The cold transcript on which we appraise him is not so faithful in reflection of reality as the picture the witness exhibits in himself to the Board. Nothing conveys sincerity or exposes insincerity like the personal appearance. I do not feel capable of a better judgment second-hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">It is suggested that because the Board <em>could </em>have founded its decision on arbitrariness, misconstruction of law or some other ground than disbelief, it should be required to state the reasons for its determination. Any and all of these elements, if we are to indulge in speculation, could be just as readily hidden in a formal statement of distrust of the registrant. Indeed, they <em>could </em>be in any conclusion of the Board, but surely it does not have to disavow explicitly the entry into its judgment of each of these or other unacceptable factors. But suppose it did make such disclaimers, could not these protestations be subject to the same speculation? Refusal of credence to the registrant\u2019s testimony is so squarely demonstrated here that I see no reason to engage in hypotheses to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">The majority opinion puts the burden upon the Bo\u00e1rd to acquit itself of these unfair possibilities. Certainly, a presumption of fair dealing is accorded by law to the Board members. Congress has reposed in them the power and responsibility of decision of the facts \u2014 as neighbors or lay citizens \u2014 and so expressed faith that they would not vote capriciously in this resolution. Confidence of this kind is not uncommon in our governmental system. Comparably, when credibility of a defendant is the sole determinant in a criminal case, and determinable alone from <em>observation </em>of him on the witness stand, the jury or the judge may find guilt without appending the reasons for rejecting his testimony. I would extend this confidence to the Board until it is overridden by proof. None is proffered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">I did not understand counsel for the United States to concede there was no basis for the Board\u2019s denial of exemption. True, in response to questions from the bench as to the existence in the record of evidence upholding the Board, he answered there was none. He meant there was no affirmative proof denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the claim or refuting it. Absence of proof was the determinant, and so counsel\u2019s answer did not acknowledge infirmity in the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">I would affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
