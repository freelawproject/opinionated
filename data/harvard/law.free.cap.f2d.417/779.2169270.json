See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 409 F.2d 804 (Part I) (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">Appellant was engaged in loading a cargo of filled drums. While lifting a drum, or standing it on end, he slipped and suffered a sacroiliac sprain. The sole basis of appellant\u2019s claim is that there was oil on the deck which caused or contributed to his slipping. The burden of proving unseaworthiness or negligence was upon appellant. McQuis-ton v. Freighters &amp; Tankers Steamship Co., 327 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1964). He failed to discharge that burden. Appellant urges that the shipowner\u2019s witnesses had no personal knowledge, or insufficient knowledge, of whether oil was on the deck. But the trial judge was not willing to accept as credible the testimony of appellant and his one supporting witness, which meant that appellant failed to put before the court the proof required of him. Credibility choices are for the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-20\">The decision of the District Court must be, and it is, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-17\">. The District Court also found for the shipowner on its cross-claim against the stevedoring company for breach of workmanlike performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
