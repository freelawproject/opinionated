Dupoint contends that the District Court erred in not granting his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">This is the second appeal in this case. The first conviction was reversed and remanded. Since the essential facts were discussed in our prior opinion, 388 F.2d 39, there is no necessity for repetition here. The facts pointed unerringly to the guilt of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-19\">The judgment of conviction is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
