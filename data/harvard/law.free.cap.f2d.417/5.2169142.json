State of Georgia, 417 F.2d 1, decided today by this court are consolidated appeals from the remand to the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, of two removal petitions filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, pursuant to Section 1443(1), Title 28, United States Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petitioners-Appellants Mardon R. Walker and James R. Forman in this case were charged with riot, malicious mischief and other offenses against public order. On January 25, 1964, several Negro and white citizens (not including Appellants who at all times were on the outside) unsuccessfully sought service and accommodations at Leb\u2019s Restaurant which is a covered establishment under Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Approximately twenty-two months later, on or about November 25, 1965, a Fulton County Superior Court judge on his own initiative ordered the Solicitor General of Fulton County to prepare an indictment against the petitioners, charging them with violating Georgia\u2019s malicious mischief, riot and other offenses against public order statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The grand jury indicted both Miss Walker and Forman, then Executive Secretary of SNCC, on the judicially prescribed charges for their \u201calleged\u201d role in an attempt to obtain routine service at Leb\u2019s Restaurant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ' Up to this time (some 22 months) the sit-in attempt at Leb\u2019s had led to no charges against <em>anyone </em>even for trespass. It has still led to no charges against any of the persons who gained an entrance to the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">Miss Walker and Mr. Forman alleged in their petition for removal that the statutes under which they are charged as applied and used against them infringe upon and deprive them of their <em>equal rights </em>and access to places of public accommodations in violation of the specific grants of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that they are denied and/or cannot enforce in the courts of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of Georgia rights under the laws of the United States providing for the equal rights of citizens as guaranteed under Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The defendants removed the case to the United States Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which upon motion of the State of Georgia remanded it to the state court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Once again, this court is called upon to determine whether another case falls within the permissible scope of removal under the principles announced by the Supreme Court in State of Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966) and City of Greenwood, Mississippi v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944. While we agree that the permissible scope for removal is narrow and limited, we have held that the right of removal of a state criminal prosecution has not been restricted by the Supreme Court to the small group of eases in which a state prosecution for <em>trespass </em>seeks to forbid the enjoyment of the right to equal accommodation guaranteed under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See Whatley v. City of Vidalia, 5 Cir., 399 F.2d 521, 527 (1968) (exercise of the voting rights granted by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1973i(b); Wyche v. State of Louisiana, 5 Cir., 394 F.2d 927 (1967) (charge of aggravated burglary), and Achtenberg v. State of Mississippi, 5 Cir., 393 F.2d 468 (1968) (charge of vagrancy). Our most recent pronouncement in this regard is Walker <em>(not </em>Mardon Walker) v. State of Georgia, 5 Cir., 1969, 405 F.2d 1191, in which the state had charged Walker with \u201cassault.\u201d Reversing an order remanding the case to the state courts, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cThe requirement of Rachel is that the District Court is to conduct a hearing to determine whether appellant was being prosecuted solely for his peaceful and nonforcible attempt to gain service. If his allegations in this regard are found to be true, then it would follow that his conduct is immunized from prosecution by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000a-2 (c). In that event the removals would be sustained, and the prosecutions dismissed. See also Achtenberg v. State of Mississippi, 5 Cir., 1968, 393 F.2d 468, 475; Wyche v. Louisiana, 5 Cir., 1967, 394 F.2d 927. We reiterate what we said in Wyche, i. e., that it is not the state charge which controls; rather, what appellant was actually doing with respect to the exercise of his federally protected rights.\u201d 405 F.2d 1191, 1192.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> It has always been the position of the court that unless the Supreme Court expressly limits its opinion to the facts before it, it is the principle which controls and not the specific facts upon which the principle was decided. Here the controlling principle is that the court will not allow <em>any </em>state statute to be used to deny any citizen the peaceful exercise of rights guaranteed to him by Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The test of removability is comparable to the test for the existence of federal jurisdiction \u2014 the well pleaded petition of the petitioner. This test of removability is governed, in the first instance, by the content of the petition and not the characterization given the conduct in question by the prosecution. State of North Carolina v. Hawkins, 4 Cir., 365 F.2d 599. The issue then to be decided in a hearing for remand is what the movant was actually doing with respect to the exercise of his right granted in terms of equality by some federal statute. Georgia v. Rachel, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The trial court concluded that even if the charges were groundless or if the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion of guilt of the crimes charged that the state court is the only court of competent jurisdiction to make the initial determination and that accordingly the merits of the charges should not be decided by the federal court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Supreme Court in Georgia v. Rachel, <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 807, 86 S.Ct. at 1800 held to the contrary. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">\u201c * * * [0]ne of the functions of the hearing on the allegation of the removal petition will be to <em>determine </em>whether the defendants were rejected on racial grounds or for some other, <em>valid, </em>reason. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">This court has also in a recent case made this explicit. In Walker v. State of Georgia, this court in a remand case in which the movant had been charged with assault said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201cIt appears that the issue for the District Court is whether appellant engaged in non-peaceable conduct, i. e., simple assault, when or after he was refused service but this issue is to be resolved in the federal forum in the first instance and in the context of his federal statutory right to obtain service and not to be prosecuted for his effort. This means that the court will not reach the question of the state\u2019s good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">It is the primary purpose of \u00a7 1443(1) to remove from state courts groundless charges not supported by sufficient evidence when these charges are based on race and deny one his federally protected equal rights as guaranteed by Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. We find nothing either explicit or implicit in the language of the Supreme Court in Peacock, <em>supra, </em>to support a contrary interpretation when it stated, \u201cThe civil rights removal statute does not require and does not permit the judges of the district courts to put their brethren of the state judiciary on trial,\u201d for it is the credible and supported evidence as it relates to the applicable law which we are considering, not the character, competency or prejudices of our state brethren.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">We, therefore, turn our attention to the evidence presented in the trial court. The trial court did not make any factual determination as to whether <em>any </em>of the persons inside the restaurant did commit any of the illegal acts charged in the indictments. While there is some evidence that one or two identifiable persons did so, the principal witnesses for the <em>state </em>cast the strongest doubt on the subject. In this discussion of the evidence of what other persons not indicted did, it must be borne in mind that at <em>no </em>time was either Mar don Walker or James Forman inside the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">One of the state\u2019s key witnesses, Mr. Kenotes, the manager, testified on several occasions that the demonstrators generally were quiet and obedient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">When his testimony is taken as a whole, there is but one conclusion \u2014 the demonstrators came to Leb\u2019s immediately letting it be known that they desired service and that their general conduct was non-violent. The general peaceful conduct of the demonstrators is also supported by the testimony of Police Captain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Mozley and the attorney for Leb\u2019s, Mr. Cowan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Of course, we agree that neither the 1964 Civil Rights Act nor the companion removal statute authorize nor can be utilized as a license to \u201cunfettered vandalism or criminal activity,\u201d as stated by the trial court. The facts as presented here to us do not indicate that the demonstrators as a group, were involved in any \u201cunfettered vandalism or criminal activity.\u201d Demonstrators are clearly responsible for any intentional destruction of property. Here, there is no evidence to support a finding that even the demonstrators who entered the restaurant intended to destroy property when they entered Leb\u2019s or at anytime thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Even if uncontradicted evidence were to support a finding that there were \u201cindependent acts of vandalism\u201d that finding could not support the charge against these two appellants, that they,- \u2014 \u201cbeing motivated by common intent and purpose to unlawfully disturb and disrupt the operation of Leb\u2019s, did aid, abet, counsel, assist, direct and command the demonstration to wilfully, maliciously, violently, tumultuously and unlawfully enter Leb\u2019s for malicious mischief and other acts against public order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">Under Georgia law, which is the general rule, mere proof of presence is not sufficient to render one an aider or abettor or to authorize a conviction. Gentry v. State, 65 Ga.App. 100, 15 S.E.2d 464 (1941). It must be shown that the accused participated in the criminal design either by word or deed, Brown v. State, 118 Ga.App. 617, 165 S.E.2d 185 (1968), had knowledge of the wrongful purpose of the perpetrator, or that the accused was connected by act or intent with the commission of the <em>crime. </em>Sheppard v. State, 91 Ga.App. 672, 86 S.E.2d 711 (1965). The state did not prove <em>any </em>of these elements. At most, the state only proved that both <em>petitioners </em>\u2014 at <em>all times on the outside of the </em>restaurant\u2014 had the <em>general </em>reputation of aiding demonstrators in the <em>peaceful attempts </em>to obtain routine service at places of public accommodations which had established practices of racial discrimination. Therefore, petitioners at most, would be guilty only to the extent of their knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the \u201ccrime\u201d intended \u2014 obtaining service at a racially segregated restaurant \u2014 such insistence of \u201csitting in\u201d was a \u201ccrime\u201d under the Georgia statute at the time, but became a \u201cright\u201d by the passage of the Civil Rights Act which was made applicable to all pending cases by Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306, 85 S.Ct. 384, 13 L.Ed.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We, therefore, hold that this case falls within the permissible removal scope of \u00a7 1443(1), Title 28 United States Code and that the standards established in both Peacock and Rachel are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Rachel type cases require a full evidentiary hearing on the merits of the allegations within the removal petition to determine whether defendants are being prosecuted solely for peacefully attempting to gain equal access to places of public accommodation. Remand to the district court for such a hearing is the usual procedure when none has been held. Wyche v. Louisiana, <em>supra, </em>or when the hearing held is found to have been inadequate. Walker v. Georgia supra. But where there has been an adequate hearing and the <em>undisputed facts </em>show an utter absence of evidence to support the state charge, the proper cause is for this court to remand to the district court with directions to dismiss the indictments, as the district court itself did with respect to the co-defendants of Miss Walker in the companion Walker case. This court followed this procedure, and remanded with directions to dismiss the state prosecutions in Achtenberg v. Mississippi, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">There is no need to delay the ultimate disposition of the case by remanding it to the district court for the making of findings as to the disputed issues dealing with the conduct of <em>some </em>of the persons inside the restaurant. There is absolutely <em>no </em>evidence to convict <em>these </em>appellants for engaging in such conduct. Therefore, the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. Any of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State Court may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\">. This followed a reversal of the conviction of Miss Walker for \u201ctrespass\u201d by the United States Supreme Court. This case is discussed further in the companion <em>Walker </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">. This indictment against Miss Walker and Mr. Forman was more specifically stated as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201c * * * did wilfully, maliciously, violently, tumultuously, and unlawfully, together with other persons, who are to the Grand Jurors unknown, numbering in excess of fifteen persons, said accused and said other unknown persons being motivated by the eom-mon intent and purpose to unlawfully disturb and disrupt the operation of the restaurant business carried on in said county at said time by Lebs Incorporated, doing business under the name of Leb\u2019s and located on the corner of Luckie Street and Forsyth Street in the city of Atlanta, enter and invade the premises of said Lebco, Incorporated, at said place, in a violent and tumultuous manner, and while therein, did unlawfully smash and break the legs of booths, and urinate in pots, glasses, utensils and equipment in said restaurants; that the said WALKER and the said FORMAN, <em>beiii(j present on, the outside of said premises </em>and restaurant at said time and place, did aid, abet, counsel, assist, direct, and command said unknown persons to commit the aforesaid acts of entering said premises in said violent and tumultuous manner, smashing and breaking the logs of said booths, and urinating in said pots, glasses, utensils and equipment therein; thereby injuring and destroying the property of said Lebco, Incorporated (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">.
