We have jurisdiction. Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 24, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Prior to 1959, some 267 residents of Hawaii, looking for profit in North Dakota oil, separately entered into contracts with Petroleum Corporation of America (PCA), a Colorado corporation then doing business in North Dakota, whereby PCA agreed to assign to each Investor a percentage interest in specific oil and gas leases on North Dakota property. The Hawaiians invested in excess of 1.6 million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-19\">PCA was adjudicated bankrupt on January 3, 1959. As a result, instead of reaping profits, the Hawaiian Investors sustained a complete loss of their investments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-20\">Each Hawaiian Investor filed a creditor\u2019s claim in the initial bankruptcy proceedings for the amount that he or she had paid PCA pursuant to the contracts. PCA\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy, H. L. Thorndal, denied these claims and asserted counterclaims alleging that each Hawaiian Investor, as a \u201cmining partner\u201d of PCA, was indebted to the trustee for debfs PCA had incurred in the oil drilling operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each Hawaiian Investor denied the allegations and each contested the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-21\">On August 23, 1960, the referee in bankruptcy, the late Charles M. Pollock, denied the creditors\u2019 claims of the Hawaiian Investors. Referee Pollock also ruled that he had jurisdiction to hear the counterclaims. The district court reviewed and approved these rulings. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>1963, the Hawaiian Investors unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the counterclaims or a change of venue to Hawaii. This litigation remained at rest until 1966 when, following liquidation of substantially all of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, the trustee asked Referee Pollock\u2019s successor to schedule a hearing to assess money damages against the Hawaiian Investors as \u201cco-partners of the bankrupt\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">The present referee assumed that Referee Pollock\u2019s 1960 order established that the Hawaiian Investors and PCA were mining partners <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that as such the Hawaiian Investors incurred joint and several liability to all of the creditors in each drilling venture. Thus, the present referee scheduled a hearing for the sole purpose of determining the amount of such liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After hearing evidence which established the amount of expenses and charges that were still unpaid as against different well drilling projects, the present referee, in January of 1968, entered judgment jointly and severally against the Hawaiian Investors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They appeal from the order of the district court which affirmed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Hawaiian Investors in essence here protest that they have never been adjudicated to be mining partners of PCA. They deny any liability to the trustee for the claims he asserts against them. These contentions require a brief review of some of the early bankruptcy records and proceedings affecting these appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">On April 14, 1960, Referee Pollock informed counsel that he would hear one claim as a test case, that of Raymond D. K. Lau which had been selected by counsel for the Hawaiian Investors, to determine the rights of the \u201ccontract holders\u201d. On August 23, 1960, Referee Pollock ruled that Lau possessed an ownership interest rather than a creditor\u2019s claim against the bankrupt. The referee recited as one conclusion of law that Lau and PCA were \u201cmining partners\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">However, Referee Pollock, noting that even if Lau could be deemed a creditor his claim would be subordinate to the rights of general creditors, stated in a contemporaneous memorandum opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-13\">\u201cProm the evidence at hand, it would appear conclusively claimant purchased an interest in physical assets of the bankrupt, separate and distinct from an interest in the company, and further agreed to enter into a joint venture with bankrupt in developing such properties. <em>This could well be called a \u2018mining partnership\u2019, using the vernacular of the trade.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\"><em>But whether or not the claimants be called mining partners, co-adventurers or investors, they are participants in the common enterprise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">In addition, Referee Pollock said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-16\">\u201cIt is the opinion of this Referee, however, that notwithstanding the ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>risdiction of the Referee to determine the issues by the counterclaim and the reply raised, by reason of the fact that the Trustee can in no event recover on his counterclaim against claimant until all of the physical assets of the bankrupt\u2019s estate have been exhausted, <em>it would, be improper and premature at this time to determine the issues thus raised.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">We read Referee Pollock\u2019s conclusion of law that Lau and PCA were mining partners in light of his memorandum opinion and other determinations. See Southern Pacific Land Co. v. United States, 367 F.2d 161, 162, n. 1 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1030, 87 S.Ct. 1478, 18 L.Ed.2d 592 (1967); American Pipe &amp; Steel Corp. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 292 F.2d 640, 642 (9th Cir. 1961); Stone v. Farnell, 239 F.2d 750, 755 (9th Cir. 1957). In so doing, it is readily apparent that Referee Pollock used \u201cmining partnership\u201d as a generally descriptive term to indicate only that Lau possessed some form of ownership interest in the bankrupt\u2019s estate as opposed to a creditor\u2019s claim, not as an adjudication that Lau and others similarly situated actually constituted mining partners of PCA. Referee Pollock\u2019s order and opinion, fairly read, support no other conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Our conclusion in this regard is further supported by later action taken by Referee Pollock. After considering the 1963 motion of the Hawaiian Investors for dismissal for want of prosecution or change of venue, in a memorandum opinion accompanying his order denying relief, Referee Pollock again articulated the limited nature of the 1960 order in leaving unresolved all issues raised by the counterclaims. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201cThe <em>Lau </em>case, chosen by counsel, was to test <em>all </em>the <em>rights </em>of the Hawaiian Investors, * * * <em>As a result of the Lau case, the investors have been determined to be just that, not creditors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-9\">The only matters to be resolved is as to the <em>liability, if any, </em>on the <em>so-called \u2018mining partnership\u2019 </em>they entered into. In each case the contract is one file, as in the <em>Lau </em>case. Interpretation of such written agreements is a matter of law, not fact. No need to go to Honolulu to determine that. As the counterclaims are by the trustee, representing the creditors, and as the investors have no status as creditors, the testimony to be considered, <em>if liability is established, </em>is the amount thereof. All that evidence is in this District, none in Honolulu.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayg-dedup-1\">In the instant proceedings in bankruptcy, the trustee obained a judgment against the Hawaiian Investors as mining partners obligated jointly and severally to the creditors for all unpaid claims for goods, materials or services furnished in the operation of the eight drilling projects. That judgment cannot stand in the absence of an adjudication of the underlying liability issue of whether the Hawaiian Investors and PCA constituted a \u201cmining partnership\u201d. From our review of the prior orders and judgments in bankruptcy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we are satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>fied that such issue has never been litigated nor settled. Our conclusion on this issue alone requires reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We, however, elect not to rest our decision solely on that ground. Even if the Hawaiian Investors were mining partners of PCA and were jointly and severally liable to those creditors who filed claims in bankruptcy against PCA, PCA\u2019s trustee possesses no power<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to assert the rights of those creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">Although the counterclaims might be read as an assertion by the trustee of rights possessed by the bankrupt to seek contribution for payment of drilling expenses from the Hawaiian Investors in proportion to their interests in the oil and gas leases pursuant to contract,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> neither the trustee nor the court of bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ruptcy has so interpreted them. In any contractual claim made by PCA\u2019s trustee for oil drilling expenses, each Hawaiian Investor\u2019s contractual liability would be measured and limited by his ownership interest, usually one or two per cent, in a particular oil and gas lease. The trustee here asserts no such claim to assess damages for contribution on a pro rata basis against each Hawaiian Investor. Rather, he here presses the collective remaining claims of all of PCA\u2019s creditors arising out of the oil drilling programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Generally, the trustee of a bankrupt has no power to press the general claims of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors against third parties. See Barnes v. Schatzkin, 215 App.Div. 10, 212 N.Y.S. 586 (1925), aff\u2019d, 242 N.Y. 555, 152 N.E. 424, cert. denied, 273 U.S. 709, 47 S.Ct. 100, 71 L.Ed. 852 (1926).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Collier summarizes the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">\u201cIn any event, the claims sued upon by the trustee must belong to the bankrupt estate, and a trustee may not sue upon claims not so belonging, even though they were assigned to him by creditors for convenience or other purposes.\u201d 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 47.-05[1], p. 1746 (14th ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">However, mere assertion of the general rule cannot end our inquiry. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the \u201cstrong arm clause\u201d of \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(c), has modified or eroded the rule so as to enable the trustee to assert creditors\u2019 claims in this case. At the time of this bankruptcy, the applicable version of that, clause read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-11\">\u201cThe trustee, as to all property, whether or not coming into possession or control of the court, upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy, shall be deemed vested as of such date with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings, whether or not such a creditor actually exists.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(c) (1952), as amended, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(c) (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">The strong arm clause was designed to assure the trustee the rights of a lien creditor upon property in which the bankrupt has some interest or as to which the bankrupt might be the ostensible owner. See House Report, No. 2320, 82d Congress, 2d Sess. 1952; 4A Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 70.03 [4], pp. 40-41 (14th ed.). The reference to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>\u25a0 actual or hypothetical creditor denotes a creditor of the bankrupt. See Lewis v. Manufacturers National Bank, 364 U.S. 603, 81 S.Ct. 347, 5 L.Ed.2d 323 (1961); 4A Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 70.49, pp. 595-598 (14th ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\"> The creditors\u2019 armor worn by the trustee by virtue of the strong arm clause of \u00a7 70(c) affords no assistance to PCA\u2019s trustee here. Only PCA, one partner of the assumed mining partnership, has been declared bankrupt. Accordingly, the power of an actual or hypothetical creditor of one partner to reach assets in satisfaction of creditors\u2019 claims against that partner necessarily defines the limits of the trustee\u2019s power to assert creditors' claims under \u00a7 70(c). A creditor of a bankrupt partner could obtain a lien or judgment against only that partner\u2019s personal property and his share of the partnership assets, and not against other partners\u2019 personal property or partnership interests. See Kaufman-Brown Potato Co. v. Long, 182 F.2d 594 (9th Cir. 1950); Todd v. Pettit, 108 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1939); Sturm v. Ulrich, 10 F.2d 9 (8th Cir. 1925); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 5.30, p. 741 (14th ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\"> Our analysis that powers of a creditor cast upon the trustee in this ease by virtue of \u00a7 70(c) are limited ones gains strength by examination of the rights of a creditor analogous to those represented by the instant trustee, one who may hold a judgment against a partnership, rather than against an individual partner. Such creditor may levy against partnership property, but not property of an individual partner not personally served in the action. Detrio v. United States, 264 F.2d 658 (5th Cir. 1959); In re Panitz &amp; Co., 270 F.Supp. 448 (D.C.Md.), aff\u2019d sub nom. Hammerman v. Arlington Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 385 F.2d 835 (4th Cir. 1967). See also Grainger v. Antoyan, 308 P.2d 453 (Cal.App.), aff\u2019d, opinion vacated, 48 Cal.2d 805, 313 P.2d 848 (1957), and cases collected in Annot., 100 A.L.E. 997, 999 (1936). The forum state follows a like rule. International Shoe Co. v. Hawkinson, 73 N.D. 677, 18 N.W.2d 761 (1945). Similarly, when only a partnership is declared a bankrupt, a creditor\u2019s claim as filed in that bankruptcy cannot be enforced by the trustee against an individual partner\u2019s assets unless partnership assets are insufficient and the individual partner\u2019s creditors are first paid. See 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 5.19, pp. 721-722; \u00b6 5.25, pp. 730-732 (14th ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">We find no statutory authority in \u00a7 70(c) or elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Act for the trustee to sue third parties on this type of creditor\u2019s claim. It is unnecessary in the fair administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate to extend the reach of the law to permit or require the trustee to undertake collection of the creditor\u2019s purely personal claims against those parties whose basic relation with the bankrupt is that of sharers in a common liability. At least, under the version of the strong arm clause applicable in this case, we do not so extend the grasp of the trustee\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Because there has never been an adjudication of the underlying partnership issue and because the trustee has no power to enforce creditors\u2019 personal claims .against the Hawaiian Investors, we reverse the judgment of the court of bankruptcy and on remand direct that the counterclaims be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-10\">. The agreements for assignment of oil and gas interests were not recorded. After bankruptcy, the referee, in an order dated August 23, 1960, determined that the trustee was vested with title to the oil and gas leases free of all claims of the Hawaiian Investors under \u00a7 70(a) (5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a) (5). The trustee thereafter, administered those leases as the bankrupt\u2019s sole property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b994-13\">.

In another part of his order, Referee Pollock ruled that the Hawaiian Investors lost their unrecorded fractional ownership interests in the oil and gas leases involved. <em>Supra, </em>note 1. That ruling would not have been <em>appropriate </em>if the bankrupt and the Hawaiian Investors constituted a partnership. Under those circumstances, the Hawaiian Investors, as partners of a bankrupt partner, would have had the right to establish and retain their ownership interests in partnership property regardless of the status of record title.

Later cases approving, considering or applying a doctrine limiting the trustee\u2019s right to pursue the creditors\u2019 claims include : Hi-Pro Fish Products, Inc. v. McClure, 346 F.2d 497 (8th Cir. 1965); Palmer v. Travelers Ins. Co., 319 F.2d 296 (5th Cir. 1963); Harris v. Standard Accident &amp; Ins. Co., 297 F.2d 627 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 843, 82 S.Ct. 875, 7 L.Ed.2d 847 (1962); Todd v. Pettit, 108 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1939). Barnes v. Schatzkin, <em>supra, </em>has also been criticized in 39 Harv.L.Rev. 768 (1926), particularly for refusal to recognize the creditors\u2019 assignment of claims to the trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b999-11\">.
