BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b668-25\">This is the second time around for these parties. This <em>in rem </em>libel by Longshoreman-strawboss Manning against the M/V Sea Road, owned by his employer, for <em>Yaka-Jackson</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>recovery was heard and decided in the fall of 1964. After initial affirmance the judgment of the District Court was vacated on rehearing and the cause remanded. Manning v. M/V Sea Road, 5 Cir., 1965, 358 F.2d 615, 1966 A.M.C. 591. With great tenacity the case now comes before us again on the employee\u2019s appeal from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>final adverse judgment in the case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The question presented for our determination is whether Shipowner\u2019s violation of a safety regulation for long-shoring which resulted in unseaworthiness of the vessel was the proximate cause of Manning\u2019s injury. We hold that it clearly was and send the case back for redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The facts of the case are simple. The Sea Road, a converted Navy World War II stern ramp loader (a landing craft type vessel used during the war for invasion purposes), is a small one-hold vessel, and is loaded by driving vehicles up the ramp into the hold. Her cargo space is long and narrow, approximately 62 feet by 20 feet beam. The cause in fact \u2014although so far determined to be no cause in law \u2014 for this case was a manhole approximately 3 feet in diameter the outboard edge of which was about 2 or 3 feet from the starboard side plates and 10 to 20 feet from the square stern. The manhole cover had rusted so that it would not seat properly to support weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">On an evening in September, 1963 the longshore crew of which Manning was the strawboss was loading a cargo of cement blocks stowed on pallets. The pallets were carried aboard the vessel by fork-lift and stowed four abreast athwartships from port to starboard. The pallet load was 4 feet wide and about 4 to 5 feet high. The fork-lift was 12 feet long and was maneuvered by its tiller-like single rear wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Sometime between 6:00 and 7:00 p. m. a longshoreman, with the unlikely name Sam Smith, stepped on the manhole cover but the rim was wasted away and Smith fell into the hole.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Fred Craft, one of the owners of the employer company and of M/V Sea Road, investigated the accident and went to find some plywood to provide a temporary cover, but he gave up on that sometime between the time Smith was injured and 8:00 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Sometime about 8:00 o\u2019clock Manning was walking backwards directing a forklift over the ramp along the starboard side in the hold to fill out a line of pallets. There were three pallets stowed abreast and this load was to fit in the space of 4% to 5 feet remaining on the starboard side. There was approximately 15 to 20 feet between the forward lip of the manhole and the after side of the cargo. As he was holding the cement blocks, he stepped backwards onto the replaced rusted-rimmed manhole cover and fell into the manhole \u2014 obviously a misnomer because it is a hole where men don\u2019t really belong. As a result of the fall Manning injured his left knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">On the initial trial Shipowner conceded, with no real concession at all, that the defective manhole cover rendered M/V Sea Road unseaworthy. It took the bold course, which so far has maintained its buoyancy, that the whole thing was due to the flagrant carelessness of Manning so that the misfortune of the 100 percent contributorily negligent Manning was not proximately caused by this flagrant unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">This was the conclusion of the Trial Judge. It was based upon a permissible credibility choice, 52(a) F.R.Civ.P., that Manning knew of Sam Smith\u2019s earlier injury and management\u2019s abortive efforts toward temporary repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">On the first appeal this Court affirmed the finding that Manning knew of the accident and of the unseaworthy condition on the basis that it was not clearly erroneous. The Court affirmed the finding that Manning was negligent in that there was a safe route available and there was more than mere knowledge on Manning\u2019s part of the unseaworthy condition. After pointing out that assumption of risk concepts could not be applied to defeat recovery and that mitigation of damages for contributory negligence was the most that could result, we distinguished one case on the ground that \u201cthere was no alternative safe route available and the court specifically noted that this might have given rise to a contributory negligence situation.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>then went on to characterize the instant case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">\u201cHere there was a safe route available, and there was more than mere knowledge of the unseaworthy condition. The employee was a part of management and was supervising the loading operation, and it is a fair inference that he could have avoided the danger by discontinuing the work, relocating it, or going around the danger.\u201d 358 F.2d at 617.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">This had led us earlier to declare in quite sweeping terms that the Governmental Safety Regulations for Longshor-ing did not change the result because, essentially, they were not applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We phrased it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cIt is not clear that the safety regulation was called to the attention of the District Court; however, we do not think that it precludes the decision of the court. It is not geared to a situation such as was presented here where the seaworthiness went only to a small portion of the vessel. The regulation calls for a work stoppage only when the unseaworthy condition would jeopardize the safety of employees. Here the work could go on provided the longshoremen steered clear of the defective cover. The regulation was not applicable under the facts presented.\u201d 358 F.2d at 617.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">But all of this was markedly changed on rehearing and it is the fact that this was not discerned or we did not make ourselves clear that led to the error on remand. No longer adhering to the rigid reading of the Regulation that it applied only where the condition would jeopardize safety rather than the risk of likely injury or to the declaration that here \u201cthe work could go on provided the longshoremen steered clear of the * * * cover,\u201d we announced this change of judicial heart: \u201cMoreover, upon further consideration of the documentary evidence, it is not clear that the work could have safely proceeded in spite of the defective manhole cover.\u201d 358 F.2d at 618.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Although charged by our mandate for full judicial-evidentiary inquiry into the Regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the District Judge reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the whole thing to a very simple fact question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201cDid [Manning] have another available route or course to direct that fork lift in?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">To which he supplied a ready answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6_\">\u201cIf he did and didn\u2019t take it, the safety regulation is not applicable and couldn\u2019t possibly have been the proximate cause of his injury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">There are several things wrong with this conclusion. First, it misread our mandate. Second, declaring that this choice of unsafe over safe route \u201cprecluded recovery\u201d (note 5, <em>supra) </em>brought back into the case assumption of risk concepts that we had declared to be proscribed, (see 358 F.2d at 617). Third, this was an erroneous view of the law. Contributory negligence is more than an inquiry into safe versus unsafe routes. It is doubly so where comparative fault ameliorates this type of misconduct. This greatly simplifies our task, for fact, or fact-legal, conclusions induced by an erroneuos legal standard do not have the F.R.Civ.P. 52(a) clearly erroneous insulation. United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 1963, 374 U.S. 174 (note 9, page 194), 83 S.Ct. 1773, 1784, 10 L.Ed.2d 823, 838; Fulton National Bank v. Tate, 5 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 562; Fromberg, Inc. v. Thornhill, 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 407; Davis v. Parkhill-Goodloe Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 302 F.2d 489; MacMullen v. South Carolina Elec. and Gas Co., 4 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 662, cert. denied 373 U.S. 912, 83 S.Ct. 1302, 10 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">We must, therefore, examine what this record demands concerning the regulations, and the significance of any violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">There can be no doubt that the Regulations are applicable in a general sense. They bind all employers, such as shipowner here, of longshoring employees. And, promulgated by the Department of Labor with their genesis in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq., imposing stringent sanctions, civil and criminal, they are geared directly to the safety of men, safety of working conditions, elimination of hazards that have long made longshoring one of industry\u2019s most crippling vocations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>This brings into play Marshall v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 5 Cir., 1964, 334 F.2d 131, 1964 A.M.C. 1686, which dealt with regulations issued by the Coast Guard under 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 170(7). The applicability and impact of regulations was summed up this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\u201cThe law is well established that violation of a statute which is intended to protect the class of persons to which a plaintiff belongs against the risk of the type of harm which has in fact occurred is negligence in itself. Pros-ser, Torts \u00a7 34, at 161 (2d ed. 1955); Restatement, Torts \u00a7 286 (1934). Inherent in this statement of the legal principle are three questions which must be resolved before liability could be imposed * * * on a negligence per se theory. What proof makes out a violation of the regulations? Were the regulations designed to protect longshoremen? Were they intended to protect against the risk of the kind of harm that occurred here * * * ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">334 F.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">But, unlike <em>Marshall, </em>where we held that although Longshoremen were within the class of intended beneficiaries, the Regulation was not designed to protect against the kind of hazard there encountered, it is plain here that both the specific regulation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> asserted and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>whole statutory-regulatory structure are aimed directly at avoiding personal injuries from hazardous conditions. On accepted principles violation of these safety regulations constitutes negligence <em>per </em>se.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">We need not pause long over violation of the specific or related regulations (see notes 6 and 7, <em>supra). </em>Longshoring is a hazardous business. It will always be so. Part of the hazard comes from unavoidable necessity of working around tween deck hatch openings or the edge of built-up deck cargoes during loading or discharging operations. But the risk of falling into or through deck openings which are not essential to current operations is one the regulations sought to stamp out. Everywhere the regulations recognize the risk from openings in holds, decks or hatches and undertake to eliminate or minimize it. Everywhere there is a requirement for suitable stanchions, guard rails or life lines (see note 7, <em>supra). </em>This is a recognition of experience-proved results that these are dangers having devastating consequences to life and limb even to those who, from working in the area, are bound to know of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">All of this has a powerful bearing on causation. The aim of Congress in this legislation and the regulations carrying Congessional imprimatur is to prevent the risk of injury. The regulations forbid the employer to do or not do the thing specified. Severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions are imposed to eliminate the conditions prohibited. The burden is on the employer, not the employee. The aim of the structure is to eliminate the risk of injury to all longshoremen, not just longshoremen who are 100%-plus prudent. Any notion that a flagrant violation of a regulation by the employer shifts the whole loss onto the victim would thwart the entire objective of Congress. Unless an employer bears a considerable portion of the loss, the sought after safety will not be achieved. Indeed, this case illustrates the irony of a holding that the more flagrant the violation the less money risk the employer runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">On the specifics of this record, violation is plain. Granted that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was deck space over which Manning could have guided the fork lift to avoid his letting the fork lift and himself get too close to the manhole, this is not the whole answer. The fork lift filled up 12 feet of the 20 foot interval. The pallet had to, be spotted in a space little wider than the pallet. The operation was a continuous movement in close quarters calling for some direction by Manning. Congress meant to protect workers against injuries, many of which occur in an industrial surrounding of momentary thoughtlessness, imprudence or carelessness. This was a hole in a deck surface over and on which men were working but which did not have to be uncovered for operations. The risk was that of stepping or falling into the hole. The means to avoid it was a secure cover, stanchions, or suspension of work until repairs had been made. The risk became a fact. The resulting fact was directly due to a violation by shipowner so flagrant that even its counsel could not defend it. What could not \u2014 the word is <em>could not </em>\u2014 have occurred without breach of the regulation by the employer surely must meet all the tests anyone has ever contrived \u2014 metaphysical or otherwise\u2014 on legal causation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">This conclusion is not a departure from either our former decision or the rule of the law of the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the contrary, by our former decision the court recognized that the applicability and significance of the regulations called for further judicial inquiry, evaluation and determination. It was another way of saying that on that record and in that posture the court was not able with requisite assurance to rule as a matter of law that the trial court\u2019s conclusions were acceptable. By the plain terms of the mandate (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>a further trial was contemplated and by the nature of the court\u2019s doubts leading to the remand, it equally contemplated an appeal anew on the remanded issues. What\u2014 and all \u2014 we have done is just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">With this conclusion on causation all else falls. We make these further comments because of a basic misconception running through Shipowner\u2019s briefs. It stresses and restresses that this action is a libel <em>in rem </em>and that consequently violation of the regulations is of no significance since this would constitute negligence for which a shipowner-employer is not liable, and certainly not in a libel <em>in rem. </em>There are a number of things wrong with that approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">At the outset, if there is unseaworthiness, it no longer matters whether the claim is asserted <em>in rem or in personam. </em>By <em>Jackson </em>(note 1, <em>supra) </em>the shipowner-employer has a <em>Yaka </em>liability in both forms of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-22\">And from a substantive point of view Shipowner misconceives the significance of the violation of the regulations. True, violation here is negligence, and negligence for which the employer is not liable because of the exclusive liability provision of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905. But what Shipowner overlooks is that the negligent violation of the regulations simultaneously makes the vessel unseaworthy. The Fourth Circuit has expounded this forcefully in Provenza,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an opinion we approved in <em>Marshall </em>supra, at 135 and n.9, as have others<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>If negligence arising from breach of the regulations by an independent stevedore\u2019s creating a condition can make the vessel unseaworthy,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> then it is doubly so where the violator is both the employer and the owner of the vessel. All the more is it so when, on general principles so well recognized that even knowledgeable salt water counsel could find no basis for contending otherwise, Shipowner conceded and the Court found the vessel un-seaworthy for this defective cover. Violation of the statutory regulations only makes it worse since this brings into play congressional objectives which, as we have discussed, bear on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Thus the case must go back again for proper evaluation in terms of mitigation in the light of the policies we have outlined. Obviously the reduction cannot be 100%. The share to be borne by the Shipowner-employer must be substantial to effectuate these policies. (See The Max Morris, note 9 supra). Hopefully the travail of two trials and two appeals, with the unlikelihood that this small case can generate more problems worthy of a third appeal will lead the parties to find a way to bring this case to an end before it takes its place alongside some other persistent one. <em>E. g., </em>Williams v.

See Marshall v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., <em>supra, </em>at 134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b674-4\">. The inquiry starts from the position that unless an action is a cause in fact of an injury it cannot be a proximate (sometimes called \u201clegal\") cause. I\u2019rosser says that \u201can act or an omission is not regarded as a cause [in fact] of an event if the particular event would have, occurred without it.\u201d Prosser, Law of Torts 242 (3d ed. 1964). Noting that this rule does not cover all situations, Prosser espouses the broader rule, which has found general acceptance: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause Lin fact] of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">While cause in fact is readily definable, legal, proximate cause does not lend itself so readily to scientific exjdication. The Restatement (Second) of Torts says the \u201cwords \u2018legal cause\u2019 are used * * * to denote the facts that the causal sequence by which the actor\u2019s tortious conduct has resulted in an invasion of some legally protected interest of another is such that the law holds the actor responsible for such harm unless there is some defense to liability.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts 16 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">On this approach the maritime rule of comparative fault has some bearing. For what would in a contributory-negligence-as-a-bar jurisdiction constitute a \u201cdefense\u201d as the Restatement phrases it, works in a comparative fault jurisdiction as mitigation of damages and not ordinarily as an element of liability in terms of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Prosser also uses legal cause in policy terms. He says that legal cause \u201cis sometimes said to be a question of whether the conduct has been so significant and important a cause that the defendant should be legally responsible. But both significance and importance turn upon conclusions in terms of legal policy, so that this becomes essentially a question of whether the policy of the law will extend the responsibility for the conduct to the consequences which have in fact occurred.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra </em>at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Of course on policy considerations maritime law, long before these regulations of like aim, with its ever expanding concern for the safety of real and <em>SieraclH </em>seamen, recognized comparative fault principles as an effective instrument in that objective. Of it the court had this to say in the old case of The Steamer Max Morris v. Curry, 1890, 137 U.S. 1, 11 S.Ct. 29, 34 L.Ed. 586: \u201cthe more equal distribution of justice, the dictates of humanity, the safety of life and limb, and the public good, will be best promoted by holding vessels liable to bear some part of the actual pecuniary loss sustained by the libelant * * 137 U.S. at 14, 11 S.Ct. at 33, 34 L.Ed. at 589.
