ROBINSON, III,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak4P\">Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-29\">Under review in this case is a record featuring an undercover police officer and the chief defense witness as the principal figures other than appellant himself. The latter has been convicted of four violations of the federal narcotic laws <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stemming from two transactions in each of which, so a jury found, he sold capsules containing a narcotic drug to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the officer and the witness, who allegedly was then a special employee of the police department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s single contention is that the trial judge erred in excluding testimony by the witness tendered to show that the officer had participated in homosexual acts with him. Our examination of this ruling in its full context leads us to conclude that the judge remained well within legitimate bounds, and that the conviction must accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">At the trial, the officer testified that the witness introduced him to appellant who, on the two occasions specified in the indictment, sold them capsules which, by uncontradieted expert testimony, yielded their narcotic content on chemical analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defense protested that the officer\u2019s version was wholly a contrivance to cover his \u201cpartying and \u2018gay\u2019 life\u201d in neglect of police business and to falsely \u201cshow that he was doing something constructive.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel for appellant first pursued this thesis, albeit unsuccessfully, by cross-examination of the officer as to his relationship with the witness and others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was then permitted to introduce extensive testimony by the witness that the officer, in contravention of official instructions, had regularly bought marijuana and liquor for private parties, smoked marijuana and used cocaine, and consorted with women. The trial judge, however, refused to allow the witness to testify that the officer had, allegedly twice, engaged in deviate sexual activity with him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">Recognizing its irrelevance to the substantive issues and disavowing any at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tempt at character impeachment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s counsel urged at trial that the proffered testimony indicated, consonantly with the overall defensive theory, a reason for the officer to fabricate a case against appellant. The sole issue thus framed for our decision is whether that testimony was admissible in support of appellant\u2019s effort to show that the officer was so motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"> It is always open to a party to undertake a demonstration of the bias <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or testimonial motivation \u2014 a form of bias <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 of one who testifies for his adversary. \u201cSuch an effort,\u201d we have said, \u201cmay properly solicit over a wide range any information of potential value to the trier of fact in the assessment of credibility.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Evidence of homosexuality is no exception, and in appropriate circumstances it may readily be admitted for that purpose.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But, as ever so recently we were careful to point out, \u201c[o]nce a reasonable opportunity to prove bias has been afforded a party, the trial judge has the discretion to control the extent of the proof.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Appellant\u2019s position is not that the alleged homosexual acts alone but that the entire course of misconduct attributed to the officer, of which those acts were but a small part, induced him to invent a tale of narcotic violations by appellant. And the trial judge, after carefully weighing the matter upon full argument of counsel, let the witness narrate in elaborate detail the \u201cpartying and \u2018gay\u2019 life\u201d which appellant deemed vital to his contention that the officer had a motive to lie. Even if there were no more to the matter, we could not say that the judge abused his discretion in disallowing testimony that would have added only about two specific episodes to an already lengthy chronical of official misbehavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">But there is more \u2014 indeed, much more. Evidence of homosexuality has an enormous proclivity for humiliation and degradation of a participant in a fashion completely unrelated to testimonial honesty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record before us makes evident the trial judge\u2019s concern that the witness\u2019 claim that the officer had engaged in homosexual conduct would unfairly debase him in the eyes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even where testimony of that sort has some tendency to connote motivation, any exercise of judicial discretion worthy of the name necessitates consideration of these adverse effects.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here the proffered evidentiary items could have legitimately added little to appellant\u2019s substantial presentation while their illegitimate propensities loomed large. On balance, and indulging the leeway that all discretionary rulings command, we hold that the trial judge did not err in excluding them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-30\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4705(a) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">.

We note that on cross-examination the officer denied that he had ever shared a bed with the witness. See note 5, supra. Presumably the witness, if permitted to testify, would have contradicted that statement, but this circumstance did not qualify the disputed testimony for admission. As we have had occasion to state, \u201cgenerally the inquiring party is concluded by the witness\u2019 answer when cross-examination relates to a matter collateral to the issues, and he may not later rebut it for purposes of impeachment.\u201d Ewing v. United States, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 21, 135 F.2d 633, 640, cert. denied 318 U.S. 776, 63 S.Ct. 829, 87 L.Ed. 1145 (1941). See also Lee v.

And the term \u201ccollateral,\u201d we said, \u201ccan mean no more than the matter inquired about is not logically relevant, independently of \u2018pure\u2019 impeachment, to the issues or cause on trial or is so only in so remote and indirect a manner that the authoritative tribunal thinks it should not be inquired into in a case of contradiction by extrinsic testimony or, in one of self-contradiction, further than to make inquiry of the witness.\u201d Ewing v. United States, <em>supra, </em>77 U.S.App.D.C. at 21, 135 F.2d at 640. We have no difficulty in concluding that the answer appellant elicited from the officer was of that character, precluding appellant from attempting contradiction by extrinsic testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
