He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by this Court in January, 1968. Churder v. United States, 387 F.2d 825 (8th Cir. 1968). The appellant now seeks post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964). In October, 1968, he filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri seeking to vacate the judgment and sentence, or, alternatively, to obtain an evidentiary hearing upon the merits of the motion. The motion set forth ten grounds as bases for the requested relief. The District Court, Chief Judge Harper presiding, entered an order overruling the appellant\u2019s motion in all particulars. Churder v. United States, 294 F.Supp. 207 (E.D.Mo. 1968). From that order, the appellant brings this appeal. The appellant has abandoned one of the grounds urged in the District Court, appealing the order as to the other nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">The District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion dealt with each of the appellant\u2019s contentions. Careful scrutiny of that opinion, of appellant\u2019s motion, of the complete record in this case and of the applicable law has convinced us of the correctness of the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The order of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
