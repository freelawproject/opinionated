Appellant filed' a motion in said court asking dismissal of the action on the ground that appellee did not have a bona fide domicile in the Virgin Islands. The motion was heard September 30, 1968. Appellant\u2019s sole witness as she states \u201cwas the plaintiff called as for cross-examination.\u201d On October 1, 1968, the District Court entered an order finding \u201cas a matter of fact that the Plaintiff was, for six weeks preceding the filing of this complaint, and continues to be, a bona fide resident and domiciliary of the island of St. Thomas, the U. S. Virgin Islands.\u201d The motion was thereupon denied and appellant was ordered to file her answer or other responsive pleading within twenty days from October 1, 1968. The present appeal was taken from that order. There was a later motion dated December 3, 1968, filed on behalf of appellant on which no hearing has been had. Said motion is no part of this proceeding. What is presented on this appeal involves an interlocutory matter which is nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
