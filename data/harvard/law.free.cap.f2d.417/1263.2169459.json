There was no reliable indication as to the cause of the fire. Indeed, without objection, the court below charged the jury that \u201cthere has been no proof asserted as to the origin of the fire.\u201d Appendix (App.) 549a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">Plaintiff-appellant sued three parties for damages from the fire, appellee H. A. Crane &amp; Brother, Inc. (Crane), appellee Allied Chemical Corporation (Allied), and Towmotor Corporation (Towmotor). The jury rendered a verdict in favor of all the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">On the day of the fire, August 11, 1964, appellee Crane was engaged in repairing the roof of the Ryerson building. In so doing, Crane constructed an apparatus to raise and lower tar buckets from the ground to the Ryerson roof. The ground abutting the Ryerson building was owned by appellee Allied. Ryer-son had received permission for Crane to make such use of the premises from Allied. The tar was heated to a temperature of 400\u00b0 Fahrenheit while on the ground and then hoisted to the Ryerson roof for application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">On the same day Towmotor was engaged in repairing a forklift which belonged to Allied and was located on Allied\u2019s property. Appellant claimed that the employees of Towmotor used a flammable material to clean the forklift in close proximity to the fire used to heat the tar kettle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-21\">Also at the time of the fire, and for a long time prior thereto, appellee Allied, whose property abuts the Ryerson building, had permitted combustible materials, including wooden boards, wooden pallets, paper, weeds and other trash, to accumulate on its premises near the Ryerson structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-22\">Appellant asserted that Crane was negligent in heating the tar near the litter on the Allied property, that Towmotor was negligent in using flammable liquids near the Crane fire and the Allied trash, and that Allied was negligent in permitting the litter to accumulate as a fire hazard. Further negligence on the part of Allied was alleged to have been its failure to prevent the spread of the fire from its property to the Ryerson building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-23\">Despite these contentions, not only is there no evidence as to how the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>started but the parties are also in dispute as to where the fire started. The record leaves uncertain whether the fire began on the Allied property or in the Ryerson building. In addition, there was evidence of other causes of the fire. One of Crane\u2019s employees admitted to smoking on the job. (App. 352a, 361a.) On the day of the fire a plumbing contractor was working inside the Ryerson building using electric arc welding equipment. (App. 313a.) Ryerson\u2019s employees were permitted to smoke both inside and outside the building. (App. 45a.) Finally, there is testimony that an unidentified Ryerson employee stated that at the time of the fire he observed a spark or flame emanate from an electric box and ascend the wall or beam inside appellant\u2019s building. (App. 388a-390a, 393a, 394a, 403a and 408a-409a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">Appellant requested that the jury be charged that regarding appellee Crane, the roofer, the doctrine of res ipsa lo-quitur was applicable, and regarding Allied, that an adjoining landowner has a duty to aid in the extinguishment of a fire if it starts on its premises. The court refused to so charge. Appellant\u2019s request for an extensive and detailed charge on the inferences permissible to be drawn from circumstantial evidence was also rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Appellant moved for a new trial after a jury verdict for all three defendants on the ground that failure to give the requested charges was error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court below ruled against appellant on all of these claims, without opinion. Ryerson appealed; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">\n<em>Was Appellant Entitled to the Requested Res Ipsa Loquitur Charge Against Appellee Crane?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">The Latin phrase res ipsa loquitur means \u201cthe thing speaks for itself.\u201d Prosser on Torts \u00a7 39 at 217 (3d ed. 1964). Application of the doctrine entitles plaintiff to a jury instruction that a finding of the breach of duty element in a negligence action may be based on inferences alone without direct proof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">The law of New Jersey which controls this lawsuit generally requires the plaintiff to satisfy three elements for a res ipsa loquitur charge:</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">(1) The accident which produced the injury was one which ordinarily does not happen unless someone was negligent ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\">(2) The instrumentality or agency which caused the accident was under the exclusive control of the defendant; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-15\">(3) The circumstances indicated that the untoward event was not caused or contributed to by an act or neglect on the part of the injured person.

Winokur, 98 N.J.Super. 554, 237 A.2d 916, 920 (Law Div.1968), aff\u2019d per curiam, 104 N.J.Super. 329, 250 A.2d 38 (App.Div.), certification denied, 53 N.J. 582, 252 A.2d 157 (1969); Lorenc v. Chemirad Corp., 37 N.J. 56, 179 A.2d 401, 408 (1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 328D(1) (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>Regarding the first element, we are not unmindful that this is a fire case and that fires often happen without negligence on the part of any person,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but we do not rest on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Focusing on the second element, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the instrumentality which caused the fire<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was in the exclusive control of appellee Crane. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 328D(1) (b) (1965) phrases the requirement to be that \u201cother responsible causes, including the conduct of the plaintiff and third persons, are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-14\">Both the Restatement and the law of New Jersey contemplate that the plaintiff eliminate all other possible causes by a preponderance of the evidence. No such elimination is present here. Appellant itself attributed the cause of the fire to three different defendants, including Towmotor. (See note 1, <em>swpra.) </em>The possibility of additional causes, <em>e. g., </em>arc welding by the plumbing contractor inside the Ryerson building and the testimony of an electric spark emanating from inside the building, was not sufficiently disproved by the appellant to entitle the jury to find that any instrumentality of Crane\u2019s was the exclusive cause of the fire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The operative effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>of a res ipsa charge is to force a defendant, who usually knows more about the instrumentality allegedly causing the injury, to bring out all that he knows. In the manufactured products area, a plaintiff is customarily in the dark about the processes used in the making of the products which may not have met the appropriate standard of care. This is not our ease. All the relevant events occurred in an area occupied by or observable to the appellant\u2019s agents.- The policy in favor of the invocation of the res ipsa doctrine is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that appellant was not entitled to a res ipsa loquitur charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Was <em>It Error to Refuse Appellant\u2019s Requested Charge on Inferences Permissible From, Circumstantial Evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">Appellant contends that the trial judge erred in refusing a requested charge relating to circumstantial evidence and the inferences to be drawn from such evidence. The proposed charge, App. 581a, was not only extraordinarily long and complicated but also amounted to little more than a recitation of those portions of the evidence favorable to appellant, thinly draped in ostensibly impartial \u201cwhether or not\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">The wording of a charge is peculiarly a matter for the trial judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court is under no obligation to defer to the specific requests of the parties in determining the content of the charge to the jury where the substance of the requests has already been covered in other instructions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">We recognize the importance in negligence eases of relating the law to the evidence in instructions to the jury, as this court has previously stressed. Atkinson v. Roth, 297 F.2d 570, 574 (3d Cir. 1961). Nor do we part from our prior holding that a \u201crequested instruction, in accord with a party\u2019s contention, and consistent with evidence in the case, must be granted unless the subject matter has been adequately covered in the court\u2019s main charge.\u201d Richardson v. Walsh Construction Co., 334 F.2d 334, 338 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">Rather, in the circumstances here, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-11\">[cjounsel ordinarily have the right to argue to the jury their own conception of what reasonable deductions should be drawn from facts in evidence * * * it is not necessary to this end that the Court point out all the deductions that might reasonably be drawn from these facts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-12\">We are thus of the opinion that the charge given by the court below on the subject of circumstantial evidence, while couched in somewhat abstract language, adequately informed the jury of the relevant law and was not in error in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>\n<em>Was the Court Below in Error for Refusing to Charge the Jury That an Adjoining Landowner (Allied) Has the Duty to Aid in the Extinguishment of a Fire Which Spreads From Its Premises to the Property of a Neighbor and in Refusing Evidence Tending to Show Allied\u2019s Breach of Such Duty?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Appellant cites as error the failure to instruct the jury (and the failure to permit some proffered testimony) on the duty of Allied, the adjoining landowner, to use due care in extinguishing the fire and preventing its spread to the Ryer-son building. See Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1081 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">We uphold the lower court\u2019s action on the following grounds. First, the court properly sustained objections to testimony which tended to show that Allied\u2019s employees did not immediately attempt to aid in extinguishing the fire burning on both Ryerson\u2019s and Allied\u2019s premises. Menth v. Breeze Corp., 4 N.J. 428, 73 A.2d 183 (1950), teaches that a prerequisite to such testimony is proof that the fire had its <em>origin </em>on the adjoining landowner\u2019s premises. Without this basis, never shown here, such testimony is irrelevant. Furthermore, the testimony sought by appellant that two unidentified persons were seen in Allied\u2019s doorway observing the fire when Ryerson employees first reached the scene, and that Allied personnel took no steps to fight the fire before the arrival of the fire department, was in fact both earlier and subsequently admitted into evidence without any limitation as to its purpose. (App. 29a-30a, 42a-43a, 268a.) Therefore, even if the court\u2019s refusal to permit such testimony at one point in the trial was error, it was nevertheless cured by the allowance of similar testimony at other times during the trial, and appellant was not injured thereby. See I Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 19 at 353 (3d ed. 1940); F.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">Second, the refusal of the court to charge that Allied had a duty to prevent the spread of the fire was proper. Such a duty would arise only if (1) the fire started on the Allied premises, and (2) Allied\u2019s agents had notice of the existence of the fire. As we have already noted, the proof fails to demonstrate that the fire started on the Allied property. Furthermore, the fire department was notified by Ryerson personnel immediately upon discovery of the fire (App. 68a, 78a) and arrived within four minutes. (App. 169a, 182a.) The only evidence tending to show that Allied had notice of the fire prior to the time the fire department was notified was (a) testimony by an Allied employee that he first saw the fire \u201ca few minutes\u201d before the fire trucks arrived (App. 216a), at which time he observed the fire to be on both the Ryerson and Allied premises (App. 234a-235a), with pieces of flaming tar descending from the roof of the Ryerson building to the ground; and (b) testimony by Ryerson employees that when they arrived at the scene they saw two unidentified persons in the doorway of Allied\u2019s building observing the fire. (App. 29a-30a.) There is no evidence, nor did appellant offer to prove, that these unidentified individuals had knowledge of the fire either before the fire department was notified or before the appellant\u2019s employees arrived on the scene. Thus the record fails to show that Allied had notice of the fire at a time significantly in advance of the arrival of the fire department. In such a situation, it cannot be said that Allied became subject to a duty to extinguish or contain the fire.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>The New Jersey Supreme Court has articulated the duty of an adjoining landowner in the following fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-4\">* * * [A]n owner or occupant of premises <em>on which a fire accidentally starts </em>is liable for the communication of the fire to the premises of a neighbor only if he has been guilty of some negligence in connection with its origin or escape. (Emphasis added.) Menth v. Breeze Corp., <em>supra </em>73 A.2d at 186.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-5\">The court went on to say in <em>Menth:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-6\">It is the settled rule that the owner of property is not liable for the spread of a fire which is accidentally <em>started thereon </em>by the act of a stranger or by some other cause with which he is not connected, unless he is guilty of negligence in respect to the condition of his premises or in failing to prevent the spread of the fire, <em>after he has notice of the existence of the fire on his premises. </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 188.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">We conclude on the basis of <em>Menth </em>that appellant\u2019s contentions on this issue are not meritorious. In the first quotation from <em>Menth, </em>New Jersey requires that before other related evidence becomes relevant, and before entitlement to the type of charge here requested, appellant must demonstrate that the fire had its origin on Allied\u2019s premises. Moreover, as the second quotation shows, and as the court below charged the jury, App. 553a-554a, Allied must also have had notiice of the existence of the fire before it became subject to a duty to contain it. Since neither the origin of the fire nor Allied\u2019s notice of its existence were sufficiently shown, the requested charge was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">\n<em>Did the Lower Court Err in Admitting (Over Objection) an Alleged Statement Made by an Unidentified Ry-erson Employee Concerning the Origin of the Fire?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Appellant further claims as error the admission into evidence of a statement by an unidentified employee of Ryerson, testified to by Muirhead, a foreman of appellee Crane. Muirhead stated that on the day following the fire he visited the Ryerson plant site and one of appellant\u2019s agents, known to him to be a Ryerson employee but unknown by name, stated that a spark or flame from an electric box<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ascended the wall or beam inside the Ryerson building.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">Muirhead further testified that this unidentified employee made the statement within the earshot of Ryerson\u2019s general superintendent, John Retterer. (App. 395a, 404a-405a.) Although Ret-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>terer was a witness, he was never questioned - about the identity of this employee nor was he called to rebut Muir-head\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellant argues that its objection to the statement as hearsay should have been sustained. Ap-pellees assert that the statement is admissible under Rule 63(9) of the New Jersey Rules of Evidence, adopted in 1967, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-4\">Vicarious admissions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-5\">A statement which would be admissible if made by the declarant at the hearing is admissible against a party if (a) when made it concerned a matter within the scope of a then existing agency, employment, or representative relationship * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">This rule does not require that before the statement is admissible it must be shown that the servant was authorized to make it but only that the statement be made as \u201can ordinary incident of his employment status.\u201d Kingsley v. Miller, 90 N.J.Super. 9, 216 A.2d 11, 13 (App.Div. 1965).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">Appellant refers to Hansen v. Eagle-Picher Lead Co., 8 N.J. 133, 145, 84 A.2d 281, 287 (1951), and Carter v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, 47 N.J.Super. 379, 136 A.2d 15 (App.Div. 1957), as supporting its contention that Muirhead\u2019s testimony was improperly admitted. However, the pertinent comment of the committee which formulated the New Jersey Rules of Evidence states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-13\">Rule 63(9) (a) represents a departure from New Jersey law as represented by [the <em>Hansen </em>and <em>Carter </em>cases]. * * * The proposed Rule represents what is intended to be a more practical and enlightened point of view. -It reflects the position taken in the more modern cases to the effect that statements made by an agent are admissible if they concern a matter within the scope of the agency.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-15\">One of the reasons assigned by the New Jersey committee for the liberalization of the Vicarious Admissions Rule evident in Rule 63(9) (a) is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-16\">the agent is more likely to be telling the truth in most instances when he makes an admission than when later he is summoned to give testimony against his employer. * * * [I]t has been traditional practice to permit a hearsay exception where the necessity is great and the reliability involved in an identifiable class of statements is adequate. It would seem that such requirements are met here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-18\">In the instant case the testimony, that the maker of the disputed statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>a Ryerson employee is nowhere contested or contradicted in the record. Appellant\u2019s objection is that the statement is not shown to concern a matter within the scope of the employment relationship. We have no doubt, however, that an employee has a duty to report all he knows about a fire that occurs on his employer\u2019s premises. Statements of an employee reporting a fire, accidents and other incidents affecting his employer\u2019s business interests normally concern matters within the scope of the employment relationship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Reporting information about the origin of a fire is part of an employee\u2019s general duty of fire prevention and detection clearly incident to his employment status.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that under the circumstances of this case, Muirhead\u2019s testimony was properly admitted under New Jersey Rule 63(9) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">. Although Ryerson did not appeal the judgment in favor of Towmotor, appellant\u2019s action against Towmotor below has relevance to the issues involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">. Additionally, although <em>not presented to </em>the trial court as grounds for a new trial, Ryerson now claims prejudicial error in the admission into evidence (over objection) of an out-of-court statement of an unidentified Ryerson employee. (See p. 10, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">While it would have been desirable for the trial court to have had an opportunity to consider this alleged error on the motion for a new trial, appellant\u2019s failure to raise the claim at that time does not, of course, bar him from asserting this ground on appeal provided objection to the evidence was made at trial, as was the case here. Kiernan v. Yon Schaik, 347 F.2d 775, 777 (3d Cir. 1965). See 3A Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1551 at 54 (Wright ed. 1958) and \u00a7 1551 n. 14 (Supp.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1329-18\">. The <em>Lorenc </em>case pointed out that in products liability cases the second element of the rule relating to exclusive control has been modified. The court said: * * * Modern manufacturing, packing, shipping and marketing conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>however, brought the realization that to hold strictly to the view that inferences of negligence became permissible only on proof of exclusive control of the injuring agency at the time of the mishap would largely destroy the efficacy of the principle. The result was a sensible and logical broadening so as to permit the inference where the total circumstances showed a probability that defendant\u2019s lack of due care while the agency was in his possession and control was responsible for the casualty, and eliminated the probability of efficient participation by some other cause. * * * Harper &amp; James suggest that as generally applied the requirement for exclusive control \u201cis more accurately stated as one that the evidence must afford a rational basis for concluding that the cause of the accident was probably \u2018such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u2019 \u201d 2 The Law of Torts (1956) p. 1086. 179 A.2d at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">With respect to another possible element of the rule, the court said in <em>Gould:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">* * * There is some conflict as to whether there is a fourth prerequisite\u2014 that knowledge of the actual facts be more accessible to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-11\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">Quite frankly this court thinks accessibility of knowledge is irrelevant because it relates more to the justice of a new rule of law based upon strict liability rather than to traditional notions of liability based upon fault, which notions have not yet explicitly been rejected in New Jersey. * * * 237 A.2d at 920-921.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1330-15\">.

The court charged the jury as follows: The charge of negligence may be supported by direct evidence, persuasive proof, specific acts of negligence, or by direct and persuasive proof of facts and circumstances from which negligence may reasonably be inferred. There is no burden on the plaintiff to prove the charge of negligence by direct evidence. The proof of negligence, like the proof of any other fact, may be sustained by circumstantial evidence; that is, evidence of related facts and circumstances sufficiently persuasive to support a reasonably probable inference that a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>fendant was guilty of negligence.

Town of West New York, 49 N.J. 318, 327, 230 A.2d 133, 138 (1967), the New Jersey Supreme Court dealt with a fire that had unquestionably started in defendant\u2019s vacant building. The court defined the duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>the landowner as requiring that he take \u201creasonable means\u201d to prevent the spread of the fire. Ordinarily, the court held, such reasonable means require only that the appropriate municipal fire fighting agency be alerted by the landowner when he acquires notice of the fire\u2019s existence. Since, at most, only a few minutes elapsed between Allied\u2019s notice of the fire and the arrival of the fire department, we do not believe that a duty can be said to have existed for a long enough period of time to justify the requested charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1333-13\">.
