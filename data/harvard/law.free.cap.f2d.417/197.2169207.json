The royalty income is from lands held in trust by the Department of Interior, which lands were allotted to Jackson Barnett, a full-blood Creek Indian. The royalty income has been reinvested by the trustee and the narrow legal question in the case concerns the right of ap-pellee to levy and collect income taxes upon this reinvestment income. The trial court decided the case on stipulated facts and denied recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">We fully agree with the trial judge and for the reasons, so ably expressed by him in a memorandum opinion published in 294 F.Supp. 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
