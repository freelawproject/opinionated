No. 118 (1967). There was credible evidence before the Board that the Company terminated and refused to rehire Peterson because he had instigated a grievance proceeding against a closely related company and had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. The Board was not required to credit the Company\u2019s version that Peterson was discharged for failing to comply with a Company rule regarding absences. Accordingly, there was substantial evidenc\u00e9 to support the finding that the Company violated sections 8(a) (3), (4) and (1) of the Act. In addition, the nature of the hearing before the trial examiner does not warrant denial of enforcement. While the examiner could have been more evenhanded, his conduct did not deprive respondent of a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
