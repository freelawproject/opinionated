H. Bull Steamship Company, now in bankruptcy in that court, is obligated to indemnify the Trustee for the payment of personal injury claims within the scope of the policies. These contain a $1,000 deductible and the Trustee has arranged that upon his payment of a judgment against the estate the claimant will repay $1,000 and become a general creditor for that amount. The insurer argues that all the insured is paying is the net amount plus its expenses and that it is entitled to deduct $1,000 from that sum rather than from the gross recovery and expenses. Judge Mansfield, in a well-considered opinion, 299 F.Supp. 106, held the contrary. We agree and can find nothing to add.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
