At 12:50 P.M. on May 17, 1968, the appellants entered the office of Local Board No. 33 in Catons-ville, Maryland and removed approximately 378 I-A, I-Y and II-A files to an adjacent parking lot where they burned the files with homemade napalm. The appellants, men and women with sincere and strong commitments, readily admit the commission of these acts as a protest against the war in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-22\">The appeal is based on asserted error in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>jury. The appellants claim that: (1) The trial court erred in charging the jury on the definition of criminal intent and the meaning of \u201cwillfully,\u201d and (2) That the trial judge should have informed the jury that it had the power to acquit the defendants even if they were clearly guilty of the offenses, or at least, that the court should have permitted their counsel so to argue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">For the appellants to be convicted of the crimes for which they were indicted, they must have acted knowingly (50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 462(a)) or willfully (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361, 2071(a)). The trial court instructed the jury to the effect that the willful intent requisite to constitute a violation of the statutes involved is the intent on the part of the accused to commit the proscribed acts with knowledge that they were violating the statute. Defense counsel urged upon the court a more expansive interpretation of the word \u201cwillful\u201d as used in the statutes, namely that no violation occurred unless defendants performed the admitted acts with a bad purpose or motive. Their position was and is that since they acted from good motives, i. e., to protest a war which they sincerely believed was not only <em>illegal</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but immoral, they could not have \u201cwillfully\u201d violated the statutes and must be acquitted. We agree with the interpretation of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">To read the term \u201cwillfully\u201d to require a bad purpose would be to confuse the concept of intent with that of motive. The statutory requirement of willfulness is satisfied if the accused acted intentionally, with knowledge that he was breaching the statute. While the trial judge allowed evidence to be freely admitted concerning the defendants\u2019 motives, whatever motive may have led them to do the act is not relevant to the question of the violation of the statute, but is rather an element proper for the judge\u2019s consideration in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">The cases appellants cite to support their argument with respect to \u201cwillfulness\u201d are not controlling in the present situation. In Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288, the defendant removed a number of spent bomb casings from an Air Force bombing range under the mistaken belief that the casings had been abandoned. The Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding that his mistaken belief negated the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>He was acting in good faith since he believed that the casings had been abandoned. However, this is not to say that Moris-sette would have been entitled to acquittal if he had taken the bomb casings with the knowledge that they were not abandoned, but did so for the purpose of protesting the use of bombs as weapons of destruction. Similarly, the appellants in the instant case could not destroy Government property with knowledge that the destruction was illegal and claim that, due to their motivation, the action lacked the requisite willful intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">Other cases <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cited by appellants likewise stand for the incontestable proposition that a mistaken belief as to a material fact may negate the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>Here the appellants, by their own admissions accompanying the acts, knowingly and purposely committed the offense denounced by the statute. They do not challenge the validity of the laws under which they were prosecuted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Furthermore, the language of cases cited by appellants supports the interpretation the district court and we place on \u201cwillfulness.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">.II</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Appellants\u2019 second contention is that the trial judge should have informed the jury, as requested, that it had the power to acquit even if appellants were clearly guilty of the charged offenses. They maintain that the judge should have told the jury this or permitted their counsel to argue it to the jury in the face of the judge's instruction on the law. Appellants reason that since the jury has \u201cthe power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and facts,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> then the jury should be told that it has this power. Furthermore, the argument runs, the jury\u2019s power to acquit where the law may dictate otherwise is a fundamental necessity of a democratic system. Only in this way, it is said, can a man\u2019s actions be judged fairly by society speaking through the jury, or a law which is considered too harsh be mitigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Historically, a fierce controversy has raged over the question of whether the trial judge was under a duty to instruct the jury that it may disregard the law as he has explained it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The earliest reported case adhering to the distinction between law and fact in regard to the respective roles of judge and jury in criminal cases seems to be Plowden\u2019s report of Townsend\u2019s case where the reporter comments, \u201cFor the office of 12 men is no other than to inquire of Matters of Fact and not to adjudge what the Law is, for that is the office of the Court and not of the Jury * \u2019* *.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While Littleton had earlier recognized the power of the jury to \u201cdetermine the crime or issue by their verdict\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> upon the basis of both law and fact, it is Lord Coke\u2019s famous pronouncement which firmly established the law/fact dichotomy in English Jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayt-dedup-0\">The most usual triall of matters of fact is by 12 such men; for <em>ad quaes-tionem facti non respondent judices; </em>and matters in law the judges ought to decide and discuss; for <em>ad quaes-tionem juris non respondent jura-tores.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-18\">In the early history of the American Colonies and for a time after the Revolution juries were nearly always recognized as having the power to judge both law and fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is exemplified in the early Supreme Court case of Georgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>v. Brailsford, 3 Dali. 1, 4, 1 L.Ed. 483, in which Chief Justice Jay declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-4\">* * * for as, on the one hand, it is presumed that juries are the best judges of facts; it is, on the other hand, presumable, that the court are the best judges of law. But still, both objects are lawfully within your power of decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">In criminal cases juries remained the judges of both law and fact for approximately fifty years after the Revolution. However, the judges in America, just as in England after the Revolution of 1688, gradually asserted themselves increasingly through their instructions on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">Concededly, this power of the jury is not always contrary to the interests of justice. For example, freedom of the press was immeasurably strengthened by the jury\u2019s acquittal of John Peter Zenger of seditious libel, a violation of which, under the law as it then existed and the facts, he was clearly guilty. In that case Andrew Hamilton was allowed to urge the jury, in the face of the judge\u2019s charge, \u201cto see with their own eyes, to hear with their own ears, and to make use of their consciences and understanding in judging of the lives, liberties, or estates of their fellow subjects.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">No less an authority than Dean Pound has expressed the opinion that \u201cJury lawlessness is the great corrective of law in its actual administration.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, this is not to say that the jury should be encouraged in their \u201clawlessness,\u201d and by clearly stating to the jury that they may disregard the law, telling them that they may decide according to their prejudices or consciences (for there is no check to insure that the judgment is based upon conscience rather than prejudice), we would indeed be negating the rule of law in favor of the rule of lawlessness. This should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">The Supreme Court, in the landmark case of Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895), affirmed the right and duty of the judge to instruct on the law, and since that case the issue has been settled for three-quarters of a century. Justice Harlan\u2019s scholarly opinion traced the history of the rights of juries in criminal cases. He distinguished <em>Brailsford </em>as a civil case and therefore not controlling in criminal trials. Justice Harlan further deprecated that decision, going to the extreme of questioning whether it was in fact reported properly, since he doubted that Chief Justice Jay could ever have held such an opinion even in a civil case. The Justice concluded finally that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-13\">Public and private safety alike would be in peril if the principle be established that juries in criminal cases may, of right, disregard the law as expounded to them by the court, and become a law unto themselves. Under such a system, the principal function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>of the judge would be to preside and keep order while jurymen, untrained in the law, would determine questions affecting life, liberty, or property according to such legal principles as, in their judgment, were applicable to the particular case being tried. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\">But upon principle, where the matter is 'not controlled by express constitutional or statutory provisions, it cannot be regarded as the right of counsel to dispute before the jury the law as declared by the court. * * * We must hold firmly to the doctrine that in the courts of the United States it is the duty of juries in criminal cases to take the law from the court, and apply that law to the facts as they find them to be from the evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aue-dedup-0\">There was a powerful dissent by Justice Grey joined by Justice Shiras. As in the majority decision, Justice Grey historically traced the authorities and the classic arguments to support his conclusion that the jury should decide both the law and the facts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">The Harlan majority opinion, however, has carried the day. Since the <em>Sparf </em>case, the lower federal courts\u2014 even in the occasional cases in which they may have ventured to question its wisdom<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 have adhered to the doctrine it affirmed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, among the states, only two still allow the jury to be told that they can disregard the law as given them by the court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">The recent case of United States v. Spock et al., 416 F.2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969), heavily stressed by the appellants in their supplemental memorandum, does not reach a different conclusion. That case was concerned with the question arising from submission of special interrogatories to the jury. The First Circuit, speaking through Chief Judge Aldrich, concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-14\">By a progression of questions each of which seems to require an answer unfavorable to the defendant, a reluctant juror may be led to vote for a conviction which, in the large, he would have resisted. The result may be accomplished by a majority of the jury, but the course has been initiated by the judge, and directed by him through the frame of the questions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">Nowhere does the court intimate that the judge should not instruct the jury on the law, and nowhere does it hold, as appellants here contend, that the jury should be instructed that it may disregard the law as declared by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-16\">As an undercurrent throughout the trial and interwoven with appellants\u2019 assertions of error is an appeal to morality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>as justification for their conduct. The argument consists of two closely related strands. They argue that the motivation for their action was moral in the sense that they intended to protest a war which is outrageous to their individual standards of humanity. Therefore, their actions are said to be not punishable regardless of the literal violation of a statute. Moreover, appellants argue that apart from their motivation, which is subjective, the war in Vietnam is in fact illegal and immoral and hence their acts in protest of this war were themselves moral acts for which they must be similarly immunized from punishment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In effect, the appellants focus upon the means by which an organized society treats those citizens who choose to commit an act of civil disobedience in the name of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">From the earliest times when man chose to guide his relations with fellow men by allegiance to the rule of law rather than force, he has been faced with the problem how best to deal with the individual in society who through moral conviction concluded that a law with which he was confronted was unjust and therefore must not be followed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Faced with the stark reality of injustice, men of sensitive conscience and great intellect have sometimes found only one morally justified path, and that path led them inevitably into conflict with established authority and its laws. Among philosophers and religionists throughout the ages there has been an incessant stream of discussion as to when, if at all, civil disobedience, whether by passive refusal to obey a law or by its active breach, is morally justified. However, they have been in general agreement that while in restricted circumstances a morally motivated act contrary to law may be ethically justified, the action must be non-violent and the actor must accept the penalty for his action. In other words, it is commonly conceded that the exercise of a moral judgment based upon individual standards does not carry with it legal justification or immunity from punishment for breach of the law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The defendants\u2019 motivation in the instant ease \u2014 the fact that they engaged in a protest in the sincere belief that they were breaking the law in a good cause \u2014 cannot be acceptable legal defense or justification. Their sincerity is beyond question. It implies no disparagement of their idealism to say that society will not tolerate the means they chose to register their opposition to the war. If these defendants were to be absolved from guilt because of their moral certainty that the war in Vietnam is wrong, would not others who might commit breaches of the law to demonstrate their sincere belief that the country is not prosecuting the war vigorously enough be entitled to acquittal? Both must answer for their acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">We are not called upon in this case to establish guidelines for determining in what extreme circumstances, if any, governmental acts may be resisted. We confine ourselves to this case and hold only that the law does not allow the seizure of public records and their mutilation or destruction, even when this is done as an act of conscience to dramatize the protest of a presumed evil. The acts of these appellants are not as extreme as some committed by other dissenters. Nevertheless, this publicly exploited action cannot be dismissed as <em>de minimis. </em>To encourage individuals to make their own determinations as to which laws they will obey and which they will permit themselves as a matter of conscience to disobey is to invite chaos. No legal system could long survive if it gave every individual the option of disregarding with impunity any law which by his personal standard was judged morally untenable. Toleration of such conduct would not be democratic, as appellants claim, but inevitably anarchic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">.

The motivation prompting the defendants\u2019 acts was eloquently expressed by defendant James Darst:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-6\">\u201cThe basic human duty is to cry out in the face of a crime, in the face of suffering that can be prevented, perhaps, by a cry * * * [and] doing a very tiny bit to stop the machine of death that I saw moving and killing * * * to hinder this effort in a literal way, an actual, physical, literal way, by preventing these people, these young men, from being taken by the war effort and then put to killing people unnecessarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Trial testimony of James Darst, 401-402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">.

Adherents and practitioners of civil disobedience who have reached this conclusion are too many to list. One need only allude to Socrates, Sir Thomas More, Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. whose actions supported this proposition. The Lutheran and Episcopal Churches in America have endorsed civil disobedience, but only if action is non-violent and <em>the </em>actor is willing to accept the consequences of his action. <em>See, </em>Lutheran Church in America, Statement on Race Relations, July 9, 1964 (adopted by the 1964 convention of the church in Pittsburgh, Penna.) ; Episcopal Church, Report No. 5 on Christian Social Relations (adopted by the 1964 General Convention of the Church in St. Louis, Missouri).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
