Examination of the record and the briefs discloses that the railroad\u2019s appeal is utterly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-18\">The appellant\u2019s only assertion of error is the reference in the charge given by the District Judge to the jury, to a possible preexisting injury to the plaintiff before the occurrence of the injury which is alleged as the basis of the defendant\u2019s liability. The Judge was at pains to protect the defendant against any award of damages \u201cfor any condition existing pri- or to the alleged injury for which [the railroad] was not in any way responsible in causing or aggravating.\u201d While the defendant objected to this charge at the trial, we note it was the defendant who first injected the issue of preexisting injury into the evidence. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s charge was not only a correct statement of the law, but it was highly favorable to the defendant, and in no event could it have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b696-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
