He is a California prisoner who pled guilty to a charge of petty theft with a prior petty theft conviction (a felony), and to a charge of possession of narcotics (heroin) for sale, with prior felony and narcotics convictions. He was sentenced under both convictions on the same day; the sentences are concurrent. He attacks only his conviction of the narcotics offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-21\">The only ground stated for granting the writ that appears to have any merit is that Chavez entered his plea in reliance on a promise, and without understanding its consequences. We set out his allegations in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sence, Chavez makes two claims: 1. That he pled guilty because he was promised that he would be sent to the hospital and 2. that he did not know that he could be sent to prison. .</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">These allegations stretch credulity almost to the breaking point. We would have thought that, if they are true, both Chavez and his counsel would have protested when, at sentencing, the court did not exercise its power to start proceedings to have Chavez committed to the state narcotic detention, treatment and rehabilitation facility, but instead sentenced him for the term prescribed by law, with only a recommendation that he be given treatment at the facility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet neither of them protested. Moreover, when Chavez entered his plea, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Has anybody made you any promises of a lesser sentence, probation, reward, immunity or anything else in order to induce you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">THE COURT: Do you understand the matter of probation and sentence is to be determined solely by this Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEx\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">THE COURT: Are you pleading guilty because in truth and in fact you are guilty and for no other reason, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">The District Judge relied on this colloquy in denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">Nevertheless, nowhere in the transcript of the proceedings on the plea or on the sentencing does it appear that anyone told Chavez what the possible punishment was, or asked him if he knew what it was. Nor did Chavez state that he knew what it was. Moreover, in his traverse Chavez says his counsel told him not to say anything about the claimed agreement while being sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the record demonstrates that Chavez is entitled to no relief. The contention that a guilty plea was not entered knowingly or voluntarily can seldom be resolved without a hearing because most allegations that the plea was induced by lack of knowledge or by a broken promise, or by some other improper factor, involve facts outside the record. See, e. g., Bright v. Rhay, 9 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 915; Smiley v. Wilson, 9 Cir., 1967, 378 F.2d 144; Johnson v. Wilson, 9 Cir., 1967, 371 F.2d 911; Doran v. Wilson, 9 Cir., 1966, 369 F.2d 505; Gilmore v. California, 9 Cir., 1966, 364 F.2d 916. These cases, we think, require that Chavez be given a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-18\">The order is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">. If his narcotics conviction is set aside, Chavez indicates that he will have served enough time on the theft conviction to be eligible for parole. See Imbler v. Oliver, 9 Cir., 1968, 397 F.2d 277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. In the form petition prescribed by the District Court, Chavez alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">\u201cCounsel * * * promised petitioner the judge had agreed to sentence petitioner to the hospital. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">\u201cThe plea was entered * * * on the promise of the petitioner being sent to the hospital. Petitioner was unaware a guilty plea would result in a prison sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">In a more detailed statement, attached to the petition, Chavez alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">\u201cOn or about February 1, 1965, petitioner was asked to enter a plea of guilty to a charge of violation of Section 11500 of the Health and Safety Code, to wit; Possession of Heroin. Couusel entered Chambers with the District Attorney and Judge where a discussion took place out of petitioner\u2019s presence. Counsel told petitioner, following the conference, that if petitioner would plead guilty the Judge was willing to recommend petitioner to the Narcotic Hospital for treatment. Petitioner, after being informed of this, did enter a guilty plea expecting to be referred to Department #95 for said committment [sic]. Following the plea of guilty, however, the Judge sentenced petitioner to the term prescribed for by law in case No. 291,603 with the recommendation that petitioner receive the treatment through the Department of Corrections and also sentenced to the term prescribed for by law in case No. 296,744, to run concurrent and the priors in both cases were found to be true and also a further recommendation made that petitioner receive treatment through the Department of Corrections. The prior convictions aggravated petitioner\u2019s committment [sic] thus the sentence is Ten (10) years to Life. * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Counsel assured petitioner upon consulting the Judge and Prosecuting Attorney in chambers, that if petitioner would plead guilty the Judge was willing to recommend petitioner to the Narcotic Hospital for treatment in compliance with Section 6451 of the Penal Code. * * * At no time did counsel or the court advise petitioner that the \u2018guilty plea\u2019 could or would result in a prison sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">In his traverse to the return of the prison warden to the court\u2019s order to show cause, Chavez says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-14\">\u201cIt stands uncontidicted [sic] that the Petitioner would plead guilty freely, voluntary [sic], and without threats or fear because it was Petitioner\u2019s understanding that he would be sent to the hospital for necessary treatment in exchange for the guilty plea. Prior to entering the guilty plea counsel advised Petitioner not to say anything in court in regards to the agreement while being sentenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-20\">. The facility is under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Corrections. (Cal.Welf.&amp;Inst.C. \u00a7 3001, formerly Cal. Pen.C. \u00a7 6400.) California law permits the trial judge, upon conviction of a crime in Superior Court, if it appears that the defendant is a narcotic addict, to adjourn proceedings or suspend sentence, conduct proceedings to determine the fact of addiction, and commit the defendant to the facility for treatment. (Cal.Welf.&amp;Inst.C. \u00a7 3051, formerly Cal. Pen.C. \u00a7 6451.) If the defendant is thereafter rehabilitated, the criminal charge may be dismissed (Cal.Welf.&amp;Inst. C. \u00a7 3200, formerly Cal.Pen.C. \u00a7 6520).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
