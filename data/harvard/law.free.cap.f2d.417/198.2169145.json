The examiner also found that one of respondent\u2019s supervisors had engaged in coercive interrogation and had threatened one worker regarding layoffs, and the Board adopted these findings as well. The sole question for our determination is whether these findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Respondent\u2019s argument against enforcement rests entirely upon an attempt to overturn the examiner\u2019s credibility determinations. Recognizing the heavy oar it must pull to justify reversal on this ground, respondent refers us to the following language in NLRB v. Monroe Auto Equipment Co., 5th Cir. 1968, 392 F.2d 559, 560-561: \u201c[I]n a proper case the Court may decline to follow the action of an examiner in crediting and discrediting testimony even though the Board has adopted the examiner\u2019s findings.\u201d We do not think, however, that the case at bar presents such an instance; rather, we think it falls within the further language of the <em>Monroe </em>case, <em>supra, </em>that \u201cwe are not at liberty to displace the Board\u2019s choice if it is between two fairly conflicting views, even though we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.\u201d The trial examiner wrote a full memorandum of decision in which he explained the reasons for his credibility determinations painstakingly and in detail. Each of his findings adopted by the Board was clearly supported by the testimony of witnesses whom he had some reason to believe credible and who at the very least created a fair conflict with testimony of respondent\u2019s witnesses. Therefore, we hold that respondent\u2019s disagreements with the examiner\u2019s credibility determinations, even though not wholly without merit as must inevitably be the case when testimony of numerous witnesses is in -hopeless conflict, do not vitiate the Board\u2019s findings of fact since those findings remain supported by substantial evidence in the record viewed as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the Clerk to place on Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. <em>See </em>Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
