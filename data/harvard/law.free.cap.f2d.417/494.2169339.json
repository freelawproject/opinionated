Defendant, Ernest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Sanchez, pleaded guilty on March 10, 1966, to one count of illegal importation of marihuana into the United States, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Prior to accepting his plea of guilty, the trial judge informed him of the nature of the charge against him and of the penalties he might incur. The judge instructed defendant that a conviction for illegal importation of marihuana under \u00a7 176a carried a minimum mandatory penalty of five years in prison and a maximum penalty of twenty years in prison plus a fine of $20,000. Defendant replied that he understood the penalties he might incur, and then, with the aid of his court appointed attorney, entered a plea of guilty. Before accepting the plea, the trial judge made diligent inquiry as to defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge against him and as to the voluntariness of his plea. Upon defendant\u2019s assurance that the plea was made of his own free will and that no threats or promises had been made to him, the plea was accepted and thereafter on March 17, 1966, sentence was pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">On this appeal Sanchez complains that the trial judge did not inform him that a person found guilty of violating \u00a7 176a was ineligible for probation or parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contends that the failure of the trial judge to inform him of such ineligibility was a violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and vitiated the effects of his guilty plea. Rule 11, as amended in 1966, requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that a defendant entering a plea of guilty understand \u201cthe nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant does not complain that he did not understand the nature of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>against him. His sole grievance is that he tendered the plea of guilty under the erroneous belief that he would be eligible for probation and parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim of error is grounded on the view that ineligibility for parole is a \u201cconsequence of the plea\u201d within the meaning of Rule 11. Such an allegation is not new to this Court. In Trujillo v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 266, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 899, 88 S.Ct. 224, 19 L.Ed.2d 221, the defendant was convicted on a plea of guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison for the unlawful sale of marihuana. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4742(a). He argued on a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate that failure to inform him of parole ineligibility vitiated his guilty plea. While noting that the issue was not free of doubt, see Munich v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 337 F.2d 353, 361, we rejected this argument and concluded that \u201cthe judge was not required to inform appellant of ineligibility for parole * * 377 F.2d at 269. Our decision in <em>Trujillo </em>was based in part on the rationale of Smith v. United States, 1963, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 324 F.2d 436, 442, cert. denied, 376 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 978, 11 L.Ed.2d 975, where the Court held that \u201cnoneligibility for parole is not a \u2018consequence\u2019 of a plea of guilty * * *; rather, it is a consequence of the withholding of legislative grace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Since the opinion in Smith v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and our own opinion in <em>Trujillo, </em>three additional Circuits have ruled on whether parole ineligibility is covered by Rule 11, and two of them have reached results contrary to our own. See Durant v. United States, 1 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 689; Berry v. United States, 3 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 189. But see United States v. Caruso, S.D.N.Y.1967, 280 F.Supp. 371, aff\u2019d sub. nom. United States v. Mauro, 2 Cir. 1968, 399 F.2d 158, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 904, 89 S.Ct. 1010, 22 L.Ed.2d 215 (March 4, 1969). The First and Third Circuits have rejected the view that parole ineligibility is not a \u201cconsequence\u201d of a plea of guilty within the meaning of Rule 11. The First Circuit in <em>Durant </em>has taken the position that denominating parole ineligibility \u201cthe withholding of legislative grace\u201d involves the failure to distinguish between ineligibility for parole and merely the unavailability of parole. Ineligibility for parole is said to be \u201cin the nature of an additional penalty.\u201d 410 F.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The Court in <em>Durant </em>has also rejected our comparison in <em>Trujillo </em>between parole ineligibility and such matters as loss of a passport, deportation, loss of voting privileges and undesirable discharge from the armed forces, all of which have been said to be consequences of a guilty plea too remote for the compass of Rule 11. The First Circuit has determined that these matters are \u201ccollateral consequences, civil in nature, while parole goes directly to the length of time a defendant is to be incarcerated.\u201d 410 F.2d at 692. Distinction is thus made for purposes of Rule 11 between consequences that affect the length of detention and consequences that do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Were the question of parole ineligibility before this Court for the first time, the considerable appeal of these recent decisions might persuade us to a like position. However, in Trujillo v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and by implication in Dorrough v. United Slates, 5 Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 887, 897, cert. denied, 1969, 394 U.S. 1019, 89 S.Ct. 1637, 23 L.Ed.2d 44, this Court rejected the argument that parole ineligibility is a consequence of a guilty plea within the meaning of Rule 11. We are bound by that result. We therefore conclude, as we did in <em>Trujillo, </em>that the trial judge was not required to inform defendant of his ineligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">We note in passing that the Court in <em>Trujillo </em>did not specifically address itself to the issue of probation, as distinct from parole, because the defendant in that ease had been informed that probation was not available. 377 F.2d at 266, n. 1. We do not believe, however, that this distinction can afford any comfort to the defendant here. We cannot in good conscience find any mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ingful difference for purposes of Rule 11 between ineligibility for probation and ineligibility for parole. We therefore conclude that <em>Trujillo </em>is equally binding on both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">We have considered the two most recent Supreme Court cases on Rule 11, McCarthy v. United States, 1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418; Halliday v. United States, 1969, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16, and find nothing therein contrary to our decision in <em>Trujillo, </em>supra. This panel being impotent' to overrule <em>Trujillo </em>we abide and apply its edict.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The judgment of the district court denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whoever, knowingly, with intent to defraud the United States, imports or brings into the United States marihuana contrary to law, or smuggles or clandestinely introduces into the United States marihuana which, should have been invoiced, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such marihuana after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law, or whoever conspires to do any of the foregoing acts, shall be imprisoned not less than five or more than twenty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000. For a second or subsequent offense (as determined under section 7237(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), the offender shall be imprisoned for not less than ten or more than forty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">sfc :*\u00ab jf; :js s{!</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. See 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237(d). Subsequent to defendant\u2019s conviction, this section was modified by amendment, see Pub.L. 89-793, 80 Stat. 1438, to permit parole for marihuana offenders previously ineligible for parole. The amendment was not, however, in effect either when defendant pleaded guilty or when sentence was imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-14\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 (1969 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the court, <em>nolo contendere. </em>The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of <em>nolo con-tendere </em>without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea. As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff.

Since the amended language was added, however, only \u201cto state what clearly is the law,\u201d Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 (1969 Supp.), we assume, as we did in <em>Trujillo, </em>377 F.2d at 268, that the language \u201cconsequence of his plea\u201d was part of the meaning of Rule 11 prior to the amendment which gave it actual expression.
