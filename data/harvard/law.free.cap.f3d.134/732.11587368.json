Black argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims of due process violations during a disciplinary hearing pursuant to <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). He contends that Texas created a liberty interest by enacting certain Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID) procedural rules governing prison disciplinary hearings. He also argues that no evidence supported the disciplinary action taken against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) amended \u00a7 1915 to require the district court to dismiss <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) prisoner civil rights suits if the court determines that the action is frivolous or malicious or does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae &amp; (ii); <em>see also, </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The language of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) tracks the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We will therefore employ the same <em>de novo </em>standard to review the \u00a7 1915(e)(B)(ii) dismissal as we use to review dismissal pursuant to 12(b)(6). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997); <em>accord McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997); <em>Atkinson v. Bohn, </em>91 F.3d 1127, 1128 (8th Cir.1996). As to the dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B) (i), we review a determination by a district court that a case is frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We have reviewed the record and find neither error nor abuse of discretion in the reasoning of the district court as to Black\u2019s claim of a due process violation because he did not receive advanced written notice of the charge. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>No. 9:96-CV-359 (E.D.Tex. Oct. 28,1996). Black has not demonstrated plain error with respect to his contention, raised for the first time in this appeal, that he was deprived of due process because he was not allowed to present documentary evidence or to call witnesses at the hearing. <em>See Robertson v. Plano City of Tex., </em>70 F.3d 21, 23 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484-85, 115 S.Ct. at 2300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Assuming TDCJ-ID procedural rules regarding notice and the right to call witnesses and present documentary evidence were violated, Black has not shown that such errors rise to the level of a constitutional due process claim. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1251-52 (5th Cir.1989). Even if a constitutional liberty interest is implicated by Black\u2019s challenge to the disciplinary decision on the ground that no evidence supports the charge, the record reveals that \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the charge. <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 234 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
