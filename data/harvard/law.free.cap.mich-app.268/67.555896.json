In <em>People v Derror, </em>the prosecution also appeals a trial court order ruling that, pursuant to MCL 257.625(4) and MCL 257.625(5), the prosecution must prove that the presence of a controlled substance in a defendant\u2019s body is a proximate cause of an accident resulting in death or serious injury. In <em>People v Kurts, </em>the prosecution appeals the dismissal of the charges against defendant, Dennis Wayne Kurts, based on the insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We agree with the trial courts\u2019 determinations that carboxy THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance. However, we disagree with the trial court in <em>Kurts </em>that the presence of this substance in a defendant\u2019s blood is not evidence of the presence of THC,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a schedule 1 controlled substance. Pursuant to the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in the companion cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>People v Schaefer </em>and <em>People v Large,</em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find that the trial court in <em>Derror </em>improperly determined that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s \u201cdecision to drive with any amount of a controlled substance in her body produced a change in her operation of the vehicle that was a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d We presume from the opinion that the Supreme Court will apply this case retroactively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court\u2019s orders in <em>Derror, </em>and reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the case against Mr. Kurts in <em>Kurts. </em>We, therefore, remand in both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In <em>Derror, </em>defendant Delores Marie Derror was charged with violating MCL 257.625(8) for driving under the influence of marijuana, a schedule 1 controlled substance, and with violating MCL 257.625(4) and MCL 257.625(5) for causing a motor vehicle accident resulting in death and serious injury. Ms. Derror was driving eastbound on a snow and slush-covered M-72 at approximately 6:00 p.m. on a snowy January 11, 2004, when she crossed into oncoming traffic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>collided with another vehicle. The front-seat passenger was killed, two children riding in the back seat were paralyzed, and a third child received a broken neck and jaw. Deputy sheriffs found five marijuana cigarettes in Ms. Derror\u2019s purse while looking for identification. Ms. Derror later admitted that she had smoked one marijuana cigarette at 2:00 p.m. Two separate blood samples were analyzed for the presence of illegal substances. The first blood sample drawn contained 38 nanograms per milliliter of car-boxy THC, and the second contained 31 nanograms per milliliter of the same substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In <em>Kurts, </em>Mr. Kurts was also charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana in violation of MCL 257.625(8). Mr. Kurts was stopped at approximately 9:45 p.m. on February 25, 2004, for driving erratically. The officer initiating that stop noted the Mr. Kurts smelled of alcohol and that his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. Mr. Kurts admitted to drinking two beers and was asked to exit the vehicle. After the officer discovered a marijuana pipe in Mr. Kurts\u2019s pocket during a pat-down search, Mr. Kurts admitted to smoking marijuana only a half-hour earlier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Kurts\u2019s blood contained eight nanograms per milliliter of carboxy THC, and 0.07 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In each case, both the prosecution and the defense presented the testimony of expert witnesses at pretrial evidentiary hearings regarding the characteristics of marijuana, THC, and carboxy THC. The experts agreed that carboxy THC is a \u201cmetabolite,\u201d or byproduct of metabolism,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> created in the human body during the body\u2019s biological process of converting marijuana into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>water-soluble form that can be excreted more easily. Its presence in the blood conclusively proves that a person ingested THC at some point in time. However, carboxy THC itself has no pharmacological effect on the body and its level in the blood correlates poorly, if at all, to an individual\u2019s level of THC-related impairment. In fact, carboxy THC could remain in the blood long after all THC has gone, as THC quickly leaves the blood and enters the body\u2019s tissues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In <em>Derror, </em>the trial court determined, following a pretrial evidentiary hearing, that the Legislature did not intend to include carboxy THC as a schedule 1 controlled substance because it has no pharmacological effect on the human body. The court did not dismiss the case against Ms. Derror, however, because a jury could determine from the presence of this substance in her blood that she had THC in her body at the time of the accident. Although the prosecution argued that MCL 257.625(8) is a strict liability statute, the court ordered that the prosecution would be required to establish at trial that the presence of the THC in Ms. Derror\u2019s blood was a proximate cause of the accident for purposes of MCL 257.625(4) and MCL 257.625(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In <em>Kurts, </em>the trial court granted Mr. Kurts\u2019s motion to dismiss his charged violation of MCL 257.625(8). Following an evidentiary hearing, the court determined that the Legislature did not intend to include carboxy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>THC as a schedule 1 controlled substance because it has no pharmacological effect or medicinal value. As the level of carboxy THC in a person\u2019s blood bears a poor correlation to the level of THC in a person\u2019s body, the court found that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find that Mr. Kurts was operating a motor vehicle with a controlled substance in his body at the time of his traffic stop. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">II. NATURE OP CARBOXY THC</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">These cases present an issue of first impression\u2014 whether carboxy THC, a metabolite of a schedule 1 controlled substance, can be considered a schedule 1 controlled substance itself for purposes of proceeding against a defendant under MCL 257.625(8). Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law subject to review de novo on appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The primary goal in statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is only when statutory language is ambiguous that we are permitted to look beyond the statute to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When construing an ambiguous statute, \u201c[t]he court must consider the object of the statute, the harm it is designed to remedy, and apply a reasonable construction that best accomplishes the statute\u2019s purpose, but should also always use common sense.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this regard, courts should seek to avoid a construction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>would produce absurd results, injustice, or prejudice to the public interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Defendants were charged with violating MCL 257.625(8), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway ... within this state if the person has in his or her body any amount of a controlled substance listed in schedule 1 under section 7212 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7212, or a rule promulgated under that section ... .[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Marijuana, spelled \u201cmarihuana\u201d in the statute, is expressly included as a schedule 1 controlled substance in MCL 333.7212(l)(c). This statute does not expressly include carboxy THC, by any name, as a schedule 1 controlled substance. MCL 333.7212(l)(d) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">Except as provided in subsection (2), <em>synthetic </em>equivalents of the substances contained in the plant, or in the resinous extractives of cannabis and <em>synthetic </em>substances, derivatives, and their isomers with similar chemical structure or pharmacological activity, or both, such as the following, are included in schedule 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">(i) A1 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">(ii) A6 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">(iii) A3,4 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Carboxy THC does have a similar chemical structure to THC.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, as carboxy THC is created during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>body\u2019s metabolism of that substance, it clearly is a natural, rather than synthetic, byproduct of THC.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find MCL 333.7212(l)(d) inapplicable and must determine if carboxy THC is included in the definition of marijuana as a classified schedule 1 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201cMarijuana\u201d is defined as \u201call parts of the plant Canabis sativa L., growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin ... .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As a byproduct of the body\u2019s metabolism of marijuana, carboxy THC is clearly not a part of the actual plant nor does it fit within the common definitions of a compound, manufacture, salt, mixture, or preparation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Legislature did not define \u201cderivative\u201d in the Public Health Code. The Michigan Supreme Court has given us permission to use the common dictionary to define terms. However, it is unnecessary to do so in this case as we can determine the Legislature\u2019s intent by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We note that the Legislature could have included metabolites in the definition of marijuana or schedule 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>controlled substances if it so intended. Under the Child Protection Law, for example, certain parties are required to report if \u201ca newborn infant has any amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in his or her body . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he Legislature is presumed to be aware of all existing statutes when enacting new laws.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the Legislature expressly included metabolites in another statute, we must assume that it intended to expressly <em>exclude </em>the regulation of these substances in the Public Health Code.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We also note that those Arizona and Indiana statutes cited by the prosecution that prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance expressly include metabolites and, therefore, have no persuasive effect on our interpretation of the relevant statutes in this case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We also find that controlling the presence of carboxy THC in a defendant\u2019s body does not comport with the purpose of the Public Health Code. The general purpose of the code is to protect \u201cthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To meet that goal, the Legislature provided the administrator with the following guidance in determining how to classify a substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">In making a determination regarding a substance, the administrator shall consider all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">(a) The actual or relative potential for abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>(b) The scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">(c) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">(d) The history and current pattern of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">(e) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">(f) The risk to the public health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">(g) The potential of the substance to produce psychic or physiological dependence liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">(h) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this <em>article.[</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">The Legislature further provided that \u201cAfter considering the factors enumerated in section 7202, the administrator shall make findings with respect thereto and promulgate a rule controlling the substance if the administrator finds the substance has a potential for abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cThe administrator shall place a substance in schedule 1 if it [sic] finds that the substance has high potential for abuse and has no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or lacks accepted safety for use in treatment under medical supervision.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">It is undisputed that carboxy THC has no pharmacological effect on the human body and, therefore, it can have no potential for abuse, history of abuse by members of the public, or produce chemical dependence. It is also undisputed that THC is the precursor of carboxy THC, and that carboxy THC is not the immediate precursor of any controlled substance. As carboxy THC itself is a benign substance, it does not meet the criteria for classification as a schedule 1 controlled substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>or for <em>any </em>classification of controlled substance.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, its control could not be the object of the Public Health Code.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Both trial courts, therefore, properly determined that carboxy THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">However, the trial courts reached divergent rulings regarding whether a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants had THC present in their bodies at the time of their alleged violations from the presence of carboxy THC in their blood. In Docket No. 259315, we find that the trial court erroneously answered this question in the negative and dismissed the charged violation of MCL 257.625(8) against Mr. Kurts. We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss charges for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The evidence presented by the prosecution and defense expert witnesses reveals that the presence of carboxy THC in a person\u2019s blood <em>conclusively </em>establishes the prior ingestion of THC. It is irrelevant that Dr. McCoy testified that the level of THC in Mr. Kurts\u2019s body and related THC-impairment at the time of his traffic stop could not be determined with certainty, based on the level of carboxy THC in his blood. Mr. Kurts admitted to smoking marijuana only one half-hour before he was arrested. In light of this admission and the scientific evidence, although disputed, regarding the significance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>presence of carboxy THC in the blood, there clearly was sufficient evidence to present this charge to the jury. Accordingly, the triad court abused its discretion in dismissing this charge against Mr. Kurts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">III. CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In Docket No. 258346, Ms. Derror was also charged with violating MCL 257.625(4) and MCL 257.625(5), which provide for an enhanced sentence for causing death or serious injury while driving impaired. These subsections provide, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">(4) A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (1), (3), or (8) and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes the death of another person is guilty of a crime ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">(5) A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (1), (3), or (8) and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes a serious impairment of a body function of another person is guilty of a felony... ,[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The prosecution contends that it need not prove a causal relationship between the presence of the controlled substance in Ms. Derror\u2019s body and the accident. As MCL 257.625(8) proscribes the operation of a motor vehicle with <em>any </em>amount of a controlled substance in the operator\u2019s body, the statute imposes strict liability. Therefore, the prosecution argues that it is not required to establish impairment causing an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The Michigan Supreme Court previously held in <em>People v </em>Lardie<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that the Legislature did not intend to impose strict liability on an individual who \u201cby the operation\u201d of his or her vehicle while under the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ence of alcohol \u201ccauses the death of anther person\u201d in violation of MCL 257.625(4).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>Lardie, </em>the defendant\u2019s voluntary and purposeful operation of the vehicle while under the influence must have been \u201ca substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The statute was \u201cdesigned to punish drivers when their <em>drunken </em>driving caused another\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court found that imposing a penalty on a driver when the fatal accident would have occurred regardless of that intoxication would fail to serve the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Michigan Supreme Court recently overruled this holding in the companion cases of <em>People v Schaefer </em>and <em>People v Large.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court found that, according to the plain language of the statute, \u201cit is the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle that must cause the victim\u2019s death, not the defendant\u2019s \u2018intoxication.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Although the defendant\u2019s intoxication is an element of the offense, \u201cit is not a component of the <em>causation </em>element of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, operating under the influence causing death is not a strict liability offense as suggested by the prosecution. In order to establish the causation element, the prosecution must prove that the defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle was both a factual and proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">The concept of factual causation is relatively straightforward. In determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>a factual cause of the result, one must ask, \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s conduct, would the result have occurred? If the result would not have occurred absent the defendant\u2019s conduct, then factual causation exists.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">To establish proximate causation, the prosecution must show that the victim\u2019s injury was a \u201c \u2018direct and natural result\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> However, an intervening cause may supersede the defendant\u2019s act \u201cas a legally significant causal factor\u201d and break the causal chain.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In order to supersede the defendant\u2019s act, the intervening cause must be \u201cforeseeable based on an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u201cWhile an act of God or the <em>gross </em>negligence or intentional misconduct by the victim or a third party will generally be considered a superseding cause, <em>ordinary </em>negligence by the victim or a third party will not be regarded as a superseding cause because ordinary negligence is reasonably foreseeable.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Although <em>Lardie, Schaefer, </em>and <em>Large </em>involve violations of MCL 257.625(4) alone, we see no reason to interpret the identical language of MCL 257.625(5) differently. Furthermore, there is no indication in the plain language of these subsections that the Legislature intended to treat violations of subsection (8) differently than violations of subsections (1) or (3). While the trial court properly determined the prosecution\u2019s burden at that time, we are bound to follow the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schaefer </em>and <em>Large.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ingly, the prosecution must establish that Ms. Derror\u2019s operation of her vehicle, rather than the presence of a controlled substance in her body, was both a factual and proximate cause of the death and serious injuries of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In <em>Derror, </em>we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the presence of carboxy THC may be evidence of a schedule 1 controlled substance in Ms. Derror\u2019s body at the time of the alleged violation. To the extent that the trial court required the prosecution to establish causation under MCL 257.625(4) and MCL 257.625(5) consistent with <em>Lardie, </em>we reverse the trial court\u2019s order in that case. In <em>Kurts, </em>we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that carboxy THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance. However, we reverse the court\u2019s dismissal of the charged violation of MCL 257.625(8) against Mr. Kurts based on its erroneous determination that the presence of this substance in his body was not evidence of the presence of a schedule 1 controlled substance in his body at the time of the alleged violation. We, therefore, remand both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\"> In Docket No. 258346, this Court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to file an interlocutory appeal and stayed the trial court proceedings. <em>People v Derror, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered October 21, 2004 (Docket No. 258346).
