J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ano\">The plaintiff appeals from a decision of the compensation review division affirming a January 5, 1990 finding and award by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. We affirm the decision of the compensation review division on all issues except the failure to award interest on the medical bills for which payment was ordered by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">On September 15,1979, the plaintiff and the defendant employer had a contract of employment. Their employment relationship was subject to the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 through 31-355a. The defendant employer insured its full compensation liability with the defendant insurer, Aetna Life and Casualty Company. On September 15, 1979, the plaintiff sustained an accidental injury to her left, nonmaster forearm, which injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. Following the accident, the plaintiff received workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>compensation payments until approximately sometime in December, 1982, at which time the payments were stopped by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The cessation of the workers\u2019 compensation payments in 1982 prompted formal hearings and argument before the commissioner that concluded in 1987 with a finding and award dated May 11, 1987. The central focus of those hearings and the 1987 decision was the interplay between the plaintiff\u2019s deteriorating mental status brought about by the 1979 injury and certain unrelated surgery performed on her in February, 1982. The plaintiff argued that her psychiatric disability was a direct and proximate result of her September, 1979 compensable injury. The defendants contended that they are not obligated to pay for any psychiatric treatment or total disability benefits after February, 1982, due to the intervening and unrelated surgery. In his 1987 finding and award, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiff is totally disabled due to posttraumatic stress disorder. The commissioner further found that, although the plaintiff developed a conversion hysteria disorder as a result of her 1979 compensable injury, this condition did not render her totally disabled. Rather, the commissioner concluded, \u201cthe basis for the claimant\u2019s total disability [the posttraumatic stress disorder] is the cervical surgery [an anterior cervical fusion at C4-C5 and excision of the C4-C5 disc] performed upon her by Dr. [Allen] Chamberlin on February 24, 1982,\u201d which surgery \u201cwas unrelated to her September 15,1979 left arm injury, and that such surgery was unjustified insofar as it may relate to said compensable left arm injury.\u201d The 1987 finding and award made the defendants liable for all psychiatric care for the plaintiff made necessary as a result of the conversion hysteria disorder, \u201cthe full extent of which is limited to such care as will restore her to the point where her mental status was prior to her cervical surgery on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>February 24, 1982.\u201d Accordingly, the finding and award did not provide for any additional temporary total disability benefits. The commissioner made no findings on the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for permanent partial (specific) benefits for the injury to her left arm, leaving the matter undecided. The commissioner also left undecided the issues of liability for outstanding medical bills, interest and attorney\u2019s fees, and the acceptance or denial of Form 36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The plaintiff attempted to obtain review of the commissioner\u2019s May 1987 finding and award. Her appeal to the compensation review division, however, was determined to be untimely. The review division did review the commissioner\u2019s denial of her timely filed request for modification and reopening, concluding that there was no basis to overrule the commissioner\u2019s action. The review division also granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel the defendants to comply with that portion of the commissioner\u2019s award that requires the defendants to provide psychiatric care to the plaintiff sufficient to restore her to her mental status before the 1982 cervical surgery. <em>See Imbrogno </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>5 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 99 (1988). No further appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Further formal hearings and argument before the commissioner took place in 1989. On January 5,1990, the commissioner issued a second finding and award which addressed the issue of the defendants\u2019 liability for the payment of various outstanding bills pertaining to medical and psychiatric treatment provided to the plaintiff by a number of medical providers between 1979 and 1988. The commissioner ordered the defendants to pay certain bills that were not disputed by them and to pay the undisputed portion of certain other bills. For the most part these bills were incurred prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>February 24,1982, with the exception of bills for ongoing psychiatric treatment. With regard to those bills that were totally contested by the defendants, the commissioner concluded that \u201cthe claimant has not sustained her burden of proof in showing that such bills were by authorized medical providers and/or being reasonable and necessary,\u201d and denied liability. The commissioner further ordered that the defendants pay a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee of $1000 to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel for their undue delay in the payment of the undisputed bills for which payment was ordered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No interest was awarded to the plaintiff arising out of the defendants\u2019 undue delay in the payment of the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The plaintiff appealed the 1990 finding and award to the compensation review division. On August 2, 1991, the review division concluded that the commissioner\u2019s factual conclusions regarding the disputed claims for payment of medical expenses were reasonable. The review division also concluded that the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the commissioner was a proper exercise of discretion and, therefore, affirmed the January 5, 1990 finding and award. See <em>Imbrogno </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>9 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 174 (1991). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the commissioner and the compensation review division did not properly analyze the underlying facts and the prior decisions in the case. She argues that she is entitled to disability payments and full payment for treatment for both the physical and psychiatric injuries. Specifically, she claims that (1) temporary total disability benefits should be paid by the defendants subsequent to the December, 1982 cutoff date, with permanent awards to follow when shown to be due, (2) bills for all medical treatment (except those for the unauthorized cervical fusion of February 24,1982) should be paid by the defendants, (3) attorney\u2019s fees for all work in this case by plaintiff\u2019s counsel should be paid by the defendants, and (4) interest should be paid on all of the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals is well settled. \u201cThe commissioner has the power and duty to determine the facts and his conclusions must stand unless incorrectly drawn from the subordinate facts, illegal or unreasonable. . . . The compensation review division must review the appeal on the record and must not retry facts.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Department of Administrative Services, </em>21 Conn. App. 464, 466, 573 A.2d 770, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 804, 577 A.2d 716 (1990). Affording the plaintiff\u2019s claims the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that the compensation review division properly affirmed the determination of the commissioner on all issues except the failure to award interest on the medical bills for which payment was ordered by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Temporary Total Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Although the issue of temporary total disability benefits is not discussed in the commissioner\u2019s 1990 finding and award, the commissioner addressed the subject of the claim for temporary total benefits during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>course of the formal hearings. He concluded that further contest of that issue by the plaintiff was precluded by his 1987 finding and award. See footnote 2, supra. We agree that the commissioner\u2019s 1987 decision, which became final in 1988, precluded further contest of the issue of temporary total benefits in the subsequent proceeding that is the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u201cThe adjudications and awards of compensation boards or commissions, as well as the judgments of courts, in proceedings for the recovery of compensation, are generally held to be conclusive upon the parties and their privies, as to the matters and issues involved or justiciable therein, so as to preclude, under the doctrine of res judicata, the relitigation thereof in subsequent proceedings.\u201d 82 Am. Jur. 2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 583, p. 304. In 1987, the commissioner determined that the plaintiffs disability was psychiatric in nature and was caused by the cervical surgery performed upon her on February 24,1982, which surgery was unrelated to her 1979 compensable injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, temporary total disability benefits were denied on the basis of an intervening event, unrelated to the compensable injury, which broke the chain of causation linked to the original, compensable injury. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>Dehron </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>122 Conn. 592, 191 A. 526 (1937); <em>Lemieux </em>v. <em>Highland Dairy Co., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 483, 185 A. 433 (1936); J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985), p. 45; 1 A. Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1985) \u00a7 13.11 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The plaintiff attempts to avoid the preclusive effect of the prior determination by arguing that, when the review division affirmed the 1987 decision of the commissioner in 1988, there remained several unresolved issues in the case, namely, her entitlement to specific benefits and her entitlement to payment of outstanding medical bills. In fact, in its 1988 opinion, the review division specifically noted that the commissioner \u201cleft undecided the other issues, i.e. permanent partial disability, attorney\u2019s fees and interest due to unreasonable contest, and acceptance or denial of Form 36.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The claimant asserts that because these issues remained to be decided, the denial of temporary benefits was not final for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiffs appeal to the compensation review division from the 1987 decision of the commissioner, and the review division\u2019s decision in 1988 pertained to the commissioner\u2019s decision that concluded that she was not entitled to ongoing temporary total disability benefits. Any further proceedings after the 1988 decision of the compensation review division would not alter the prior determination that the plaintiff\u2019s total psychiatric disability was causally related to a noncompensable event and that she was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits after February, 1982. Unlike in <em>Guinan </em>v. <em>Direct Marketing Assn., Inc., </em>22 Conn. App. 515, 578 A.2d 129 (1990), relied on by the plaintiff, the compensation review division did not remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings. Also, the issues involved in the additional proceedings before the commissioner in 1989 and the appeal therefrom to the review division in 1990 were conceptually distinct from those involved in the initial appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">This case is also unlike <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 594 A.2d 446 (1991). There, a prior decision of the compensation review division upholding a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner was not deemed to be a final judgment because additional hearings on the issue, which was the subject of the later appeal, were contemplated by the commissioner\u2019s original determination. Here, the upholding by the compensation review division of the denial by the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of temporary benefits was final for purposes of appeal because no further hearings on that subject were envisaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Accordingly, the plaintiffs failure to appeal from the 1988 decision of the compensation review division pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or to reserve her right to appeal from that decision pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4002<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> precludes her from now challenging the basis for the 1988 decision. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>210 Conn. 597, 606-607, 557 A.2d 506 (1989). \u201cAny decision of the compensation review division, in the absence of an appeal therefrom, shall become final after a period of twenty days has expired from the issuance of notice of the rendition of judgment or decision.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-301a.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Because the issue of the plaintiffs entitlement to temporary total disability benefits was finally and fully resolved in the prior proceedings in 1988, further contest of the issue was precluded in the subsequent proceedings in 1989 and 1990 that are the subject of this appeal. The compensation review division, therefore, properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s refusal to address the issue of the claim for temporary total benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Outstanding Medical Bills, Attorney\u2019s Fees and Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the compensation review division\u2019s review of the commissioner\u2019s decision regarding payment of medical bills, attorney\u2019s fees and interest was fundamentally flawed in that it rested on a misunderstanding of the 1987 findings and award. The review division\u2019s 1991 decision which is the subject of this appeal contains the following background discussion: \u201cThe May 11,1987 ruling concluded claimant developed a conversion hysteria due to her left arm injury, and she was granted payment for treatment of that condition until February 24, 1982. On that date, cervical surgery unrelated to the arm injury occurred. This caused worsening of claimant\u2019s medical state. <em>The May 11,1987 decision did not order payment for treatment of that condition after February 24, 1982.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that this last sentence refers to her psychiatric condition and is directly contrary to the conclusion reached by the commissioner in 1987.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We conclude that the challenged sentence is ambiguous. The \u201ccondition\u201d referred to therein could be either the further deteriorated and disabling psychiatric condition that resulted from the cervical surgery or the earlier conversion hysteria that was found to be causally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>related to the compensable injury. Only the latter condition was compensable. Because a public official is presumed to have performed his duty properly unless the contrary appears; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 242, 502 A.2d 410 (1985); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>22 Conn. App. 310, 314, 577 A.2d 297 (1990); we will interpret the sentence to exclude payment for treatment of only the former condition, and not the latter condition as is suggested by the plaintiff. Furthermore, the plaintiff has failed to show that the challenged sentence affected the compensation review division\u2019s review of the commissioner\u2019s decision or otherwise requires that we remand the matter to the review division for further consideration. See <em>Boulay </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>27 Conn. App. 483, 486-87, 607 A.2d 450 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The commissioner denied liability for various medical bills not because of the dates of treatment but because the plaintiff had not shown that the treatment involved was provided by authorized medical providers and was reasonable and necessary in light of her compensable injuries. This is a fact bound determination that we will not disturb on appeal. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Department of Administrative Services, </em>supra. The commissioner further limited the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees to those issues on which the plaintiff had prevailed. It is within the commissioner\u2019s discretion whether to award a fee and how much to award. See <em>Balkus </em>v. <em>Terry Steam Turbine Co., </em>167 Conn. 170, 179-80 n.8, 355 A.2d 227 (1974); <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 349, 334 A.2d 452 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">With regard to the issues of medical bills and attorney\u2019s fees, the plaintiff does little more than attack the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. The compensation review division properly reviewed the appeal on the record and did not retry the facts. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Department of Administrative Services, </em>supra. Our review of the record indicates that the review division properly con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>eluded that the commissioner made a reasonable finding and award regarding the medical bills and the attorney\u2019s fees based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim to interest on the medical bills that the commissioner ordered the defendants to pay presents a different matter, however. The commissioner determined that there had been an undue delay by the defendants in the payment of the undisputed bills and in the payments of the undisputed portions of other bills for which they were made liable. This was the basis of the commissioner\u2019s discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-300.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner failed to award interest on these amounts also after making a finding of delay due to the fault or neglect of the defendants sufficient to justify an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Cf. <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>22 Conn. App. 539, 542-44, 579 A.2d 98 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 219 Conn. 439, 594 A.2d 446 (1991). Because the commissioner found that there was a delay due to the fault or neglect of the defendants that warranted a discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees, an award of interest should also have been made. We read the words of \u00a7 31-300, \u201cmay include in his award interest .. . and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d to allow a discretionary award of both interest and attorney\u2019s fees or neither, but not to allow an award of one and not the other. Accordingly, we must remand the case for a further award of interest pursuant to \u00a7 31-300, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>on those medical bills for which the commissioner found payment by the defendants to have been unduly delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Permanent Partial (Specific) Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Both parties correctly recognize that the commissioner has yet to make any findings and award with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to permanent partial benefits, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-308, for the compensable injury to the plaintiffs left arm. Decision on that issue was specifically reserved in the 1987 findings and award. The subject was not addressed in the 1990 findings and award. Consequently, final administrative determination of claimant\u2019s entitlement to these benefits must await further proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The decision is reversed only as to the failure to award interest and the case is remanded to the compensation review division with direction to calculate the appropriate amount of interest due the plaintiff on the medical bills for which the commissioner found payment by the defendants to have been unduly delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\"> See footnote 4, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> In addition to the matter of outstanding medical bills and attorney\u2019s fees, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner addressed other issues orally during the course of the 1989 formal hearings. At the hearings, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner noted that his 1987 finding and award had determined that \u201c[t]he Aetna is not liable for the total disability. They are liable, rather, for the payment of reasonable psychiatric bills to, in effect, take care of [the plaintiff] the way she was prior to the [1982] surgery.\u201d The commissioner determined that his prior decision had resolved the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for temporary total disability benefits based on her psychological condition, precluding further contest of the issue. The commissioner also noted that the issue of any specific or permanent disability award for the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s left arm was not yet ripe for review as the plaintiff had not yet responded to the defendants\u2019 tender of a voluntary agreement for a 100 percent injury to the arm with a December, 1982 date of maximum medical improvement because the plaintiff had believed that the issue of temporary total benefits was still part of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> The relevant portions of the May 11, 1987 finding and award are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u201c6. The claimant is presently totally disabled due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, however both the claimant and the respondents attribute different reasons for her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u201c7. The claimant contends that her current psychiatric disability is a direct proximate cause of her compensable injury of September 15, 1979, that she has not yet reached maximum medical improvement, that she has outstanding medical bills in excess of $40,000.00 and that she will require ongoing future medical and psychiatric care as a result of said accident; and that she is entitled to all payments retroactive to the time they ceased being paid in late 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u201c8. The respondents claim that the claimant injured her left arm in 1979, and they paid benefits to the claimant in connection with said injury; that certain treatment rendered to the claimant was unrelated to the left arm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>injury of September 15, 1979, which treatment includes, inter alia, cervical surgery; that they are not responsible for any psychiatric treatment or total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u201c9.

It is found that the claimant developed a conversion hysteria as a result of said accident, but she was still able to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u201c11. As a result of the cervical surgery, the claimant\u2019s personality changed further, she continued to deteriorate, become sadder, do less work around the house than prior to said surgery, and ultimately was diagnosed as suffering from a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder by Dr. J.A. Camacho-Pantoja, a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u201c12.

It is further found that the cervical surgery performed upon the claimant was unrelated to her September 15,1979 left arm injury, and that such surgery was unjustified insofar as it may relate to said compensable left arm injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b142-12\"> Form 36 is a notice to the compensation commissioner and the claimant of the intention of the employer and its insurer to discontinue compensation payments.
