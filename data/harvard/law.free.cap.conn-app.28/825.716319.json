J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0q\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that (1) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the essential elements of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) by failing to instruct on the meaning of the statutory terms \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d and \u201cgrave risk of death,\u201d and (3) the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of a defense witness who was called to testify about the victim\u2019s alleged threats to kill the defendant. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The jury could reasonably have found certain facts. The defendant and the victim had an argument, during which the defendant threatened the victim with a fence picket, which ended the fight. Subsequently, the defendant drove off with some friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Later that evening, in the vicinity of the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s house, the defendant and the victim again got into an altercation. This time a gun was involved. Three to five gunshots were fired, one of which fatally wounded the victim. Shortly after the shots were fired, the defendant was seen with a gun in his possession coming from the area where the victim lay wounded. The defendant then fled and was apprehended four months later. There were no eyewitnesses to what actually occurred between the defendant and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The defendant\u2019s first two claims involve \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). He argues that \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) violates his due process rights because it is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to define, in its instructions to the jury, the terms \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d and \u201cgrave risk of death,\u201d which are used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The defendant concedes that he did not raise the claim of a due process violation at trial and, therefore, seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). He argues that the failure of the legislature to define the terms as used in the manslaughter statute fails to give him fair warning of the effect of the statute and fails to provide a sufficient guarantee against arbitrary enforcement. The defendant\u2019s failure to raise the constitutionality of a statute at trial, or to object to the instruction given,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in light of the facts that the jury could reasonably have found, leaves the record inadequate for a fair consideration of whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>218 Conn. 483, 485, 590 A.2d 434 (1991). In the absence of such a record, review is precluded. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury when it failed to define the terms \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d and \u201cgrave risk of death\u201d during its main instructions to the jury and, again, later when the jury specifically requested the definition of \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d during its deliberations. The defendant failed to preserve this claim properly. He, therefore, seeks our review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim must fail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because the record shows that a constitutional violation does not clearly exist and he was not clearly deprived of a fair trial. Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony is relevant to a resolution of this issue. He claimed that on the evening of the shooting, the victim came looking for him at his sister\u2019s apartment. The victim and the defendant struggled for a gun that the victim had brought with him. The defendant gained possession of the gun and then requested that the victim leave. The two men went outside and the victim refused to leave without his gun. The defendant turned to walk back into the apartment building and the victim ran toward the defendant. The defendant then turned and fired two shots at the ground near the victim\u2019s feet. The victim stopped. The defendant again turned to walk into the apartment and the victim again ran toward the defendant. The defendant turned and again fired two shots at the ground near the victim\u2019s feet. The victim stopped. The defendant turned for a third time to enter the apartment. The victim again approached the defendant. This time, however, the defendant lost his balance when he turned toward the victim, and the gun went off, fatally wounding the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">It has long been held that a \u201c \u2018charge should be read as a whole. . . . The whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jurors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>guiding them to a proper verdict . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 548, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990). Where supplemental instructions are given, as is the case here, they must be viewed together with the original instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toczko, </em>23 Conn. App. 502, 507, 582 A.2d 769 (1990). \u201cThe test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>217 Conn. 498, 501, 586 A.2d 610 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>27 Conn. App. 322, 326, 606 A.2d 30 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>176 Conn. 227, 405 A.2d 656 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 1248, 59 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1979), the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s failure to define the term \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d for the jury required a new trial. The court\u2019s instructions, which defined the term for the jury by stating that it meant more than \u201cmere carelessness\u201d or \u201cordinary recklessness\u201d and also charged the jury extensively on the meaning of \u201crecklessly,\u201d were upheld. Id., 236-37. Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>supra, 325-27, which involved similar statutory language found in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we recently determined that the trial court had not impermissibly diluted the meaning of \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d when it paraphrased the statutory term to mean \u201ca high degree of disinterest to human life\u201d where the trial court had adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>defined the term \u201crecklessly\u201d to the jury and had stressed the difference between ordinary recklessness and the type of reckless assault made criminal by \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). We concluded that the <em>Bunker </em>jury was properly guided to a correct verdict because the court\u2019s instructions \u201cgave the jury a clear understanding of the aggravated form of recklessness required to support a conviction under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).\u201d Id., 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Our review of the record in this case shows that the court instructed the jury on the statutory definition of \u201crecklessly.\u201d No definition of \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d is found in the penal code, title 53a of the General Statutes, and the court did not define the term. In carefully instructing the jury concerning the difference between manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, the court explained that \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) requires \u201cthe prosecution . . . to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the reckless conduct was under circumstances which evinced an extreme indifference to human life and that conduct by its very nature is conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the court further explained that under \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1), by contrast, \u201cthese two requirements are dropped. The state . . . merely has to prove that [the defendant] acted recklessly and that the death of [the victim] resulted from that reckless conduct.\u201d This instruction is entirely consistent with that approved by our Supreme Court in <em>Spates </em>and, we believe, \u201cgave the jury a clear understanding of the aggravated form of recklessness required to support a conviction under [\u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>supra; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>supra, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>In response to the jury\u2019s requests for a definition of \u201cextreme indifference to human life,\u201d the court stated that \u201c[t]here is no special definition. There is no legal definition that I can go to and say this is how the law defines it. It really is a question of fact as to whether or not there was extreme indifference to human life. The term in and of itself is the ordinary meaning of each of the words put together. For me to try to give you an illustration would be for me to attempt to find facts for you, and I can\u2019t do that because you are the factfinders.\u201d In this supplemental instruction, the court appropriately instructed the jury as to the lack of any specific definition of the term \u201cextreme indifference to human life,\u201d especially \u201cwhen the defendant has not shown that the phrase was used in anything other than its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>supra, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to define the term \u201cgrave risk of death.\u201d The defendant offers no analysis of this aspect of his claim nor has he suggested, in light of the evidence, that the phrase was used in anything other than its ordinary meaning. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Maresca, </em>173 Conn. 450, 460-61, 377 A.2d 1330 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>supra, 328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions, when viewed as a whole, reveal that the jury could not have been misled by the lack of a statutory definition. The jury reasonably could have found, even if it accepted the defendant\u2019s testimony as true, that the defendant\u2019s behavior evinced \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d and recklessly created \u201ca grave risk of death to another person.\u201d Repeatedly firing a loaded gun in the direction of another person, even at the ground, in a populated area exhibits behavior plainly within the intendment of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The court\u2019s instructions gave the jury \u201ca clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged and the proper guidance to determine if those elements were present.\u201d <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>v. <em>Avila, </em>166 Conn. 569, 574, 353 A.2d 776 (1974). The defendant cannot prevail on his claim because it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. A clear constitutional violation does not exist, and the defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly refused to admit certain testimony regarding the victim\u2019s threats to kill the defendant. The defendant attempted to present the testimony of Andrea Cunningham regarding certain threats made by the victim. Cunningham visited the victim at the hospital some time after the shooting and before his death. During one or more of those visits, the victim allegedly confirmed to Cunningham that he had intended to kill the defendant on the day of the incident. The state objected to this testimony on grounds of hearsay and relevance. The court refused to permit the challenged testimony because there were no indicia of reliability since the defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that the victim could not talk after the shooting and could only nod his head in response to statements made by Cunningham, and because the testimony was cumulative. On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence was relevant and corroborated testimony that the defendant\u2019s actions were in self-defense. The defendant asserts that the trial court should have admitted Cunningham\u2019s testimony (1) as a statement against penal interest, (2) as hearsay falling within the catchall exception to the hearsay rule, or (3) as non-hearsay testimony offered not for the truth of the matter asserted but only to show the effect that this information had on the defendant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Cunningham had already testified that the victim, prior to the shooting, had expressed to her his desire to kill the defendant. Additionally, the defendant himself had testified that the victim had directly communicated such an intention to him during their confrontation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>earlier in the day of the shooting. In his challenge to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, the defendant has the burden of proving the harmfulness of any alleged erroneous exclusion of evidence, when, as here, it does not involve a constitutional issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 624-25, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Murdick, </em>23 Conn. App. 692, 697, 583 A.2d 1318 (1991). Although the evidence was relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, it was cumulative. Evidence of the victim\u2019s alleged reiteration to Cunningham of his prior intention to kill the defendant would have been cumulative of other evidence to the same effect. Even if the evidence had been admissible, its exclusion, therefore, could not have been harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumble, </em>24 Conn. App. 57, 70, 585 A.2d 1245 (1991), cert. denied, 218 Conn. 902, 588 A.2d 1077 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\"> We note that not only did the defendant not object at trial to the instruction given regarding General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), but he affirmatively requested that the court instruct the jury as to this lesser included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\"> In <em>Bunker, </em>the crime in question was assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Like manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), assault in the first degree requires proof of reckless conduct that creates a grave risk of death to another person \u201cunder circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life.\u201d The only difference between \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) is that the former requires the conduct to cause the death of another person, whereas the latter requires the same type of conduct to cause serious physical injury to another person.

App. 322, 326-27, 606 A.2d 30 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
