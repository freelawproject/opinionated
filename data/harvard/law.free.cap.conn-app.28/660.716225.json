In its motion to strike, the defendant argued (1) that counts one, two, three, five and six failed to state claims on which relief can be granted \u201cin that the allegations fail to state a common law cause of action based upon alleged violations of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d (2) that count four failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted in that it \u201cimproperly claimed a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; based on alleged wrongful conduct of the defendant, as an employer, as to the plaintiff, an employee of the defendant, and failed to state that such alleged wrongful conduct was performed in the conduct of any \u2018trade or commerce\u2019 as defined in CUTPA,\u201d and (3) that counts seven and eight failed to state claims on which relief can be granted in that these counts allege a violation of CUTPA and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA); General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-60 (now \u00a7 38a-815 et seq.) \u201cbased upon alleged wrongful conduct of the defendant in its capacity as an \u2018insurer\u2019 in the context of a single workers\u2019 compensation claim, without alleging that said alleged wrongful conduct was performed by the defendant 'with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u2019 \u201d We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff, an employee of the defendant, a self-insured corporation, was injured in a work related accident. The plaintiff notified the defendant of her injury pursuant to the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31- 275 et seq., and the defendant, after initially contesting liability, accepted the plaintiff\u2019s claim as a compensable workers\u2019 compensation claim. During the course of the proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sioner for the seventh district, the defendant paid benefits to the plaintiff at various times and in various amounts for medical bills, temporary total disability and temporary partial disability. Despite having made these payments, the defendant continued to contest the extent of the plaintiffs permanent disability, her entitlement to benefits and certain medical bills as being unauthorized and unnecessary for her treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">On September 4, 1990, the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant seeking damages and injunctive relief for various common law and statutory causes of action based on the defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The essence of the plaintiff\u2019s eight count complaint was that the defendant wrongfully failed (1) to pay benefits in a timely manner, (2) to conduct a reasonable and timely investigation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and (3) to agree to a reasonable resolution of the plaintiffs claim within a reasonable time. In count one, the plaintiff sought damages for emotional distress. In count two, she alleged that the defendant acted recklessly and in bad faith by failing to pay her benefits timely and that the defendant \u201cwrongfully discharg[ed] the plaintiff and thereby violated] [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-290a.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In counts three and six, she claimed that the defendant\u2019s bad faith dealings constituted a tortious breach of contract. In counts four, seven and eight, she alleged that the defendant\u2019s bad faith refusal to pay benefits constituted CUTPA and CUIPA violations. In count five, she claimed that the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay benefits constituted a breach of its contractual obligation to deal in good faith. The defendant filed a motion to strike all eight counts of the complaint. The trial court granted the motion as to counts one, two, three, five and six because the facts alleged did not sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>support the plaintiffs claim that the defendant\u2019s conduct rose to a level of intentional misconduct, thereby constituting an exception to the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The trial court also struck counts four, seven and eight because count four failed to allege that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d and in counts seven and eight the plaintiff failed to allege that the defendant treated other claimants in a similar manner or that the defendant\u2019s conduct was performed \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 20, 1991, in which the following substantive changes were made: (1) an allegation that the plaintiffs injury \u201cwas the subject of a voluntary agreement as to workers\u2019 compensation executed by the parties and approved by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner for the Seventh District\u201d was added to paragraph three of the first count;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) an allegation that the defendant acted \u201cintentionally, recklessly and/or negligently\u201d was added to paragraphs eight, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen of the first count;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) an allegation that the defendant acted \u201cintentionally, recklessly and/or negligently\u201d was added to paragraphs eighteen and nineteen of the second count; and (4) an allegation that \u201cthe defendant Kimberly Clark Corporation has engaged in conduct as aforesaid before, after and during its processing the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d was added to paragraph twenty-four of the fourth count. The defendant filed a motion to strike all eight counts of the amended complaint. The trial court granted the motion as to counts four, seven and eight for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>reasons that it had struck these counts in the original complaint. It also granted the motion as to counts one, two, three, five and six on the ground that \u201c[tjhe new allegations contained in the plaintiffs substitute complaint are insufficient to support a cause of action based on common law tort since they allege no new facts, only legal conclusions.\u201d After the plaintiff failed to file a substituted complaint within fifteen days, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 157. The plaintiff then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Initially, we briefly outline our standard for reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike. It is well settled that \u201c[wjhere an appeal is taken from a judgment following the granting of a motion to strike, we take the facts to be those alleged in the amended complaint construed in a manner most favorable to the pleader. . . . For purposes of appeal, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82-83, 438 A.2d 6 (1980); <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 655, 509 A.2d 11 (1986); <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O'Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 530 n.2, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983). Although the motion to strike admits all facts well pleaded, it does not admit legal conclusions or the truth or accuracy of opinions stated in the pleadings. <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 545, 427 A.2d 822 (1980); <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Lafayette Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>4 Conn.

See General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the workers\u2019] compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u201d <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) an employer within the scope of the act is not liable in \u201cany action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his [or her] employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained . . . .\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In these five counts of the complaint, the plaintiff has attempted to allege facts that constitute grounds for avoiding the prohibition in General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) against suing employers for work related injuries. Both this court and our Supreme Court have \u201cconsistently held that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act operate as a total bar to actions brought by employees against their employers for job related injuries. See, e.g., <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 66, 546 A.2d 846 (1988); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 532, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>[supra, 98]; <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>[supra, 217].\u201d <em>Sgueglia </em>v. <em>Milne Construction Co., </em>212 Conn. 427, 433, 562 A.2d 505 (1989); <em>Coolick </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>7 Conn. App. 142, 148, 508 A.2d 46 (1986) . Our Supreme Court, however, has carved out a few exceptions to the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provisions. See, e.g., <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 34, 43, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987) (exception for a minor who has been illegally employed); <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 221 (exception for intentional torts committed by an employer). On the other hand, the Supreme Court refused to extend the <em>Jett </em>exception to include \u201c \u2018accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct of the employer short of genuine intentional injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 108, quoting 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) \u00a7 68.13, pp. 13-18; <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corporation, </em>208 Conn. 589, 599, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, the Supreme Court recognized that intentional torts committed by an employer constitute an exception to the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation remedy. As the trial court in the present case noted, these counts of the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>apparently were drafted in order to raise claims falling within that exception. The trial court ruled that the allegations of the complaint suffered from the shortcomings the Supreme Court recently deemed fatal to the common law action brought in <em>Mingadlos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 96. \u201cTo bypass the exclusivity of the act, the intentional or deliberate act or conduct alleged must have been designed to cause the injury that resulted. ... A wilful and malicious injury is one inflicted intentionally without just cause or excuse. It does not necessarily involve the ill will or malevolence shown in express malice. Nor is it sufficient to constitute such an injury that the act resulting in the injury was intentional in the sense that it was the voluntary action of the person involved. Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury must be intentional. A wilful or malicious injury is one caused by design. Wilfulness and malice alike import intent. . . . [Its] characteristic element is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances. The intentional injury aspect may be satisfied if the resultant bodily harm was the direct and natural consequence of the intended act.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>206 Conn. 495, 501, 538 A.2d 1031 (1988), quoting <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 102-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\u201c \u2018The word \u201cintent\u201d . . . denote[s] that the actor desires to cause [the] consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to follow from it.\u2019 1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 8A (1965). Thus, the concept of \u2018intent\u2019 in relation to tortious conduct has reference to the consequences of the act rather than to the act itself. \u2018But a high risk or probability of harm is not equivalent to the substantial certainty without which an actor cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results.\u2019 <em>Shearer </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Homestake Mining Co., </em>supra, 559. In terms of intentional tort then, the use of the word \u2018intent\u2019 in allegations \u2018is not a talisman that can change the allegations into colorable claims of true intentional torts.\u2019 <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Shell Chemical Co., </em>610 F.2d 328, 332 (5th Cir. 1980).\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The issue in this case is whether the factual allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint meet the test of <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 102. Counts one, two, three, five and six contain the following factual allegations relating to the defendant\u2019s alleged intentional misconduct. The defendant intentionally, recklessly or negligently failed to carry out its duties under the law to pay benefits in a timely manner as required under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, to investigate the plaintiff\u2019s claims timely and to agree to a reasonable resolution of the plaintiffs claims, knowing that the plaintiff would not be able to carry on life\u2019s activities, would have no sufficient source of income to meet her financial needs and that the plaintiff was relying on and anticipated receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. As a result of the defendant's misconduct, the plaintiff alleged that she was forced to suffer loss of income, various financial expenses, an exacerbation of her medical condition, emotional stress, and embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The mere use of the word intent does not change the allegations into colorable claims of true intentional torts. The allegations do not allege that the defendant desired to cause the consequences of its actions or that these consequences were substantially certain to follow. The complaint alleges no more than the fact that the defendant acted with the knowledge that the plaintiff would no longer be able to carry on life\u2019s activities, and that she was relying on and anticipated receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits to meet her financial needs. Because these allegations are insufficient to allege an intentional tort, the plaintiffs claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Counts Four, Seven and Eight</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The trial court also properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike counts four, seven and eight of the plaintiffs complaint. In count four, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, in its capacity as an employer, engaged in the conduct alleged in counts one through three inclusive \u201cbefore, after and during its processing the plaintiffs claim.\u201d In counts seven and eight the plaintiff alleged that the bad faith dealings of the defendant, in its capacity as an insurer, constituted violations of CUTPA and CUIPA. We agree with the trial court that these counts failed to state causes of action cognizable under Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">If the facts that the plaintiff alleges are insufficient to frame her causes of action, the plaintiff cannot prevail. Ivey, <em>Barnum &amp; O'Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>supra, 532. In order to allege a CUTPA violation properly, the plaintiff must allege, inter alia, that the acts complained of were performed in a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b; <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 354, 525 A.2d 57 (1987). In order to allege properly a CUIPA violation, the plaintiff must allege, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in the allegedly wrongful conduct \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-61 (6); <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 660. The plaintiffs complaint lacks these essential allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">COUNT FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The central allegations of the fourth count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, which incorporates the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>count in its entirety, is that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay benefits in a timely manner, to investigate reasonably and promptly the plaintiff's claim and to enter into a reasonable resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, constituted a CUTPA violation. We agree with the trial court that these allegations are insufficient to support a CUTPA cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The plaintiff does not allege that the defendant committed these acts \u201cin the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d The terms trade and commerce are defined in General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a (4) as \u201cthe advertising, the sale or rent or lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal, or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value in this state.\u201d The relationship in this case is not between a consumer and a commercial vendor, but rather between an employer and an employee. There is no allegation in the complaint that the defendant advertised, sold, leased or distributed any services or property to the plaintiff. The United States District Court in <em>Banerjee </em>v. <em>Robert, </em>641 F. Sup. 1093 (D. Conn. 1986), held that the employer-employee relationship does not fall within the definition of trade or commerce for the purposes of an action under CUTPA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Banerjee </em>court noted that \u201c[although an employer may engage employees for the purpose of promoting trade or commerce, the actual employment relationship is not itself trade or commerce for the purpose of CUTPA.\u201d Id., 1108, citing <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 13, 444 N.E.2d 1262 (1983) (construing similar Massachusetts statute); see also <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Gulf Oil Corporation, </em>605 F. Sup. 1519, 1523 (D. Conn. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Applying the holding of <em>Banerjee </em>to this case, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the fourth count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">COUNTS SEVEN AND EIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The central allegations of wrongdoing in the seventh and eighth counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are contained in the fifth count of the complaint which again alleges the failure of the defendant to pay benefits timely, to investigate the plaintiffs claim reasonably and promptly and to arrive at a reasonable resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s claim within a reasonable time. All of the defendant\u2019s misconduct was alleged to have occurred in the context of the plaintiff\u2019s single workers\u2019 compensation claim. The plaintiff did not allege that the defendant treated other claimants in a similar manner or that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cperformed with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-61 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, addressed the scope of the liability imposed by CUIPA and CUTPA on the insurance industry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court focused on the definition of \u201cunfair claims settlement practice\u201d in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-61 (6)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that the allegations, in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>an express allegation that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a \"general business practice,\u201d did not suffice to establish a violation of either CUIPA or CUTPA and that an allegation of a singular failure to investigate was insufficient. Id., 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Under the guidelines set forth in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, for a plaintiff to allege CUIPA and CUTPA violations successfully the plaintiff must allege more than a singular failure to settle a plaintiffs claim fairly. The plaintiff must allege that the defendant has committed the alleged wrongful acts with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice. Here, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is based wholly on the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to settle only the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim properly. She makes no allegations that the defendant has similarly failed to settle similar claims presented by other claimants properly and, accordingly, has failed to allege properly that the defendant has committed the alleged wrongful acts \"with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d Her claim, therefore, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In this opinion, Heiman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> Count two was incorporated, in its entirety, into counts three and four.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> This paragraph was incorporated by reference into each of the subsequent counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> Each of these new allegations was incorporated by reference into counts two, three and four of the amended complaint.

All rights and claims between employer and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment as aforesaid are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing therein shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional benefits from his employer for such injury or from enforcing such agreement for additional benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> We note that although the interpretation of our state statute by a federal court is not binding on us, it may be persuasive authority.

As to count two, however, the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike should be reversed because the complaint stated a cause of action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The majority opinion correctly sets forth our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s motion to strike. \u201c \u2018Where an appeal is taken from a judgment following the granting of a motion to strike, we take the facts to be those alleged in the amended complaint construed in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\u2019 \u201d <em>Biro </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>214 Conn. 1, 2, 570 A.2d 182 (1990), quoting <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). On appeal, \u201call well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted.\u201d <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>supra, 83. The motion to strike should be granted if the allegations in the complaint only allege legal conclusions unsupported by facts. <em>Mora </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>13 Conn. App. 208, 211, 535 A.2d 390 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Count two, although inartfully drafted, alleged that the defendant acted in bad faith by \u201cwrongfully discharging the plaintiff and thereby violating \u00a7 31-290a\u201d because she sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the defendant. Construing this allegation in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it was sufficient to state a statutory cause of action under \u00a7 31-290a.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 217, 520 A.2d 217 (1987), the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendants negligently misrepresented the facts to the plaintiff, caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ing her damages as pled\u2019 \u201d sufficiently stated a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. Id. Our Supreme Court noted that \u201c[although the complaint could have alleged the nature of the defendants\u2019 negligence more precisely, the lack of linguistic specificity does not warrant striking the second count. As the Appellate Court noted, under the rules of practice governing pleading, a party may plead legal effect as long as the pleading \u2018fairly [apprises] the adverse party of the state of facts which it intended to prove.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 109; see Practice Book \u00a7 108.\u201d Id., 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The allegations in count two of this case fairly apprised the defendant that the plaintiff intended to prove she was wrongfully discharged because she exercised her rights under the workers\u2019 compensation act. Therefore, the allegations in count two stated a cause of action under \u00a7 31-290a. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u201c(b) Any employee who is so discharged or discriminated against may either: (1) Bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district where the employer has its principal office for the reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and reestablishment of employee benefits to which he would have otherwise been entitled if he had not been discriminated against or discharged and any other damages caused by such discrimination or discharge.
