Johnson, was convicted, after a trial by jury, of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1) and of evading responsibility in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (b). On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion to dismiss, which claimed that a peace officer does not have probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor committed out of that officer\u2019s presence, (2) failed to permit him to testify regarding his personal history and background, (3) precluded the defendant from introducing evidence of events that allegedly occurred at the police station subsequent to his arrest and failed to conclude that the state\u2019s failure to furnish this evidence violated <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), (4) charged the jury that it could consider the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test in determining his guilt or innocence and that it was not necessary that the defendant know that the automobile collision he was involved in had caused damage to property, and (5) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also claims that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial because the trial court was biased against him. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 23,1990, Catherine Mangels was driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ing her car on Route 1 in Westbrook when it was struck by a car driven by the defendant. As a result of the collision, the cars became hooked together. Robert Pandora, who had been driving behind Mangels and had witnessed the collision, helped unhook the two cars. Pandora then drove Mangels\u2019 car into the parking lot of a nearby restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The defendant drove his car to the back of the restaurant lot. Pandora got out of Mangels\u2019 car, went to where the defendant had driven, and told him that a bystander had called the police. The defendant responded that he would not wait for the police, and then tried to leave the restaurant lot. The defendant was having trouble getting his car into gear, so Pandora reached into the defendant\u2019s car, turned off the ignition and removed the keys. Pandora went into the restaurant with the keys, and the defendant followed him in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve his keys. When the police arrived, Pandora was walking out of the front door of the restaurant with the defendant behind him. The defendant, upon seeing the police, retreated into the restaurant bathroom and locked himself in a bathroom stall.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Pandora led Trooper Michael Polansky of the state police to the bathroom the defendant had just entered. Polansky identified himself and asked the defendant to come out of the stall. After refusing several times, the defendant finally staggered out. The defendant smelled of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring his speech. Pandora identified the defendant as the operator of one of the cars involved in the collision. Polansky asked the defendant if he had been involved in the collision and the defendant replied that he had not. Polansky then asked the defendant to take a number of field sobriety tests. After the defendant refused to take the requested tests, Polansky arrested him without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>On the way out of the restaurant, the defendant acknowledged that he was the owner of one of the cars that had been involved in the collision. At the police station, Polansky asked the defendant to take a breathalyzer test. He refused. The jury subsequently convicted the defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, and of evading responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss. In his motion, the defendant claimed that a peace officer does not have probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor committed outside the presence of that officer. The defendant argues that General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which governs warrantless misdemeanor arrests and provides in pertinent part that peace officers \u201cshall arrest, without previous complaint and warrant, any person for any offense in their jurisdiction, when the person is taken or apprehended in the act or on the speedy information of others,\u201d expands the common law rule for misdemeanor arrests, which stated that a person could not be arrested for a misdemeanor committed outside the officer\u2019s presence. This expansion, the defendant claims, violates the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The state argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1976), which held that the fourth amendment imposes no warrant requirement for felony arrests occurring outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>home, also applies to warrantless misdemeanor arrests outside the home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The defendant correctly notes that the common law rule was that a person could not be arrested for a misdemeanor unless it was a breach of the peace committed in the presence of the arresting officer. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 5.1 (b), pp. 396-97. Connecticut enlarged this rule by statute to permit warrantless arrests \u201cfor any offense . . . on the speedy informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion of others.\u201d <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Conn. 279, 282, 161 A. 392 (1932). The defendant suggests that such \u201cenlargement may raise constitutional issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Although the defendant asserts this claim on both federal and state constitutional grounds, he does not provide any analysis of either the federal or state constitutional claims. Therefore, we consider his constitutional claims to be abandoned and therefore need not address them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 510 n.17, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly failed to permit the defendant to testify regarding his mother\u2019s name and where he lived for the first eighteen years of his life. We disagree. At trial, the state objected to the introduction of this evidence on the basis of relevance. In an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, the defendant argued that this information was relevant to his character. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection and the defendant properly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The rule regarding the admission of character evidence by a defendant is well established. The defendant may introduce only \u201csuch specific traits of his character as are involved in the crime or crimes as charged\u201d and not evidence of his \u201cgeneral good character.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>157 Conn. 99, 103-104, 249 A.2d 232 (1968). The evidence the defendant attempted to introduce bore no relation to the crimes charged. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly precluded the defendant from introducing this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly precluded him from introducing evidence concerning events that allegedly occurred subsequent to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>arrest, and that the state\u2019s failure to provide the defendant with this evidence violated the rule <em>o\u00ed Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 83. The defendant attempted to introduce photographs depicting injuries that he allegedly suffered during his postarrest detention at the hands of state troopers and testimony concerning a discussion he had with Polansky, five weeks after the arrest, about a videotape allegedly made of this incident. In an offer of proof, the defendant argued that he had a \u201cminor breakdown\u201d and was unable to remember the accident due to these injuries and that the injuries were relevant because they bore on whether he knew of his involvement in the accident, which is an element of the crime of evading responsibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that this purported injury lacked relevance because it occurred after the accident and could not have been the cause of his breakdown. We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">\u201cA trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on relevancy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>27 Conn. App. 654, 664, 610 A.2d 672 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 646, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). \u201cOne fact is relevant to another fact whenever according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 664-65; <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 8-9, 505 A.2d 658 (1986). \u201cAll that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 665; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Our review of the record indicates that this evidence does not render any other relevant fact either certain or more probable, and has no relationship to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>of evading responsibility. We also note that the defendant attempted to leave the scene of the accident when Pandora told him that a bystander had called the police, indicating that the defendant was aware of his involvement in the accident. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly precluded the defendant from introducing this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The defendant also claims that the state\u2019s failure to furnish this evidence prior to trial violated <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra. We disagree. In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Id., 87. Because we conclude that this evidence was neither relevant nor material, the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court improperly charged the jury that it was not necessary that the defendant knew that his accident caused damage to property to be guilty of evading responsibility, and that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test in determining his guilt or innocence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (b), evading responsibility, provides that \u201c[ejach person operating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes physical injury ... to any other person or injury or damage to property shall at once stop and render such assistance as may be needed and shall give his name, address and operator\u2019s license number and registration number to the person injured or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>owner of the injured or damaged property . . . .\u2019\u2019The defendant argues that to be guilty of the crime of evading responsibility, the operator of a vehicle must know of his involvement in an accident <em>and </em>that the accident caused damage to property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant claims that \u201cknowingly\u201d modifies both \u201cinvolved in an accident\u201d and \u201cdamage to property.\u201d The state argues that \u201cknowingly\u201d modifies only \u201cinvolved in an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">When a statute\u2019s meaning is ambiguous, \u201ccompelling principles of statutory construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). If there are two possible interpretations of a statute, we will adopt the more reasonable construction over one that is unreasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Uretek, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 706, 719, 543 A.2d 709 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Prior to 1957, the evading responsibility statute provided that \u201c[e]ach person operating a motor vehicle who knowingly causes injury, whether or not resulting in death, to any other person or injury or damage to property shall at once stop\u201d and render assistance. General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 239. In 1957, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>was amended to provide that \u201c[e]ach person operating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes injury ... or damage to property shall at once stop\u201d and render assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The effect of this statutory amendment has not been addressed by this court or our Supreme Court. The statutory change was, however, analyzed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Herbst, </em>2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 236, 197 A.2d 550 (1963). While we are not bound by that court\u2019s decision; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>9 Conn. App. 426, 430, 519 A.2d 612 (1987); we agree with its interpretation and adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In <em>Herbst, </em>the court, faced with a similar argument, noted the significance of the change in language between the 1949 statute \u2014 \u201cknowingly causes injury . . . or damage to property\u201d \u2014 and the 1957 statute\u2014 \u201cknowingly involved in an accident which causes . . . damage to property\u201d \u2014 and concluded that, aside from operation of the vehicle, \u201cthe prime element of the [crime] is being knowingly involved in an accident. . . . It is immaterial that the defendant [does] not know that he had caused damage to [property].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herbst, </em>supra, 238-39. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Interpreting the statute as the defendant suggests would result in the defendant\u2019s having the means to avoid responsibility simply by allowing him to say that although he knew there was an accident, he did not know that it caused damage to property. Such a result is not reasonable and would indeed thwart the purpose of the statute. We hold, therefore, that the only knowledge required is knowledge that there has been an accident. We reject the defendant\u2019s interpretation and conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements necessary to find a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The defendant next contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could consider the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test in determining his guilt or innocence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (f)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to such a test may be admissible if the refusal meets the procedural requirements set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b). The procedural requirements are that the defendant must be (1) apprised of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, (2) asked to submit to a blood, breath or urine test, (3) given a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney prior to the performance of the test, (4) informed that his operating privileges will be suspended if he refuses to submit to the test, and (5) informed that refusal to submit to the test shall be admissible and may be used against him in any subsequent criminal prosecution in accordance with \u00a7 14-227a (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Our review of the record indicates that the arresting officer fulfilled each of these requirements. First, Polansky testified that he read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a card carried by the state police to ensure compliance by arresting officers. Second, Polansky testified that he also read to the defendant from a card that listed the requirements of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b). The defendant refused to sign the card indicating that he understood these requirements, but Polansky noted the defendant\u2019s refusal on the card, and signed his name, which was witnessed by another officer who also testified at trial. Moreover, Polansky testified that he personally looked up and dialed the phone number of the defendant\u2019s attorney but was unable to contact him. Because the officer met the procedural requirements of \u00a7 14-227b (b), the trial court properly instructed the jury as to any inference that may be drawn from the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for a new trial must take into account the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided. Although our decisions have not been entirely consistent in delineating the appropriate standard for appellate review, we have most often characterized the action of the trial court as an exercise of its legal discretion and have accordingly confined our role to a determination of whether there has been an abuse of discretion. . . . Although we have occasionally taken a broader view . . . we now conclude that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 269-70, 604 A.2d 793 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Our review of the record indicates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court was biased against the defendant and that he was consequently denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166 [1941]; <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>145 Conn. 11, 19, 138 A.2d 512, cert. denied, 356 U.S. 969, 78 S. Ct. 1010, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1075 [1958]. In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is his responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 [1942]; <em>Quercia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. Ed. 1321 [1933].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>197 Conn. 413, 424D-25, 504 A.2d 1020 (1985). The defendant is entitled to a new trial only in situations where he can show that the trial court\u2019s actions resulted in prejudice to the defendant. Id., 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Our review of the record clearly indicates that the trial court was not biased against the defendant. The trial court was evenhanded in its evidentiary rulings. Furthermore, while the defendant lists eight instances in which he claims that the trial court was biased, he offers absolutely no indication of how this has prejudiced him. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> The defendant properly preserved these claims for appellate review by taking exceptions to the court\u2019s rulings and instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a) \u201cmakes no distinction between misdemeanors and felonies, but defines and prescribes the limitations upon peace officers in making arrests without a warrant \u2018for any offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Conn. 279, 282, 161 A.2d 392 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> The state notes that the federal courts that have examined the meaning of the fourth amendment have held that it imposes no warrant requirement for misdemeanor arrests occurring outside the officer\u2019s presence. See <em>Field </em>v. <em>South Houston, Texas, </em>922 F.2d 1183, 1189 (5th Cir. 1991) (public intoxication and public exposure); <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>902 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir. 1990) (vehicle tampering); <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Southbridge, </em>679 F. Sup. 131, 133 (D. Mass. 1988) (driving under the influence); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>586 F. Sup. 1235, 1237 (W.D. Mo. 1984) (violation of conservation laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">A number of state courts have come to the same conclusion. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burdo, </em>56 Mich. App. 48, 51, 223 N.W.2d 358 (1974) (driving under the influence); <em>Bucyrus </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>46 Ohio App. 3d 43, 45, 545 N.E.2d 1298 (1986) (driving under the influence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>763 P.2d 385, 387 (Okla. Crim. App. 1988) (assault and battery); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 117, 121, 390 S.E.2d 198 (1990) (statutory burglary and grand larceny).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The Connecticut Supreme Court has not addressed this issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>26 Conn. App. 481, 482 n.2, 602 A.2d 40, cert. granted, 221 Conn. 920, 608 A.2d 686 (1992). In <em>Santiago, </em>the defendant was arrested on the porch of his home, without a warrant and on the speedy information of others, for the misdemeanor of threatening, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62. The issue was whether the porch was part of the defendant\u2019s home, thereby precluding a warrantless arrest; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 104 S. Ct. 2091, 80 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1984); or not a part of his home, which would validate the arrest under the fourth amendment if supported by probable cause; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Because the court concluded that the porch was part of the defendant\u2019s house, the warrantless misdemeanor arrest was invalid under the fourth amendment. The court, therefore, did not reach the question of whether the warrantless arrest would have been upheld under General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a) had it been made in a public place. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 485-86 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> See part IV, section B, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> The defendant claims that Connecticut courts are divided on whether the state is required to prove that the defendant knew that the accident caused damage to property. The court in <em>State </em>v. <em>La Riviere, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 385, 389, 173 A.2d 900 (1963), found that four elements were necessary to prove the crime of evading responsibility: (1) damage by the vehicle to the property of another, (2) knowledge by the driver of such damage, (3) failure of the driver to give his name, operator\u2019s license number and registration to the owner of the property and to report such damage to the police, and (4) operation of the vehicle.
