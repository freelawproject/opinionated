On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly determined that he refused to submit to a chemical test or analysis when he requested that he first be allowed to telephone an attorney pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f) limits the issues in an administrative license suspension hearing to the following: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle. <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>204 Conn. 507, 511-12, 529 A.2d 177 (1987); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 6, 509 A.2d 489 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(1986); see also <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>26 Conn.

We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff refused to submit to the test was reasonably supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
