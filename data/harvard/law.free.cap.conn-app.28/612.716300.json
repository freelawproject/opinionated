The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury on a theory of criminality under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) for which there was no evidence, (2) defined serious physical injury in its definition of dangerous instrument, (3) excluded evidence of possible third party culpability, and (4) defined reasonable doubt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On January 7, 1989, Valerie Root was working at a package store in Windsor Locks. During the course of the afternoon, a man entered the store and approached Root as she was standing behind the cash register. The man pulled out a utility knife and said \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game; give me all the money or I\u2019ll cut you.\u201d Root gave him all the money in the cash register as well as additional money kept in a cigar box below the cash register. The man wanted more money, so Root removed her jewelry and gave it to him. After examining the jewelry, the man left it behind and exited the store. Root felt that the entire incident took about five minutes. There were no other people in the store at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Root reported the robbery to the police and gave a description of the perpetrator. She later viewed a series of photographs of possible suspects, and ultimately identified the defendant from a photograph as the person who committed the robbery. Root identified the defendant in court as the robber. The defendant testified that he was working near Boston on January 6, 1989, and returned home to Connecticut during the early evening hours. He further stated that he was taking care of his daughter on the day of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on a theory of criminality for which there was no evidence presented by the state. The defendant argues that the court allowed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d of a dangerous instrument as a basis for supporting a conviction of a violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3). He argues that this was improper because the evidence indicated that the perpetrator only threatened to use the knife and did not actually use it. The defendant asserts that the court could not instruct the jury on the use of a dangerous instrument as there was no evidence that the perpetrator used the utility knife. The defendant interprets \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) as providing two separate methods of committing the crime of robbery in the first degree. The defendant posits that a person cannot \u201cordinarily use a dangerous instrument and at the same time threaten to use a dangerous instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The court read \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) to the jury. The court noted that \u201cthe distinction between robbery and robbery in the first degree in the case before us is the threat to use a dangerous instrument.\u201d The court further stated that \u201c[i]f you find that no actual physical force was inflicted upon the victim but that the victim was threatened with physical force, you must also find to sustain a verdict of guilty that the defendant threatened the victim with immediate use of physical force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The defendant did not object to the court\u2019s charge. He seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We review this claim because it implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the charged crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 388, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Although the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 521 A.2d 150 (1987), to support his claim, his reliance on that case is misplaced. In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court instructed the jury on both subdivisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state conceded that it did not present any evidence to support a conviction based on subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53a-133. Because there was no evidence to support a conviction under the second statutory alternative, the judgment of conviction was reversed even though there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction under subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-133. Reversal of the conviction was required because a trial court cannot submit to the jury an issue on which there is no evidence to support a finding. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 364; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>28 Conn. App. 360, 365, 610 A.2d 1328 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Here, the state has not conceded that there was no evidence to support the finding that the defendant used a dangerous instrument. The defendant seems to argue that \u201cuse\u201d of a dangerous instrument requires that the instrument be used to harm the victim in order to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>come the victim\u2019s resistance. The defendant concedes that there was evidence to support a charge on the threat of use of a dangerous instrument under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The term \u201cuse\u201d is not defined in the Connecticut penal code. We conclude that once the defendant displayed the utility knife and ordered the victim to give him the money in the cash register, he used a dangerous instrument. The use of a dangerous instrument does not require evidence that the victim was actually touched or harmed by the instrument. In contrast, a threat to use a dangerous instrument also occurred in this case when the defendant threatened to cut the victim if she did not cooperate with him. Because there was evidence indicating that the defendant both used and threatened the use of a dangerous instrument, the trial court properly instructed the jury on both portions of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3). See <em>State v. John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 688-89, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to what constitutes a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for purposes of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3). The court first read the statutory definition of dangerous instrument and stated that \u201cserious physical injury imports a meaning of more than physical injury.\u201d The court then gave the statutory definition of physical injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The defendant argues that the trial court incorrectly defined \u201cserious physical injury\u201d because it did not read the statutory definition set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4). The defendant claims that the court\u2019s statement about serious physical injury constituted an affirmative misstatement of an essential element of robbery in the first degree. The defendant did not properly preserve this claim by taking exception to the trial court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to review of this claim under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, or under the plain error standard on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>17 Conn. App. 226, 551 A.2d 1264 (1988), cert. denied, 210 Conn. 810, 556 A.2d 609 (1989), <em>and State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Conn. App. 330, 523 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In <em>Huff, </em>the defendant sought to challenge for the first time on appeal the trial court\u2019s omission of the definition of serious physical injury as it related to the definition of dangerous instrument, an essential element of the crime of assault in the second degree. We declined to review the defendant\u2019s claim because \u201c \u2018[sjerious physical injury,\u2019 is not itself, however, an essential element of the crime charged. It is but a definitional component of an essential element. A court\u2019s failure to read the statutory definition of a phrase which itself appears as part of the definition of an essential element, is not an error of constitutional proportion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The defendant attempts to avoid this result by arguing that, in this case, the trial court misstated the meaning of serious physical injury, rather than merely omitting the definition of serious physical injury. The court did not give an incorrect definition of serious physical injury when it stated that it involves \u201cmore than physical injury.\u201d The court made clear that a seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ous physical injury is more than a physical injury. The court\u2019s failure to explain fully all of the definitional components of the essential element concerning a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The defendant has failed to establish the existence of a constitutional violation that clearly deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant also has failed to establish the existence of plain error from the court\u2019s instruction on dangerous instrument that resulted in manifest injustice. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of third party culpability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During his cross-examination of Detective John Murphy of the Windsor Locks police department, the defendant sought to present evidence about a robbery that occurred in Agawam, Massachusetts, on January 6, 1989. The Agawam robbery involved a suspect who had a similar physical description to that of the defendant. The Agawam suspect also employed a utility knife. The trial court refused to admit this evidence because the defendant failed to offer any evidence directly connecting any other person responsible for the Agawam robbery. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection and gave the defendant an exception. The trial court noted that it would allow further inquiry about the Agawam robbery if the defendant produced some evidence connecting the Agawam suspect to this robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The defendant also sought to offer evidence of a robbery that took place in Enfield, a town near Windsor Locks. According to the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>made outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the Enfield police brought the victim of the Enfield robbery to the defendant\u2019s arraignment. The victim in that case stated that the defendant was not the person who committed the Enfield robbery, which was committed in a manner similar to the Windsor Locks robbery. The defendant sought to develop this evidence through Officer Rick Rachele of the Windsor Locks police department. Defense counsel asked Rachele whether he remembered bringing the defendant to the Enfield courthouse for the defendant\u2019s arraignment. Rachele had no recollection of transporting the defendant to his arraignment. Defense counsel then stated: \u201cI can\u2019t get anywhere if in fact this witness doesn\u2019t remember arraigning my client in Enfield court because he would then have no recollection of whether or not [the] Enfield police department had brought the victim in that robbery to Enfield court to identify my client, so I think the issue is moot as a practical matter, Your Honor.\u201d The court noted that it would not admit any evidence about the other robberies until there was some evidence linking a person other than the defendant to them. The court found that evidence indicating that the defendant was not responsible for the Enfield robbery was irrelevant to the issues in this case. The defendant never attempted to offer evidence linking another person to the Windsor Locks robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Evidence indicating that a third party and not the defendant was responsible for the crime with which the defendant is charged is generally admissible. <em>State </em>v. Burge, 195 Conn. 232, 252, 487 A.2d 532 (1985). \u201cThe defendant, however, must show some evidence which directly connects a third party to the crime with which the defendant is charged. ... It is not enough to show that another had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the defendant is accused.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>203 Conn. 385, 392, 524 A.2d 1143 (1987). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevancy of third party inculpatory evidence will be reversed on appeal only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 117, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The defendant failed to offer any reliable evidence linking a third party to the commission of the Windsor Locks robbery. The fact that the victim of a similar robbery in a nearby town stated that the defendant was not responsible does not constitute reliable evidence that the defendant did not commit the Windsor Locks robbery. The defendant never offered any evidence linking another person to the robbery in Windsor Locks. The trial court\u2019s finding that evidence of the other robberies was irrelevant did not constitute an abuse of discretion or cause an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim concerns the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s references to the jurors\u2019 considering decisions in their own personal affairs when deciding on a verdict impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Again, the defendant did not raise this issue at trial by taking an exception to the trial court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt. He seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>26 Conn. App. 259, 271, 600 A.2d 1036 (1991), we refused to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instructions relating a reasonable doubt to the jurors\u2019 own affairs \u2018trivialized\u2019 the state\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d Id. This instruction did not constitute a constitutional violation. Id. Because the challenged instruction on reasonable doubt did not constitute a constitutional violation, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>refuse to review this claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 177-80, 571 A.2d 79, (1990). The instructions in the present case are almost identical to the instructions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 270. We conclude that <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, controls the disposition of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sion of the crime [of robbery, defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133] or of immediate flight therefrom, he . . .
