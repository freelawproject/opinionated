We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of March 21, 1990, the victim was involved in a craps game with the defendant and another individual, \u201cCat\u201d Bunkley, at the defendant\u2019s apartment in Hartford. The game ended at approximately 2 a.m. when the victim had won approximately $1100 from the defendant and Bunkley. At that time, there was a discussion between the defendant and the victim about the return of some money to the defendant, which he claimed the victim owed to him for a loan made approximately one year earlier. The victim refused to give the defendant any money, but stated that he would \u201csee what [he could] do.\u201d The victim then decided to return to his apartment, which was directly across the street, to count his winnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">On his way out of the apartment building, the victim stopped by the apartment of some friends, William and Kenneth Stewart, and told them about his winnings and asked them to escort him across the street to his apartment. The three left the Stewarts\u2019 apartment, and were accompanied across the street by the defendant and Bunkley. While they walked, one of the Stewarts heard the defendant ask the victim, \u201cDo you have anything for me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">When the group reached the victim\u2019s apartment, the victim and the Stewarts entered through a door that opened into the kitchen. They closed the door behind them, leaving the defendant and Bunkley in the hall. The victim began counting his cash when the defendant knocked on the door. When the victim opened the door, the defendant asked for money from the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>who advised the defendant to wait until he finished counting his winnings and then closed the door. The defendant then knocked on the door again. The victim opened the door a second time and told the defendant to wait, and when the victim tried to close the door again, the defendant stuck his foot in the threshold to prevent the victim from closing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">At this time, the victim moved toward one side of the kitchen to light a cigarette over the stove, which was near the doorway in which the defendant was then standing. As he did so, the defendant pulled out a pistol and shot the victim in the right shoulder. The defendant then left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the law applicable to his self-defense claim. Specifically, he claims that in instructing the jury on self-defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court improperly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>the \u201creasonable force\u201d to be evaluated by the jury \u201cis that force which <em>an average person of ordinary intelligence </em>in like circumstances would judge to be necessary to prevent injury and no more.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In other words, this portion of the charge given by the trial court instructed the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s use of force strictly on an objective basis. The defendant argues that this definition of reasonable force impermissibly replaced the subjective-objective standard required by \u00a7 53a-19 and, therefore, deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to have his jury properly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The defendant has not properly preserved this claim for appellate review. He seeks review, however, under the well established principles for reviewability of unpreserved constitutional claims as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 232, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because his fundamental right to present a defense includes a proper instruction on the elements of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, </em>24 Conn. App. 624, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>632-33, 591 A.2d 131, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 905, 593 A.2d 131 (1991). On the basis <em>of State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 462, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991), we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim because the court\u2019s instruction, although containing an incorrect statement of the law, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant challenged the following language of the trial court\u2019s instruction on self-defense: \u201c \u2018[Reasonable force\u2019 . . . \u2018is the amount of force that would be used by an average person of ordinary intelligence, acting under the same circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id., 463. As the state concedes in its brief, an instruction on self-defense that fails to instruct the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s use of force on a subjective-objective basis, such as the challenged instruction here and that given in <em>Williams, </em>is an incorrect statement of the law under \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 53a-19 requires that the jury evaluate, among other things, the perception of the danger that the defendant faced and his use of force in response to that perceived danger. \u201cWhere, as here, the improper instruction is of constitutional dimension, the test is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d Id., 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">As <em>Williams </em>points out, the defendant\u2019s perception of the danger he faced, and his use of force in response to that perceived danger, although two distinct legal concepts for purposes of analyzing the trial court\u2019s instructions, \u201care so inextricably intertwined that they cannot be analyzed in a vacuum, one separated from the other. The degree of force used by a defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>necessarily be evaluated in relationship to <em>something. </em>That something is the danger that was perceived by the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. The <em>Williams </em>court then considered the instructions given by the trial court regarding the perception of danger,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and determined that that part of the instruction \u201cenabled the jury properly to carry out its duty to examine the evidence both subjectively and objectively, while keeping in mind that the defendant\u2019s conduct must \u2018be judged ultimately against that of a reasonably prudent person.\u2019 \u201d Id., 466. The court concluded, therefore, that the improper instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">As previously stated, the challenged portion of the jury instruction here is nearly identical to that challenged in <em>Williams. </em>The trial court\u2019s instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s perception of danger is also nearly identical to that given in <em>Williams.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because we see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>no meaningful distinction between the facts of <em>Williams </em>and the facts of the present case, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled and that the improper instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The defendant suggests that the instruction given in his case is distinguishable from that given in <em>Williams </em>because he claims that the trial court also improperly instructed the jury regarding his duty to retreat. Section 53a-19 (b) provides that \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety (1) by retreating . . . .\u201d The trial court, however, instructed the jury that the defendant would not be justified in using force if he could have retreated \u201cwith safety.\u201d The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to include the word \u201ccomplete\u201d in this portion of its charge was improper, and thus, when combined with the other improper portion of the instruction, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. We disagree. Although the trial court\u2019s failure to include the express language of the statute in its charge to the jury may be improper; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 651, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 324-25, 507 A.2d 457 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>19 Conn. App. 48, 56-57, 562 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 804, 567 A.2d 834 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>(1989); it did not alter the substantive meaning of the statute in any way. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines safety as \u201cfreedom from exposure to danger.\u201d The term safety, therefore, necessarily entails complete safety and thus the absence of the word \u201ccomplete\u201d from the trial court\u2019s instructions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that a combination of improper interrelated rulings had the cumulative effect of depriving the defendant of a fair trial. He claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to admit into evidence the defendant\u2019s entire written police statement, (2) conducted an offer of proof on the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, (3) failed to direct a mistrial in the light of prosecutorial misconduct, (4) permitted the state to impeach the defendant with a prior inconsistent statement made during the offer of proof, (5) failed to admit into evidence his written police statement after the state impeached him, and (6) excluded surrebuttal evidence offered by the defendant relating to the prior inconsistent statement. Additional facts must first be set out in order to address these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, he gave a sworn written statement to the police regarding the incident in question. In it he stated that when he saw the victim move toward an open drawer, \u201cwith fear for my life I then defended myself.\u201d During the state\u2019s casein-chief, the state sought an advance ruling, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, regarding the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s police statement. The state indicated to the court that it did not intend to offer any part of the written statement into evidence, but it sought the ruling because it planned to call Detective Stanley Lukas, who took the defendant\u2019s statement at the police station, to testify that the defendant admitted carrying a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The defendant did not object to the request for an advance ruling. Rather, he merely argued that the pistol was inadmissible because the police had seized it during an allegedly improper warrantless arrest. The court determined that the statement was voluntarily given during a police interrogation, and Lukas then testified that the defendant told him that he carried the gun for his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">At the beginning of his case, the defendant called Lukas and attempted to introduce the defendant\u2019s entire written statement through him. The defendant argued that the statement was admissible as an admission and as a declaration against interest. The court refused to permit the introduction of the statement at this time and the defendant took exception to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The defendant then took the stand and testified as to his version of the chain of events leading up to the shooting. On direct examination, he testified that the victim was a drug and alcohol abuser and had a reputation for violence. The state objected to this testimony. It claimed that such testimony was not relevant unless the defendant presented a claim of self-defense. It requested that the defendant make an offer of proof regarding his possible self-defense claim, and the defendant did not object to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">During the offer of proof, which was outside of the presence of the jury, the defendant stated that he did not intentionally shoot the victim, but that the gun accidentally discharged when he pulled it out of his coat pocket. The state argued, still outside of the presence of the jury, that the defendant did not adequately present a self-defense claim through this offer because self-defense requires an intentional act, which the defendant had stated during his offer of proof did not occur. The court rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The jury was called back into the courtroom and the defendant continued his direct testimony. When asked about the shooting, the defendant testified that he aimed the pistol at the victim\u2019s shoulder and shot the victim to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">On cross-examination, the state questioned the defendant about his inconsistent versions of the incident. The defendant first acknowledged that he stated during his offer of proof that the shooting was accidental. The state then asked the defendant whether his decision to forgo an accident defense in his testimony to the jury was influenced by the state\u2019s argument during the offer of proof that a claim of accident precludes a claim of self-defense. The defendant denied that he heard the particular argument to which the state was referring. Upon further cross-examination, the defendant denied that he stated during the offer of proof that the gun went off accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">During the state\u2019s rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s case, the state moved to admit the portion of the transcript from the offer of proof where the defendant claimed that the shooting was accidental. The state sought to admit the transcript, not for the truth of the matter contained therein, but rather to impeach the defendant by contradicting the defendant\u2019s testimony before the jury in which he denied that he made the accident claim. The trial court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, admitted the transcript. The defendant then moved to present surrebuttal testimony of the defendant to clarify, contradict and explain the prior inconsistent statement. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, to which the defendant excepted. Then, during final argument, the prosecutor highlighted the inconsistency of the defendant\u2019s claims and suggested that the defendant changed his inconsistent defense to one of simply self-defense after he heard the prosecutor\u2019s argument during the offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to admit into evidence the defendant\u2019s entire written police statement after the state, in its case-in-chief, elicited from Lukas certain statements that the defendant made to him during interrogation. On appeal, the defendant claims that the statement should have been admitted in order to \u201celicit the context in which the admission was made . . . .\u201d Although the defendant excepted to the trial court\u2019s ruling, he failed to state on the record this reason for the statement\u2019s admission into evidence. At trial, he argued that the entire statement was admissible as an admission or as a declaration against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">\u201cIn raising claims of error on appeal, parties are limited to arguing the authority and grounds for objections that were presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 457, 442 A.2d 906 (1982).\u201d <em>In re Christopher G., </em>20 Conn. App. 101, 107, 564 A.2d 619 (1989), cert. denied, 213 Conn. 814, 569 A.2d 549 (1990). We are not bound to consider claims that are not distinctly raised at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Review of evidentiary rulings is limited to the specific legal ground raised on the objection. <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>17 Conn. App. 186, 192, 551 A.2d 421 (1988), cert. denied, 210 Conn. 810, 556 A.2d 610, cert. denied, 491 U.S. 906, 109 S. Ct. 3190, 105 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1989). Because the defendant does not raise the same claim of admissibility of the statement that he did at trial, we will not review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The defendant\u2019s second challenge is to the trial court\u2019s conducting an offer of proof on the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. He claims that it \u201cclearly deprived him of fair proceedings.\u201d This claim was not preserved at trial, but the defendant requests both <em>Golding </em>and plain error review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">We fail to see how this offer of proof deprived the defendant of a constitutional right. Because the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ant had not interposed a self-defense issue into the case at the time he sought to have character evidence of the victim admitted, an offer of proof was an appropriate method for ascertaining whether the defendant could properly make such a claim such that the trial court could conditionally admit the evidence at the time, subject to the defendant\u2019s connecting it to a self-defense claim later. The defendant has failed to satisfy both the second and third prongs of <em>Golding, </em>and thus is not entitled to review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The defendant\u2019s next claim appears to be one of prosecutorial misconduct. The defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that a defendant cannot legally assert inconsistent defenses. During the offer of proof on the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, the defendant stated that he did not intentionally shoot the victim, but that the gun went off accidentally when the defendant pulled it out of his jacket pocket.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>jury was still out, the state argued that this testimony would not inject the issue of self-defense into the case. It argued that because he testified that the gun went off accidentally, he cannot claim self-defense because self-defense requires an intentional act. Later, when the defendant presented self-defense testimony to the jury, the state attempted to impeach the defendant with the statement made at the offer of proof. Then, during its summation, the state highlighted the inconsistency in the defendant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The defendant did not preserve this claim, but argues that it is amenable to <em>Golding </em>review. We first note, however, that the state\u2019s initial argument regarding the inconsistent claims was made outside of the jury\u2019s presence during the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, and therefore did not harm the defendant in any way. When the prosecutor asked the defendant on cross-examination whether he changed his defense after he heard the prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding inconsistent defenses during the offer of proof, the trial court limited the questioning to whether the defendant had heard an argument concerning the law of inconsistent defenses. The prosecutor did not state that the law prohibits inconsistent defenses. Then, when the prosecutor commented on the inconsistent defenses during summation, he did not claim that the law prohibited them, but rather highlighted the defendant\u2019s retreat from his accident defense as bearing on his credibility. Although <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>189 Conn. 268, 273, 455 A.2d 342 (1983), permits a defendant to assert inconsistent defenses, it does not prohibit the state from exposing the defendant\u2019s inconsistent positions on cross-examination. Because the defendant has failed to demonstrate a pattern of misconduct repeated throughout the trial or that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was blatantly egregious, the defendant cannot prevail on his unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 509-10, 594 A.2d 906 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 536-37, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to impeach the defendant with statements he made under oath during the offer of proof. After the defendant testified on direct examination that he shot the victim in self-defense, the state, on cross-examination, asked the defendant whether he remembered saying during the offer of proof that the gun went off by accident. The defendant, at one point in his testimony, responded affirmatively to the state\u2019s questioning. The defendant argues that the impeachment was improper because the defendant admitted that he had made inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>trial court has wide discretion in allowing prior inconsistent statements to impeach the testimony of a witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>210 Conn. 631, 640, 556 A.2d 1013 (1989). Every reasonable presumption will be made in favor of the trial court\u2019s proper exercise of its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 47, 501 A.2d 752 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>21 Conn. App. 688, 703, 575 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 805, 577 A.2d 1063 (3990).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">\u201c Tt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimension, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). The question is whether the claimed erroneous action of the trial court is likely to have affected the result of the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 25, 505 A.2d 690 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>196 Conn. 115, 119, 491 A.2d 1067(1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrice, </em>20 Conn. App. 75, 91, 564 A.2d 330, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 809, 568 A.2d 794 (1989). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>defendant has failed to demonstrate to us how the admission of the prior inconsistent statement was harmful to him. Because of this failure, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The defendant also claims that once the prior inconsistent statement was elicited through the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, his entire written statement to the police should have been admitted to rehabilitate the defendant because in it the defendant had stated that he acted in self-defense. As the state points out and we concur, however, \u201cthe defendant ignores the fact that he never moved to admit the written statement following the state\u2019s admission of the transcript excerpt. In essence, he does no more than fault the court for not assuming the role of his advocate.\u201d Further discussion of this claim, therefore, is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that he should have been able to testify in surrebuttal after the state introduced into evidence certain portions of the transcript from the offer of proof. He claims that the trial court improperly precluded him from rehabilitating his credibility by explaining what he meant when he stated that the gun went off by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">\u201cThe trial court is vested with considerable discretion in the matter of rebuttal evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 123, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisella, </em>187 Conn. 335, 337, 445 A.2d 922 (1982). \u2018Ideally, rebuttal evidence is that which refutes the evidence [already] presented . . . rather than that which merely bolsters\u2019 one\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisella, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 139, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The state\u2019s rebuttal evidence was not new evidence. Rather, it was simply relevant portions of the transcript of the defendant\u2019s testimony during the offer of proof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>The defendant had already been cross-examined about these statements and, in fact, admitted the very inconsistency that the transcript contained regarding the accidental shooting. The defendant had ample opportunity to rehabilitate his credibility when he was previously examined on redirect. The trial court concluded that the defendant \u201ccould have explained [the inconsistency] this morning.\u201d In other words, the testimony that the defendant sought to provide on surrebuttal did not respond to anything new.

Because I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, misstating the law on self-defense in two critical respects, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">It is the law in Connecticut that, \u201c \u2018[i]f the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 707-708, 425 A.2d 108 (1979)]. \u201c[A] defendant is \u2018entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>435 F.2d 789, 792 (2d Cir. 1970), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>237 F.2d 466, 474 n.8 (2d Cir. 1956).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alfonso-Perez, </em>535 F.2d 1362, 1365 (2d Cir. 1976). <em>\u201cA </em>fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>[199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986)]. When the legislature has created a legally recognized defense, the defendant is entitled to a proper jury instruction on the elements of that defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has sustained its burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 660-61.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 597-98, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 660-61, our Supreme Court stated that this fundamental constitutional right to establish a defense includes properjury instructions on the elements of self-defense \u201cso that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In this case the trial court twice incorrectly instructed the jury that it was to evaluate reasonable force under a strictly objective standard, that reasonable force is \u201cthat force which an average person of ordinary intelligence in like circumstances would judge to be necessary to prevent injury and no more.\u201d The majority concedes that this is an incorrect statement of law; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 586, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); but concludes that the incorrect instruction on reasonable force was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>the light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In <em>Williams, </em>an instruction identical to the one at issue here was found to be improper. Id., 464. In that case, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. Id., 457. In addition to self-defense, the jury had to decide the effect of intoxication on the defendant\u2019s intent, as well as whether he was influenced by extreme emotional disturbance. Id., 458-60. This court found that the \u201caverage person of ordinary intelligence\u201d instruction was clearly improper, but that within the context of that case the improper instruction was harmless error. Id., 464-66. In the present case, where self-defense was the only contested issue, the error <em>is </em>harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The law is clear that a jury is not to use a purely objective standard in evaluating self-defense. Indeed, the statute focuses on the person claiming self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). \u201cThe starting point of the jury\u2019s inquiry into whether \u2018reasonable force\u2019 was used by a defendant is whether the defendant believed that deadly force was necessary to repel the attack. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>[194 Conn. 376, 389 n.13, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984)].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The defendant\u2019s beliefs were central to his claim that he acted in self-defense. Both he and his fiancee testified that the victim was known to be arroed and had a reputation for violence. The victim was a convicted felon, drug user, drinker, and gambler. Of paramount importance was that the victim had been armed with a gun and threatened the defendant in the past, and that the defendant believed him to be a bully and was afraid of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Additional evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s reasonable beliefs under the circumstances was that he had been robbed at gunpoint at Stowe Village, and another time his home was broken into and he personally encountered the intruder. He testified to his belief that the Stowe Village housing project, where the incident occurred, was a high crime area, especially at night, and to his belief that there were fewer police officers there at night, which is when the incident occurred. These factors were all highly relevant to how much force <em>he </em>believed to be necessary under the circumstances. This accumulated evidence was relevant not to what the average person would have believed, but to what <em>the defendant </em>reasonably believed. He was entitled to a jury that was properly instructed on how to evaluate <em>his </em>reasonable beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The \u201cConnecticut test for the degree of force in self-defense is a subjective-objective one. The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. [General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a)] requires, however, that the defendant\u2019s belief ultimately must be found to be reasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 464. Only after the jury has focused on the situation from the defendant\u2019s perspective, may it decide whether his belief was reasonable. \u201c \u2018This statutory emphasis on the defendant . . . demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of the self-defense claim.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. The jury must evaluate the danger a defendant claims to have faced, and the reasonableness of his response to that danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Another difference between this case and <em>Williams </em>is that the trial court\u2019s instruction in <em>Williams </em>was incorrect only as to the reasonable force portion of the self-defense instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>462-63. In this case, the self-defense instruction incorrectly defined <em>both </em>reasonable force <em>and </em>the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that before using deadly physical force the defendant had a duty to retreat if he could have done so with safety. Section \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (1), however, provides that a person need only retreat if he can do so \u201cwith complete safety.\u201d In reaching its conclusion that the incorrect instruction on the duty to retreat was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the majority decided that the word safety necessarily encompassed \u201ccomplete safety.\u201d Such a conclusion is not in accord with our well established rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, we assume that the words themselves express the legislature\u2019s intent and there is no need to look further for interpretive guidance. . . . Similarly, we presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>27 Conn. App. 412, 420, 606 A.2d 725, cert. granted on other grounds, 222 Conn. 911, 608 A.2d 694 (1992). \u201cOur conclusion is also supported by the principle that \u2018 \u201c[n]o word in a statute should be treated as superfluous, void or insignificant</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Complete safety is a higher standard than mere safety, and the language of the statute calls for that standard to be applied. If the majority\u2019s conclusion is correct, however, the word complete serves no meaningful purpose in the statute and is nothing more than mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>The defendant testified at trial that he did not have time to retreat, and that he believed had he done so he would have been shot in the back. The defendant was entitled to a correct charge on his duty to retreat\u2019 with complete safety, as it was a pivotal question in the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. A commonsense reading of the statutory language indicates that the legislature intended that the state must meet the higher burden of showing that the defendant could have retreated with complete safety, not with mere safety. I would find the omission of the word complete to be harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Self-defense was the only defense presented by the defendant in this case. Because the charge on self-defense was patently incorrect in two critical respects, I cannot agree that the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
