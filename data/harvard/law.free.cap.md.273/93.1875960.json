The County\u2019s zoning hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>examiner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after conducting a hearing at which no protestants appeared, recommended that the requested rezoning be granted. The rezoning failed of passage by the district council by four negative and three affirmative votes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> four members being absent, and remained dormant for 90 days after it had first been considered, with the consequence that under Prince George\u2019s County, Md., Code of Ordinances and Resolutions \u00a7 30.4 (1967), the inaction became the equivalent of a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Northampton, alleging in essence that the district council\u2019s failure to act on the case was arbitrary and capricious, entered an appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, which affirmed. Northampton then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which vacated the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. We granted certiorari for the reason that we perceived that the decision of the Court of Special Appeals might well be at variance with the holding of this Court in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Maryland-Nat'l Cap., </em>269 Md. 202, 306 A. 2d 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U. S. 1068 (1973) (the Charter Case), which has been followed in <em>Biggs v. Maryland-Nat'l Cap. P. </em>&amp; <em>P. Comm\u2019n, </em>269 Md. 352, 354, 306 A. 2d 220, 222 (1973) and <em>Logan v. Town of Somerset, </em>271 Md. 42, 55, 314 A. 2d 436, 443 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In the Charter Case, <em>supra, </em>269 Md. at 223-25, we held that Chapter 780 of the Laws of 1959, as amended, Prince George\u2019s County, Md., Code of Public Local Laws \u00a7\u00a7 59-61 through 59-105 (1963) (the Regional District Act), was a public general law, and as a result could not be amended or superseded by the Prince George\u2019s County Charter which had been adopted by the voters on 3 November 1970, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>became effective on 8 February 1971. In furtherance of this holding, we said that any provision of the Charter relating to planning or zoning which is at variance with the Regional District Act is inoperative in that portion of the County which lies within the regional district, because the grant of zoning and planning powers to chartered counties by the Express Powers Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 25A, enacted in pursuance of Md. Const. Art. XI-A (the Home Rule Amendment), is made specifically inapplicable to the Maryland-Washington Regional District by \u00a7 2 of Chapter 614 of the Laws of 1959, now Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (X). As a consequence, in that portion of the County which lies in the regional district, the County council\u2019s zoning and planning powers are those granted by the Regional District Act and not those granted by the Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As Judge Barnes, for the Court, noted in the Charter Case, <em>supra, </em>269 Md. at 226:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cThus, the Charter, adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Express Powers Act and Article XI-A of the Constitution of Maryland, is not \u2018applicable\u2019 to the provisions of Chapter 780. This does not mean that the provisions of the Charter are invalid or illegal. They are effective in those portions, if any, of Prince George\u2019s County not included in the Regional District. The County\u2019s remedy in this regard is not with the Courts, but with the General Assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The Court of Special Appeals seems to have found persuasive the notion that after Chapter 898 of the Laws of 1965 had added new \u00a7\u00a7 59-102 through 59-105 to the Regional District Act, when Chapter 426 of the Laws of 1966 made it clear that these sections were applicable only to Prince George\u2019s County, these provisions took on the character of a public local law, and as such were impliedly repealed by Article XI, \u00a7 1102 of the Charter <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>adoption because they were in conflict with Article VII of the Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It seems to us that this (i) misreads our opinion in the Charter Case, <em>supra, </em>which contains a flat holding that the Regional District Act is a public general law because it is applicable to more than one county; (ii) overlooks the specific denial of zoning and planning powers contained in Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (X), and (iii) ignores the fact that Chapter 426 of the Laws of 1966, while applicable only to Prince George\u2019s County in \u00a7 59-102 to \u00a7 59-105, nevertheless was an amendment to the Regional District Act, which was and is a public general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Again, quoting from the opinion in the Charter Case, <em>supra, </em>269 Md. at 230:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cHere again, the County confuses local functions and responsibilities with local laws. Chapter 780, a public general law, does provide for <em>local functions </em>and does impose <em>local responsibilities; </em>but, as we have already indicated, such provisions do not change Chapter 780 from a <em>public general law </em>to a <em>public local law, </em>and make the Planning Boards subject to the Charter and local regulations. Chapter 780 is by no means unique in its application of a public general law to local situations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">A result of the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals was the determination that the procedure before the district council was controlled by Article VII, \u00a7 707 (a) of the County\u2019s Charter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cThe final decision of the Council in any zoning case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>shall be based solely upon record evidence, and shall be supported by specific written findings of basic facts and conclusions of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">This led to the decision to remand the case to the circuit court for the formulation of such findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Under our view of the case, the proper procedure was that mandated by \u00a7 59-104 of the Regional District Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cIn Prince George\u2019s County, no application for a map amendment or special exception, <em>which is contested, </em>shall be granted or denied except upon written findings of basic facts and written conclusions.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The trial court, which concluded that the latter provision was applicable to the case, noted that there was no opposition to Northampton\u2019s request at the hearing before the zoning hearing examiner. A letter from Mrs. Lem Woo had been received and placed in the file, but Mrs. Woo did not appear at the hearing. The hearing examiner regarded the letter as a \u201cposition letter,\u201d however, in preparing his report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The trial court seemingly viewed this as an uncontested case \u2014 because Mrs. Woo, by failing to appear at the hearing, could not be cross-examined, <em>see </em>Prince George\u2019s County, Md., Code of Public Local Laws \u00a7 59-103 (1963) and <em>Birckhead v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>260 Md. 594, 599, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>273 A. 2d 133, 136 (1971), and <em>compare Hertelendy v. Montgomery County, </em>245 Md. 554, 567-68, 226 A. 2d 672, 680 (1967) <em>with Bryniarski v. Montgomery County, </em>247 Md. 137, 148, 230 A. 2d 289, 296-97 (1967). A more compelling reason why this might not be a contested case is the implication in the County\u2019s zoning ordinance that only a party present at the original hearing may contest a recommendation before the district council. <em>See </em>Prince George\u2019s County, Md., Code of Ordinances and Resolutions \u00a7 30.41 A (b) (1967); <em>Wagner v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>263 Md. 560, 566-68, 284 A. 2d 5, 8-9 (1971) (dealing with a special exception under Ordinances and Resolutions \u00a7 28.16 A (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">While Mrs. Woo did not attend the original hearing, there is an intimation that she may have been present at the first council hearing on 13 December 1972, of which she had received notice, advising her that oral argument would be permitted, but that no additional testimony would be taken. Even assuming that the case was contested, it is apparent, as both Northampton and the County concede in their briefs, and as the Court of Special Appeals held, that there was neither a granting nor a denial by the district court of the requested rezoning because the thrust of \u00a7 30.4 of the County\u2019s Ordinances and Resolutions, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cDeferred applications, upon which no decision is rendered within ninety (90) days of the date of deferral, shall be considered denied.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">meant that there was an automatic denial by operation of law, on 13 March 1973, when 90 days had passed from 13 December 1972, the date of the meeting when action was first deferred by the district council.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is interesting to note that throughout, the council followed the procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>delineated by the County\u2019s zoning ordinance, which had been enacted in pursuance of the Regional District Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\">When an appeal is taken in a case like this, the function of the circuit court is a limited one: it reviews the entire record to determine whether the action of the district council was unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, <em>Montgomery County v. National Cap. Realty, </em>267 Md. 364, 376, 297 A. 2d 675, 682 (1972); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Ziegler, </em>244 Md. 224, 228-29, 223 A. 2d 255, 257 (1966); <em>Hedin v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>209 Md. 224, 233, 120 A. 2d 663, 667 (1956); <em>Offutt v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>204 Md. 551, 562, 105 A. 2d 219, 224 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Judge Parker made such a review and determined that there was competent, material and substantial evidence which would have justified the council\u2019s inaction. An aerial photograph in the record showed Northampton\u2019s property to be bisected by the only entrance road to the sizable Ritchie Elementary School. In his report, the hearing examiner had noted that the school was not \u201copposed\u201d to the rezoning which had been applied for. An examination of the memorandum from the Office of Population Analysis, Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools shows that the response was by no means so unequivocal: \u201cThere is no objection to the rezoning of this parcel of land to the 1-1 category as long as the ultimate use of this land is not detrimental to the safety, educational and administrative function of Ritchie Elementary School.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The same photograph showed that a large' area surrounding the tracts appeared to be devoted to agricultural use, except for an extensive residential development nearby. There was no hard evidence of a change in the character of the neighborhood, or of a mistake in original zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Only if the lower court had determined that the action of the council found no support in the facts and that it was unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious and not in accordance with law, could the case have been remanded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>reconsideration, <em>Cohen v. Willett, </em>269 Md. 194, 196-97, 304 A. 2d 824, 825 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">For the Court of Special Appeals to remand the case to the circuit court for a formulation of findings of fact and conclusions of law is at variance with the rule of our cases that it is not the function of the reviewing court to zone or rezone, or to substitute its judgment for that of the zoning authority if the action of the zoning authority is based on substantial evidence and the issue is thus fairly debatable, <em>Montgomery County v. Pleasants, </em>266 Md. 462, 465-66, 295 A. 2d 216, 217-18 (1972); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v, Meininger, </em>264 Md. 148, 153-54, 285 A. 2d 649, 652 (1972); <em>Kirkman v. Montgomery County Council, </em>251 Md. 273, 276, 247 A. 2d 255, 257 (1968); <em>Bosley v. Hospital for Consumptives, </em>246 Md. 197, 204, 227 A. 2d 746, 750 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, the result which was reached was that mandated by law: that an application not granted within 90 days would be regarded as having been denied. No findings of fact or conclusions of law by the district council were required, either because the case was not contested or because the application failed of passage as a consequence of inaction by the council. The only issue before Judge Parker was whether a proper application of the law to the facts before the council produced a result which was neither unreasonable, arbitrary nor capricious. He was satisfied that the facts supported the result, and we see no reason to disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>Judgment of Court of Special Appeals reversed; case remanded to that court with direction that Order of Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County he affirm,ed; each party to pay its own costs in this Court and in the Court of Special Appeals.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">.
