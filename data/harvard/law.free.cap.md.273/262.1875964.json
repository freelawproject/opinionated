J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2X\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The appellant was arrested by a security guard at a Montgomery Ward Department Store in Wheaton, Montgomery County, Maryland on March 21, 1973, and later charged with committing an unnatural and perverted sexual act in violation of Maryland Code (1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 554. On July 19, 1973, the State entered a nolle prosequi in. the case, thereby terminating all criminal proceedings-against the appellant. On August 27, 1973, the appellant filed a \u201cPetition to Expunge Arrest Records\u201d in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, in equity, naming Montgomery County and State and County law enforcement officers as defendants. Appellant alleged in the petition that the criminal charges filed against him were \u201cunfounded\u201d and had been dismissed \u201cafter a complete explanation\u201d of the circumstances; that appellant had no criminal record \u201csave this erroneously placed charge\u201d; that appellant was employed in a position of trust and confidence at Georgetown University Law Center; that because of his criminal arrest record, he will be irreparably damaged \u201cin that his opportunities for future employment will be adversely affected, and his constitutional right to privacy infringed upon\u201d; that a suit for money damages could not compensate him \u201cfor the damage he has suffered and will continue to suffer in the future and cannot correct the harm done . . .\u201d; and that his criminal arrest record \u201ccreates a permanent scar on . . . [his] totally exemplary, hardworking and law-abiding mode of living in the community.\u201d The petition contained a prayer for the following equitable relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">(1) An order restraining further dissemination of appellant\u2019s criminal arrest records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">(2) The return to him of all such original records and copies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(3) An accounting in writing for all copies not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>returned and securing of these copies for return to appellant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">(4) Removal of all references to appellant in any computer data banks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">(5) Notification to the court of all recipients of computer information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">(6) The placing of certain explanations of the circumstances of the case in court files;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">(7) An order directing the defendants to seek return or removal of materials relating to appellant from FBI files and,computer data banks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">(8) A certification by defendants of compliance with the court\u2019s order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">(9) Any other additional relief the court deemed just and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The defendants Brown, Watkins,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Montgomery County demurred to the petition, claiming that it contained insufficient facts to state a cause of action against them; that a suit for false arrest and malicious prosecution provided appellant with an adequate legal remedy; that absent statutory authority the court was without power to order expungement of arrest records; that appellant did not allege any facts to establish that the arrest and subsequent identification process were improper or invalid; and that the expungement and destruction of validly made arrest records was contrary to public policy and to the need for accurate information of criminal activity regardless of the ultimate disposition of the prosecution. Defendants Kavanaugh and Burch,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a motion raising preliminary objection (Maryland Rule 323), urged the court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition; they claimed that the only statutory authority for expungement of arrest records is contained in \u00a7 292 of Article 27; that it is limited in application to certain cases involving controlled dangerous substances, and that in the absence of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>statute making it compulsory for the police to expunge or return records of an arrested person upon his release without being tried or convicted, a bill in equity to compel such action would not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In a brief order granting both the demurrer (without leave to amend) and the motion raising preliminary objection, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cIt is apparent that the legislature intended to grant the Courts authority to expunge arrest records in one specific instance, to-wit, drug abusers who are first offenders, <em>(Article 27, Section 292, Annotated Code of Maryland). </em>While the powers of an Equity Court are quite general, an Equity Court may not create a right where none exists. Accordingly, the relief sought <em>by </em>the plaintiff must, at this juncture, be denied. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">From this order, appellant filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Because it was of importance that the question presented be promptly decided, we granted certiorari on our own motion prior to argument and decision in the Court of Special Appeals. See Maryland Code (1974) Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Appellant argues on appeal, as he did below, that an equity court in Maryland is empowered to order expungement or limit dissemination of criminal arrest records in instances where there is no evidence of any kind that the arrested person committed any criminal offense. He maintains that the factual averments of his petition show an invasion of his constitutional right to privacy \u2014 a right recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U. S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). He asserts that as a person acquitted of criminal conduct, the continuing inclusion of his name among the defendants\u2019 criminal arrest records, in violation of his constitutional right to privacy, causes him irreparable injury, which cannot be compensated by money damages, and that because an equity court will not suffer a wrong without a remedy, the lower court erred in concluding that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The appellant contends that the magnitude and effect of the wrong perpetrated against him is substantial; that present day technology and modern police investigatory procedures have combined to produce a situation in which the arrested individual has a criminal record on file in at least one or more law enforcement centers; that it is widely known that local and state law enforcement agencies forward their data pertaining to arrests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that the number of people affected by these practices is staggering; that there is incalculable economic and personal harm to an individual that results if his arrest becomes known to employers, credit agencies or even neighbors; and that notwithstanding the absence of a conviction, the mere record of arrest often works as a serious impediment and basis of discrimination in the search for employment, in securing professional, occupational or other licenses, and in subsequent relations with the police and the courts. Appellant asserts that most employers and employment agencies inquire whether an applicant has been arrested and that an affirmative answer to this question, regardless of whether a conviction resulted, is often sufficient to deny the applicant further consideration, and that where there are two or more, applicants for the same job, those with previous arrest records clearly stand in less favorable position than do other applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">To \u201cexpunge\u201d a record, in common parlance, is \u201cto strike out, obliterate, or mark for deletion ... to cause the physical destruction of . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Although courts have not been uniform in their usage of the term in cases involving criminal arrest records, it appears that \u201cexpungement\u201d at least in a general sense may also consist of the return of the record to the person accused or the sealing or segregation of the record in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>secure place to prevent public or private access. <em>See </em>57 Op. Att. Gen. 518 (1972); 58 Op. Atty. Gen. 340 (1973). Cases dealing with the right of an exonerated arrestee to have fingerprints, photographs, or other criminal identification or arrest records expunged or their dissemination restricted are collected in an exhaustive annotation appearing at 46 A.L.R.3d 900-33 (1972). The cases fall generally into four groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Some courts reaching the merits of the issue weigh heavily the need for public safety and effective law enforcement and classify the problem as one for the legislature. <em>Herschel v. Dyra, </em>365 F. 2d 17 (7th Cir. 1966) <em>cert. denied </em>385 U. S. 973, 87 S. Ct. 513, 17 L.Ed.2d 436 (1966); <em>Sterling v. City of Oakland, </em>208 Cal.App.2d 1, 24 Cal. Rptr. 696 (1962); <em>Walker v. Lamb, </em>254 A. 2d 265 (Del. Ch. 1969), <em>affd </em>259 A. 2d 663 (Del. Supr. 1969); <em>Kolb v. O\u2019Connor, </em>14 Ill.App.2d 81, 142 N.E.2d 818 (1957); <em>Weisberg v. Police Dept. of Lynbrook, </em>46 Misc. 2d 846, 260 N.Y.S.2d 554 (1965).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Kolb v. O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>the Illinois court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cIn considering the right of the public we must take into consideration the increasing incidence of crime, particularly crimes of violence and crimes involving sex, as indicated by well publicized statistics, and the fact that the automobile, affording mobility to the criminal, has rendered the detection and identification of criminals more difficult than it has ever been in the history of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>world, all of which is particularly true in all of the metropolitan centers of the United States, as is shown by the newspaper reports of unsolved and unsolvable crimes of the last few years. Interposed against this is the right of the individual to privacy, which in this case would mean that a person who has been arrested, photographed and fingerprinted should have such records of identification destroyed or returned to him. It is true that under our system of jurisprudence no person is guilty of a crime until he has been convicted thereof. However, as is said in an article of Sidney M. DeAngelis, 27 Temple Law Quarterly 441: \u2018The extent of the actual harm which may befall the injured citizen, is at most, conjectural. On the other hand, the extent of the possible danger to an effective system of law enforcement is considerable. The innocent person of today, unfortunately, may be tomorrow\u2019s criminal. The day before some poor soul kills his fellow man, he is an innocent person. The minute possibility that his previously obtained identification records may help to apprehend him and prevent further tragedy is, it is submitted, substantial enough to outweigh the alleged invasion of his right of privacy.\u2019 \u201d 142 N.E.2d at 822.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">A second group of cases would deny traditional expungement relief, <em>i.e., </em>the return, removal, destruction or sealing of records, but would place certain restrictions on dissemination of arrest record information or the contents of such records. <em>Menard v. Mitchell, </em>328 F. Supp. 718 (D.D.C. 1971), remanded with instructions, <em>Menard v. Saxbe, </em>162 U.S. App. D.C. 284, 498 F. 2d 1017 (1974); <em>Spock v. District of Columbia, </em>283 A. 2d 14 (D.C. App. 1971);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel. Mavity v. Tyndall, </em>224 Ind. 364, 66 N.E.2d 755 (1946); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>ex rel. Reed v. Harris, </em>348 Mo. 426,153 S.W.2d-834 (1941).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, other cases denying expungement relief suggest that a cause of action might be stated in connection with improper dissemination of arrest records. <em>United States v. Rosen, </em>343 F. Supp. 804, (S.D.N.Y. 1972): <em>Sterling v. City of Oakland, supra. </em>The older cases in which the court restricted the dissemination of criminal arrest records are based on the power of courts of equity to restrain an invasion of the arrestee\u2019s privacy. <em>State ex rel. Mavity v. Tyndall, supra. Cf. Itzkovitch, v. Whitaker, </em>115 La. 479, 39 So. 499 (1905) and 117 La. 708, 42 So. 228 (1906). <em>Menard, </em>borrowing from language applicable to the constitutional right of privacy, holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">\u201cWhere the Government engages in conduct, such as the wide dissemination of arrest records, that clearly invades individual privacy by revealing episodes in a person\u2019s life of doubtful and certainly not determined import, its action cannot be permitted unless a compelling public necessity has been clearly shown.\u201d 328 F. Supp. at 726.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A third group of decisions would permit expungement relief in \u201cextreme circumstances,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>in instances of an arrest without probable cause or in cases of police misconduct. <em>See Sullivan v. Murphy, </em>156 U.S. App. D.C. 28, 478 F. 2d 938 (1973) (mass arrests where procedures rendered judicial determination of probable cause impossible); <em>United States v. McLeod, </em>385 F. 2d 734 (5th Cir. 1967) (arrests made for sole purpose of harassing civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>workers); <em>Kowall v. United States, </em>53 F.R.D. 211 (W.D. Mich. 1971) (petitioner\u2019s arrest, conviction and sentence for failure to report for induction were declared invalid); <em>United States v. Kalish, </em>271 F. Supp. 968 (D.P.R. 1967) (prosecutor\u2019s attempt to keep photographs and fingerprints amounted to a form of spite); <em>Bilick v. Dudley, </em>356 F. Supp. 945 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (arrests without probable cause and harassment); <em>Wheeler v. Goodman, </em>306 F. Supp. 58 (W.D.N.C. 1969), remanded on other grounds, 401 U. S. 987 (1971), <em>affd </em>on remand, 330 F. Supp. 1356 (W.D.N.C. 1971) (extreme misbehavior of police in making arrests without probable cause); <em>Hughes v. Rizzo, </em>282 F. Supp. 881 (E.D. Pa. 1968) (arrests made for purpose of harassing \u201chippies\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Rosen, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Dooley, </em>364 F. Supp. 75 (E.D. Pa. 1973) for the converse of this position \u2014 that expungement relief is not warranted in the typical case. The basis for the expungement remedy in these cases is that such relief is \u201cnecessary and appropriate in order to preserve basic legal rights.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Murphy, supra, </em>478 F. 2d at 968. However, it is not clear whether the relief in most of these cases is predicated solely on the inherent power of an equity court, <em>Wheeler v. Goodman, supra, </em>at 65, or constitutional considerations aside from a constitutional right of privacy, <em>Menard v. Mitchell, </em>139 U.S. App. D.C. 113, 118-19, 430 F. 2d 486, 491-92 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Finally, there are those cases that hold that without regard to legislative action, or to the presence of special circumstances justifying relief, expungement may be ordered. <em>Davidson v. Dill, </em>Colo., 503 P. 2d 157 (1972); <em>Eddy v. Moore, </em>5 Wash. App. 334, 487 P. 2d 211 (1971). These cases say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cWe believe the right of an individual, absent a compelling showing of necessity by the government, to the return of his fingerprints and photographs, upon an acquittal, is a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and that it is as well within the penumbras of the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights \u2018formed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.\u2019 <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U. S. 479, 484, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cIt will take a compelling showing on the part of the state to justify a retention of the fingerprints and photographs. . . 487 P. 2d at 217, 503 P. 2d at 161.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Both <em>Eddy </em>and <em>Davidson </em>involved acquittals. Eddy\u2019s case arose on a denial of a writ of mandamus aimed at the chief of police; Davidson\u2019s on a dismissal of her complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court in <em>Eddy, </em>with no findings of fact or testimony before it, ordered return of the fingerprints and photographs. The court in <em>Davidson, </em>suggesting a less rigorous application of this compelling necessity test, remanded saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cThe record here is devoid of any facts showing the need of the police department to keep this plaintiff\u2019s arrest records, or the ability of the department to keep them confidential. Who has access to these records, what facts are contained in them, how likely and to what extent information in the records may be disseminated, and what justification exists for their retention in the police files, are all questions, among many, which must be left to the trial court fact-finding process. After factual development, relief may or may not be warranted. Should the court determine the precise relief requested is not appropriate, other means may be formulated to protect plaintiffs right of privacy from any improper invasion. C.R.C.P. 54 (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cTo hold that this case must be reversed and remanded for adjudication on the merits, however, is not to express an opinion as to what its eventual outcome should be. The issue presented is complex and involves the balancing of the state\u2019s interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>efficient law enforcement procedures as against a particular citizen\u2019s right to be let alone. Only after the facts are fully developed will this be possible.\u201d 503 P. 2d 162-63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It is no doubt true, as <em>Eddy </em>and <em>Davidson </em>hold, that the right of privacy is protected by the Constitution, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U. S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and that if this right is applicable, regulation limiting it must be justified by a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d Roe <em>v. Wade, </em>410 U. S. at 155-56. However, it is also true that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cthe definitions of privacy which the <em>Griswold </em>approach offers are at best descriptions of a widely shared emotional attitude. Analytically, the reasoning of <em>Griswold </em>and <em>Wade </em>offers no guidance for separating what privacy is from what it is not; it offers no generalizable definition of the right it is used to protect. Indeed, the extreme breadth of the <em>Griswold </em>analysis has produced utmost caution in courts called on to apply it. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Note, <em>Privacy in the First Amendment, </em>82 Yale L.J. 1462, 1476 (1973).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The Supreme Court has yet to extend the right much beyond the context of intimate relationships. <em>See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U. S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (marriage); <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U. S. 557, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (possession of obscene matter in the privacy of a person\u2019s own home); <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, </em>405 U. S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972) (contraception) and <em>Roe v. Wade, supra </em>(abortion). And as our examination of the expungement cases reveals, few courts are willing to predicate relief specifically on <em>Griswold </em>and <em>Wade </em>and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of the two courts that has applied <em>Griswold </em>went out of its way to soften the application of the compelling interest test. <em>Davidson v. Dill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We think the lower court was wrong in its fundamental conclusion that because specific legislative authorization to expunge criminal arrest records existed only in connection with certain drug abuse cases,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a court of equity was without subject matter jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of appellant\u2019s petition or without power to grant the relief prayed. Juridically, jurisdiction of a court of equity refers to two distinct concepts: (1) the power of a court to render a valid decree, and (2) the propriety of granting the relief sought. <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. 497, 141 A. 2d 176 (1958). Appellant\u2019s petition asserted an infringement of a claimed constitutional right to privacy by reason of the maintenance and control by the defendants of his criminal arrest record and the absence of an adequate legal remedy to protect the right. We said in <em>Shryock v. Morris, </em>75 Md. 72, 76, 23 A. 68, 70 (1891), that \u201cthe court of chancery being a superior court of general jurisdiction, nothing shall be intended to be out of its jurisdiction which is not shown to be so.\u201d And, as we observed in <em>Wells v. Price, </em>183 Md. 443, 452, 37 A. 2d 888, 893 (1944), the mere absence of precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>would be no bar to the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity \u201cfor equity principles are broad and comprehensive and their application is not to be denied merely because of a new subject.\u201d It is clear that a court of equity has jurisdiction over issues involving the maintenance of civil rights, <em>Adams v. Commissioners of Town of Trappe, </em>204 Md. 165, 102 A. 2d 830 (1954), and at least in some matters involving consideration of personal rights, <em>e.g., </em>rights protected by the federal or state constitutions. In <em>Schneider v. Pullen, </em>198 Md. 64, 68, 81 A. 2d 226, 228 (1951), we flatly held \u201cthat where constitutional questions are involved, the litigant has the right to raise them in a court of equity, and such court has the right to consider them.\u201d To the same effect, <em>see Poe v. Baltimore City, </em>241 Md. 303, 216 A. 2d 707 (1966); <em>Maryland Committee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, </em>228 Md. 412, 180 A. 2d 656 (1962); <em>Kracke v. Weinberg, </em>197 Md. 339, 79 A. 2d 387 (1951). <em>See also Downs v. Swann, </em>111 Md. 53 (1909), a case in which a preliminary injunction had been issued upon the filing of a bill in equity to restrain the police authorities from photographing and measuring a person arrested, but not tried and convicted, for embezzling public funds; the bill praying for injunctive relief had alleged that the accused would be irreparably injured by such police activity, that it would violate his personal liberty and constitutional rights, and that he had no adequate remedy at law. In the course of affirming an order dissolving the injunction, our predecessors noted that the accused did not charge in his bill of complaint \u201cthat the police intend to put his photograph in their rogues\u2019 gallery or distribute copies of it to the police authorities of other cities, unless he is convicted or becomes a fugitive from justice, or that they propose to apply his Bertillon record to any other uses than those of their own department . . . .\u201d 111 Md. at 60. The Court, however, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cbut we must not be understood by so doing [dissolving the preliminary injunction] to countenance the placing in the \u2018rogues gallery\u2019 of the photograph of any person, not a habitual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>criminal, who has been arrested but not convicted on a criminal charge, or the publication under those circumstances of his Bertillon record. Police officers have no right to needlessly or wantonly injure in any respect persons whom they are called upon in the course of their duty to arrest or detain, and for the infliction of any such injury they would be liable, to the injured person, in the same manner and to the same extent that private individuals would be.\u201d Id. at 64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><em>Downs </em>has been cited as authority for the proposition that a right of privacy may be protected by injunctive relief. <em>See State ex rel. Mavity v. Tyndall, supra </em>(66 N.E.2d at 761-62). <em>Cf. Carr v. Watkins, </em>227 Md. 578, 177 A. 2d 841 (1962), recognizing a right of redress in tort for an unwarranted invasion of privacy in a case involving the transmission of derogatory information by the police to the plaintiffs employer; we there noted, citing <em>Tyndall, </em>and referring to the dicta in <em>Downs, </em>that \u201c[c]ases which have sustained a claim of violation of the right of privacy . . . include those in which the right of one arrested not to have his fingerprints and picture disseminated or exhibited prior to conviction, unless he becomes a fugitive from justice, has been recognized.\u201d 227 Md. at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">While we said in <em>Schneider v. Pullen, supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he Legislature cannot. . . interfere with the judicial process by depriving litigants from raising questions involving their fundamental rights in any appropriate judicial manner,\u201d 198 Md. at 68, we have also observed that the exercise of power by a court of equity in matters involving constitutional questions is not favored where statutory remedies exist which permit the raising of such questions. <em>Kracke v. Weinberg, supra, </em>197 Md. at 343. No statutory remedy now exists for expungement of non-drug-related criminal arrest records, although a bill broadly authorizing the expungement of such records, enacted at the 1974 Session of the Legislature (House Bill 122), was vetoed by the Governor for reasons wholly unrelated to the merits of the expungement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>concept. See Laws of Maryland, 1974, at page 3090.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of our conclusion that the lower court did have subject matter jurisdiction, but declined to exercise it in the mistaken belief that absent specific legislative authorization an equity court was without power to adjudicate the merits ,of appellant\u2019s petition, or grant the injunctive or other equitable relief prayed, we shall do no more than vacate the order sustaining the demurrer and granting the motion raising preliminary objection on purely jurisdictional grounds and remand the case for further proceedings in light of the principles herein enunciated. The propriety of granting the relief sought necessarily depends upon the facts and circumstances as may be developed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">\n<em>Order vacated; case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; costs to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\">.

However, some decisions adopting this approach do not completely foreclose the court\u2019s role in the area. For example, in Mulkey v. Purdy, 234 So.2d 108 (Fla. 1970), the Supreme Court of Florida suggested that a court may order arrest records expunged or destroyed when \u201cstrong overriding equitable considerations\u201d are present. <em>Id. </em>at 110. And in Roesch v. Ferber, 48 N.J.Super. 231, 137 A. 2d 61 (1957), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cWe have seen that courts recognize that situations may possibly arise where equitable relief such as that sought here may be warranted. However, the equities must be strongly in favor of the complainant for this court to interfere with the valid administrative procedures of our law enforcement agencies.\u201d 137 A. 2d at 72.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\"><em>See also </em>State v. Bellar, 16 N.C.App. 339, 192 S.E.2d 86 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. Although the District of Columbia decisions rely on local rules to govern content and dissemination of arrest records, Morrow v. District of Columbia, 135 U.S. App. D.C. 160, 173-75, 417 F. 2d 728, 741-43 (1969), suggested that those rules need not be the limit of the court\u2019s power over dissemination Of records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">. The later ease of Cissell v. Brostron, 395 S.W.2d 322 (Mo. App. 1965), dissolving an injunction which inhibited dissemination of the arrest records of an individual against whom murder charges were dismissed, rested <em>inter alia </em>on the fact that there was no evidence of past or threatened dissemination of the records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">. The District Court went on to say that it was a matter for Congress in the first instance to determine the public necessity for government conduct, but it then proceeded to narrowly construe the statute authorizing the FBI to collect and exchange arrest records in order to avoid \u201cserious constitutional issues.\u201d 328 F. Supp. at 726. Thus, the court found that the FBI was without authority to disseminate arrest records outside the Federal Government for employment, licensing or related purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, <em>infra, </em>the Supreme Court said, \u201cIf the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into <em>matters so fundamentally affecting a person </em>as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\u201d 405 U. S. at 453 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. Section 292(a) of Article 27 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201cWhenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this subheading or under any other prior law of this State or the laws of the United States or of any other state relating to controlled dangerous substances as defined in this subheading, and who is tried for any offense specified in this subheading and is found not guilty, or where the charges against such person are dismissed in any manner, by either the court or the prosecuting authority, the court, if satisfied that the best interest of the person and the welfare of the people of this State would be served thereby, shall expunge the criminal record resulting from the arrest in such case. No expunged criminal arrest record shall thereafter be regarded as an arrest for purposes of employment, civil rights, or any statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or any other public or private purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Section 292 (b) authorizes expungement of records in certain instances involving persons found guilty of drug offenses for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">. In his veto message, the Governor stated that he favored the concept of expungement of criminal records in cases where no conviction has been obtained, and said he would \u201csupport, and would sign, properly drawn legislation to accomplish that end.\u201d That such legislation will be introduced at the forthcoming 1975 Session of the General Assembly is not unlikely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
