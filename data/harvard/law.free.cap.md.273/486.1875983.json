Gould (Gould), a sixty-three-year-old resident of the District of Columbia and a self-employed cab driver, was abducted at gun point while operating his taxi in the District on April 11, 1970; driven to Clinton, in Prince George\u2019s County, he was there robbed and shot \u2014 both in the neck and the back of his head. He spent more than five months hospitalized as a result of his wounds. Thereafter he filed a claim with the appellant, Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (Board), as an \u201cinnocent victim\u201d of crime, for an award allowable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act (Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 26A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-17). When the Board on June 14, 1972 finally disallowed his claim he appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County which vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the claim for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Board in urging us to overturn that decision contends that under the provisions of Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a), the decision was not subject to any judicial review by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Gould leased his taxi at a weekly rate from the Yellow Cab Company of D. C., Inc. (Company) which repaired and mechanically maintained the vehicle. Although he was free to work the days and hours of his choice, he was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>inform the Company daily concerning his use of the cab at the end of each shift he worked. Approval from the Company was required for \u201ctime off\u201d and his relationship could be terminated \u201cfor cause.\u201d Gould filed United States income tax returns for 1967, 1968 and 1969 as a self-employed person; he made no report of his earnings to the Company and received no compensation from it; Gould, as other drivers similarly situated, was not included within Yellow Cab\u2019s casualty or workmen\u2019s compensation policies. He received no benefits of any kind from the Company after he was victimized by the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">When Gould\u2019s claim came before a single member of the Board (Art. 26A, \u00a7 8) it was decided \u2014 without a hearing \u2014 that he was a self-employed cab driver, was the \u201cinnocent victim\u201d of a crime and had sustained serious financial hardship (Art. 26A, \u00a7 12), but that \u201cthe injury was inflicted by a third person in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment and that he was in fact an employee . . . covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Maryland and for D. C. and must exhaust his remedies before either of those agencies before this Commission [Board] can lawfully make an award. . ..\u201d His claim was placed in an \u201cabated status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In order to overcome this \u201cabatement\u201d Gould filed a claim with the District of Columbia Bureau of Employees\u2019 Compensation (Bureau). Subsequent thereto both the Bureau <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> wrote the Board, advising that Gould was self-employed, not an employee of the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and was not entitled to nor did he receive any benefits as a result of his \u201cmisfortunate accident.\u201d The Bureau (an adjunct of the Department of Labor) rejected Gould\u2019s claim for compensation benefits on March 24,1971.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">In his further efforts to satisfy the objection raised by the Board, Gould next filed a claim with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland (Commission). When the case came before the Commission at a hearing on November 8, 1971, counsel for Gould stipulated as to those facts which concerned Gould\u2019s self-employment status. Upon the stipulation the Commission found that at the time Gould was shot he was an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d that the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund was not involved and disallowed his claim for compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">After having unsuccessfully attempted to claim workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in both the District of Columbia and Maryland, Gould\u2019s claim was reconsidered by the Board (again by the same single member). The Board\u2019s resistance persisted however, this time ruling that the stipulation entered into at the Commission hearing, that he-was \u201cnot an employee in the involved instance constitutes a deliberate lack of cooperation on his part with both the spirit and the letter of our decision of February 10th, 1971.\u201d The Board further noted \u201cit most inappropriate that public monies should be spent to compensate a claimant for injuries received while employed and thereby eligible for other benefits.\u201d The claim was again disallowed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Gould, under the provisions of Art. 26A, \u00a7 9 (a), then applied \u201cfor a consideration of the decision by the <em>full </em>Board.\u201d The Board, after a hearing, affirmed the action taken by its single member, holding that although the evidence established that Gould drove the cab on a rental basis, received no salary, was not subject to workmen\u2019s compensation coverage and filed income tax returns for the \u201cprofit and loss from a business,\u201d and nonetheless concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThis case is one of several in recent months where companies have attempted to use State funds by way of this program to protect their alleged independent contractors in lieu of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. By calling the given individual an independent contractor, these companies have to date successfully avoided the expense and exposure of Workmen\u2019s Compensation claims. The various times we have ordered the issue to be determined before a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission has resulted in stipulations between representatives of the employer and claimant that he is in fact an independent contractor. This results in said commission being locked into a finding that the claimant is an independent contractor without the issue ever being fully litigated or heard. We find this practice to be reprehensible and an unfair burden on the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, <em>we find under the laws of the State of Maryland as enunciated in Article 101, Section 67, and the cases annotated thereunder, that the claimant is an employee and/or servant; and not an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>independent contractor. </em>Therefore, the liability for his injuries must by operation of law, be that of the employer and/or master. Commenting further, we have previously attempted to avoid deciding issues such as the instant case in order not to judge matters usually best left to the powers and jurisdiction of a sister agency. However, in the protection of the State and those citizens eligible for this program, we can no longer permit employers to escape their exposure from the master-servant relationship by referring those injured to this Board, as a substitute therefor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">When Gould\u2019s appeal came before the Circuit Court the trial judge (Cahoon, J.) held that Art. 26A, \u00a7 10, prohibiting judicial review, was \u201cunconstitutional and void,\u201d in conflict with the holdings in <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379 [45 A. 2d 73, 76] (1945), and was a \u201clegislative intrusion into inherent powers of the court.\u201d It was further held that the Board was an \u201cagency\u201d within the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act (Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244 ff.); and that Gould\u2019s appeal was properly before the court within the provisions of Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a). In remanding the case for further consideration the trial court concluded that the Board had exceeded its statutory authority and jurisdiction in undertaking to redetermine the claimant\u2019s eligibility for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and that the Board, in finding that the claimant \u201chad not fully cooperated with all <em>law enforcement agencies,\u201d </em>had made an unduly strained construction of Art. 26A, \u00a7 12 (a), in applying it to proceedings before the Board itself as an adjudicatory body.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\n<em>REVIEWABILITY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Article 41, \u00a7 255 (a), enacted by Ch. 94 of the Acts of 1957, of the Administrative Procedure Act permits a judicial review to any party \u201caggrieved by a final decision in a contested case.\u201d The section is captioned \u201cJudicial Review.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined in \u00a7 244 (c) as a proceeding \u201cbefore an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are <em>required </em>by law or constitutional right to be determined <em>after an agency hearing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The statute here in question, enacted by Ch. 455 of the Acts of 1968, repealed and re-enacted with amendments by Ch. 401, Acts of 1970, and codified as Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cWithin thirty days after receipt of the copy of the report containing the final decision of the Board, the Attorney General may, if in his judgment or in the judgment of the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services the award is improper, commence a proceeding in the circuit court of the county or the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, as the case may be, to review the decision of the Board. Any such proceeding shall be heard in a summary manner and shall have precedence over all other civil cases in such court. The court may, however, take additional testimony, if it so desires. <em>There shall he no other judicial review of any decision made or action taken by the Board, </em>by a member of the Board or by the secretary of the Board with respect to any claim.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Although statutes relating to remedies and procedure as a general rule are to be liberally construed with a view toward the effective administration of justice, they are not to be given such a construction as will defeat or frustrate the legislative intention. <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. Schuck, </em>151 Md. 367. 134 A. 349 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">When two statutes relate to the same general subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>matter \u2014 such as here where Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a) and Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) both relate to the right of judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency \u2014 to the extent of any conflict between them, the later statute governs. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners v. Potter, </em>268 Md. 285, 300 A. 2d 680 (1973); <em>Department of Motor Vehicles v. Greyhound Corp., </em>247 Md. 662, 234 A. 2d 255 (1967). <em>See also United States v. Milk Distributors Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>200 F. Supp. 792 (D.C. Md. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Similarly controlling is the premise that where there is a specific enactment and a general enactment \u201c \u2018which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 328 A. 2d 293 (1974); <em>Maguire v.

Baltimore County Revenue Authority, </em>267 Md. 687, 298 A. 2d 413 (1973); <em>Montgomery Citizens League v. Greenhalgh, </em>253 Md. 151, 252 A. 2d 242 (1969); <em>Truitt v. Board of Public Works, </em>243 Md. 375, 221 A. 2d 370 (1966). In ascertaining the true meaning of the statute and the intention of the Legislature in enacting it, aid may be found in the history of its adoption and the object sought to be attained thereunder. <em>See Clerk of the Circuit Court v. Chesapeake Beach Park, Inc., </em>251 Md. 657, 248 A. 2d 479 (1968); <em>Truitt v. Board of Public Works, supra; Associated Acceptance Corp. v. Bailey, </em>226 Md. 550, 174 A. 2d 440 (1961); <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 121 A. 2d 816 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">When, in 1968, the General Assembly enacted the Criminal Injuries Act (Art. 26A) Maryland was but the fifth American jurisdiction to establish a program permitting the unreimbursed victims of crime to be compensated by funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>appropriated by the state for their personal injuries and loss of earnings, if the victim would otherwise suffer serious financial hardship. In its \u201cdeclaration of policy and legislative intent\u201d the General Assembly recognized that many innocent persons suffer personal physical injury or death as a result of criminal acts, or in their efforts to prevent crime or apprehend a person committing or attempting to commit crime; that such persons, or their dependents, may thereby suffer disability, incur financial hardships or become dependent upon public assistance. A need for governmental financial assistance for such victims was expressly found to exist and the Legislature declared its intent that \u201caid, care and support be provided by the State, as a matter of moral responsibility, for such victims of crime.\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 26A, \u00a7 1; Comment, <em>Criminal Victim Compensation in Maryland, </em>30 Md.L.Rev. 266, 278-83 (1970); H. Edelhertz and G. Geis, Public Compensation to Victims of Crime, at 175-80 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Act provides not only that the victim, but in the event of his death, his surviving spouse, children or other dependents may be eligible for awards; it incorporates a good-Samaritan concept by providing for compensation if the victim\u2019s injury or death resulted from apprehending a criminal or attempting to prevent a criminal act (\u00a7 5 (a)). Provision was made for emergency awards (\u00a7 11). The prerequisites for an award emphasize the incurring of \u201cserious financial hardship.\u201d Provision is made for the payment of benefits predicated upon the schedule of benefits and degree of disability reflected in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (\u00a7 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Funds for the payment of the awards made by the Board must be appropriated by the General Assembly, although they are financed in part by an increase in the assessment of court costs upon convictions for criminal offenses (\u00a7 17). Although enacted in' 1968, funds to support the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board were not appropriated by the General Assembly until 1969.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Maryland version is modeled upon the New York statute, adopted in 1966, creating the Crime Victims Compensation Board (N.Y. Exec. Law, Art. 22, McKinney (1972)). While our Act is based on \u201cmoral responsibility,\u201d the New York Legislature declared its intent to aid, care and support such victims of crime \u201cas a matter of grace.\u201d Among the American jurisdictions providing compensation for such injuries only Maryland and New York contain a provision undertaking to preclude judicial review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) is substantially identical to the provisions in \u00a7 629 of the New York statute. The New York section differs only in that it permits its Attorney General to commence a court proceeding \u201cIf in his judgment the award is improper <em>or excessive </em>In England the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme set out in a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d similarly provides for no judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">It has been suggested that opposition to judicial review was based upon the concept that the programs are <em>ex gratia </em>(as it is declared to be in New York and in Great Britain), with benefits conferred as a favor rather than as a matter of right, but that this doctrine has not stood the test in Great Britain \u201cwhere the writ of sovereign grace runs on a smoother track.\u201d It has further been observed that \u201c[o]pposition to the arbitrariness implicit in the New York and Maryland position should not obscure the danger that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>[the] boards could become enmeshed in frequent and unwarranted appellate litigation.\u201d <em>See </em>H. Edelhertz and G. Geis, Public Compensation to Victims of Crime, at 278-79 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The General Assembly, conceding an inability to ameliorate to any degree the threat of violent crime, and undertaking to assume the consequences of such crime as a public burden, on the ground of \u201cmoral responsibility,\u201d in enacting Art. 26A was embarking on uncharted waters in a noble social experiment without any real background data of experience. The recent nature of this type of legislation, the uncertain estimate of the volume of claims to be made under the Act, and the incalculable amount of the funds required to be appropriated for its administration confronted our lawmakers when they adopted this \u201cwelfare-theory\u201d of compensation. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Criminal Victim Compensation in Maryland, supra. </em>The statutory scheme for eligibility, the prerequisites for awards and the computation of benefits were all novel. Since the funds to be disbursed were public there can be sensed a legislative hesitancy on disbursement without some restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">It was with this historical and factual background that Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) was enacted. In providing that only the Attorney General might commence a court proceeding to review a decision of the Board when in his judgment, or in the judgment of the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the award was <em>improper, </em>the Legislature obviously intended to place a check upon the unfettered disbursement of public funds and a restriction upon possible excessive awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">One of the primary rules concerning statutory construction is that the General Assembly in enacting legislation does so with a full knowledge as to prior and existing law and judicial decisions with respect to such law. <em>See Harry Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 265 A. 2d 759 (1970); <em>Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Silkor Corp., </em>246 Md. 516, 229 A. 2d 135 (1967); <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 225 A. 2d 431 (1967); <em>St. Joseph Hospital v. Quinn, </em>241 Md. 371, 216 A. 2d 732 (1966); <em>Gibson v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>204 Md. 423, 104 A. 2d 800 (1954). Thus, in enacting Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) in 1968, and re-enacting it in 1970, the Legislature did so with full knowledge of the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, enacted in 1957, and of our decisions thereunder. It showed its clear intention by this particular and subsequent enactment to exclude decisions by the Board from being within the ambit of Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a) and the broad scope of judicial review permitted under Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (g) of the Administrative Procedure Act. It would seem \u201can inescapable conclusion that the intended omission was by deliberate choice.\u201d <em>See County Comm\u2019rs v. Donohoe, </em>220 Md. 362, 152 A. 2d 555 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As another reason demonstrative of an intent to exempt such proceedings from the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act, it could be argued with some force that since no hearing before the Board is <em>required </em>under Art. 26A, \u00a7 8 (d) to determine in the first instance the legal rights or privileges of a claimant, such a proceeding before the Board precludes it from being a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the definition of Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Bernstein v. Board of Education, </em>245 Md. 464, 226 A. 2d 243 (1967) (hearing by County Board of Education not a \u201ccontested case\u201d); <em>Department of Health v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 209 A. 2d 555 (1965) (no requirement for an agency hearing for the issuance of a permit). <em>Compare Murray v. Department of Social Services, </em>260 Md. 323, 272 A. 2d 16 (1971) (where an \u201copportunity for a fair hearing\u201d before the Department of Social Services was required under the provisions of the Social Security Act). But we need not here so decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Not only did the General Assembly intend to place the decisions and actions of the Board outside the scope of the review permitted under the Administrative Procedure Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>but in view of the experimental nature of the legislation, its background, history and the object and purposes sought to be attained by it, intended as well, by the enactment of Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) \u2014 as had New York and Great Britain \u2014 so far as it might be within the legislative power to do so, to preclude any regular judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The right to an appeal is not a right required by due process of law, nor is it an inherent or inalienable right. <em>Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U. S. 56 (1972); <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12 (1956); <em>Brown v. State, </em>237 Md. 492, 498-99, 207 A. 2d 103, 108 (1965); <em>Winkler v.

If the legislature has not expressly provided for judicial review, a court will ordinarily utilize its inherent powers to prevent illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious administrative action. In <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379, this Court said: \u2018The legislature is without authority to divest the judicial branch of the government of its inherent power to review actions of administrative boards shown to be arbitrary, illegal or capricious, and to impair personal or property rights; * * *,' and then quoted the opinion in <em>Hecht v.

Maryland Port Authority, supra, </em>Judge Singley, for the Court, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">\u201c[I]t is equally well settled that when the statute creating an agency makes no provision for judicial review of the agency\u2019s determination, courts will act where a decision is not supported by facts, or where an action is not within the scope of delegated authority, or is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Board of Education of Carroll County v.

Crook, supra, </em>that in the absence of any statutory provision for an appeal such review by the courts may be \u201cthrough the writ of mandamus, by injunction or otherwise\u201d was not only restated in <em>Heaps v. Cobb, supra, </em>but reiterated in <em>Hammond v. Love, </em>187 Md. 138, 49 A. 2d 75 (1946); <em>Brashears v. .Lindenbaum, supra; Gianforte v.

Rosenberg, </em>269 Md. 520, 307 A. 2d 704 (1973), that relief by way of mandamus was properly invoked where the withholding of approval of a preliminary subdivision plan was shown to have been arbitrary and capricious. Similarly, in <em>Department of Health v. Walker, supra, </em>judicial review by way of mandamus was held proper where there was \u201cno statutory provision for hearing or review and where public officials were alleged to have abused the discretionary powers reposed in them,\u201d and there had been an arbitrary denial of the issuance of a sewage disposal permit. In <em>Hammond v. Love, supra, </em>this Court held that relief by way of mandamus was appropriate where election supervisors, acting as a quasi-judicial body, misconstrued the law and their own statutory powers; and that such illegal action was reviewable without being characterized as \u201carbitrary.\u201d In <em>Heaps v. Cobb, supra, </em>relief by way of mandamus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>granted to direct the payment of retirement benefits where the trustees of a municipal retirement system reached an erroneous conclusion of law as to whether or not the deceased employee was \u201cin the actual performance of [his] duty\u201d at the time of his death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>. In each of these cases there was no vestigial discretion remaining in the administrative agency and the writ of mandamus directed the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In addition to relief by mandamus, resort to relief by way of certiorari has been held appropriate where an inferior tribunal, whether created by a public or private law, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity has undertaken to act contrary to law or beyond the scope of its jurisdiction and the lawfulness of such action could not be inquired into upon appeal. <em>State v.

Green, supra, </em>although it was concluded that no appeal would lie from the issuance of a writ of certiorari, it was held that the writ had been properly issued \u2019to question the regularity of the proceedings by which the Board of School Commissioners, acting in a quasi-judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>capacity, in trying charges preferred against a teacher had denied him the representation of counsel and had ordered his dismissal at a hearing from which he was absent. The lower court, upon issuing the writ, had stricken the order of the Board dismissing the teacher and remanded the proceedings for proper legal action before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Judge Burke, who delivered the opinion of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cNo appeal from the decision of the board is provided by law. In such a situation, if the procedure adopted by the board is irregular, or illegal, the teacher has a right to have that procedure reviewed and corrected by <em>certiorari </em>proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">In <em>Williamson v. Carnan, </em>1 G. &amp; J. 196, Chief Judge Archer announced the following principles which he said were adjudged and settled by the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\"><em>One. </em>That every inferior jurisdiction, whether created by a public or a private law, is subject to have its proceedings inspected either by appeal, or by <em>certiorari </em>and <em>mandamus, </em>where such jurisdiction acts judicially. 1 <em>Salk. </em>146; <em>Rex v. Inhabitants, </em>1 Ld. Ramy. 580. They would be coerced to perform their duties, and restrained and confined within their proper limits as prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\"><em>Second. </em>That where these jurisdictions act in a summary manner, or in a new course different from the common law, a <em>certiorari </em>is the peculiar and appropriate remedy; as in such a case, a writ of error will not lie. <em>Groenvelt v. Burwell, </em>1 Salk. 263 Com. Rep. <em>Israel v. Allen, </em>decided in Baltimore County Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\"><em>Three. </em>That a <em>certiorari </em>does not go to try the merits of the question, but to see whether limited jurisdictions have exceeded their bounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Rex v. Moreley, 2 </em>Burr, 1042.\u201d 118 Md. at 225-26, 84 A. at 345.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Williamson v. Carnan, supra, </em>certiorari was held proper to order the Levy Court not to illegally close a road. <em>See also Swann v. Mayor </em>&amp; <em>Common Councilmen of Cumberland, </em>8 Gill 150 (1849), holding that certiorari should have been granted to determine whether the council had acquired approval to tax the citizenry to pay for a street improvement under a statute which specified the requirements for \u201csufficient approval.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"><em>See </em>as well <em>State v. Jacob, </em>234 Md. 452, 199 A. 2d 803 (1964), in which this Court reversed the denial of certiorari by the lower court where a review was there sought to determine whether a justice of the peace had, by an erroneous application of the law, exceeded his jurisdiction in granting \u201cprobation without verdict.\u201d Although the decision was based on the issue of \u201cjurisdiction, rather than of mere irregularity in the proceedings,\u201d it was recognized that \u201ccertiorari may be invoked to ascertain whether an inferior tribunal has transcended its limited powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In England under their Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> providing for \u201cex gratia\u201d compensation to the victims of crime and those injured by criminal violence, review by way of certiorari to test the Board\u2019s interpretation of the provisions of the Scheme has been regularly recognized notwithstanding the provision \u2014 similar to Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) \u2014 that the Board\u2019s \u201cdecisions will not be subject to appeal or to ministerial review.\u201d <em>See Reg. v.

In each of the cases certiorari was granted to correct erroneous interpretations or determinations of law by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">There is a dearth of judicial authority under the New York statute which was the model for Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a). <em>Goldmeer v. Crime Victims Comp. Ed., </em>32 N.Y.2d 679, 343 N.Y.S.2d 359, 296 N.E.2d 256 (1973), throws no light upon the subject; in a one line per curiam a motion to dismiss the appeal was granted upon the ground that the appeal did not lie. In <em>Johnsen v. Nissman, </em>39 A.D.2d 578, 331 N.Y.S.2d 796 (2d Dept. 1972), it was held that the claimant\u2019s application for benefits under the Act had been filed too late and should not be considered by the Board as had been ordered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">When Gould docketed his \u201cappeal,\u201d invoking Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a) and Maryland Rule B2,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> counsel for the Board had assured his counsel that the Board\u2019s decision was appealable under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Board now here concedes that it is estopped to argue that there is not at least a minimum permissible judicial review where personal or property rights are involved. The Board, however, contends that such review \u2014 by mandamus or certiorari \u2014 is here contraindicated because Gould does not possess such standing, and such judicial review may not be granted where a gratuity, privilege or discretionary disbursement is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Although from our holdings in <em>Heaps v. Cobb, supra, </em>and in <em>Johnstown Coal and Coke v. Dishong, </em>198 Md. 467, 84 A. 2d 847 (1951), it would appear that the impairment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201cpersonal or property rights\u201d is a condition precedent to judicial review of alleged arbitrary, illegal or capricious actions of an administrative board, our later decisions unqualifiedly seem to permit such judicial review without conditioning it upon the existence of such rights. <em>See County Council v. Investors Funding Corp., </em>270 Md. 403, 434-37, 312 A. 2d 225, 242-43 (1973), recognizing that such determinations are \u201calways open to judicial review by an aggrieved party\u201d and quoting with approval <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v.

Accordingly, as we said in <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895 (1961), \u2018consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.\u2019 See also <em>Hannah v.

Lyons, </em>374 Ill. 557, 562-63, 30 N.E.2d 46, 50 (1940), although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>there is no obligation upon any governmental unit to support the poor and the destitute, once the state voluntarily assumes such humanitarian obligation, the means employed must not be applied arbitrarily or unreasonably \u2014 if so, judicial relief is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We conclude that once a claimant, such as Gould, met the statutory qualifications set forth in Art. 26A, \u00a7 5, for an award he possessed a sufficient \u201cpersonal right\u201d and eligibility to the benefits provided in \u00a7 12, and as an aggrieved party was entitled to seek judicial examination of the action of the Board, by reason of the fact that the General Assembly, not \u201cas a matter of grace,\u201d or <em>\u201cex gratia\u201d </em>(as in New York and England), but rather in recognition of a \u201cmoral responsibility,\u201d created a scheme of benefits upon a \u201cwelfare-theory\u201d of compensation for such victims of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Although we disagree with the conclusions of the trial court that Art. 26A, \u00a7 10 (a) is unconstitutional in that it undertakes to bar any appeal from the decisions of the Board and that a review of the Board\u2019s action is within the purview of the Administrative Procedure Act, under Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a), we hold that the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 10 (a) similarly did so with full cognizance of our long line of decisions recognizing, that in the absence of any statutory right to appeal, the courts are vested with the inherent residual right to review and restrain improper exercises of administrative powers by agencies alleged to have acted arbitrarily, illegally, capriciously and unreasonably, and did not intend by \u00a7 10 (a) to preclude such type of judicial examination. <em>See Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U. S. 361 (1974), where the appellee, denied educational assistance under the Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Benefits Act, brought an action for declaratory judgment. Judicial review of the decisions of the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs on any questions of law or fact was prohibited by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211 (a) (1970). The United States Supreme Court in the majority opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan, while recognizing that the section was not intended to permit day to day judicial review of the determinations and interpretations of veterans\u2019 administrative policy, held nonetheless that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>congressional statutory intent to preclude judicial cognizance of a constitutional challenge such as that made by the appellee to a statute proscribing the payment of benefits to him and who asserted a denial of \u201cequal protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Since Gould\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d asserted arbitrary, illegal, capricious and unreasonable action by the Board, we conclude, as we here interpret \u00a7 10 (a), that review of the Board\u2019s action, upon the allegations he made, was properly before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for scrutiny within the scope of mandamus or certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Although Gould\u2019s application for judicial review, under Maryland Rule B2, was misappropriately captioned as an \u201cappeal\u201d his memorandum in support thereof, docketed as a \u201cpetition,\u201d a copy of which was served both upon the Board and its counsel, sufficiently complied factually with the requirements of Maryland Rule BE40 (b) [mandamus], as well as Maryland Rule K43 [certiorari], to be considered as a \u201cpetition\u201d under either.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u201cWhere there has been a compliance with the substance of the requirements of statutes or rules and the other parties have not been prejudiced, technical irregularities cannot be made the basis for depriving persons of the opportunity to assert their legal rights.\u201d <em>Hertelendy v.

Since the \u201cappeal\u201d was docketed upon the assurance of counsel for the Board that its decision was subject to an appeal and the Board here concedes that by its concurrence it is estopped to deny that at least a minimum judicial review exists, there was, without prejudice to the Board, a substantial compliance by Gould with the procedure for obtaining judicial review of the Board\u2019s action and any technical irregularity by captioning his application as an \u201cappeal\u201d should not be held to be a basis for having deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Gould of his opportunity to assert his legal rights in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The office of mandamus, as generally used, is to compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right. <em>Miller v. City of Baltimore, </em>262 Md. 423, 426, 278 A. 2d 61, 63 (1971), citing from <em>George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Allegany County Comm\u2019rs, </em>59 Md. 255, 259 (1883), where, however, the acts and duties necessarily call for the exercise of judgment and discretion on the part of such officials mandamus will not lie to direct the manner in which such discretion shall be exercised. <em>County Council v. Egerton Realty, Inc., </em>217 Md. 234, 140 A. 2d 510 (1958); <em>Hillyard v. Chevy Chase Village, </em>215 Md. 243, 137 A. 2d 555 (1958); <em>Town of District Heights v.

Montgomery County, </em>180 Md. 498, 25 A. 2d 682 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">On the other hand, the object of the writ of certiorari is not to authorize the court to decide the case on its merits, but merely to determine whether the inferior tribunal has proceeded in a summary manner and in a course contrary to the law or in excess <em>of </em>its jurisdiction. <em>Kalis v. Brown, supra; Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, supra; Swann v. Mayor &amp; Common Councilmen of Cumberland, supra; Williamson v. Carnan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In view of the discretion still remaining in the Board under Art. 26A, \u00a7 12 \u2014 even after eligibility might be established \u2014 concerning the extent of \u201cserious financial hardship,\u201d the amount of any payments received or to be received from any other source, and the computation of the benefits, if any, to which Gould might be entitled, the trial court could not mandate the payment of benefits to him as in those cases where by mandamus the issuance of a permit, or a license,' or the payment of a pension has been ordered. Since the trial court, upon the record before the Board, did not undertake to decide the case on its merits, but undertook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to ascertain whether the Board had acted contrary to law and outside the scope of its jurisdiction, we conclude that it is more appropriate that Gould\u2019s application for judicial review be here treated as an application for certiorari rather than for mandamus, and we treat it as such. <em>See Moulden v. State, </em>217 Md. 351, 353, 142 A. 2d 595, 596 (1958), where this Court finding \u201cit apparent that the questions sought to be raised [by appeal] render \u2018it desirable and in the public interest that the case should be reviewed,\u2019 \u201d treated an appeal as an application for certiorari. <em>See also Shipley v. State, </em>201 Md. 96, 93 A. 2d 67 (1952), where we held that a writ of certiorari was available to test the constitutionality of a section of the statute under which a defendant had been convicted.

When the full Board on June 14, 1972, upheld the rejection of the claim by the single commissioner, although concluding that Gould was \u201can innocent victim of a crime\u201d and that \u201cserious financial hardship is determined\u201d not only found that the stipulation \u201clocked the Commission into a finding that the claimant is an independent contractor without the issue ever being fully litigated or heard\u201d \u2014 a practice the Board found \u201cto be reprehensible and an unfair burden on the State\u201d but, notwithstanding the decision of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission nonetheless found under the provisions of \u201cArt. 101, \u00a7 67, and the cases annotated thereunder, that the claimant is an employee and/or servant and <em>not </em>an independent contractor.\u201d The Board in denying benefits to Gould concluded that \u201cthe liability for his injuries must, by operation of law, be that of the employer and/or master.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Art. 26A, \u00a7 12 (d), provides that any award made under the article shall be reduced by the amount of any payments, received or to be received, from any source, including any award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission under Art. 101. Thus, any Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits award to Gould would operate as a reduction in the amount of any benefits which might be awarded him under Art. 26A.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Section 12 (a), concerning \u201ccooperation,\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201cNo award shall be made unless the Board or Board members, as the case may be, finds that (1) a crime was committed, (2) such crime directly resulted in personal physical injury to, or death of the victim, and (3) police records show that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>crime was promptly reported to the proper authorities; and in no case may an award be made where the police records show that such report was made more than forty-eight hours after the occurrence of such crime unless the Board, for good cause shown, finds the delay to have been justified. The Board, upon finding that any claimant or award recipient <em>has not fully cooperated with all law enforcement agencies, </em>may deny or withdraw any award, as the case may be.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">An independent contractor is not an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits under the provisions of Maryland Code 1957 (1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 101, \u00a7 67. <em>See Bowers v. Eastern Aluminum Corp., </em>240 Md. 625, 214 A. 2d 924 (1965). Such an independent contractor has been defined as one who contracts to perform a certain work for another according to his own means and methods, free from the control of his employer in all details connected with the performance of the work, except as to its product or result. <em>Marine v. Service Trucking Co., </em>225 Md. 315, 170 A. 2d 188 (1961); <em>Snider v. Gaultney, </em>218 Md. 332,146 A. 2d 869 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Of the several criteria to be applied in determining the relationship, the right to control the worker in the performance and manner of doing the work is the most decisive test. <em>Thompson v.

Cohen, <em>Some Aspects of Maryland Administrative Law, </em>24 Md.L.Rev. 1, 20-24 (1964), we here conclude that the decision by the Commission that Gould was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d was conclusive and not subject to collateral attack by the Board upon its own initiative. When the Board, contrary to the Commission\u2019s decision, undertook to make a finding that Gould was in fact an \u201cemployee,\u201d it clearly arrogated unto itself a function reserved unto the courts and transcended the power vested in it as an administrative agency.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Its attempt to redetermine his status was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">When the Board undertook to reject Gould\u2019s claim because of a deliberate \u201clack of cooperation on his part,\u201d it undertook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>to bring itself, as an administrative agency, within the concept of a \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d and overstrained the clear statutory language in Art. 26A, \u00a7 12 (a). In the context in which the term \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d is used in the statute, following immediately upon the provision concerning the time within which reports of any such crime are to be filed, it is clear that the term is intended to mean a showing of cooperation on the part of the claimant with those who are charged with the investigation of crime, the apprehension of the criminal and his prosecution under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">All policemen, without regard to rank, have been held to be \u201claw enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Frazier v. Elmore, </em>180 Tenn. 232, 173 S.W.2d 563 (1943). Similarly, an FBI agent is held to be a \u201claw enforcement officer.\u201d <em>Otten v. United States, </em>210 F. Supp. 729 (S.D. N.Y. 1962). In <em>Pratt v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 220, 226, 263 A. 2d 247, 250 (1970), an officer commissioned by the governor to protect corporate mercantile establishments was held to be a \u201claw enforcement officer.\u201d The Bureau of Motor Vehicles of New York has been held not to be a \u201claw enforcement agency\u201d which might invade the secrecy of Grand Jury proceedings. <em>See In re Special Report of Grand Jury, </em>192 Misc. 857, 77 N.Y.S.2d 438 (Erie Co. Ct. 1948). Similarly, a former member of a Grand Jury has been held not to be a \u201claw enforcement agent\u201d privileged from divulging names of those who had given him information concerning gambling. <em>See In re Schwartz, </em>133 N.J.L. 79, 42 A. 2d 564 (1945). Since the term was obviously intended to include the police, prosecutors and arguably, the courts and even the Grand Jury, the Board in applying the term to itself as the agency empowered to administer the Act clearly made an erroneous interpretation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Although, concededly, as the Board argues, there is an implied requirement of cooperation- on the part of the claimant in that he must seasonably file his claim and file supporting data, there is no requirement anywhere in the article that he must successfully litigate a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, nor by filing such claim satisfy transitory subjective standards of the Board. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>agree with the conclusion by the trial court that it would be \u201ca perversion of the function of an adjudicatory body to dispense [its] largesse only to those who are willing to be cooperative with [it].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Mistaken interpretations of law, however honestly arrived at, are held not to be within the exercise of sound administrative discretion and the legislative prerogative, but to be arbitrary and illegal. <em>Dept. of Health v.

Geis, Public Compensation to Victims of Crime, at 176 (1974) and \u201cSecond International Conference on the Compensation of the Innocent Victims of Violent Crime\u201d (Baltimore, 1970) at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-12\">. Alaska provides that all orders and decisions of its Board \u201cshall be final.\u201d Hawaii permits judicial review by one aggrieved \u201con the sole ground that a decision was in excess of the Commission\u2019s authority or jurisdiction.\u201d In California and New Jersey there are no statutory provisions for appeal, but it appears that since in each a hearing is required, judicial review would be permitted under their respective Administrative Procedure Acts. In Massachusetts the claim is filed in a district court, a hearing is held by a district court judge and decisions are apparently appealable as in other civil cases. In Washington appeals are expressly provided for under that state\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. Maryland Code Art. 26A, \u00a7 8 (d) provides that in the first instance the single Board member to whom the claim is assigned may decide in favor of the claimant on the basis of the documents filed and the report of investigation; it is only when he is unable to decide the claim upon those documents that he shall order a hearing. Although Gould was given a hearing before the full Board, upon the request of his attorney, the record does not otherwise disclose that any hearing was conducted \u2014 even after the single member of the Board disallowed his claim on January 31, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">.

In Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, 196 Md. 400, 76 A. 2d 736 (1950), it was held that the certiorari authorized by the Baltimore County Zoning Act was a procedure separate and distinct from common law certiorari and was similar to the appeal provision in the Baltimore City Zoning Act; that in the absence of statutory authority no appeal would lie since the lower court was exercising a special statutory jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. <em>See </em>D.
