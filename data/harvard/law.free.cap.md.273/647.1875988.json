III, \u00a7 40A. The basis of their claim is the requirement of Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City (1969) \u00a7 21-16 (a) as amended by Chapter 420, Acts of 1972, that a petition for immediate possession state \u201cthe reasons therefor.\u201d They say the City failed to comply. The short answer to this contention is that the City\u2019s petition referred to an attached affidavit. That affidavit said \u201c[t]hat all other property interests in the ten disposition lot areas aforesaid ha[d] been acquired, and demolition and sale of the entire site areas [could] not be completed until possession and title of the subject property interests [were] granted to the City.\u201d This complied with the statute. For this reason we have not addressed ourselves to the City\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellants to pay the costs; mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
