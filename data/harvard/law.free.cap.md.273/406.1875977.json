Burgess Hamilton, Sr., Suzanne Mensh, Alexander B. Page, Jr., Frank J. Wesolowski and Warren Brown ha[d] no.t been admitted to practice law in any of the Courts of this State\u201d; that the Board was \u201cmaking preparations for the General Election to be held on November 5, 1974 listing the names of four of the aforesaid candidates who ha[d] not been admitted to the practice of law as required by Section 2, Article 4 of the Constitution of Maryland\u201d; that the Board \u201cpermitted unqualified candidates to be placed on the official ballot which was used in the primary election on the 10th day of September, 1974 and [as of the time of the filing of the bill of complaint] intendfed] to permit unqualified candidates to be placed on the official ballots to be used on November 5, 1974 as candidates seeking the nomination as Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County\u201d; and \u201c[t]hat the voters of Baltimore County, by virtue of the Constitution of Maryland, are unaware that they are voting for candidates who have not been certified nor do they meet the qualifications for the office of Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court as set forth in the Constitution of the State of Maryland.\u201d It was prayed that the Board might \u201cbe enjoined from placing the names of any candidate who is not a member of the Bar of the State of Maryland or who has not been admitted to the practice of law in the State of Maryland ... on the ballot to be used in the General Election of Baltimore County on the 5th day of November, 1974,\u201d and that the Board, \u201cin so doing, disqualify the three Democratic candidates . . . nominated in the primary election, namely Alexander B. Page, Jr., T. Burgess Hamilton, Sr. and Suzanne Mensh, and place, the names of the three qualified candidates who have accumulated the highest number of votes in the primary election as nominees for the Democratic party\u201d for the then forthcoming general election. Alexander B. Page, Jr., T. Burgess Hamilton, Sr., and Suzanne Mensh were granted leave to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The dispute revolves around Maryland Constitution Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and 40, which state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cSection 1. Judicial power vested in enumerated courts; courts of record; seals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cThe Judicial power of this State shall be vested in a Court of Appeals, . . .

Qualifications of judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201cThe Judges of all of the said Courts shall be citizens of the State of Maryland, and qualified voters under this Constitution, and shall have resided therein not less than five years, and not less than six months next preceding their election, or appointment, as the case may be, in the city, county, district, judicial circuit, intermediate appellate judicial circuit or appellate judicial circuit for which they may be, respectively, elected or appointed. They shall be not less than thirty years of age at the time of their election or appointment, and shall be selected from those who have been admitted to practice law in this State, and who are most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201cSection 40.

The chancellor (Raine, J.) sustained a demurrer to the bill of complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the bill. The petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and then applied to us for the writ of certiorari prior to the hearing of the case in that court. We granted the petition and advanced the case for argument because of the public importance of the question here presented, a question not heretofore determined by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Except for the additions of provisions for \u201csuch intermediate courts of appeal, as shall be provided by law by the General Assembly,\u201d and for the District Court, and the deletion at the time of the adoption of the District Court amendment of the earlier provisions for justices of the peace, \u00a7 1 reads as it was adopted in 1867 and as it was originally reported to the floor of the Constitutional Convention of that year. <em>See Proceedings of the State Convention of Maryland to Frame a New Constitution </em>333, 736 (1867). With the exception of slightly different language relative to the courts in Baltimore City, the section also read when proposed and adopted as did the same section in the Constitution of 1864. The language of \u00a7 2 as originally proposed and as it existed until 1966 referred only to judicial circuits. <em>Proceedings </em>at 333. No reference has been made by the litigants here to \u00a7 3, but as introduced into that convention and as adopted that section provided that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Judges of the said several Courts [should] be elected ... by the qualified voters in their respective Judicial Circuits ... .\u201d The original styling as reflected in the Report of the Committee Upon the Judiciary Department of the 1867 convention and as carried forward in the Constitution to this day reads immediately prior to \u00a7 1 <em>\u201cPart I </em>\u2014 <em>General Provisions. \u2019\u2019Proceedings </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For historical background as to probate law in Maryland before and after the adoption of Chapter 101 of the Acts of 1798 providing for orphans\u2019 courts see 1 P. Sykes, <em>Maryland Probate Law and Practice </em>1-9 (1956); C. Dorsey, <em>The Statutory Testamentary Law of Maryland </em>9-15 (1838); and the address entitled \u201cOrphans\u2019 Courts\u201d of then Chief Judge Marbury of this Court as President of the Maryland State Bar Association, 52 Trans, of Md. St. B. Ass\u2019n 241 (1947). Specific provision was made in \u00a7 2 of Art. IV of the Constitution of 1864 that its provisions'were not applicable to the orphans\u2019 courts. The proposal of the Committee Upon the Judiciary Department of the 1867 convention was that \u201c[t]here [should] be an Orphans\u2019 Court in the city of Baltimore, and in each of the counties of this State, to be he[d in the case of the city of Baltimore, by one of the Judges of the \u2018Supreme Court of Baltimore City\u2019 assigned thereto, and in the case of the counties by the Judges of the respective Circuit Courts . . . .\u201d <em>Proceedings </em>at 341, and P. Perlman, <em>Debates of the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1867 </em>at 399 (1923). The provisions relative to orphans\u2019 courts and registers of wills were headed in that report \u201cPart V \u2014 Orphans\u2019 Courts,\u201d under which heading \u00a7\u00a7 40-41 appear today. <em>Proceedings </em>at 341. Other headings used were \u201cPart II \u2014 Court of Appeals,\u201d \u201cPart III \u2014 Circuit Courts,\u201d \u201cPart IV \u2014 Courts of Baltimore City,\u201d \u201cPart VI \u2014 Justices of the Peace,\u201d and \u201cPart VII \u2014 Sheriffs,\u201d headings still in use except for the substitution of \u201cCourts of Appeal\u201d for \u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d after provision for what is now the Court of Special Appeals and the further substitution of \u201cDistrict Court\u201d for \u201cJustices of the Peace\u201d when the District Court replaced justices of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The 1867 convention met on May 8 for its initial session. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>On May 16 Delegate Henry F. Garey of the Second Legislative District of Baltimore City submitted a proposal that \u201cthe Committee on the Judiciary Department consider upon the propriety of the abolition of the Orphan\u2019s Court system of the State, and the substitution of a method better adapted to the transaction of testamentary business.\u201d <em>Proceedings </em>at 47, and Perlman, <em>op. cit. </em>73. The order was duly adopted. On May 18 Delegate Richard H. Alvey of Washington County, later Chief Judge of this Court, submitted.an order, likewise adopted, calling, among other things, for \u201c[a]bolishing the Orphans\u2019 Courts as [then] constituted, and conferring upon said county Judge[s] all the powers and jurisdiction thereof.\u201d <em>Proceedings </em>at 72, and Perlman, <em>op. cit. </em>85. When the convention took up on August 3 that portion of its committee report on the judiciary article dealing with orphans\u2019 courts, Delegate William M. Merrick of Howard County proposed a substitute. It was in the basic language of the present \u00a7 40. <em>Proceedings </em>at 537, and Perlman, <em>op. cit. </em>399, 400. This was adopted on August 6. <em>Proceedings </em>at 562, and Perlman, <em>op. cit. </em>410-411. The Perlman account must be placed in the context as stated in the preface to it, after lamenting \u201cthe failure to preserve the debates, [which] would have been of inestimable value in arriving at the true construction of provisions written into the Maryland Constitution for the first time by that Convention,\u201d and reference to \u201c[a] search of the files of The Sun\u201d for data \u201clater used in the argument\u201d of a case in this Court, that \u201c[t]he accounts in The Sun were reported with such apparent care that it was suggested that the articles on the Convention should be compiled and printed so as to make them accessible to those desiring information on the subject.\u201d Perlman records relative to the adoption of the Merrick substitute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cPart five of the report, relative to the Orphans\u2019 Courts, was then taken up, the substitute offered by Mr. Merrick <em>(preserving the present system) </em>for the 38th section being under consideration, and the pending question being on the amendment of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Brent to prohibit the Orphans\u2019 Courts from the power to order sales of real estate, which was not agreed to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cAfter some discussion, and the rejection of various amendments, the substitute of Mr. Merrick was adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410-11. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Under what was the then \u201cpresent system\u201d orphans\u2019 court judges were not required to be lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In this regard it should be noted that the qualifications for an orphans\u2019 court judge set forth in \u00a7 43 of the 1864 Constitution, that he be \u201cat the time of his election a citizen of the United States and resident for twelve months in the city or county for which he may be elected,\u201d are identical with those in \u00a7 40. The comparable section in the Constitution of 1851 was \u00a7 17 which provided that such judges should \u201cbe citizens of the State of Maryland and citizens of the city or county for which they [might] be severally elected at the time of their election.\u201d All three Constitutions provided in identical language for the orphans\u2019 courts to \u201chave all the powers now vested in the Orphans\u2019 Courts of the State, subject to such changes as the Legislature may prescribe.\u201d No provision relative to an orphans\u2019 court appeared in the Constitution of 1776. The divisions in Art. IV of the Constitution of 1864 are identical with those in Art. IV of the Constitution of 1867, that is the styling by numbered parts with the headings \u201cGeneral Provisions,\u201d \u201cOrphans\u2019 Courts,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It is stated in 16 Am.Jur.2d <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 64 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">\u201cThe fundamental principle of constitutional construction is that effect must be given to the intent of the framers of the organic law and of the people adopting it. This is the polestar in the construction of constitutions. A constitutional clause must be construed reasonably to carry out the intention of the framers, and should not be construed so as to defeat the obvious intent if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>another construction equally in accordance with the words and sense may be adopted which will enforce and carry out the intent. The intent must be gathered from both the letter and spirit of the document, the rule being that a written constitution is to be interpreted in the same spirit in which it was produced. The court should put itself as nearly as possible in the position of the men who framed the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cWherever the purpose of the framers of a constitution is clearly expressed, it will be followed by the courts. If the terms of a constitutional provision are not entirely free from doubt, they must be interpreted as nearly as possible in consonance with the objects and purposes in contemplation at the time of their adoption, because in construing a constitutional provision, its general scope and object should be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">A similar statement is found in 16 C.J.S. <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 16 (1956), with citation to <em>Schneider v. Lansdale, </em>191 Md. 317, 61 A. 2d 671 (1948), and <em>Beall v. State, </em>131 Md. 669, 103 A. 99 (1917). Neither of these cases specifically states the rule, but in both cases this Court sought to ascertain the intent of the framers.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The title or heading of a statute has been held relevant in attempting to ascertain its intent and purpose. <em>Mass Transit Adm. v. Balto. Co. Revenue Auth., </em>267 Md. 687, 695-696, 298 A. 2d 413 (1973). The history of a legislative enactment has been held to often shed light upon its intent and to be of aid in construing its terms. <em>Truitt v. Board of Public Works, </em>243 Md. 375, 389, 221 A. 2d 370 (1966). The subheadings within a constitution and its history should be considered as equally relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\"><em>In New Cent. Co. v. George\u2019s Creek Co., </em>37 Md. 537 (1873), our predecessors, in construing the Constitution of this State, applied the rule of statutory construction concerning a presumption against retroactivity. Judge Alvey there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>stated for our predecessors at page 557: \u201cThere can be no good reason suggested why this same general principle, so wise and just, should not also apply as a rule of interpretation of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In <em>Johnson v. Duke, </em>180 Md. 434, 24 A. 2d 304 (1942), Judge Delaplaine said for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cIt is an elementary rule of interpretation that effect should be given, if possible, to every section and clause of a written Constitution; and where there is a special provision in conflict with a general provision, the special provision should be <em>given </em>effect to the extent of its scope, leaving the general provision to control in cases where the special provision does not apply.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 440.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">To like effect <em>see </em>16 Am.Jur.2d, <em>op. cit. </em>\u00a7 69. In <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner, </em>211 Md. 357, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956), Judge Hammond said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cIt is a hornbook rule of statutory construction that, in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, all parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part and that all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible. <em>Bickel v. Nice, </em>173 Md. 1, 6; <em>Baltimore v. Deegan, </em>163 Md. 234, 238; <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority, </em>180 Md. 457, 463; <em>Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 623; <em>Frazier v. Warfield, </em>13 Md. 279, 301. A corollary rule of construction is that if there is no clear indication to the contrary and it is reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\"><em>Accord, A. H. Smith Sand &amp; Gravel v. Dep't, </em>270 Md. 652, 659, 313 A. 2d 820 (1974); <em>Anne Arundel County v. Moushabek, </em>269 Md. 419, 426, 306 A. 2d 517 (1973); <em>Parker v. Junior Press Printing, </em>266 Md. 721, 725, 296 A. 2d 377 (1972); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beard, </em>266 Md. 83, 91, 291 A. 2d 636 (1972); and <em>Baltimore City v. United Stores, </em>250 Md. 361, 368, 243 A. 2d 521 (1968). We conclude that these rules should be applied here in the process of interpretation of the Constitution of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Applying these rules, we note that \u00a7 2 appears under <em>\u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d </em>while \u00a7 40 appears under <em>\u201cOrphans\u2019 Courts.\u201d </em>The qualifications for judges set forth in \u00a7 2 are that they \u201cbe citizens of the State of Maryland, and qualified voters under this Constitution,\u201d and that they \u201cshall have resided therein not less than five years, and not less than six months next preceding their election, or appointment, as the case may be, [in the area of the State from which it is mandated that] they may be, respectively, elected or appointed.\u201d They are to be \u201cnot less than thirty years of age at the time of their election or appointment\u201d and they are to \u201cbe selected from those who have been admitted to practice law . in- this State, and who are most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal knowledge.\u201d The requirements of \u00a7 40, however, are that the \u201cJudges of the Orphans\u2019 Courts ... be citizens of the State, and residents for the twelve months preceding, in the City, or County, for which they may be elected.\u201d Not only is nothing said about their being lawyers, nothing is said about age. The time of residence within the State is not five years as in \u00a7 2, but 12 months, while the time of residence in the geographic area from which they are to be selected is 12 months, rather than six months as specified in \u00a7 2. Moreover, there is not the slightest suggestion presented here that the terms of orphans\u2019 court judges should be for 15 years as provided in \u00a7 3 for \u201c[t]he judges of the [said] several Courts,\u201d a tacit recognition of the principles of construction we have already noted. Accordingly, the only way the Constitution can be read \u201cso that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory\u201d is to conclude that \u00a7 2 of Art. IV applies to all courts of the State other than orphans\u2019 courts. Moreover, the contemporary account as reported by Perlman, said the delegates were \u201cpreserving the present system.\u201d That was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>system where orphans\u2019 court judges were not required to be lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We find this conclusion buttressed by yet another principle and that is, as it was put by Chief Judge Marbury for the Court in <em>Johns Hopkins Univ. v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 86 A. 2d 892 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201c \u2018In aid of an inquiry into the true meaning of the language used, weight may also be given to long continued contemporaneous construction by officials charged with the administration of the government, and especially by the Legislature.\u2019 <em>Norris v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 675, 676, 192 A. 531, 535. \u2018Great weight has always been attached, and very rightly attached, to contemporaneous exposition.\u2019 Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>6 Wheaton 264, 418, 5 L. Ed. 257. \u2018A contemporaneous construction placed upon a particular provision of the organic law by the legislative department of the government, acquiesced in and acted upon without ever having been questioned, followed continuously and uniformly from a very early period * * * furnishes a very strong presumption that the intention is rightly interpreted.\u2019 <em>Trustees of the Catholic Cathedral Church of Baltimore v. Manning, </em>72 Md. 116, 130, 19 A. 599, 603. <em>Wyatt v. State Roads Commission, </em>175 Md. 258, 264, 1 A. 2d 619. \u2018While the construction of statutes or constitutional provisions is a judicial function, courts may, in declaring their meaning and effect, avail themselves of the construction put upon them by the Legislature by long continued custom and acquiescence.\u2019 <em>Humphreys v. Walls, </em>169 Md. 292, 299,181 A. 735, 738.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">There is no doubt but what the leading members of the legal profession of this State from 1867 until the present time have been of the view that orphans\u2019 court judges were not required to be lawyers. Indeed, members of this Court can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>attest from their own experience and practice- to the presence of non-lawyers on the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore City in comparatively recent times. Only eleven years after the adjournment of the Constitutional Convention of 1867 Edward Otis Hinkley of the Baltimore City Bar wrote in the preface to his <em>Testamentary Law in Maryland </em>(1878):<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cAnd I have included also the law of Inheritance of Real Estate, and the law of Apprentices, because the Orphans\u2019 Courts have jurisdiction over both of these subjects, and the work is, in a great measure, designed for- the benefit of the Judges of these Courts, <em>many of whom are not learned in the law.\u201d Id. </em>at v. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The comment is made in A. Niles, <em>Maryland Constitutional Law </em>(1915), relative to \u00a7 40 of Art. IV:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cIt will be noticed that the only constitutional qualification for a judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court is that he must be a citizen of the State of Maryland and a resident, for the twelve months preceding, in the city or county for which he is elected. It is evident that the framers of the Constitution had before them the advantage of saving expense to parties interested in a decedent\u2019s estate, and providing for such parties a court easy of access and untrammeled by formal procedure, and did not place much value upon the benefit that such persons might derive from having estates settled under the supervision of competent lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201cA judge of the orphans\u2019 court may, under our Constitution, never have looked inside of a law book before he takes his seat upon the bench, and it is to the credit of the voters, and not of the Constitution, that the judges chosen, often possess marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ability to discharge the duties of their office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274-75.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The late Judge Morris A. Soper is authority for the fact that a paper presented by then Attorney General William C. Walsh to the mid-winter meeting of the Maryland State Bar Association in 1941 revived interest in judicial reform in Maryland, leading to the appointment of what came to be known as the Bond Commission. <em>See </em>M. Soper, <em>Reorganization of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>8 Md. L. Rev. 91, 98 (1944). The Commission on the Judiciary Article of the Constitution of Maryland, the \u201cBond Commission,\u201d appointed by Governor Herbert R. O\u2019Conor on November 1, 1941, was a truly outstanding one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the caption \u201cThe Orphans\u2019 Courts\u201d the Report of the Commission on the Judiciary Article of the Constitution of Maryland (1942) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cConsultation of members of the commission with lawyers and others from various parts of the state has disclosed a widespread opinion that the jurisdiction over matters of probate and the administration of estates of deceased owners should now be committed to the trained judges of the trial courts, and that the Orphans\u2019 Courts should be abolished. Plainly the work of the courts of untrained laymen in the counties causes dissatisfaction. This is the opinion of members of the commission, and they recommend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>change be made, both in the counties and in Baltimore City, effective January 1, 1947, when the terms of the judges elected in the November, 1942, election will expire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cThe use of persons untrained in the law as judges of the Orphans\u2019 Courts is a survival of the practice existing before the Revolution, when trained lawyers were not required on any court of the province, although the need of training was in fact bringing lawyers to the higher courts before 1776. Beginning with the constitution of that year, all other courts of the state were by the year 1805 equipped with trained judges, but although the problems to be disposed of in probate and administration of estates were of no lesser importance and difficulty lawyers have not been required to preside over Orphans\u2019 Courts. The result has been that the regular courts of law and equity have been made available to aid in the disposition of special matters, and this division and duplication of machinery still exists. In recognition of the need for it, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore City has in practice been equipped with trained lawyers in recent years .. ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As we have already indicated, Chief Judge Ogle Marbury took occasion as President of the Maryland State Bar Association to address the association on the subject of \u201cOrphans\u2019 Courts.\u201d He referred to the statement of our predecessors in <em>Scott v. Burch, </em>6 Har. &amp; Joh. 67 (1823):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cBy the 15 sub-ch. sec. 20, of the testamentary system, (1798, ch. 101,) it is declared that the Orphans\u2019 Court shall not, under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever, not expressly given by that Act or some other law. And to avoid the necessity of a recurrence to incidental or implied authority, the powers of the Orphans\u2019 Court, both in relation to the subject-matter of its jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and the forms of its proceeding, are declared with the most formal and precise minuteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">He then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201cIt cannot be doubted that this restriction of the powers of the Orphans\u2019 Court which has continued to this day, and which has caused many difficulties which would not be experienced by any court of general jurisdiction, was due to the fact that the judges were not lawyers and it was not thought wise to give them any but the most limited jurisdiction.\u201d 52 Trans, of Md. St. B. Ass\u2019n at 253 (1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">At another point he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201cIt is a matter of interest to note that from the days of the provincial commissary down to the present time, there has been recognition of the incongruity of permitting laymen to pass upon legal matters concerned with the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">In a concluding paragraph, he referred to the \u201clack of legal knowledge on the part of the Orphans\u2019 Court Judges [as] damaging and detrimental to the interests of those coming under their jurisdiction.\u201d He then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cEventually this must be changed. All lawyers know the danger, the delay and the added expense of having legal decisions made by laymen. The average individual does not realize how much easier, how much less expensive and how much more effective would be the administration of estates under the method proposed by the Bond Commission. The average individual, as a matter of fact, does not know anything about it. But when he is made to understand that at least 90% of the orders signed by Orphans\u2019 Courts are merely matters of form which could be just as easily signed by the Register of Wills, he would see no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>paying salaries to 72 extra state officials for doing this work. And when he understands that in the remaining cases important questions of law have to be decided by individuals who have no legal training, he will begin to wonder why we have kept this system so long. The reasons which caused its adoption no longer exist, and it will be changed as soon as the public realizes that it is kept solely to provide offices. No politician, however shortsighted, can afford to stand in the way of a public demand to improve this important part of our judicial system. It is part of our obligation as lawyers to see that the public understands the situation. When this happens, Orphans\u2019 Courts will be abolished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As a result of the address by Judge Marbury there was appointed by the association a Committee on Abolishing Orphans\u2019 Courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That committee, in its report submitted at tne mid-winter meeting of the Maryland State Bar Association in 1948, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201cThe judges are selected, in the great majority of instances, in the light of their claims upon or value to the. controlling party organizations with which they are affiliated rather than because of their capacity to serve or any real need for their services. They are (with rare exceptions) untrained in the law and without any other special knowledge qualifying them to deal with or determine problems incident to the administration of estate. Indeed it can be fairly said that, in the counties, the so-called judges are little more than honest and sincere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>laymen who discharge their duties by striving to comply with the advices or instruction of the Registers of Wills. It is a happy circumstance that, so far as your Committee can ascertain, the offices and functions of the Registers of Wills in this State are administered with marked ability. If such were not the case, any experienced lawyer whose professional duties bring him in frequent contact with the Orphans\u2019 Courts, particularly in the counties, can readily imagine the chaos that would prevail in those courts.\u201d 53 Trans, of Md. St. B. Ass\u2019n 28, 29 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In 1965 Governor J. Millard Taws appointed a Commission to Study and Revise the Testamentary Laws of Maryland, under the chairmanship of the Honorable William L. Henderson, a former Chief Judge of this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the letter of transmittal of its second report to the Governor and the General Assembly of Maryland the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201cThe Commission takes no position on such questions as the desirability of continuing the use of lay judges, the various and varied compensations paid judges in the different counties and Baltimore City, the operation of the Registers\u2019 offices on a fee basis, the fixing of their salaries by the Board of Public Works, the provision for the mandatory approval by the Comptroller of the employment and compensation of all employees in the offices of the Registers, and the utilization of the Registers as tax collectors. The Commission\u2019s failure to call for changes in these traditional procedures is not to be taken as an expression of approval, but simply that these subjects seem to fall outside the scope of study of the law called for in the Joint Resolution to which we owe our existence as a commission.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Second Report of Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland </em>at i (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Commission commented as a preamble to its proposed section on the orphans\u2019 courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201c[T]he Article continues the system of utilizing the three judge Court (the members of which need not be and, with the exception of Baltimore City, usually are not even members of the Bar), the varied methods of compensating the Judges in different Counties, the operation of the offices of the Registers of Wills on a fee basis, the fixing of the salaries of the Registers of Wills by the Board of Public Works, the provision for the mandatory approval by the Comptroller of the employment and compensation of all employees in the offices of the Registers of Wills, and the like. This fact is not to be construed as representing either approval or disapproval of such provisions by the Commission or by any of its members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.

There is no justification for retaining, as part of the Constitutionally-established judicial system, a separate Orphans\u2019 Court staffed for the most part by <em>lay judges, </em>sitting perhaps once a week for the purpose of signing routine orders.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On the basis of the history of \u00a7 40 extracted from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 1867, the interpretation of the Constitution following the usual procedures and rules for constitutional and statutory interpretation, the interpretation almost contemporaneous with its adoption by Hinkley, and the long continued interpretation of the provisions by distinguished members of the legal profession of this State, including the view of it acquiesced in or stated by former Chief Judges Bond, Markell, Marbury, and Henderson of this Court and former Judges Parke and Capper of this Court, we conclude that Art.
