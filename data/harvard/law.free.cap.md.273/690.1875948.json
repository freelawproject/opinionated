S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), the Supreme Court held, for the first time, that various of the federal constitutional guarantees accompanying ordinary criminal proceedings are applicable, in certain instances, to state juvenile delinquency cases. Those safeguards, all embraced within fundamental procedural due process, are: Notice of charges; the right to counsel; confrontation and cross-examination; and the privilege against self-incrimination. Appellant seeks to extend that holding \u2014 with specific reference to self-incrimination \u2014 to another area of juvenile court jurisdiction in Maryland, known as \u201cChildren in Need of Supervision\u201d (CINS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The Court of Special Appeals in Matter <em>of Carter and Spalding, </em>20 Md. App. 633, 318 A. 2d 269 (1974), upheld the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County sitting as a Juvenile Court, rejecting appellant\u2019s claim. We granted certiorari to consider whether statements made to the police by appellant \u2014 then 13 years of age \u2014 should have been suppressed; whether she was denied her constitutional right to refuse to testify; and whether she should have been permitted to cross-examine a police officer with regard to both voluntariness of the statements made to him and the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In the early morning hours of January 31, 1973, Officer Joseph W. Price, a member of the Baltimore County Police Department assigned to the Dundalk station, responded on instructions from his headquarters to a call from City Hospital to investigate a possible rape and overdose of narcotics. There, he was met by a Mr. Carter, who advised him that his daughter, age 11, had taken a white tablet which had impaired her speech, had caused a loss of equilibrium and had dilated her pupils. She had also admitted to her parents that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with an adult male on January 29 in an apartment immediately below that occupied by her family. She contrived this visit by climbing down from her bedroom window. When questioned by the police officer, the child acknowledged the episode of the 29th, and added that on the same occasion she had engaged in sexual acts with others who were present including two women. The Carters had brought their daughter to the hospital because they wanted her examined for possible sexual intercourse and treated for the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Later that morning, at approximately 6:30 A.M., Officer Price again met with the Carter family at the Dundalk police station. Also there in response to a phone call from the officer were appellant and her mother. The minister of the church attended by both families was also present. Officer Price and one of his superiors then proceeded to interrogate both girls under somewhat disorganized conditions. Much of this appears to have resulted from interference by both the minister, who exercised considerable influence over the girls, and the parents. Ultimately, with permission of the latter, Officer Price obtained written statements from both girls. The officer later testified that the parents had \u201c. . . insisted on the girls giving the information. They were at sometime, they were [sic] some yelling at the girls and the girls being upset, crying, they were trying to calm them down. They were trying to help and assist getting all the information they could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In her oral and written statements to the police that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>morning, as well as in her statements subsequently given to Juvenile Bureau detectives, appellant admitted her participation in the same events of the 29th as had been described by the Carter youngster. In doing so, she supplied the names of all those who had been in attendance on that occasion. She also recounted additional episodes of similar sexual activity in the basement of her home with male boarders residing there; and at a number of other \u201cparties\u201d in the apartment below that occupied by the Carters. She was able to attend these early-morning functions, amounting to nothing less than orgies at which adults and juveniles were in heavy attendance, by placing a sleeping pill in her mother\u2019s coffee. She was furnished the pills, and was driven to those bizarre parties by one Sheldon B. Coon, who apparently was the impresario of the \u201csex ring.\u201d He gave a pill to the girls on each occasion immediately before they departed from their residences, and again before they engaged in sexual intercourse. This seems to have had a narcotic-like influence on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After the police had struggled through their various interrogation procedures on the 31st, they took the girls to the Parkville police station, with the approval of the Department of Juvenile Services, where they were detained overnight. This step was taken because the statements furnished by the girls disclosed assaults upon them by Coon, who threatened to kill them if they ever revealed information to anyone concerning the parties. The official report filed by the police specified \u201cprotective custody\u201d as the reason for the detention. Once the police had completed the interviews, they immediately sought arrest warrants for the large number of adults identified by the girls. The men in this group were charged with \u201cstatutory rape\u201d and the women with \u201cunnatural and perverted sexual practices.\u201d In both instances, the two girls were listed as victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On the following morning, February 1, 1973, both girls were brought before Juvenile Master Kahl pursuant to petitions of the Department of Juvenile Services, which charged each with being a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d and \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>need of supervision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within the meaning and intent of Section 70-2 of Article 26 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Master found both girls to be in need of care and treatment, but, significantly, did not find them to be \u201cdelinquent.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His memorandum, dated February 1,1973, is quoted here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cPolice investigation indicates that these young girls have been <em>victimized </em>by a group of adults in the Dundalk area and elsewhere, for purposes of sexual abuse and drug experimentation. It is not known at this point just how much damage has already been done, physically and psychologically, to these girls. The situation is one of the most serious that I have encountered in my four years with the Juvenile Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cBoth girls are in need of medical treatment immediately, and notwithstanding whatever wishes the parents of the girls may have at this time, <em>I find them to be Children In Need Of Supervision </em>and am committing them to the Department of Juvenile Services for placement, with the intention that they shall be immediately admitted to the University Hospital <em>for medical evaluation and treatment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cOn February 7, 1973, they are to be transported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to the Maryland Children\u2019s Center for evaluation and return to Court one month thereafter.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">During the ensuing month, extensive psychiatric and family studies were conducted at the Maryland Children\u2019s Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On March 7, 1973, immediately upon their return from the Children\u2019s Center, the girls attended a hearing before Juvenile Master Peach. Armed with the thorough reports and comprehensive recommendation of the Children\u2019s Center, he adjudicated each girl to be \u201ca child in need of supervision\u201d and \u201cin need of care and treatment.\u201d He therefore \u201ccommitted both of them to the Department of Juvenile Services for placement and planning so that they can receive some therapy to help them cope with the problems which I am sure lie ahead for both of them.\u201d Exceptions to the findings and recommendations of the Master were duly noted on behalf of each juvenile, accompanied by a request for a <em>de novo </em>hearing before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Pursuant to the exceptions and requests, the cases came on for trial on May 3, 1973, before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County sitting as a Juvenile Court (Jenifer, J.), where extensive testimony and argument ensued in accordance with Maryland Rule 908. Shortly before the trial commenced, a written motion was filed on behalf of appellant aimed at suppressing the statements made by her to the police, to the Juvenile Service workers and to the staff of the Children\u2019s Center. At the outset of the trial, the court announced that it would reserve its ruling on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">During the course of the trial, objections to the admissibility of those statements were renewed on the grounds that the fourfold <em>Miranda </em>warnings had not been given by any of the interrogating officers prior to or during any questioning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Price, however, had announced to all those assembled at the police station that \u201canything they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>said could be used against them in a court of law if they were charged..\u201d This colloquy also appears in the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u201cMR. MEOLA: Your Honor, I would like to question the officer about what warning he did give these children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think he has to give any warning. <em>They were not in custody for the commission of a crime or for a delinquency petition at this time. </em>They were volunteered statements given with the consent at the insistence of the parents. The <em>Miranda </em>warning doesn\u2019t apply to these statements, gentlemen.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">It is this refusal that laid the groundwork for one of the three questions framed by the Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Later in the trial, when asked by the court to describe how he elicited the statements from the girls, Officer Price stated \u201cThey volunteered all of this information to begin with, and it was so bizarre I started asking questions to try to pinpoint dates and time and individuals.\u201d The confusion which reigned at the police station and the abbreviated warning announced by Officer Price are demonstrated in this excerpt from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">\u201cQ Okay, you stated earlier the parents were shouting at the girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">\u201cA Everybody was yelling at each other trying to get information, specifically from Elaine [Carter], because she was still under the influence of drugs, trying to get through to her. The parents were upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">\u201cQ You stated earlier the girls were crying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-13\">\u201cA Yes, I did, from the yelling of the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-14\">\u201cQ Whom did you make the statement to the statement they made would be used against them, to whom did you make that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-15\">\u201cA I made it to everyone in the room there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>anything they said could be used against them in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you go any further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cA Yes, sir, if they were charged with a crime, named offense. ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\u201cQ Was this ydiile they were quiet or were they still yelling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cA Everybody was milling around. I had a little bit of trouble with Reverend Gatling there. I had to threaten to arrest him just to keep him quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">\u201cQ Do you know for certain that the parents heard that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cA I cannot be certain anybody heard anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">In the course of their testimony, Officer Price and the detectives from the! Juvenile Bureau were permitted, over objection, to state what the girls had said during the various interviews. Then, an announcement by the prosecuting attorney that he proposed to call appellant to the stand as a witness drew a vigorous objection from counsel on the ground of self-incrimination. Prior to any definitive ruling by the court, however, she was shown her written statement given to Officer Price on January 31, and confirmed the truth of its contents. She also acknowledged on her direct testimony that she knew Coon and certain of the other persons for whom; adult warrants had been issued. When asked by her own counsel whether anyone at the police station had informed her that she was not required to make any statements, she replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">\u201cA Well, we more or less made it on our own. We figured we could save some more kids, but they gave us no rights or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Give you what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-14\">\u201cA Any kinds of rights, we thought we were doing the State a favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, as I understand that you said you made; the statement on your own?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-16\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>At the conclusion of the trial, the court rendered its decision orally, finding that the evidence overwhelmingly had established the girls to be in need of supervision because they had \u201cdeported themselves so as to injure or endanger themselves or others\u201d and therefore required \u201cguidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d These findings were incorporated into written orders, which also committed the girls to the jurisdiction of the Department of Juvenile Services for placement in foster homes with prescribed visitation rights granted to their parents. It is from those orders that the appeal was taken to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The contentions that the statements made to the police should have been suppressed at the court hearing; and that cross-examination of the police officer should have been permitted regarding the voluntariness of those statements and the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were rejected by the Court of Special Appeals on the basis that the questioning of the police at the hospital and at the police station was not custodial interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In holding the appellant\u2019s compelled testimony did not violate her privilege against self-incrimination, the Court of Special Appeals carefully traced the enactment of the jurisdictional category, \u201cChild in Need of Supervision,\u201d created by Chapter 432 of the Laws of 1969. As Judge Moore noted for the court, such a child refers to one who is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\u201c \u2018(1) Subject to compulsory school attendance who is habitually and without justification truant from school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">(2) Without substantial fault on the part of his parents, guardian, or other custodian, who is habitually disobedient, <em>ungovernable, </em>and beyond their control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">(3) <em>Who so deports himself as to injure or endanger himself or others; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(4) Who has committed an offense applicable only to children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">(5) Requires guidance, treatment or rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). 20 Md. App. at 649.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">This classification, therefore, stands in marked contrast to a \u201cDelinquent child,\u201d defined as one \u201c \u2018who commits a delinquent act and who requires supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u2019 [Subject to the provisions of Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d),] a \u2018Delinquent act\u2019 was defined in \u00a7 70-1 (g) as \u2018an act which is in violation of Article 66\u00bd of this Code, any other traffic violation, or an act <em>which would be a crime if done by a person who is not a child.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original). 20 Md. App. at 649-50.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Essentially, then, the Court of Special Appeals stressed the basic statutory distinctions between the delinquency and CINS categories, taking particular care to emphasize the differences in disposition which are prescribed for each. For example, Code (1957, 1966 Repl. Vol., 1972 Supp.) Art. 26, \u00a7 70-19, applicable at all times material to these proceedings, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201c(a) If a child is found to be neglected, delinquent, in need of supervision, mentally handicapped, or dependent, the court may make disposition as most suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child; but <em>no child (except a delinquent child) </em>may be confined in an institution or other facility designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children, provided that this prohibition shall not apply to facilities designed by the State Department of Juvenile Services of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201c(b) If an adequate facility required by this section has not been established, the cefprt may approve a facility under the supervision anjl control of the State departments of juvenile services, social services, mental hygiene and other appropriate child-care agencies, for temporary usd , as such facility; but the use of a facility which 'does not meet the requirement of this section! |may not continue beyond January added). 1975.\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">And \u00a7 70-21 also provided, in relevant part,j that \u201cNo child shall be committed or transferred to a pend, institution or other facility used primarily for the execution of sentences of persons convicted of a crime.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ate\">The Court of Special Appeals summed it all up in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u201cIt is evident, we think, that an 'important purpose of the legislative revision of tie juvenile code was to insulate certain forms of juvenile misconduct from the consequences of an adjudication of delinquency as described in <em>Gault. </em>The creation of the category of CINS; reflects a studied design of the legislature to insure that treatment of children guilty of misconduct peculiarly reflecting the propensities and susceptibilities of youth, will acquire none of the institutional, quasi-penal features of treatment that in <em>Gault\u2019s </em>view had been the main difference between the theory and the practice of'the juvenile court system. . . .\u201d 20 Md. App. at 653. 'I</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Thus, it \u201cdecline[d] to go further and . hold that in a proceeding upon a CINS petition due process requires that the child be permitted, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to have relevant evidence excluded and.to refuse to testify.\u201d <em>Id</em>. at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>We shall affirm, finding it necessary, however, to decide only that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-in crimination is inapplicable to this proceeding. Because we so hold, the related questions of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and voluntariness are subsumed within that holding. \u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination is, of course, related to the question of the safeguards necessary to assure that admissions or confessions are reasonably trustworthy, that they are not the mere fruits of fear or coercion, but are reliable expressions of the truth.\u201d <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 47, 87 S. Ct. at 1454.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Since this case derives its impetus from <em>Gault, </em>we pause for a careful examination of the relevant facts on which that decision is bottomed. The conduct which precipitated the police action there consisted of \u201clewd or indecent remarks\u201d allegedly made during a telephone call to the female complainant. As a consequence, Gault was charged with being, and was found by a juvenile court judge to be, a \u201cdelinquent child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Under the Arizona Juvenile Code, not unlike its Maryland counterpart, the definition of a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d includes one \u201cwho has violated a law of the state . . . .\u201d The Arizona Criminal Code provided \u201cthat a person who \u2018in the presence or hearing of any woman or child . . . uses vulgar, abusive or obscene language, is guilty of a misdemeanor. . . .\u2019 The penalty specified in the Criminal Code, which would apply to an adult, is $5 to $50, or imprisonment for not more than two months.\u201d 387 U. S. at 8-9, 87 S. Ct. at 1434. Gault, who was then 15, was committed as a juvenile delinquent to the State Industrial School \u201c \u2018for the period of his minority [that is, until 21], unless sooner discharged by due process of law.\u2019\u201d 387 U. S. at 7-8, 87 S. Ct. at 1433 (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Although some disagreement existed over what had transpired at the juvenile court hearing, there being no transcript or recording of those proceedings, it is apparent that <em>Gault </em>was predicated on alleged admissions made in response to questions propounded by the juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>judge. Since the complainant did not appear, the adjudication of delinquency appears to have rested solely on those admissions. Neither Gault nor his parents were advised that he was not required to testify or make a statement, or that an incriminating statement might result in his commitment as a \u201cdelinquent.\u201d As we have already intimated, Gault was not represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In <em>Gault, </em>the Court did not deal with the totality of the relationship between the juvenile and the state; indeed, it did not even consider the entire process applicable to juvenile \u201cdelinquents.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201c. . . We consider only the problems presented to us by this case. These relate to the proceedings by which a determination is made as to whether a juvenile is a \u2018delinquent\u2019 as a result of alleged misconduct on his part, with the consequence that he may be committed to a state institution. As to these proceedings, there appears to be little current dissent from the proposition that the Due Process Clause has a role to play. . . .\u201d 387 U. S. at 13, 87 S. Ct. at 1436.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Turning to the issue of self-incrimination, the Court again emphasized that it was \u201c. . . concerned only with a proceeding to determine whether a minor is a \u2018delinquent\u2019 and which may result in commitment to a state institution.\u201d 387 U. S. at 44, 87 S. Ct. at 1452. This same emphasis was repeated in even stronger terms when the Court said that \u201c. . . juvenile proceedings to determine \u2018delinquency,\u2019 which may lead to commitment to a state institution, must be regarded as \u2018criminal\u2019 for purposes of the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 387 U. S. at 49, 87 S. Ct. at 1455. Thus, the scope of <em>Gault </em>is clear. When the Supreme Court \u201c. . . conclude[d] that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults,\u201d 387 U. S. at 55, 87 S. Ct. at 1458, it was referring to a proceeding to determine \u201cdelinquency,\u201d <em>viz., </em>\u201c. . . an act which would be a crime if done by a person who is not a child,\u201d which is the statutory definition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Maryland. The test enunciated in <em>Gault, </em>however, is two-pronged. In addition, the \u201cdelinquency\u201d must be such that it may result in commitment to a state institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">That <em>Gault </em>must be so read is confirmed, we think, by subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court. To the panoply of constitutional safeguards extended by <em>Gault </em>has subsequently been added the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). \u201cThe Court held in <em>In re Winship . . . </em>that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is among the essentials of due process and fair treatment that must be afforded at the adjudicatory stage <em>when a juvenile is charged with an act that would constitute a crime if committed by an adult. Ivan V. v. City of New York, </em>407 U. S. 203, 92 S. Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972) (applying <em>Winship </em>retroactively) (emphasis added). <em>See McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 </em>U. S. 528, 537, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Whatever else is established by <em>Gault, </em>it is clear that labels are not controlling in determining the applicability of the Due Process Clause to juvenile proceedings. In regard to the first \u201cprong\u201d of the test, for example, it is doubtful that the <em>Gault </em>result would have been different had merely the title of the proceedings been changed from \u201cdelinquency\u201d to \u201cCINS,\u201d and all else had remained the same. The essential element is that the juvenile be charged with an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult. In <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>the Court relied on <em>Gault </em>in answering affirmatively the question \u201cwhether proof beyond a reasonable doubt is among the \u2018essentials of due process and fair treatment\u2019 required during the adjudicatory stage <em>when a juvenile is charged with an act which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult.\" </em>397 U. S. at 359 (emphasis added). The Court later added that \u201c. . . intervention [by a juvenile court] cannot take the form of subjecting the child to the stigma of a finding that he violated a criminal law and to the possibility of institutional confinement on proof insufficient to convict him were he an adult.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. <em>See Ivan V. v.

As the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A20q\">\u201c. . . A boy is charged with misconduct. The boy is committed to an institution where he may be restrained of liberty for years. It is of no constitutional consequence \u2014 and of limited practical meaning \u2014 that the institution to which he is committed is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a \u2018receiving home\u2019 or an \u2018industrial school\u2019 for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. His world becomes \u2018a building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours . . . .\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead of mother and father and sisters and brothers and friends and classmates, his world is peopled by guards, custodians, state employees, and \u2018delinquents\u2019 confined with him for anything from waywardness to rape and homicide.\u201d <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 27, 87 S. Ct. at 1443.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\u201cA proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be \u2018delinquent\u2019 and subjected to the loss of; his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.\u201d 387 U. S. at 36, 87 S. Ct. at 1448. Finally, the Court added: \u201cFor this purpose, at least, commitment j is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s \u00a1will, whether it be called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d 387 U. S. at 50, 87 S. Ct. at 1455.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In sum, then, Due Process requires that various \u00a1of the federal constitutional guarantees accompanying ordinary criminal proceedings, specifically including the privilege against self-incrimination, be made applicable tat the adjudicatory stage of those juvenile proceedings in which the act charged would constitute a crime if committed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>adult <em>and </em>which may result in confinement of the child to a state institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Other state courts that have considered the question of which proceedings should invoke an application of the <em>Gault </em>rights have reached similar conclusions. For example, California\u2019s statutory scheme is quite similar to Maryland\u2019s, an apparent difference, however, being that delinquent and CINS children may be sent to the same institutions under the California Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In that state, \u201c[j]uveniles are entitled to the fundamental protection of the Bill of Rights in proceedings that may result in confinement or other sanctions, whether the state labels these proceedings \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 (citations omitted).\u201d <em>M. v. Superior Court of Shasta County, </em>4 Cal. 3d 370, 375, 93 Cal.

Superior Court of Shasta County, supra, </em>93 Cal.

Rptr. 171, 176-77 (1968) (juvenile protected against self-incrimination \u201cwhere the essential finding of the court is that a felony . . . has been committed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Illustrative of the label fallacy is <em>In re H, </em>5 Cal.App.3d 781, 85 Cal. Rptr. 359 (1970). In that case, a juvenile was charged under \u00a7 602 [delinquency] with assault with a deadly weapon and manslaughter. The sole evidence against him was his confession that he struck the child for whom he was babysitting. The confession was suppressed, as having been illegally obtained, and the petition was dismissed. The trial judge, on his own motion, however, promptly amended the petition to charge the juvenile with being \u201cin danger of leading an idle, dissolute, lewd or immoral life\u201d under \u00a7 601 [CINS]; and then admitted the confession and sustained the petition, since the defendant was no longer charged with \u201cdelinquency.\u201d The Court of Appeal reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cEven though the amended petition was filed under section 601 [CINS], the minor rightly may demand that proof of the allegation of the <em>commission of felonies </em>must meet the same standards as if the petition was brought under section 602 [delinquency], namely, a preponderance of evidence legally admissible in the trial of <em>criminal </em>cases. . . . \u2018Thus, a confession illegally obtained cannot be relied upon to support a finding that a minor committed a crime.\u2019 (citations omitted).\u201d 85 Cal. Rptr. at 366. (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In Florida, the reasonable doubt standard is applied in the adjudicatory phase of a delinquency proceeding where the act of delinquency charged is one which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult. <em>State v. V.D.B., </em>270 So. 2d 6 (Fla. 1972). \u201cDespite the fact that the. courts have with consistency recognized the civil character of juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>proceedings, nonetheless, it is now well established that in delinquency proceedings based upon a charge of violation of criminal law (which if proved could lead to loss of liberty) criminal due process standards apply. . . .\u201d <em>In Interest of E. P., </em>291 So. 2d 238, 239 (Fla. App. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Similarly, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has held: \u201cWhere the state attempts to have a juvenile declared wayward or delinquent because he violated a state criminal statute, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>In re Pereira, </em>306 A. 2d 821, 823 (R.I. 1973). On the other hand, <em>Gault </em>rights have been held not to apply \u201cin a juvenile proceeding where no public offense is charged.\u201d <em>In re Henderson, </em>199 N.W.2d 111, 119 (Iowa 1972); <em>In re D, supra, </em>100 Cal. Rptr. at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We turn then to Cindy Ann Spalding. The state contends that the <em>Gault </em>rights do not apply to CINS because of the significant differences between those proceedings and delinquency cases. It cites these dissimilarities: CINS children may not be confined in institutions designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children; CINS children may not be placed in detention;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and CINS children may not be waived to adult criminal courts. Also, in the teeth of the <em>Gault </em>teaching that labels are of little consequence, the State nevertheless argues that the label \u201cCINS\u201d bears significantly less stigma than \u201cdelinquent.\u201d Finally, the State claims that, having been placed in a foster home, appellant was not committed to a \u201cstate institution\u201d because shelter care and foster homes are not in that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Understandably enough, appellant maintains that \u201cCINS\u201d children, though treated differently in certain respects, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the same as \u201cdelinquent\u201d children for the purpose of applying <em>Gault </em>rights. She emphasizes that at the time of her hearing, she conceivably could have been confined with delinquent children; that she could have been committed to a \u201cstate institution,\u201d and thus compelled to leave her home with a resulting curtailment of her freedom; that she is now one step closer to incarceration; and that she was charged with violating a criminal statute. Although there is much to commend these arguments, we need not decide whether the second prong of the <em>Gault </em>test, <em>i.e., </em>potential confinement of the child to a state institution, mandated an application of the privilege against self-incrimination in this case. We reach this conclusion because, in any event, we think that appellant was not <em>charged </em>in this proceeding with an act which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">As we noted earlier, the petition filed on February 1, 1973, did allege that appellant was both a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d and a \u201cchild in need of supervision.\u201d The reasons assigned for these allegations were the consumption of narcotics, the acts of sexual intercourse and perversion practiced upon her, and her ungovernability. But, in the context of all the material events which ensued during the critical period, since she was, in fact, a victim, the charge of \u201cdelinquency\u201d in the petition must be regarded as simply an unexplained anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The testimony describing the circumstances at the hospital and the police station clearly depicts the girls as victims of \u201csex\u201d crimes committed by the adults. That this was the position of the police is borne out not merely by their subsequent testimony, but also by their immediate application for adult arrest warrants listing the girls as victims; the overnight detention for the purpose of \u201cprotective custody\u201d; and the total absence of suggested criminality on the part of the girls in any police records.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Even within the Department of Juvenile Services, the \u201cdelinquency\u201d charge is out-of-step with every other official record or entry pertaining to the girls. Its own complaint form, completed on the same day as the petition, lists \u201cchild <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>in need of supervision\u201d as the single \u201coffense description.\u201d Again, on that same day, February 1, the Master referred to the girls as having \u201cbeen victimized by a group of adults,\u201d found them to be \u201cin Need of Supervision\u201d and omitted any mention of \u201cdelinquency.\u201d Nothing in their four-week commitment to Maryland Children\u2019s Center for psychiatric evaluation was inconsistent with this official attitude. Nor do the reports and recommendations of that institution reflect a contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In sum, with the elimination of the delinquency \u201ccharge\u201d by the Master on February 1, the claims of alleged \u201ccriminal\u201d conduct, on which it was premised, vanished with it. What remained was the single allegation that appellant \u201c. . . is ungovernable and beyond the control of her parent, deports herself in such a manner as to be a danger to herself and others and is in need of care and treatment.\u201d From that time forward, at least, appellant was not charged in this proceeding with any acts which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">As we have said, we do not find it necessary to rest our decision on the second prong of the test laid down by <em>Gault, </em>pertaining to possible confinement in a \u201cstate institution.\u201d It is sufficient to hold that since appellant was not charged with an act which, in the circumstances of this case, would constitute a crime if committed by an adult, the privilege against self-incrimination is not applicable to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">.

S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), and later Supreme Court cases dealing with the constitutional rights to be accorded accused children in juvenile proceedings. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970); <em>McKeiver v. Pennslyvania, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>403 U. S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971); <em>Ivan V. v. City of New York, </em>407 U. S. 203, 92 S. Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The majority opinion, in my view, correctly construes <em>Gault, </em>and the subsequent Supreme Court cases, as setting forth a two-pronged test for determining whether the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is applicable to a juvenile proceeding. The test is: (1) whether the juvenile \u201cis charged with an act that would constitute a crime if committed by an adult,\u201d <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U. S. at 359; <em>Ivan V. v. City of New York, supra, </em>407 U. S. at 203; and (2) whether the child may be \u201csubjected to the loss of his liberty,\u201d or whether the proceedings \u201cmay result in commitment to a state institution,\u201d <em>Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 36, 44, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Moreover, as the majority opinion in this case seems initially to acknowledge, labels are not controlling as to either aspect of the test. It does not matter whether the name of the proceedings is \u201cdelinquency\u201d or \u201cchild in need of supervision\u201d (\u201cCINS\u201d), or whether the loss of liberty may be commitment to an \u201cindustrial school\u201d or a \u201creceiving home.\u201d <em>Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 24, n. 31, 27. The child\u2019s entitlement to the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination depends upon the substance of the matter, namely whether he or she is charged with an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult and whether the proceedings could result in a deprivation of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Despite an apparent recognition of these principles by the majority in this case, and specifically a recognition that labels are not controlling, the majority opinion goes on to make the labels \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cCINS\u201d determinative. Although the acts by petitioner Cindy Ann Spalding which caused these proceedings, and her subsequent deprivation of liberty, would have been criminal acts if committed by an adult, the majority labels her the \u201cvictim\u201d of \u201csex crimes.\u201d Based upon this label, and the fact that the charge and title of the proceedings were later limited to a \u201cchild in need of supervision,\u201d the majority denies petitioner the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>constitutional right not to incriminate herself and upholds the action of the trial court in compelling her to take the witness stand and testify against herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">There can be no question in this case about the fact that the original basis for the charges against petitioner, and one of the grounds for the ultimate adjudication of a \u201cchild in need of supervision,\u201d was her commission of acts which would have constituted crimes if committed by an adult. In the petition to the juvenile court, filed February 1, 1973, Cindy Ann Spalding was charged with being a delinquent child and a child in need of supervision. The only specific facts alleged in the petition as a basis for the charges were that \u201crespondent has consumed controlled and prohibited narcotics and engaged in acts of sexual intercourse and sexual perversion with an unknown number of male and female adults for a period of more than one year.\u201d It was also alleged, without any additional supporting facts being set forth, that Cindy Ann Spalding was \u201cungovernable and beyond the control of her parent\u201d and was \u201ca danger to herself and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The juvenile court master, Mr. Kahl, on February 1, 1973, signed a \u201cCommitment Order,\u201d which recited that Cindy Ann Spalding has been adjudged a child in need of supervision and which committed her to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services. The \u201cMemorandum\u201d of Master Kahl which accompanied that order stated, \u201cPolice investigation indicates that these young girls have been victimized by a group of adults in the Dundalk area and elsewhere, for purposes of sexual abuse and drug experimentation.\u201d Other than a reference to the fact that the girls needed medical treatment, the sexual conduct and drug abuse constituted the only facts or basis set forth in the memorandum for the commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">On March 7, 1973, petitioner was returned from the Maryland Children\u2019s Center and was committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services by Juvenile Court Master Peach. In Master Peach\u2019s memorandum accompanying the order committing petitioner, he referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>to her \u201cparticipation in unbelievable sex orgies\u201d and the use of drugs. While the master also referred to the fact that petitioner had not been attending school and had been in the habit of sleeping until two or three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, there is no doubt that the behavior which furnished in large part the basis for the commitment order was engaging in \u201csex orgies\u201d and drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">At the juvenile court trial itself, testimony offered by the prosecution to sustain the charge of \u201cchild in need of supervision\u201d largely related to the girls\u2019 use of narcotics, to petitioner\u2019s having \u201cdrugged\u201d her mother, and to the \u201csex orgies.\u201d The trial judge, in his opinion delivered at the end of' the trial adjudicating petitioner and her co-defendant to be \u201cchildren in need of supervision,\u201d found as a fact that the girls \u201chave been associated in immoral sexual activities\u201d and have \u201cindulged\u201d in the taking of \u201cdrugs of a narcotic nature.\u201d While the trial judge also placed some weight upon petitioner\u2019s failure to attend school, there is no question but that the sexual and drug abuse activities furnished the principal factual basis for the judge\u2019s adjudication and commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Of course, using \u201ccontrolled and prohibited narcotics\u201d and engaging in \u201cacts of . . . sexual perversion,\u201d to use the language of the petition against Cindy Ann Spalding, are serious crimes in Maryland. Maryland Code (1971 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 554, punishes \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practices\u201d of the type which petitioner was alleged to have committed, by a maximum sentence of ten years in the penitentiary. Art. 27, \u00a7 276 <em>et seq., </em>the \u201cControlled Dangerous Substances\u201d law, sets forth various criminal penalties for the use of prohibited narcotic drugs. Petitioner was clearly \u201ccharged with . . . act[s] that would constitute . . . crime[s] if committed by an adult,\u201d <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U. S. at 359; <em>Ivan V. v. City of New York, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 203, and these acts furnished a large part of the basis for the ultimate \u201cCINS\u201d adjudication and commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The majority opinion states that there is a \u201cmarked contrast\u201d between the \u201cdelinquent\u201d classification and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cCINS\u201d or \u201cchild in need of supervision\u201d classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, as this case illustrates, criminal conduct may furnish the factual basis for the \u201cCINS\u201d adjudication. For example, \u201cCINS\u201d includes children who are \u201chabitually disobedient, ungovernable, and beyond [their parents\u2019] control.\u201d Code (1974), \u00a7 3-801 (f) (2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The evidence of such characteristics, as in this case, may be criminal acts. \u201cCINS\u201d also includes a child who \u201c[d]eports himself so as to injure or endanger himself or others,\u201d \u00a7 3-801 (f) (3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Of course, a child who commits criminal acts such as using narcotic drugs or \u201cdrugging\u201d someone else, is deporting herself \u201cso as to injure or endanger\u201d herself or others. This is why \u201clabels\u201d should not be, and under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions are not, controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">While not dealt with in the majority opinion, the other \u201cprong\u201d or requirement of the <em>Gault </em>test was also met in this case. While petitioner was in fact committed to a \u201cfoster home\u201d instead of an \u201cinstitution,\u201d forced living for a period of years in a \u201cfoster home\u201d and away from one\u2019s own home and family is a \u201closs of his liberty,\u201d <em>Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 36. Moreover, even if commitment to a foster home, and against the will of the child and her parents, would not be deemed to meet the second requirement of the <em>Gault </em>test, petitioner was subjected to the possibility of commitment to an institution. Code (1972 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.), Art. 52A, \u00a7 5 (c), specifically authorizes a juvenile court judge to commit a \u201cCINS\u201d child \u201cto any public or private institution . . . .\u201d As to limitations upon this authority, the pertinent statute in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, Code (1966 Repl. Vol., 1972 Cum. Supp.), Art. 26, \u00a7 70-19, authorized confinement of a \u201cCINS\u201d child in an institution provided that the institution were not designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children. There were exceptions even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that proviso. The present statute, Code (1974), \u00a7 3-832 (c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, adds the further limitation to the authority to commit \u201cCINS\u201d children to institutions, requiring that such institutions may not be juvenile training schools or something similar to juvenile training schools. Limitations upon the nature of the institutions to which \u201cCINS\u201d children may be committed do not change the fact that under Maryland law, a child adjudicated to be in need of supervision may be committed to \u201can institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time.\u201d <em>Gault, supra, </em>387 U. S. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The two-pronged test of <em>Gault </em>was therefore met in this case. Petitioner was charged with acts that would be crimes if committed by adults, and petitioner was subjected to the prospect of a loss of liberty or confinement in an institution. Consequently, under <em>Gault, </em>the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was fully applicable to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">There can be no doubt in this case that the petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were violated. At no time were the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974, <em>reh. den. </em>385 U. S. 890, 87 S. Ct. 11, 17 L.Ed.2d 121 (1966), given. Both the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals stated that petitioner was not yet in custody when her incriminating statements were first made to the police on January 31, 1973, and therefore under <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. This view of what constitutes \u201ccustody\u201d is a dubious one. The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>defined custodial interrogation as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d 384 U. S. at 444. Here, petitioner was brought to the police station by her mother at 6:30 a.m. on January 31, 1973, following a phone call from the investigating police officer and a request from the officer that she be brought to the station. As far as the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>shows, she has never been at liberty to return home since that time. She was interrogated during the day at the station, gave a written statement, and was then taken to another police station where, with the approval of the Department of Juvenile Services, she was \u201cdetained\u201d overnight. On the following morning, February 1, 1973, petitioner was formally charged and committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services. To say that petitioner was not in custody from and after the morning of January 31, 1973, is to be unrealistic. Moreover, even if it be assumed <em>arguendo </em>that petitioner was not yet in custody on January 31st, the record shows that after the first hearing before the juvenile master and the commitment order on February 1st, petitioner was interrogated further by the police and the juvenile authorities, gave information to them, and no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given at those times either.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Finally, wholly apart from the matter of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were violated when at the trial she was compelled, over her attorney\u2019s objection, to take the witness stand and testify against herself. At the trial, after several prosecution witnesses testified, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cMR. NEWELL [prosecuting attorney]: I call Cindy Ann Spalding to the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cMR. MEOLA [petitioner\u2019s attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201cMR. MEOLA: I instruct my witness not to testify at all. She may be \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, take the stand, Cindy, step up to the stand. All right, you\u2019ll be sworn first.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Petitioner was then examined extensively by the trial judge and the prosecuting attorney. Objections made by her attorney to incriminating questions were ignored or overruled. The language of the Fifth Amendment is that \u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>witness against himself . . . No more clear-cut violation of that provision could be imagined than what occurred at petitioner\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The majority opinion in this case could have significant consequences. Because Cindy Ann Spalding is labelled a \u201cvictim,\u201d and because the proceedings are called \u201cCINS\u201d instead of \u201cdelinquent,\u201d she is deemed not entitled to those constitutional rights which the Supreme Court has held are applicable in juvenile proceedings. However, if petitioner was a \u201cvictim,\u201d anytime a juvenile is engaged in criminal activity with adults, the juvenile could be said to be a \u201cvictim.\u201d A teenager might be enticed by an adult into engaging in a series of armed robberi\u00e9s with the adult, and could be viewed as a \u201cvictim.\u201d Turning to the name of the proceeding, since criminal acts may be the basis for \u201cCINS\u201d proceedings, and since an adjudication that a child is in need of supervision may lead to confinement in an institution for as long a period as an adjudication that he is delinquent, virtually all juvenile proceedings could be labelled \u201cCINS\u201d by the authorties without significant consequences. Thus by using the right labels, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cCINS,\u201d the police and juvenile authorities will be able to by-pass the requirements laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Gault.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. Actually, as the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case points out, much of what is now contained in the \u201cCINS\u201d definition was formerly included in the definition of a \u201cdelinquent\u201d child.
