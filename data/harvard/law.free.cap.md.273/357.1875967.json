J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">On September 10, 1973, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the Company) filed revised schedules of electric and steam rates with the Public Service Commission (the Commission) designed to produce an additional $32,400,000 (a 10% increase in gross annual revenues. The Company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>application was predicated upon the use of an end of the test year period or \u201cterminal\u201d rate base in valuing its utility property for rate making purposes, a rate of return of 8.35% and an increase from 3.0% to 3.2% in the composite rate of annual depreciation for the Company\u2019s electric properties. The Commission suspended the Company\u2019s proposed rates for the maximum period authorized by Maryland Code (1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 78, \u00a7 70 and held extensive hearings involving 3,000 pages of testimony and numerous exhibits (Commission\u2019s Case No. 6700).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By its Order No. 60684 and Opinion dated, respectively, March 8 and 26, 1974, the Commission concluded that the appropriate test year for rate making purposes was the twelve-month period ending October 31, 1973; that the \u201cuse of this recent test period gives almost current recognition to the level of expenses as affected by inflation and minimizes the impact of regulatory lag\u201d; that it was appropriate in the circumstances to utilize an average, rather than a terminal rate base, and that the average fair value of the Company\u2019s total utility property for rate making purposes for the test period was $1,656,625,000; that a fair and reasonable rate of return on the Company\u2019s rate base was 8.2%; and that the increased rate of annual depreciation sought by the Company for its electric properties would not be allowed. As a result, the Commission authorized the Company to increase its electric and steam rates by approximately $9,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The Company appealed to the Circuit Court for Calvert County; it claimed that the Commission\u2019s decision to employ an average, rather than a terminal rate base, constituted error since it failed to give due consideration to substantial evidence of inflation, attrition and regulatory lag, and was therefore unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and not supported by substantial evidence. The Company contended that the Commission also erred in finding that 8.2% constituted a fair rate of return on its rate base and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Commission\u2019s failure to authorize an increase in the composite depreciation rate on its electric properties from 3.0% to 3.2% completely ignored the uncontradicted evidence that such increase was justified and required.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On the record made before the Commission, the lower court (Bowen, J.), by decree dated August 29, 1974, reversed the Commission\u2019s decision to use an average rate base in valuing the Company\u2019s property for rate making purposes; the court directed instead that the Commission use an end of the test year or terminal rate base. It also reversed the Commission\u2019s finding with respect to depreciation of the Company\u2019s electric properties and ordered that the claimed depreciation rate of 3.2% be allowed. The court remanded the case to the Commission for redetermination of the proper rate of return in accordance with its opinion and \u201cin the context of the holdings herein on Depreciation and Rate Base.\u201d From the court\u2019s decree, the Commission, People\u2019s counsel, and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (an intervenor in the proceedings below) appealed; the Company filed a cross-appeal, claiming that the court\u2019s decree should be modified to require a rate of return not lower than 8.5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The Public Service Commission Law, Code, Article 78, \u00a7 68 (the Law) empowers the Commission \u201cto determine just and reasonable rates of public service companies.\u201d Section 69 of the Law specifies that \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d mean \u201crates which are not in violation of any of the provisions of this article, and which will result in an operating income to the public service company, . . . yielding, after reasonable deduction for depreciation and other necessary and proper expenses and reserves, a reasonable return upon the fair value of the company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering service to the public.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 72 provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>all final valuations made by the Commission shall be prima facie evidence of value. Section 84 (b) of the' Law provides that \u201c[i]n any proceeding involving a new rate, or change in any rate, whether temporary or permanent, the burden of proof shall be on the proponent of the new rate or change in rate.\u201d Judicial review of final decisions or orders of the Commission is authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 89-98, inclusive, of the Law. Section 91 (a) provides that such review \u201cshall be instituted in the circuit court for any county within which operations are carried on by the public service company involved, or in any equity court in Baltimore City.\u201d A \u201cfurther review\u201d is authorized by appeal to the Court of Appeals. \u00a7 98. The scope of judicial review of orders of the Commission is set forth in \u00a7 97:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">\u201cEvery final decision, order, rule or regulation of the Commission shall be prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be (1) in violation of constitutional provisions, or (2) not within the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission, or (3) made upon unlawful procedure, or (4) arbitrary or capricious, or (5) affected by other error of law, or (6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested case after hearing, such order is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Consistent with these statutory provisions, we said in <em>C. &amp; P. Tel Co. v. Public Service, </em>230 Md. 395, 401, 187 A. 2d 475, 478 (1963), that \u201cevery final decision of the Commission prima facie shall be correct and shall be affirmed on appeal <em>to the courts </em>unless shown to be unconstitutional, or without statutory authority or made upon unlawful procedure, or arbitrary or capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, or is affected by other error of law.\u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>In Balto. Gas Co. v. McQuaid, </em>220 Md. 373, 382, 152 A. 2d 825, 829-30 (1959), a case involving, as here, a determination of the rate base of a public service company, we said: \u201cOur inquiry is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>finding whether there was illegality or unreasonableness in the Commission\u2019s action \u2014 when that inquiry is finished, judicial scrutiny ends and the judicial function in the rate making process is over.\u201d Recognizing that rate making is a legislative function, <em>Gregg v. Public Service Commission, </em>121 Md. 1, 87 A. 1111 (1913), we have held repeatedly that a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission, a body informed by experience and aided by a competent and experienced staff, and that consequently an order of the Commission will not be disturbed on appeal except upon clear and satisfactory evidence that it is unlawful or unreasonable. <em>See Public Service Commission v. Balto. Trans. Co., </em>207 Md. 524, 114 A. 2d 834 (1955); <em>Balto. Trans. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., </em>206 Md. 533, 112 A. 2d 687 (1955); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Public Serv. Comm., </em>203 Md. 79, 98 A. 2d 15 (1953); <em>Pub. Serv. Commn. v. United Rwys. Co., </em>155 Md. 572, 142 A. 870 (1928); <em>Public Service Commn. v. Byron, </em>153 Md. 464, 138 A. 404 (1927). We do not, therefore, in considering the legality and reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s decision in this case, afford prima facie correctness to the decree of the court below; nor do we determine merely whether the court abused its discretion in reviewing the Commission\u2019s order, as suggested by the Company. We do not directly review the reasonableness of the determinations made by the lower court, but instead consider whether there was substantial evidence before the Commission on the record considered as a whole to support its use of an average rate base, a 3.0% composite rate of depreciation, and a 8.2% rate of return. In so determining, we are governed by principles of judicial review of decisions of administrative agencies so well articulated for the Court by Chief Judge Hammond in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-10, 236 A. 2d 282, 291-92 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cWhichever of the recognized tests the court uses \u2014 substantiality of the evidence on the record as a whole, clearly erroneous, fairly debatable or against the weight or preponderance of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>on the entire record \u2014 its appraisal or evaluation must be of the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and not an independent original estimate of or decision on the evidence. The required process is difficult to precisely articulate but it is plain that it requires restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions under any of the tests, all of which are similar. There are differences but they are slight and under any of the standards <em>the judicial review essentially should be limited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. </em>This need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>Rate Base</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">As heretofore indicated, the rate base is the \u201cfair value of the company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering service to the public\u201d upon which the Company is entitled to earn a reasonable rate of return, viz., a return which will result in as much net operating income as will yield a reasonable return on the rate base fixed. Article 78, \u00a7 69; <em>C. </em>&amp; <em>P. Tel. Co. v. Public Service, supra. </em>As we observed in <em>Balto. Gas Co. v. McQuaid, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cRate making necessarily is predictive since it is the legislative process of making a rule for the future. <em>Gregg v.

The Company submitted evidence to the Commission showing both a terminal rate base ($1,742,035,000) and an average rate base ($1,656,625,000) for the test period; a witness for People\u2019s counsel, the Commission\u2019s Chief Auditor, also made calculations of both bases, fixing the terminal rate base at $1,735,220,000 and the average at $1,648,717,000. The Company argued that a terminal rather than an average rate base should be employed to compensate for attrition, inflation, regulatory lag and the shortfall in earnings. It relied upon our decision in <em>McQuaid </em>where we approved the Commission\u2019s use of a terminal rate base to take these factors into account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In adopting the average rate base, the Commission accepted the Company\u2019s fair value calculations and followed the recommendation of witnesses for People\u2019s counsel and the General Services Administration, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>intervenor in the proceedings. In its opinion, the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201cIn the last proceeding involving the rates of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (Case No. 6542) the Commission used an average rate base and specified several reasons. In this immediately prior case the Commission on October 13, 1972, entered its Order No. 60005 authorizing an annual increase in electric rates to produce not more than $13,213,000; an annual increase in gas rates to produce not more than $1,815,000; and an annual increase in rates for steam service to produce not more than $147,000. In authorizing the increase at that time, the Commission used a test year that had ended on June 30, 1972, some three and one-half months earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cIn the present proceeding, Case No. 6700, the Commission issued its order authorizing higher rates on March 8, 1974, using as the test year, the 12 months period ended October 31,1973.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cPursuant to this Order, the Company filed rates which became effective with meter readings taken on and after March 15, 1974, and these higher rates have applicability as early as within three and one-half months of the end of the test period thus reducing regulatory lag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201cIn its decision in Case No. 6542, the Commission noted the relatively short time period that had elapsed since its Order dated May 26, 1971, authorizing the Company to increase rates in the then immediately prior case (Case No. 6395) and the application filed by the Company on April 17, 1972, in Case No. 6542 for an increase in rates. The Commission again notes the relatively short time period that has expired since its Order dated October 13, 1972, in Case No. 6542 and the filing of the petition on September 10, 1973, in this proceeding (Case No. 6700).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cThe Commission is of the opinion that a terminal rate base should not be adopted in this proceeding in view of the very recent test period for this Company and the short period of time that has elapsed since the last rate case. We conclude, therefore, that rates for the future for the Company should be set on the fair value rate base averaged over the 12 month period ended October 31, 1973, which gives appropriate recognition to past inflation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In reversing the Commission\u2019s decision, the lower court concluded that the Company was experiencing rapid growth and that the terminal rate base formed a more accurate basis of fixing rates to be paid in the future. The court said that a review of the authorities indicated a pattern of using an average rate base where economic conditions were relatively stable, companies were growing, and there was little elapsed time between the request for rate relief and the decision of the regulatory agency. The court said that where evidence shows substantial attrition or substantial regulatory lag, a terminal rate base should be used. It held that the Commission\u2019s choice of methods \u201cmust be based on the evidence presented to it and must be consistent with its actions in similar situations to satisfy the test of reasonableness.\u201d The court held that the Company had presented \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of attrition and had shown rapid inflation, rapid growth, and an inability to earn the rate of return authorized by the Commission in the Company\u2019s immediately preceding rate case. For these reasons, it concluded that \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d existed supporting the use of a terminal rate base and that, accordingly, the Commission\u2019s use of an average rate base was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We think the Commission\u2019s determination to employ an average rate base in valuing the Company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering service to the public was not illegal, arbitrary or capricious, but on the contrary was supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and should have been affirmed. In determining fair value for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>rate making purposes, \u201cthe Commission is not bound to accept any one factor or method, or any particular combination of these or to accept any particular kind of evidence.\u201d C. &amp; <em>P. Tel. Co. v. Public Service, supra, </em>230 Md. at 404, 187 A. 2d at 480. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinding of fair value must only reflect \u2018the reasonable judgment of the Commission, based on all relevant facts of which several only, or indeed but one, may prove to be controlling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Balto. Trans. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., </em>206 Md. at 547, 112 A. 2d at 693). Thus, to the extent that the Commission was reasonably convinced of the existence of the problems of inflation, attrition and regulatory lag, \u201c[i]t could have attempted to meet them in various ways,\u201d <em>McQuaid, supra, </em>220 Md. at 382, 152 A. 2d at 829. <em>See generally Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. State Corp. Comm \u2019n, </em>192 Kan. 39, 386 P. 2d 515 (1963); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Department of Public Utilities, </em>Mass., 275 N.E.2d 493 (1971); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. State, </em>113 N. H. 92, 302 A. 2d 814 (1973); <em>State v. New Jersey Bell Tel.

We are satisfied from our review of the record that the Commission considered all of these factors in deciding to adopt an average rate base. We note that in the Company\u2019s preceding rate case (No. 6542), the Commission used an average rate base. The Company did not appeal this determination. This valuation, including the method of valuation, becomes prima facie evidence in subsequent proceedings. Article 78, \u00a7 72. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201c \u2018This is not to say that its failure to protest . . . would bind or estop the Company but certainly, its acquiescence in the rate base found and used by the Commission [in the earlier case] must be put on the scale when there is weighed the lawfulness and reasonableness of the current finding.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>C. &amp; P. Tel. Co. v. Public Service, supra, </em>230 Md. at 408, 187 A. 2d at 482, quoting <em>Balto. Trans. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., supra, </em>206 Md. at 548-49, 112 A. 2d at 693. Of course, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Commission is not bound by its prior use of the average rate base. Considering, however, that the burden of proof is upon the proponent of the new rates, the Commission\u2019s use of and the Company\u2019s acquiescence in the average rate base in the immediately preceding rate case is an element tending to support the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s present decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">That inflation, attrition, and regulatory lag may exist does not mandate the Commission\u2019s use of a terminal rate base to resolve these problems. <em>Balto. Gas Co. v. McQuaid, supra; New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Department of Public Utilities, supra; Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. State Corp. Comm\u2019n, supra. But cf. North Carolina ex rel. Util.

In the present case, the Commission reduced the regulatory lag to three and one half months by using a test year ending October 31, 1973. Additionally, the choice of the latest test period for which figures were available (as distinguished from the test year originally proposed by the Company, ending June 30, 1973) provided, in the words of the Commission, \u201calmost current recognition to the level of expenses as affected by inflation ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Commission made other adjustments to compensate for inflation (and, consequently, regulatory lag and attrition). In finding that the fair value of the Company\u2019s property, averaged over the test year, amounted to $1,656,625,000 (consistent with the Company\u2019s own calculations, and including a fair value increment of $20,378,000), the Commission made the following allowances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(1) The \u201cspot\u201d figure of $41,027,000 as of October 31, 1973 for the allowance for material and supplies, as \u201cmore representative of the current level of costs\u201d than the average figure over a thirteen-month period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">(2) The Company's figure of $5,400,000 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>compensatory bank balances, necessary under present economic conditions to keep open levels of credit, rather than the figure of $650,000 which the Commission\u2019s Chief Auditor deemed fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">(3) The computation of the \u201clag study\u201d for cash working capital based upon the Company\u2019s pro forma expenses rather than upon the figures experienced in the past, thus allowing inclusion in the rate base of $22,811,000, as recommended by the Company instead of $17,704,000, as recommended by the Commission\u2019s Chief Auditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">(4) The value of land held for future use at the Perryman site ($2,925,490) over objection of People\u2019s counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(5) The rate of capitalization in the allowance for funds used during construction, which rate had been increased from 6.5% to 7.69% in the preceding case (No. 6542).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Commission also made adjustments to compensate for inflation by reducing the Company\u2019s net operating income by $2,807,000 to reflect annualized wage increases, higher pension costs, and greater research and development expenses. (This reduction for expenses not actually incurred throughout the test year, would appear to be equivalent to an increase of approximately $34.2 million in the rate base, for the purposes of determining the additional revenue to be produced by the new rates.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Contrary to the lower court\u2019s holding, the Company\u2019s failure to earn the authorized rate of return is not the \u201cfinal test\u201d of attrition. An authorized rate of return is not a guarantee of any level of revenues or return. See, <em>e.g., </em>1 A. J. G. Priest, <em>Principles of Public Utility Regulation </em>202-03 (1969). Rather, attrition is evidenced by a decline in the earned rate of return. Furthermore, even if the evidence that the Company had failed to earn its authorized rate of return was not disputed (and there was evidence to the contrary), the evidence of a decline in the actual rate of return, and of the factors causing it, was conflicting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>inconclusive. For example, the Company offered as evidence of attrition an exhibit showing increases in plant investment per customer and additional plant investment per additional customer from 1967 to 1972. The Commission\u2019s Chief Auditor criticized this exhibit and offered evidence showing that while the electric utility plant in service per customer increased from $993 in 1967 to $1,501 in 1972, the Company\u2019s gross revenue per customer had increased from $273 to $418 and its net operating income per customer had increased from $57 to $98 (an increase of 71.93%). The Company, through its president, also claimed that increased wages and salaries had contributed to the attrition of the Company\u2019s earnings, yet the Company\u2019s evidence showed that labor costs per kilowatt hour had remained constant in 1972 and 1973 at 33$. Given the contradictory and unexplained nature of the evidence of attrition, and the testimony of the expert witness for People\u2019s counsel that use of an average rate base best ties in the rate base with the actual revenues produced by it, the expenses incurred, and the investment made, we cannot find that the Commission\u2019s use of an average, rather than terminal rate base, was unlawful or unreasonable. We note, in so concluding, that there was evidence before the Commission that use of a terminal rate base may result in distortion, since the revenues earned during the test year may not correspond to the rate base at the end of the year. Indeed, the Company\u2019s financial officer, F. Edward Rugemer, testified that the Company had gained new customers; that usage had increased 11-14% during the test year; but that no adjustment in the revenues for the test year to reflect these increases was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We note also the relatively short period of time since the Company\u2019s last two rate proceedings. While the Company argues that at best this is irrelevant, and at worst it shows the Company\u2019s inability to earn its authorized rate of return, it demonstrates the ability of the Commission to respond quickly to the Company\u2019s request for rate increases and thus constitutes an effective means of correction for attrition. Between November 10, 1970, when the Company, filed an application for rate increases in Case No. 6395, and March 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>1974, when the Commission issued its order in Case No. 6700, the Commission fully considered three cases (Nos. 6395, 6542, and 6700) and granted increases in rates of, respectively, $20,828,231; $15,175,000; and $9,077,000. Aside from the putative attrition throughout any test year, the Commission\u2019s almost yearly consideration of rate requests can effectively prevent any longer term attrition. Under these circumstances, use by the Commission of a terminal rate base would hardly be mandated, as directed by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">To the Commission is committed the ascertainment of facts which rest in conflicting evidence, and we must not substitute our judgment for that of the Commission. Consequently, considering all of the evidence before the Commission and the various ways in which the Commission dealt with the Company\u2019s requests, we hold that the Commission\u2019s use of the average rate base was supported by substantial evidence and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>Depreciation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Contrary to the holding of the lower court, we think that the Commission\u2019s decision to continue to allow a composite depreciation rate for the Company\u2019s electric properties of 3% and to deny the Company\u2019s request to increase the rate to 3.2% was neither illegal, arbitrary or capricious, nor unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Company for a number of years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>prior to the filing of the instant case had been using a composite rate of 3% to depreciate its electric properties. It sought to increase its 3% depreciation allowance, which amounted to $31,260,000, to 3.2% or $33,281,000. In passing upon the Company\u2019s request, the Commission set forth a detailed summary of the evidence adduced by the Company to justify the proposed increase; it concluded \u201cthat no change in the level of the depreciation rates for electric property, which are based in part on changes in technology, should be made in this rate case\u201d and that the proposed change \u201cshould be the subject of separate future consideration by the Commission.\u201d The lower court viewed this determination as an unlawful deferral beyond the maximum time limit permitted by Article 78, \u00a7 70. In the alternative, the court stated that, if the Commission\u2019s action constituted a denial of the increase, the denial was \u201cunsupported by any competent evidence before the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We agree that it was incumbent upon the Commission to decide whether the requested increase was justified by the evidence. We do not think, however, that the Commission\u2019s decision constituted an unlawful deferral of the question. The Commission fixed the rate of depreciation at 3.0% because it believed \u201cno change\u201d was necessary. Although its reasons for denying the increase leave much to be desired, the Commission\u2019s decision to retain a 3% rate of depreciation was neither illegal nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Company\u2019s request for a higher rate of depreciation was based upon asserted rapid changes in technology and the need for earlier retirement of facilities to comply with environmental requirements. To support its claim, the Company presented the expert testimony of George Faust, a principal consulting engineer with Gilbert Associates, Inc. Faust described the various methods by which he arrived at his conclusion. Following the straight line remaining life method, he estimated the average remaining lives of various types of property; he estimated the amount of net salvage; and, after accounting for obsolescence, he determined the remaining life accrual. From this data, he concluded that a 3.5% composite depreciation rate would be reasonable. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the 3.2% rate of depreciation requested by the Company was within the ambit of the witness\u2019 conclusions. Faust was extensively cross-examined. He said that the determination of the lives of the Company\u2019s various properties was a matter of judgment; that there had been a divergence of opinion among the Company\u2019s operations, engineering, and finance employees; and that a subsequent study would probably result in a different estimate of the lives of the property. The Commission thus had before it only one expert\u2019s opinion concerning the appropriate rate of depreciation, and could use its expertise to evaluate the expert\u2019s testimony and to accept or reject it. <em>See, e.g., Duncan v. McNitt Coal Co., 212 </em>Md. 386, 129 A. 2d 523 (1957). <em>See also Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Stallings, </em>165 Md. 615, 170 A. 163 (1934), and Cohen, <em>Some Aspects of Maryland Administrative Law, </em>24 Md. L. Rev. 1, 16-18 (1964). While Faust thoroughly explained the procedures by wTiich he arrived at his conclusions, there was no direct evidence to support the Company\u2019s contention of rapid changes in technology or accelerated retirement of facilities caused by environmental concerns. Other than to state that there had been considerable expenditures made for environmental protection, Faust was unable to affirm that such changes required an increase in the rate of depreciation. Moreover, Faust testified that changes in technology, still far off in the future, would not affect the current depreciation. Thus, while his conclusions may have been reasonable, they did not demonstrate that a change in circumstances required an increase in the 3% rate of depreciation previously found reasonable by the Commission. Since the Commission could reasonably have concluded that the Company had not carried its burden of justifying the requested increase in the depreciation rate, the continuation of the 3.0% rate was not unreasonable. <em>Cf.

Public Service, supra, </em>230 Md. at 406, 187 A. 2d at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\n<em>Rate of Return</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The 8.2% rate of return fixed by the Commission was neither unlawful, arbitrary, capricious nor unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Three expert \u201crate of return\u201d witnesses testified before the Commission \u2014 Dr. Phillips for the Company, Edgar Bernstein for People\u2019s counsel, and Jerome Nicholas for the General Services Administration. Each witness, in giving his opinion of a fair rate of return on the Company\u2019s rate base, purported to be guided by the governing criteria established by the Supreme Court in <em>Bluefield Waterworks &amp; Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>262 U. S. 679, 43 S. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. 1176 (1923) and <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U. S. 591, 64 S. Ct. 281, 88 L. Ed. 333 (1944).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There were no substantial differences between the testimony of the three experts except with respect to the appropriate rate of return on common equity. Phillips said that the cost rate to be used on common equity was between 13.5% and 14.0%; Nicholas testified that the rate should be 11.81%; and Bernstein arrived at a return of 11.5%. Phillips and Nicholas found that the cost component of the Company\u2019s long-term debt was 5.93% while Bernstein found it to be 5.92%. Phillips and Nicholas found the cost component of preferred stock to be 7.02% while Bernstein fixed the figure at 7.11%. Applying these cost components to the Company\u2019s capital structure as of October 31, 1973, Phillips testified that the fair rate of return on the rate base was from 8.95% to 9.14%; Bernstein said it was 8.2% and Nicholas said it was 8.3%.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>InBalto. Trans. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., supra, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cThere is no requirement that there must be any given percentage of return on the fair value of property. Between the lowest return that is not unreasonable to the point of being confiscatory and the highest that is not inordinate, there is a rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>wide zone in which a return may be reasonable under some circumstances and not under others.\u201d 206 Md. at 555,112 A. 2d at 697.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We think that the Commission\u2019s determination (Commissioner Shoemaker dissenting), that a fair rate of return was 8.2%, was within the zone of reasonableness and was plainly supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The City raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Calvert County to entertain the appeal, and it alone pursues the issue here. The controlling statutory provision is Article 78, \u00a7 91:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cProceedings for review under \u00a7 90 of this article shall be instituted in the circuit court for any county <em>within which operations are carried on by the public service company involved, </em>or in any equity court in Baltimore City.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">As revealed in the proceedings below, in 1973 the Company had in Calvert County approximately 2,100 electric customers, which amounted to 0.283% of all its electric customers, and no gas or steam customers. These customers produced $650,000 in revenues, about 0.184% of its electric revenues ($353,432,000) and 0.137% of its total revenues ($473,622,000). The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant had not been completed as of March 31, 1974, but over $545 million had been expended for its construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The City urges that the Company is not carrying on operations in Calvert County because it does a minimal amount of business, compared with its total operations, in Calvert County. It relies upon <em>Liller v. Logsdon, </em>261 Md. 367, 370, 275 A. 2d 469, 471 (1971) where, citing from <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1581 (unabridged ed. 1961), we defined the term \u201coperations\u201d as \u201cthe whole process of planning for and operating a business or other organized unit.\u201d Since the Company\u2019s operations in Calvert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>County were \u201cso miniscule in relationship\u201d to its entire operations, the City contends that the lower court had no jurisdiction in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We think the City\u2019s argument is frivolous. In construing \u00a7 91, we should give effect to the legislative intent as expressed by the words used. <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 306 A. 2d 534 (1973); <em>Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 298 A. 2d 427 (1973). The statute requires that \u201coperations\u201d be carried on in the county in which review is sought, not that a substantial part of the operations be carried on in that county. In view of the evidence, it is patent that the Company carries on \u201coperations\u201d in Calvert County and that the Circuit Court for Calvert County had jurisdiction to hear the Company\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Decree of Circuit Court for Calvert County vacated; order No. 60681 of the Public Service Commission in case No. 6700 affirmed as to all issues decided by this opinion; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-5\">.

The orthodox making of public utility rates requires four basic determinations: (1) what are the enterprise\u2019s gross utility revenues under the rate structure examined; (2) what are its operating expenses, including maintenance, depreciation and all taxes, appropriately incurred to produce those gross revenues; (3) what utility property provides the service for which rates are charged and thus represents the base (rate base) on which a return should be earned and (4) what percentage figure (rate of return) should be applied to the rate base in order to establish the return to which investors in the utility enterprise are reasonably entitled. 1 A.

Inflation, of course, increases the cost of providing service, although rates remain stable throughout the test year; \u201cattrition\u201d is the term applied to the reduction in the rate of earnings resulting from additions to plant at costs higher than the value of similar items in the rate base, so that the relation between rate base and rate of return deteriorates. In other words, attrition \u2014 the decline in the rate of return earned \u2014 results when the rate base expands faster than the revenue and is caused both by inflation and by expansionistic construction programs which do not generate additional comparable revenue. Regulatory lag is the delay in securing rate relief after the need has become known. <em>McQuaid, supra, </em>220 Md. at 381, 152 A. 2d at 829.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">.
