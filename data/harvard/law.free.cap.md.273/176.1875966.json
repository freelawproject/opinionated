Murphy, J.) which upheld the Maryland State Board of Censors\u2019 refusal to grant a license for exhibition of the film \u201cDeep Throat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">On May 23, 1974, petitioner, on behalf of North Cinema, Inc., submitted the motion picture entitled \u201cDeep Throat\u201d to the Maryland State Board of Censors for review pursuant to Maryland Code (1970 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.), Art. 66A, \u00a7 17. The next day, the Board of Censors issued a rejection order and filed a petition for review in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, as required by Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 (a). On May 30, 1974, petitioner filed a petition for continuance in the circuit court. On May 31, 1974, after a hearing, the court granted petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance, but the court issued an interlocutory injunction temporarily restraining further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>showing of the film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d in the State of Maryland until such time as the court had rendered a final judgment in the matter. The petitioner took an appeal from the interlocutory injunction on the same day, May 31, 1974. On July 31, 1974, the Court of Special Appeals, on respondent\u2019s motion, dismissed the appeal from the interlocutory injunction on the ground that it was moot. Subsequently, this Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the dismissal by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">While the appeal from the interlocutory injunction was pending, the trial judge viewed the movie at a closed showing at the court house and, again, at petitioner\u2019s request, at the theater of the petitioner. At a hearing before Judge Murphy, the film itself together with the rejection order and the minutes of the May 24 Censor Board meeting were introduced. The petitioner presented five \u201cexpert witnesses.\u201d All five of the expert witnesses testified that they did not believe that \u201cDeep Throat\u201d was patently offensive to community standards. All but one stated that the film did not appeal to the prurient interest of the average adult. Only Dr. Nachand, a psychologist, testified to artistic and scientific value, though two other witnesses made reference to the \u201cparody\u201d or \u201csatire\u201d involved in the film. All of the petitioner\u2019s experts had difficulty describing what to them would be pornographic. Only Paul Walker, a psychology instructor at the University of Baltimore, got beyond words such as \u201cunhealthy,\u201d \u201cmorbid,\u201d \u201cpathological.\u201d Mr. Walker stated that films which advocated \u201cbrutality,\u201d \u201cexploitation,\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d would be pornographic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On June 24, 1974, while the appeal from the interlocutory injunction was still pending, Judge Murphy issued his opinion and order disapproving the film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d for licensing by the Board of Censors and affirming the May 24, 1974, finding of the Censor Board. Judge Murphy found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>film to be obscene under the definition set forth in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U. S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419, <em>reh. denied, </em>414 U. S. 881, 94 S. Ct. 26, 38 L.Ed.2d 128 (1973). On the same day, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Because of the importance of the issues in this case, we granted a writ of certiorari prior to a decision by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The petitioner advances three principal arguments for reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision. (1) The appeal from the issuance of the interlocutory injunction on May 31, 1974, deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) The film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d is not obscene under the current Supreme Court definition of that term.. (3) Maryland courts may not, consistent with Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, construe the word \u201cobscene\u201d in the Maryland movie censorship law, Code Art. 66A, to be the same as the current Supreme Court definition of \u201cobscene\u201d for First Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">While generally the filing of a notice of appeal in a case deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed further in that case, there are exceptions to this rule. <em>Bullock v. Director of Patuxent Institution, </em>231 Md. 629, 633, 190 A. 2d 789 (1963); <em>Cook v. Boehl, </em>188 Md. 581, 592, 53 A. 2d 555 (1947); <em>Dietrich v. Anderson, </em>185 Md. 103, 111, 43 A. 2d 186 (1945); <em>Barnum v. Barnum, </em>42 Md. 251, 294 (1875); <em>Smiley v. Atkinson, </em>12 Md. App. 543, 549-551, 280 A. 2d 277 (1971), <em>affd, </em>265 Md. 129, 287 A. 2d 770 (1972); <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 468, 475-476, 261 A. 2d 40 (1970). One well recognized exception is where the appeal is taken from an interlocutory or preliminary injunction. The authorities, with apparent unanimity, hold that while an appeal from an interlocutory injunction is being pursued, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>may proceed with any other issue or matter in the case. <em>Ex parte National Enameling </em>&amp; <em>Stamping Co., </em>201 U. S. 156, 162, 26 S. Ct. 404, 50 L. Ed. 707 (1906); <em>DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., </em>374 F. 2d 50, 51, n. 2 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>Janousek v. Doyle, </em>313 F. 2d 916, 920-921 (8th Cir. 1963); <em>Phelan v. Taitano, </em>233 F. 2d 117, 119 (9th Cir. 1956); <em>Students Challenging Reg. Agcy. Proc. v. United States, </em>353 F. Supp. 317, 320, n. 2 (D.D.C. 1973); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Avco Corp., </em>309 F. Supp. 703, 705 (S.D.N.Y. 1969); <em>Doudell v. Shoo, </em>159 Cal. 448, 114 P. 579, 582 (1911); <em>Nomm v. Nomm, </em>164 Cal.App.2d 663, 330 P. 2d 839, 840 (1958); <em>Cloud v. Dyess, </em>172 So. 2d 528, 531 (La. App. 1965); <em>Appeals of Sheaffer and Herkscher, </em>100 Pa. 379, 382 (1882); <em>Houston Compressed Steel Corp. v. State, </em>456 S.W.2d 768, 773 (Tex.Civ.App. 1970); <em>Lynch v. Clinch Motor Co., </em>131 Va. 202, 108 S. E. 641, 642 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Moreover, in the present situation, it was even clearer that the trial court should have been able to exercise jurisdiction despite the pendency of the appeal from the interlocutory injunction. Where the prior restraint of a film exhibition is involved, the First Amendment requires that procedures to review the film be as expeditious as possible. <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U. S. 51, 85 S. Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965). Article 66A, \u00a7 19, of the Maryland Code was amended in 1965 to conform to this requirement. <em>See Dunn v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249, 213 A. 2d 751 (1965); <em>Starv. Preller, </em>352 F. Supp. 530 (D. Md. 1972), <em>remanded for reconsideration, </em>413 U. S. 905, 93 S. Ct. 3054, 37 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1973), <em>on remand, </em>375 F. Supp. 1093 (D. Md. 1974), <em>affd, </em>419 U. S. 956, 95 S. Ct. 217, 42 L.Ed.2d 173 (1974). The State also has an interest in requiring that allegedly obscene films' be reviewed quickly. If no decision on the action of the Censor Board could be made until an appeal from an interlocutory injunction were completed, the purpose of Article 66A in requiring expeditious reviewing of the film would be frustrated whenever either side appealed from any appealable interlocutory action taken by the circuit court before a finding of obscenity was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We therefore reject the petitioner\u2019s argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>appeal from the interlocutory injunction deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction during the pendency of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Petitioner contends that the film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d is not obscene under the meaning of that term set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller v. California, supra. </em>In this connection, a brief review of some of the Supreme Court cases would be useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>343 U. S. 495, 502, 72 S. Ct. 777, 96 L. Ed. 1098 (1952), that \u201cexpression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech . . . guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d However, in <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), the Court held that \u201cobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\u201d Four justices joined Mr. Justice Brennan in stating (354 U. S. at 484):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cAll ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance \u2014 unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion \u2014 have the full protection of the [First Amendment] guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests. But implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The Court went on to adopt, as a definition of obscenity, the following <em>(id. </em>at 489):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cWhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The Court in <em>Roth </em>made it clear that it was using the term \u201cobscenity\u201d to include a limited range of material dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>with sexual matters. Mr. Justice Brennan said for the Court <em>(id. </em>at 487, n. 20):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cWe perceive no significant difference between the meaning of obscenity developed in the case law and the definition of the A.L.I., Model Penal Code, \u00a7 207.10 (2) (Tent. Draft No. 6, 1957), <em>viz.- '. . . </em>A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. . . .\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">For nine years following <em>Roth, </em>the Supreme Court did not alter its definition of obscenity. Probably the most significant discussions of the definition were the various opinions <em>in Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, </em>370 U. S. 478, 82 S. Ct. 1432, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962), and <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964). In <em>Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Harlan, in announcing the judgment of the Court, took the position that where material was aimed at a particular deviant group, the test for obscenity was whether the material was patently offensive to community standards. In <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Brennan argued for a national community standard in testing obscenity. Mr. Justice Stewart saw only \u201chard core pornography\u201d as being constitutionally unprotected and, as to a definition of that, stated: \u201cI know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\u201d (378 U. S. at 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In <em>A Book Named \u201cMemoirs\u201d v. Attorney General of Mass., </em>383 U. S. 413, 86 S. Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966), the Supreme Court again wrestled with the definition of obscenity for constitutional purposes. The plurality opinion of three justices built on the <em>Roth </em>definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, to define obscenity as follows (383 U. S. at 418):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201c . . . [t]hree elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s view of the significance of the <em>Memoirs </em>definition was set forth in <em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>where Chief Justice Burger observed (413 U. S. at 21-22):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cWhile <em>Roth </em>presumed \u2018obscenity\u2019 to be \u2018utterly without redeeming social importance,\u2019 <em>Memoirs </em>required that to prove obscenity it must be affirmatively established that the material is <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value.\u2019 Thus, even as they repeated the words of <em>Roth, </em>the <em>Memoirs </em>plurality produced a drastically altered test that called on the prosecution to prove a negative, <em>i.e., </em>that the material was <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value\u2019 \u2014 a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Following the <em>Memoirs </em>case the Court, for a period of seven years, seemed to be unable to form a majority which agreed on a definition of what constituted obscene, pornographic material subject to governmental proscription. In <em>Redrup v. New York, </em>386 U. S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414, 18 L.Ed.2d 515, <em>reh. denied, </em>388 U. S. 924, 87 S. Ct. 2091, 18 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1967), and in many cases following it, the Supreme Court summarily reversed convictions for the dissemination of materials that at least five members of the Court, for whatever reasons, found to be constitutionally protected. <em>See Miller v. California, supra, </em>413 U. S. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Recently in <em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>and four other cases decided on the same day,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> five members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Supreme Court seemed to reach agreement on a definition of obscenity for First Amendment purposes. <em>Miller </em>involved a conviction under then section 311.2(a) of the California Penal Code for knowingly distributing obscene matter. The Court formulated a constitutional definition of obscenity in the following language (413 U. S. at 24-25):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cThe basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether .\u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, <em>Kois v. Wisconsin, supra, </em>[408 U. S:] at 230, quoting <em>Roth v. United States, supra, </em>[354 U. S.] at 489; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. We do not adopt as a constitutional standard the <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value\u2019 test of <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, </em>383 U. S., at 419 .. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The Court further explained this standard <em>(id. </em>at 25):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201cIt is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion, <em>supra:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201c(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201c(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions,., and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The Supreme Court made clear that the <em>Miller </em>definition reached only \u201chard core\u201d pornography. Chief Justice Burger stated in <em>Miller (id. </em>at 27):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cUnder the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>See also Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U. S. 153, 94 S. Ct. 2750, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974); <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U. S. 87, 94 S. Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974), for recent applications of the <em>Miller </em>test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In sum, under the <em>Miller </em>definition a film depicting sexual matters would be obscene or hard-core pornography, and thus beyond the protection of the First Amendment, if it meets the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">(a) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">(b) the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined as,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">(1) patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">(2) patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">(c) the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>See Ebert v. Md. St. Bd. of Censors, supra, </em>19 Md. App. at 314-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In the instant case, the trial judge as trier of the facts viewed the film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d and found that it was obscene under the <em>Miller </em>test. The court found that it was hard-core pornography and \u201cwas nothing more or less than a so-called \u2018stag\u2019 film . . . .\u201d On the basis of our viewing the film, it is clear that this is an accurate categorization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The film \u201cDeep Throat\u201d is for the most part a series of explicit depictions of sexual acts, including cunnilingus, fellatio, masturbation, normal and anal intercourse, and group sex. Effort was obviously made by the film makers to concentrate on the actors\u2019 genitals during the scenes of sexual activity. Well over half of the length of the film was devoted to displaying these explicit sexual acts. The satirical scenes referred to by some of petitioner\u2019s witnesses were brief and sophomoric, serving as little more than introductions to the scenes of explicit sexual activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This case is the first case in which the question of hard-core pornography has been considered by this Court since the <em>Miller </em>definition was formulated by the Supreme Court. The film is clearly within the <em>Miller </em>definition of obscenity or hard-core pornography. In fact, \u201cDeep Throat\u201d would probably be deemed obscene under any meaningful definition of that term, including that set forth by the plurality opinion in <em>Memoirs. </em>It is noteworthy that in other jurisdictions where the matter has arisen, \u201cDeep Throat\u201d has consistently been found to be obscene. <em>See United States v. One Reel of Film, </em>481 F. 2d 206 (1st Cir. 1973); <em>Coleman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Wilson, </em>123 N.J.Super. 310, 302 A. 2d 555 (1973); <em>People v. Mature Enterprises, Inc., supra; S.S. W. Corporation v. Slaton, </em>231 Ga. 734, 204 S.E.2d 155 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Petitioner next argues that Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights prohibits us from construing the term \u201cobscene\u201d in the movie censorship law as having the same meaning as the <em>Miller </em>definition of constitutionally unprotected obscenity. His view is that, by so construing the statutory term, this Court would be performing a legislative function in violation of the' separation of powers principle contained in the Delaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In the <em>Miller </em>case, the Supreme Court held that, with respect to state statutes regulating obscene material, \u201cwe now confine the permissible scope of such regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct.\u201d (413 U. S. at 24.) The Court went on to say that such \u201cconduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written <em>or authoritatively construed.\" (Ibid., </em>emphasis supplied.) The majority opinion of the Supreme Court, apparently recognizing the burden upon the states if obscenity statutes had to be rewritten with every shifting majority of the Court in this area, stated <em>(ibid., </em>n. 6, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cWe do not hold, as Mr. Justice Brennan intimates, that all States other than Oregon must now enact new obscenity statutes. Other existing state statutes, <em>as construed </em>heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Thus, the Supreme Court seemed to contemplate judicial construction of the term \u201cobscene\u201d in state statutes to reflect the <em>Miller </em>definition. Nevertheless, petitioner argues that this may not be done in Maryland because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>separation of powers provision in the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Neither authority nor reason supports petitioner\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The Maryland movie censorship law has never expressly contained a definition of the term \u201cobscene\u201d which has reflected any of the definitions used by the Supreme Court from the <em>Roth </em>case onward. When the law was first enacted in 1916, the Maryland State Board of Censors was directed to disapprove such films \u201cas are sacrilegious, obscene, indecent, or immoral, or such as tend, in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals.\u201d The word \u201cobscene\u201d itself was not defined. Ch. 209 of the Acts of 1916, \u00a7 6. There were revisions of the movie censorship law in 1918, 1920 and 1922, when films which \u201cincite to crimes\u201d and which are \u201cinhuman\u201d were added to the proscribed list, but no definition of the word \u201cobscene\u201d was enacted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The movie censorship law was next revised in 1955, Ch. 201 of the Acts of 1955, when the General Assembly, <em>inter </em>alia, deleted the words \u201csacrilegious,\u201d \u201cindecent,\u201d \u201cinhuman\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d from the list of prohibited films. The section listing the films which the Board was directed to disapprove thus read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c6(a) <em>Board to </em>examine, <em>approve or disapprove films. </em>\u2014 The Board shall examine or supervise the examination of all films or views to be exhibited or used in the State of Maryland and shall approve and license such film or views which are moral and proper, and shall disapprove such as are obscene or such as tend, in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes. All films exclusively portraying current events or pictorial news of the day, commonly called news reels, may be exhibited without examination and no license or fees shall be required therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In the 1955 revision the Legislature for the first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>enacted a definition of \u201cobscene\u201d in a new subsection (b) of \u00a7 6 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201c6(b) For the purposes of this Article, a motion picture film or view shall be considered to be obscene if, when considered as a whole, its calculated purpose or dominant effect is substantially to arouse sexual desires, and if the probability of this effect is so great as to outweigh whatever other merits the film may possess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Definitions of the terms \u201ctend to debase or corrupt morals\u201d and \u201ctend to incite to crime\u201d were enacted in subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 6. Subsequent amendments to the movie censorship law have not dealt with \u00a7 6 which has remained unchanged since 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Ten years after the 1955 revision of the movie censorship law, this Court in <em>Dunn v. Md. Bd. of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249, 213 A. 2d 751 (1965), in effect held unconstitutional the direction to the Board of Censors in \u00a7 6 (a) of the Act that they disapprove films which tend \u201cto debase or corrupt morals.\u201d The Court also held unconstitutional the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d in \u00a7 6 (b) and the definition of films tending \u201cto debase or corrupt morals\u201d in \u00a7 6 (c). Finally, the Court held that the definition of \u201cobscenity\u201d to be applied under the statute was that formulated by the Supreme Court as a constitutional standard. Thus, Judge Hammond said for the Court in <em>Dunn </em>(240 Md. at 254):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cWe hold that the right and power of the Board to ban films as \u2018obscene\u2019 or as tending \u2018to debase or corrupt morals\u2019 under Sec. 6 of Art. 66A extends only to motion pictures which are obscene under the <em>Roth </em>test referred to and paraphrased in <em>Trans-Lux </em>and in this opinion. The cases of <em>Kingsley Int\u2019l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N.Y., </em>360 U. S. 684, 3 L.Ed.2d 1512, and <em>Roth </em>and <em>Jacobellis, </em>following <em>Winters v. New York, </em>333 U. S. 507, 92 L. Ed. 840, and <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>343 U. S. 495, 96 L. Ed. 1098, make it manifest that only material which is obscene under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the <em>Roth </em>test can be censored or suppressed by a state, and that a state may not effectively substitute its definition of what is obscene for the <em>Roth </em>definition.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Whatever may have been left open in the <em>Dunn </em>case concerning the standards of the movie censorship law was resolved in <em>Sanza v. Md. Board of Censors, </em>245 Md. 319, 226 A. 2d 317 (1967). In <em>Sanza, </em>this Court held that the \u201cincite to crime\u201d standard of the statute was \u201cso vague that it is unconstitutional,\u201d and that the \u201conly valid standard for disapproval of a film under the Act ... is obscenity.\u201d (245 Md. at 338.) The Court in <em>Sanza </em>went on to reiterate the prior holding in <em>Dunn </em>that \u201cobscene\u201d in the statute \u201cis limited to what can be deemed obscene in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the Court in <em>Sanza </em>held that the invalidity of the statutory standards other than \u201cobscenity,\u201d and the invalidity of the statutory definition of \u201cobscenity,\u201d did not render the entire Act invalid. In holding that the provisions of the movie censorship law were severable, this Court specifically found that the General Assembly intended to authorize the Censor Board to disapprove of films deemed \u201cobscene\u201d by the constitutionally prescribed definition of that term. Judge Oppenheimer stated for the Court in <em>Sanza (id. </em>at 339, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cWhile some of the criteria which follow are impermissibly vague, <em>the legislative intent to authorize the Board to disapprove films which are obscene by any valid test seems clear. </em>In the recent cases before us, the Board has demonstrated that, in practice, the \u2018obscene\u2019 standards of Section 6 can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>be treated as severable by limiting its findings of obscenity in accordance with the <em>Roth-Alberts </em>criteria, as the Board understands them. We hold that, faced with the eventuality that all of the standards for disapproving a film would be declared invalid other than obscenity in the constitutional sense, the Legislature nevertheless would have passed the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In the other movie censorship cases following <em>Dunn, </em>this Court has consistently applied the definition of \u201cobscenity\u201d set forth in the most recent Supreme Court cases. <em>See Hewitt v. Maryland State Bd. of Censors, </em>256 Md. 358, 260 A. 2d 319 (1970); <em>Wagonheim v. Maryland State Bd. of Censors, </em>255 Md. 297, 258 A. 2d 240 (1969), <em>affd, </em>401 U. S. 480, 91 S. Ct. 966, 28 L.Ed.2d 205 (1971); <em>Hewitt v. Maryland State Bd. of Censors, </em>254 Md. 179, 254 A. 2d 203 (1969); <em>Hewitt v. Bd. of Censors, </em>243 Md. 574, 221 A. 2d 894 (1966); <em>Leighton v. Maryland State Bd. of Censors, </em>242 Md. 705, 218 A. 2d 179 (1966).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Consequently, it has been settled by this Court\u2019s decisions that the only basis for censorship of motion pictures under Art. 66A is \u201cobscenity,\u201d and that the Legislature intended to ban only those films which are \u201cobscene\u201d under the definition of that term set forth by the Supreme Court as a constitutional standard. While the specific issue does not appear to have arisen until now, our prior decisions are totally inconsistent with. petitioner\u2019s argument that the separation of powers principle is violated by construing \u201cobscene\u201d in the movie censorship law to be the same as the constitutional definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Moreover, our prior construction of the movie censorship law, that the term \u201cobscene\u201d encompasses such sexual matter in films which may be constitutionally proscribed, does not amount to \u201cjudicial legislation\u201d in violation of the separation of powers article of the Declaration of Rights. Construing statutes in connection with applying statutory provisions to specific cases, is a large and essential part of the judicial process. It is one of the principal functions which courts were created to perform in our governmental scheme. What was said by Judge Oppenheimer for the Court in <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 101-102, 231 A. 2d 514 (1967), in rejecting an argument that a particular holding on a common law point amounted to judicial legislation in violation of the separation of powers principle, is analogous here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cThe . . . argument ignores a basic function of the judicial process. The consideration of the distinctions between one group of facts and another in deciding the application of legal rules, the classification of relationships in the light of principles of justice, history and the social welfare, the determination of rights and liabilities according to status and general circumstance \u2014 these are of the warp and woof of our judicial system. See Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>117, and Cardozo, J. in <em>Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, </em>230 N. Y. 239, 242-43, 129 N. E. 889, 891 (1921). It is judge-made law which decides the varying legal liability of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>owner of land to persons upon his property according to whether they be invitees, licensees or trespassers, and the age below which infants cannot be charged with contributory negligence. These, and many other classifications, are made as a necessary part of the judicial function. The making of such determinations violates no principle of the separation of powers, for traditionally and as an inherent part of our system of government their formulation is a necessary part of the judicial duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Ascertaining and then applying the legislative will, like the development of common law principles, is also part \u201cof the warp and woof of our judicial system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Furthermore, the construction which our prior cases have given to the term \u201cobscene\u201d in the statute is fully supported by the language and legislative history. For almost forty years, the General Assembly did not explicitly define the word but chose for the courts to define its precise meaning on a case by case basis. When the General Assembly did supply a definition of the word \u201cobscene\u201d in 1955, that definition was certainly broad enough to embrace all hard-core pornography or sexual matter which is obscene in the constitutional sense. After this Court in <em>Dunn v. Board of Censors, supra, </em>held the statutory definition of \u201cobscene\u201d unconstitutional, the General Assembly did not deem it appropriate to re-define the term. In the nine years since the <em>Dunn </em>decision, the movie censorship law has been amended on several occasions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but the Legislature has chosen not to change the definition set forth in the <em>Dunn </em>case. This certainly indicates that the definition of obscenity applied by this Court over the past nine years represents the legislative will rather than a usurpation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In oral argument before us, petitioner insisted that the film \u201cDeep Throat,\u201d if its audience were restricted to consenting adults, would do no harm and should be permitted to be shown. Some of us, because of our views of the First Amendment\u2019s scope or of the wisdom of censorship, may agree with petitioner, and some of us may not. However, we are not the appropriate forum for this particular contention. It is our duty to apply the policy determinations of the Legislature to the extent that those determinations may be applied consistent with the First Amendment. The Supreme Court, of course, is the final arbiter of First Amendment requirements. The General Assembly of Maryland has made the policy determination that pornography like \u201cDeep Throat\u201d should not be licensed for viewing, even viewing limited to consenting adults, and the Supreme Court has held that such a determination is constitutionally valid. If petitioner is aggrieved by the policy determination, his remedy is a legislative one. If he disagrees with the Supreme Court\u2019s view of the First Amendment\u2019s scope in this area, the appropriate forum is that Court. Our role is to determine whether the film is \u201cobscene\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Code and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, and we conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Petitioner to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">. Petitioner also submitted to the trial court a public opinion survey taken in Maryland concerning attitudes toward depiction of explicit sexual acts in movies and magazines. The survey made no reference to \u201cDeep Throat\u201d and therefore was of little relevance to the present issue. In any case, the survey results were inconclusive, contradictory and offered little support to petitioner\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">. Petitioner raised other issues concerning the May 31, 1974, interlocutory injunction which we need not, and do not, reach. They are pertinent only to the appeal from the interlocutory injunction, and were raised in that appeal. As previously mentioned, that appeal was dismissed as moot, and this Court denied certiorari on September 11,1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">.
