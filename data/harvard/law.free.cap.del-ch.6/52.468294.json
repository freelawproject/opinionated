The authority of a court of equity to restrain the pollution of natural streams, where such pollution will cause irreparable injury and loss to a riparian owner in his accustomed and necessary le- \u25a0 gal use of the waters thereof, is unquestionable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-13\">3. Where the danger threatened is of such a nature that it cannot easily be remedied in case of a refusal of relief, and the answer does not deny that the act charged is contemplated, an interlocutory injunction will be allowed, unless the equities of the bill are satisfactorily refuted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-15\">4. A preliminary injunction granted\u2014at the suit of a riparian owner operating paper-pulp works on a natural stream, the use of the water of which in an unpolluted condition was necessary to his business and to which he was entitled\u2014to restrain the operation, by an upper riparian owner, of a morocco factory, the operation of which threatened to pollute the waters of the stream and render them unfit for use by others and so work serious injury to the complainant\u2019s business.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-17\">Bill foe an injunction.\u2014The complainant, a corporation of the State of JDelaware, is the owner of a tract of land containing about 64 acres, in Christiana Hundred in Hew Castle County, at the point where a certain ancient stream of water, called \u201c Mill Creek,\u201d empties into the Christiana River, in said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-18\">The complainant erected on this land extensive and expensive buildings, machinery, and appliances for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>manufacture of wood pulp, used in the manufacture of paper. A large volume of pure and unpolluted water is necessary to be supplied daily for the prosecution of such business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">The bill alleges that in view of the above requirement of the business, complainant selected and purchased the said land on account of its proximity to said Mill Greek and the convenience of obtaining the required water from the same in proper quantity and quality; that the water of said creek, from time immemorial, has been and is sufficiently pure and unpolluted for the complainant\u2019s use in its business; and that the complainant has continuously used the water of said creek in the prosecution of its said business, and that it is compelled to rely on the waters of said creek, not only for the proper prosecution of its business, but for the watering of its livestock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The bill also states that about 10,40.0 feet above the manufacturing site of the complainant a certain ancient and perennial stream or run or watercourse, known as Chestnut Bun or Silver' Brook, empties into said Mill Creek; that the defendants are engaged in erecting a morocco factory in immediate proximity to said Silver Brook, about 6,000 feet above its confluence with Mill Creek, from which said proposed factory noxious and offensive matter, or refuse, and impure and foul water, used in connection with the manufacture of morocco, and containing decayed animal matter, blood, lime, tonie acid, mineral poisons, hair and excrement of animals, and the general refuse of a morocco factory, consisting of divers other foul, noxious, offensive, and polluted substances, will be discharged in large quantities, from day to day, into the said stream or run, if the said building be completed and used for the purposes for which it is intended, namely, the manufacturing of morocco. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>such discharges into Silver Brook would necessarily also be discharged into Mill Greek, and render the waters thereof unfit for use in the manufacture of wood pulp, and will destroy the business of the complainant, in the conduct of which 150 men on the average are employed, and render worthless the buildings, machinery, and appliances of the complainant, which have cost, in their erection and construction, upwards of $100,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">The bill alleges that notice was given to the defendants to abstain from the pollution or spoiling of the waters of said brook and creek, and that complainant should insist on its right to the use of the same in quantity and quality as they then were, by all legal and equitable means; but that notwithstanding the service of said notice the defendants still continue the erection of the proposed factory, and persist in their intention to use it as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The bill prays that the defendants may be restrained by injunction from discharging or permitting to be discharged from said proposed factory, directly or indirectly into the waters of said stream or run, any noxious or offensive matter or refuse, or any impure or foul water used in connection with the manufacture of morocco, or containing decayed animal matter, blood, lime, mineral poison, excrement of animals, or any noxious or offensive refuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">A rule was served upon the defendants to show cause, at the time and place therein stated, why a preliminary injunction should not be awarded as prayed for in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">The hearing of the motion for a preliminary injunction was continued from time to time, until, the answer of the defendants had been put in under oath. Similar questions were then raised and discussed by solicitors for the parties respectively, as to the admissibility of affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>vits in support of the bill and answer to \u2018those raised and \u25a0discussed in the case of Forman against the same defendants, <em>ante, </em>p. 47; and the same decision of these questions was made by the Chancellor as in that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The answer in this case was in all material respects .\u25a0similar to that made by the same defendants in the case of Forman against them, with the additional statement that \u2022the said morocco factory is more than three miles above the pulp works of the complainant, and that the waters \u2022of said Silver Brook flowing that distance, and by mingling with the waters of Mill Creek, would become .so purified as to render innoxious any matter which might be discharged into the waters of said Silver Brook.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-6\"><em>Victor Dupont, Edwo/rd G.

Mill Creek, from the point where Silver Brook empties into it, flows a distance of about 10,400 feet, until it empties into the Christiana River, at said mills of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The complainant contends that the discoloration of the waters of Mill Creek, and also the dye stuffs and impure .substances contained in the refuse matter discharged from .said factory, will render the water of said Mill Creek totally unfit for use in the complainant\u2019s pulp works; that the lime and lime-water would kill the \u201cbleach,\u201d a part \u25a0of the process in manufacturing wood pulp, by neutralizing the chlorine;\" and that loose hair passing down said .stream would mingle with the paper pulp and paper, and render it unsalable; and that the necessary result of the \u25a0operation of the morocco factory by the defendants, and the discharge into said stream of the said refuse matter, will be the stoppage of the said pulp works, thus depriving the other mills of the complainant of their supply, from the said pulp works, of the material necessary for the manufacture of paper, causing it loss of trade and great .and irreparable damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">I have given careful attention to the contents of the .affidavits filed in support both of the bill and answer; .and while giving, due credit to all the witnesses, both of the complainant and the defendants, the best judgment which I am able to form in respect to their statements is that the discharge of the refuse matter from said morocco factory in the said Silver Brook, the waters of which would necessarily flow into and mingle with the waters of Mill Creek, would be perilous to the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of the complainant, as set forth and described in its bill of complaint. Since the defendants have commenced operating their factory, they seem to have run the refuse and polluted waters into ponds dammed off near their factory and adjoining Silver Brook.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">These ponds have several times broken the dams, and the contents thereof have been discharged into Silver Brook, the water of which has been blackened and discolored all the way from said factory to Mill Creek, and also the waters of Mill Creek'have been blackened and polluted for a considerable distance below said factory. The small fish in said Silver Brook have been killed by the pollution of the waters thereof; the water has been made unfit for the use of cattle for days after such discharge ; the bottom of the stream has been blackened by sediment, and black scum in some places has covered the water; this discoloration of the water extended a considerable way into Mill Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The superintendent and assistant superintendent of the pulp works swear that the waters at Mill Creek have not been so pure as usual, and larger quantities of bleaching matter have had to be used to counteract the effect of the pollution caused by a few discharges of this morocco refuse ; they say that they cannot account for this change in the water in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Without attempting a reference to all the statements, contained in the affidavits in support of the bill and answer,\u2014for a great many affidavits have been put in,\u2014it is sufficient to say that, in my judgment, it is reasonable to believe that the continued discharges of the refuse matter from said factory into Silver Brook, and thence into Mill Creek, will work serious injury and damage to. the business of the complainant, and ail others who are compelled to rely on the waters of Silver Brook and Mill Creek for a proper supply of \u25a0 pure and unpolluted waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The damage to the owners and proprietors of land on Silver Brook sufficiently appears by the affidavits read on the hearing of this rule; and in addition to the testimony of numbers as to the consequences of the pollution of the waters of Mill Creek to the business operations of the complainant at its mills is the positive testimony of the superintendent and assistant superintendent before referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">This case appears to be one which calls for the interposition of this court by way of preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Where a complainant shows a reasonable and well-founded apprehension of immediate threatened and irreparable injury and loss, it is a duty of courts of equity, in cases within their jurisdiction, to restrain the commission of such injury and infliction of such loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">I shall not attempt to discuss all the questions raised by the respective parties to this cause in the arguments of their, respective solicitors, nor shall I notice in detail in this opinion the many authorities cited in their arguments, which arguments were learned and elaborate. I have, however, carefully considered these authorities and weighed the arguments of the solicitors. I shall content myself, however, with stating a few propositions well established by authority, and which admit of no reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The complainant has a legal right to the flow of water of said Mill Creek in its accustomed channel and in its usual volume. It has a legal right to the flow of said stream in its accustomed purity, unpolluted by riparian owners above.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">To so pollute a stream as to render it useless to riparian owners below is practically, as to them, to destroy the stream, and to destroy their rights therein, as riparian owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The- authority of a court of equity to restrain the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>lufcion of natural streams of water, where such pollution will cause irreparable injury and loss to a riparian owner in his accustomed and necessary legal use of the waters thereof, is unquestionable and established by numerous authorities, some of which have been cited in arguments in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Where the danger threatened is of such a nature that it cannot easily be remedied in case of a refusal of relief, and the answer does not deny that the act charged is \u25a0contemplated, an interlocutory injunction will be allowed, unless the equities of the bill are satisfactorily refuted by \"the defendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duluth, </em>1 Dill. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It seems in that case that numerous affidavits of engineers and others were offered on both sides as to the \u25a0effect of the work sought to be enjoined; the opinions \u25a0expressed being quite conflicting. The court, Miller, <em>J., </em>.said : <em>\u201c </em>The affidavits on both sides are numerous. They demonstrate what all courts and juries have so often felt, that where the question is one of opinion, and not of fact, though that opinion should be founded on scientific principles or professional skill, the inquiry is painfully unsatisfactory, and the answers strangely contradictory. In this emergency I am relieved by a principle which has generally governed me, and which, I believe, governs nearly all judges in applications for preliminary injunctions. It is that when the danger or injury threatened is of a character which cannot be easily remedied if the injunction is refused, and there is no denial that the act charged is contemplated, the temporary injunction should be granted, unless the case made by the bill is satisfactorily refuted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">A preliminary injunction is awarded, as prayed in the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
