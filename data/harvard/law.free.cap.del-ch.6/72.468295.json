The policy of the State of Maryland will not allow a judicial assignment, or an assignment by operation of' law or in insolvency in another state, to pass the title to-personalty in that state, or to interfere with the rights of creditors suing in that state. As comity of the State of Maryland would not be extended to the State of Delaware in this respect, no reason arises for the State of Delaware to extend its comity to the State of Maryland. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>in this case. <em>Burk </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>1 Harr. &amp; M\u2019H. 236; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>2 Harr. &amp; M\u2019H. 463.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">As to the cases cited for the receiver:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\"><em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>41 N. J. L. 12. (1) The receiver .had there, by virtue of the terms of his appointment, authority as far as any court can give it to collect debts wheresoever situate. (2) It states that a receiver should not -be allowed to sue in a foreign jurisdiction in any \u2022case where there is a controversy between him and creditors. (3) The only point for the decision of the court upon the facts of the case was that a receiver could not \u00a1sue when his interests clashed with those of a citizen of Hew J\u00e9rsey ; this the court does decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\">The case is therefore no authority in this case, where \"the receiver of Maryland is attempting to interfere with \u2022the rights of Beckwith, the Hew York creditor. The whole scope of the case is shown by the illustration of the court on page 4, and is, as far as it goes, authority for the position of the respondents in this bill; namely, that where the rights of any creditor not a citizen of Maryland clashes with the pretensions of the receiver of Maryland, the receiver cannot maintain his action in a \u2022foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\"><em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Siddle, </em>3 Dill. 477, the court here also puts, as a condition for its dictum, that the receiver \u00a1\u2022should be duly authorized to maintain the suit in a foreign jurisdiction, and even then states its dictum doubtfully, recognizes the authority of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>58 U. S. 17 How. 322, 15 L. ed. 164, and refuses to give a \u2022definite opinion concerning the powers of the receiver in .respect to suits brought in that district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-10\"><em>Runk </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>29 Barb. 587, expressly states that -all that has been settled by tlje decisions to which we have been referred on this subject is that our courts will mot sustain the lien of foreign assignees or receivers, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>opposition to a lien created by attachment under our own laws. Even under this statement the receiver of Maryland could not maintain his action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">The case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>58 U. S. 17 How. 324, 15 L. ed. 164, was not brought to the attention of the court, so that the case cannot be considered as questioning the binding authority of that case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-7\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao4\">This case must be governed by that of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>58 U. S. 17 How. 324, 15 L. ed. 164, and the reasoning of Wayne, J., who delivered the opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">A receiver is an officer of the court appointing him. He is appointed for the benefit of all parties who may establish rights in the cause. The money in his hands is <em>in custodia legis </em>for whoever can make out a title to it. It is the court itself which has the care of the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The receiver is but the creature of the court. He has no powers except such as are conferred upon him by the. order of his appointment, and the cause and practice of the court. A receiver\u2019s right to the possession of the debtor\u2019s property is limited to the jurisdiction of his appointment ; and he has no lien upon the property of the debtor except for that which he may get the possession of without suit, or for that which, after having been permitted to sue for, he may reduce into possession in that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">A receiver has no extraterritorial power of official action ; none which the court appointing him can confer with authority to enable him to go into a foreign jurisdiction to take possession of the debtor\u2019s property; none;which can give him, upop the principle of comity, a privilege to sue in a foreign court or another jurisdiction, as the judgment creditor himself might have done, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>his debtor may be amenable to the tribunal which the creditor may seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><em>Mr. Justice </em>Wayne, in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clarrk, </em>says: \u201cOur industry has been tasked unsuccessfully to find a case in which a receiver has been permitted to sue, in a foreign jurisdiction, for the property of the debtor. So far as we can find, it has not been allowed in an English tribunal. Orders have been given in the English chancery for receivers to proceed to execute their functions in another jurisdiction, but we are not aware of its ever having been permitted by the tribunals of the last.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">This was said in 1854. The case of <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>41 N, J. L. 1, decided in 1879, held that a receiver appointed in a foreign jurisdiction, clothed with authority to take the designated property wherever situate, may sustain a suit for such property, in the courts of Hew Jersey; and that this was the rule whenever the creditors of the person represented by the receiver do not intervene. But this case is not at all inconsistent with the view I take of the case before me. It recognizes the case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark </em>as rightly' decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In speaking of that case the learned chief justice of Hew Jersey said: \u201cBut that ease belongs to a train of decisions which have been, undoubtedly, rightly decided, but which are not to be regarded as ruling the precise point now in issue. The decisions thus referred to will be found in High on Beceivers, \u00a7 239 ; and they are all cases involving a controversy between the receiver and the creditors of the person whose property has been placed under the control of such receiver. In such a posture of things it is manifest that different considerations should have force from those that are to control when the litigation does not involve the rights of creditors in opposition to the claims of the receiver. That the officer of a foreign court should not be permitted, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u25a0against the claims of creditors resident here, to remove from this state the assets of the debtor, is a proposition \"that appears to be asserted by all the decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In the case before me creditors of the corporation represented hy the receiver have intervened,\u2014two of these \u2022creditors are corporations in this State. The other is res\u25a0ident in the State of Hew York ; but he has obtained a judgment in this State against the insolvent corporation -of Maryland, and a judgment against a garnishee of that \u2022corporation, and is proceeding to collect the latter judgment. There is .no principle of law or equity that foribids his doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">And the rule in this case is therefore discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
