R. H. Robinson filed his complaint in the territorial district court of Maricopa County against the Minnesota and Arizona Construction Company, a corporation, to recover $20,500 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>services rendered the corporation as general manager and superintendent of the construction work then being prosecuted by it, and on second cause of action $510 on an assigned claim of James A. Fleming against the defendant for office rent. On March 21st the defendant answered, and admitted the services rendered by the plaintiff, but denied any indebtedness thereon in excess of $3,541, and alleged that at the time of the organization of the defendant company the plaintiff received seven hundred and fourteen shares of the capital stock of the defendant corporation,\u2014an equal amount with his co-organizers; and that it was the agreement and understanding that plaintiff should receive his compensation for services rendered by way of dividends on stock. Ancillary to his action, plaintiff sued out a writ of attachment, which was levied on personal property of the' defendant. The defendant corporation was organized under the laws of the territory of Arizona by articles executed on the thirtieth day of March, 1895, by Donald Grant, E. B. Langdon, A. H. Linton, D. <em>~W. </em>Grant, C. S. Langdon, S. E. H. Eobinson, and Samuel Grant, who, by the articles, became the board of directors, with Donald Grant president, A. H. Linton vice-president, G. S. Langdon secretary and treasurer. The capital stock was divided into five thousand shares of the par value of one hundred dollars. Said organizers and directors subscribed for the same in equal amounts. On the eighteenth day of March, 1899, A. H. Linton brought an action in the district court against the defendant corporation to recover the sum of $31,006.86. On the twenty-second day of March, 1899, A. H. Linton filed a petition in bankruptcy on the federal side of the court against the defendant corporation, as a creditor thereof, alleging that at various times between the twenty-fifth day of March, 1895, and the 15th of March, 1899, he had loaned the said corporation money aggregating the sum of $31,006.86; that the corporation was insolvent, and that within four months next preceding the date of his petition the said corporation committed an act of bankruptcy, in that they had permitted one S. E. H. Eobinson to institute a suit against them to obtain a writ of attachment, which was levied on the property of the defendant company, of the value of more that eight thousand dollars, and moneys in bank of more than seven hundred dollars, and that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>was the attachment vacated nor suit dismissed. He further alleged that on the eighteenth day of March he had commenced an action against the defendant corporation to recover the sum of $81,006.86, and that thereupon the said corporation, by resolution of its board of directors, admitted the justice of the claim, and admitted in writing the inability of the corporation to pay its debts, and its willingness to be adjudged a bankrupt. The schedule attached to said petition shows the debts to be the petitioner\u2019s claim in the amount aforesaid, to secure which the corporation had transferred to him a promissory note of the Rio Verde Canal Company, dated March 15, 1899, in the sum of $120,273.64, valued at one dollar; claim in favor of R. B. Langdon, deceased, $2,547.50, for moneys loaned and advanced; claim in favor of Donald Grant in the sum of $32,169.10, for moneys loaned and advanced; claim in favor of Cavour S. Langdon in the sum of $16,279.92, for moneys loaned and advanced; claim in favor of D. W. Grant in the sum of $16,084.55, for moneys loaned and advanced; claim in favor of James A. Fleming $495, for rent of office rooms. Robinson intervened, and contested the petition, and alleged that it was not a corporation, either organized for the purpose of or engaged in any trade or mercantile business, but was a corporation organized for and engaged in the work of construction only. The articles of incorporation of the defendant corporation provide as follows: \u201cKnow all men by these presents, that we, the. undersigned incorporators, desiring to form a corporation under the Revised Statutes of the territory of Arizona relating thereto of March 8th, 1887, and all acts amendatory thereof, do hereby associate ourselves for that purpose, and have signed, adopted, and acknowledged the following articles of incorporation, to wit: Article 1.

In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals this 30th day of March, A. D. 1895.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">At the trial of the. issue as to whether the company should be adjudged bankrupt it was shown that the articles of incorporation were filed with the secretary of the territory on the ninth day of May, 1895, and at a meeting of the corporation held at Minneapolis, Minn., on May 28, 1895, a resolution was passed reciting that Messrs. Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and Messrs. D. Grant &amp; Co. were the owners of a certain contract with the Rio Yerde Canal Company for the construction of a canal in Arizona, and resolved: \u201cThat this company purchase of said Langdon, Linton &amp; Ce. and D. Grant &amp; Co. the said contracts above set out, and that upon the execution and delivery to this company of the proper assignments thereof the president and secretary be authorized and directed to execute and deliver to said Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and said D. Grant &amp; Co. 5,000 shares of the full-paid stock of this company, or to such parties, firms, or corporations as they may direct.\u201d It was also shown that the. organizers of the company and the directors in the company were all of them, except S. R. H. Robinson, members of either the firm of Lang-don, Linton &amp; Co. or D. Grant &amp; Co.; and it was also shown' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and D. Grant &amp; Co. and S. R. H. Robinson were contractors, engaged in the business of constructing railroads and canals. All the debts owed by the corporation were owed to its directors, except the office rent to Fleming, and the claim of Robinson as superintendent, and that claim arose and suit was brought on it while Robinson was a director; and.it was shown upon the part of the intervener that Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and D. Grant &amp; Co., as contractors having in charge the building of an immense canal in Arizona for the Rio Verde Canal Company, and the said Robinson also being a contractor, and desiring to aid in the building of said canal, it was agreed that they would form a corporation, and pursue the work of building the canal through its instrumentality. It was also shown that the Rio Verde Canal Company had no money on hand with which to pay for the construction of the canal, but that they were the owners of large water locations, franchises, and rights of way, and they expected to raise the money by bonds; that Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and D. Grant <em>&amp; </em>Co. were to furnish the money for the building of a large portion of the canal, pending the negotiations of the Rio Verde Canal Company for the sale of their bonds; that when the construction company was organized no money was paid in on the capital stock, but that it was the arrangement with the members of the old firm of Langdon, Linton <em>&amp; </em>Co. and the members of the old firm of D. Grant <em>&amp; </em>Co., all being directors in the construction company, to advance money to the construction company, the same as they would have done as individuals in their respective partnerships of Langdon, Linton &amp; Co. and D. Grant <em>&amp; </em>Co.; the moneys so advanced by each to go upon the payment of their subscription to the capital stock. It was also in evidence that Robinson should turn in the teams and construction outfit which he then had, and his salary as manager in the field, in payment of his subscription to the capital stock, which he did to the amount of about six thousand dollars. . These facts tended to prove that the corporation was not in debt to Linton or to the other members of the corporation. It appears that the petitioners had no contract relations with the corporation whereby debts owed them were created, but that they advanced money to the corporation to enable it to carry on the business of constructing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the Rio Yerde Canal. There are no debts owing by the corporation,- except to Fleming for office rent, outside of the claims of the directors of the corporation for moneys advanced to it, and of Robinson for salary as manager while a director; and it is urged as a grave consideration upon the court that under those circumstances one director should not be allowed by his petition to force the corporation into involuntary bankruptcy, and that his co-directors, having claims of a like character, should not be allowed to place the corporation in an attitude to be forced into bankruptcy, by signing a writing consenting to the same, being done.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">If the claims of the directors are not debts against the corporation, but advances made by them upon their subscription to stock, it could scarcely be said that the Minnesota and Arizona Construction Company is insolvent. It is the owner of personal property and money in the amount to pay the admitted indebtedness of the company to Robinson. Section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act does not provide for bankruptcy of corporations under voluntary petitions, and for only such corporations on involuntary petitions as are \u201cengaged principally in manufacturing, trading, printing, publishing, or mercantile pursuits.\u201d The first question is whether, under the evidence, the defendant is such a corporation. This, if determined in the negative, will render unnecessary the consideration of the other issues presented. There was some evidence upon the part of petitioners that the. company had engaged in mercantile pursuits, but this is fully met by the testimony of the intervener that they never were in the mercantile business. The first work undertaken by them was. the construction of the Rio Yerde Canal in Arizona, at a point far removed from the base of supplies. They furnished their men with provisions, shoes, overalls, tobacco, and such necessary articles as men have to have while at work, from E. F. Kellner\u2019s store, and paid to Kellner the price thereof, and took the amount out of their men\u2019s wages. After it ceased labor on the canal, and in order to employ its teams while waiting for a probable resumption of work thereon, it took a contract to freight from Ger\u00f3nimo, the terminal of a railroad, to the city of Globe. At Ger\u00f3nimo it did no merchandising, but dealt for itself and men at the supply store of the company from which it took its subcontract. Afterwards it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>took the contract of building a railroad in Yavapai County, and at that place it kept only a supply stock for the benefit of its employees. Under such circumstances it could not be said to be a corporation principally engaged in mercantile pursuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">The. next- question is whether it is a corporation principally engaged in trading. The usual meaning of trader is \u201cone who buys and sells goods\u201d; \u201cone who makes it his business to buy merchandise, goods, and chattels, and sells the same for the purpose of making a profit.\u201d The firm of Langdon, Linton <em>&amp; </em>Co., as contractors, could not be called traders, nor could D. Grant &amp; Co., or S. R. H. Robinson. When they combined, and undertook to transact their business through the medium of a corporation of which they themselves were directors, we do not- find that they changed the character of the business engaged in. It possibly may he said that their articles of incorporation would have allowed them to have changed their business, or extended it into trading, but we have seen them in fact engaged in no business but the business of construction. Counsel on both sides have cited many authorities from which they reason either that the construction company was engaged in trading or that it was not. It has been decided that a baker buying flour and supplying his customers was a trader; that \u201cmerchant\u201d includes \u201chotel-keeper\u201d; that a butcher buying beef on foot and selling it was a trader, but that a butcher billing his own stock and selling it was not a trader; that a teamster who to a very considerable extent buys and sells hay and straw to support his teams while idle, is not a trader; that railroad and transportation companies are not traders; that a theatrical manager, though he buy and sell costumes, is not a trader. The consensus of opinions gathered from the reports seems to he that, to constitute a trader, the operation of buying and selling for profit must enter into the occupation. The only case that seems to be in point is <em>In re Smith, </em>reported in 2 Lowell, 69, 22 Fed. Cas. 394 (No. 12,981), a decision under the old Bankruptcy Law of 1867, which seems to be quite analogous to, if not-identical with, the case at bar; and it was there decided that one who contracts with a railroad company to grade and build its road is not a trader. If an individual contractor who contracts to dig a canal or to build a railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>is not a trader under the definition of trader and under the decision last cited, a corporation which does the same act cannot be a trader. The case <em>In re San Gabriel Sanatorium Co., </em>(D. C.) 95 Fed. 271, cited by the appellant, is to the same effect. This company was adjudged a bankrupt, but it was in accordance with the generally accepted doctrine that a hotel-keeper is \u00e1 merchant. The court says: \u201cRespondent\u2019s institution is not a charity, but is conducted for profit. Patients are lodged and furnished with the usual accommodations of a hotel at the sanatorium, the rates charged being $25 per week and upwards. ... If an incorporated com-, pany, such as a private hospital, be conducted in a business way for profit, and not on charitable, lines, it is a trading or mercantile corporation, within the meaning of the present bankrupt law.\u201d But the court, in the opinion, uses this argument, that seems peculiarly applicable to the ease at bar. After quoting from section 4 of the Bankrupt Act, \u201cAny corporation engaged principally in manufacturing, trading, printing, publishing, or mercantile pursuits . . . may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt,\u201d the court says: \u201cWhile the artificial atmosphere used at respondent\u2019s sanatorium is doubtless the product of a manufacturing process, I am not prepared to hold that manufacturing is respondent\u2019s principal business.\u201d The court regarded the word \u201cprincipally\u201d as being employed to distinguish a calling or usual occupation from an isolated single transaction, or from something simply an incident to one\u2019s principal business or usual occupation. Thus the manufacture of artificial atmosphere by the respondent, while not an isolated single transaction, was yet of such minor importance, when compared with the volume of the entire business of the company, that the court held that it was not respondent\u2019s principal business. The. general nature of the business proposed to be transacted by the defendant corporation in the case at bar as provided by its articles of incorporation is the construction of railroads, turnpikes, canals, dams, reservoirs, etc. A careful inspection of the articles of incorporation shows that the only authority to engage in merchandising conferred by the charter is given in the following language: \u201c\u201cAnd such-corporation is authorized to do and perform any and all things incidental to or expedient for the best interest of said corporation in carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>on and transacting the business for which it is incorporated.\u201d The entire business it had in fact transacted since its incorporation, as shown by the record, was construction of canal and tunnel, $105,000; freighting some months from Ger\u00f3nimo to Globe; construction of grade and roadbed of railroad, $110,000; and the purchase and furnishing of merchandise and supplies for its force while thus engaged; and the. sale of about $253.28 worth of feed and supplies to sundry persons while completing the $110,000 railroad contract. It had, at the time when suit was instituted, some stock for the. conduct of its principal or usual business, and some indebtedness that had been incurred in the prosecution of that business; but it did not have, nor had it for months past had, either any goods for mercantile or trading pursuits, or any indebtedness that had been incurred in such pursuits. What little business it had ever done in that line as incidental to its principal business had been closed out, and all debts arising therefrom had been paid. The statute contemplates a present condition, not something which has been finally completed, entirely closed up, and of which nothing remains, either of stock on hand or debts owing. The corporation, to be adjudged a bankrupt, must, at the time of the filing of the petition, be engaged in mercantile pursuits. The statute does not in any ease apply to a corporation that has quit all buying and selling of merchandise, has no merchandise on hand, and does not owe a dollar to any one for merchandise purchased, or in any way connected with its buying or selling of goods. If ever within the purview of the act, the defendant corporation certainly was not at the time the petition was filed. <em>Kinsey </em>v. <em>Little River Co., </em>4 Cent. Law J. 247, 14 Fed. Cas. 639 (No. 7,829). The court correctly held that the defendant corporation was not principally engaged in trading or mercantile pursuits, and was, therefore, not such a corporation as could be adjudged a bankrupt. This renders unnecessary the consideration of the other questions raised, further than to say that the dismissal of the petitions properly followed. The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">Sloan, J., and Davis, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
