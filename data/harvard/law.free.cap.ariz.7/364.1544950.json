R. W. Barr, Chairman. Frank Hare, Clerk. James F.. Duncan, Deputy Clerk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">The case was tried before the court upon the record brought up in said return. The court rendered judgment that \u201cthe action of the board, as shown by the record of July 12, 1899, whereby the said board assumed authority to enter upon the assessment roll of said county, as the property of the petitioner, at the valuation of $12,000, certain property, to wit, cars and car track in mine, was taken in excess of the jurisdiction of the said board, and the same is hereby annulled, and declared to be without legal effect; and that in all other respects the proceedings had by said board be, and the same are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>hereby, affirmed.\u201d From this judgment and the order denying a new trial the petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">It is assigned as error by the appellant that \u201cthe court erred in giving judgment affirming the proceedings had by the board of equalization in July and August, 1899, by which the board undertook to add to the valuation of petitioner\u2019s property on the assessment roll of that year, and in not giving judgment annulling said proceedings, for the reason that it appeared by the return of the board to the writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and was an uncontroverted fact in the record before the court', that the only action taken by the board in the matter was had and taken on July 12th, without any previous notice to petitioner, and on August 1st, without any appearance before them by the petitioner; and hence the whole proceeding was irregular and void, and beyond the jurisdiction of the board. \u2019 \u2019 It is necessary to determine whether the record of the proceedings of the board of equalization, as embodied in their return, shows the necessary jurisdictional facts to sustain their authority for the action taken by them. It is an admitted proposition that in tribunals of special and limited jurisdiction the particular facts and circumstances upon which their jurisdiction is based must appear upon the face of the proceedings. No presumptions are indulged in favor of the jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal, and it will be assumed that jurisdiction was wanting where -the record does not show affirmatively that it had been acquired. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Village of Rochester, </em>6 Wend. 561; <em>Kinderhook </em>v. <em>Claw, </em>15 Johns. 537; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>2 Mass. 170. The board of equalization, when acting upon the assessment roll, is a body possessed of but limited and special powers. When, therefore, its power and authority to do a particular thing are questioned, the record must exhibit affirmatively all the facts necessary to give it the authority to do the act complained of. When this is not done, the presumption is against its jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ormsby County, </em>6 Nev. 95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Washoe County, </em>5 Nev. 317. By the provisions of the Kevised Statutes of this territory for the. assessment of taxes, after the assessor has completed the assessment-roll the board of equalization may change and correct any valuation of property either by adding thereto or deducting therefrom, whether such valuation was fixed by the owner or the assessor. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>act, however, under the special authority of the. statute, and whatever they may do by way of making additions to the valuation of property as fixed in the assessment-roll by either the owner or the assessor must be done strictly in accordance with the authority given them. Their acts in this matter, when within the scope of their authority, and in strict compliance with the necessary conditions precedent as described in the statute, such as the giving of the required notice and the like, are final and binding, and are not subject to review by any other tribunal for the correction of mere informalities, or subject to reversal by any higher court by reason of any errors in judgment or procedure which do not involve the. question of transcending their authority. If, however, they proceed without the warrant of law, disregarding those matters prescribed as conditions precedent, their proceedings will be reviewed by the higher court, and, when found to be in excess of authority, or without jurisdiction, will be annulled. <em>Commissioners of Allegheny County </em>v. <em>New York Min. Co., </em>76 Md. 549, 25 Atl. 864. Paragraph 2654 of the Revised Statutes clearly defines and limits the power and authority of the board in the following language: \u2018 \u2018 The board of equalization shall meet on the first day of July, . . . and shall continue in session from time to time, until the business of equalization presented to them is disposed of; provided, however, that they shall not sit after the twentieth day of July, except as in this section provided. The board of equalization shall have power to determine whether the assessed value of any property is too small or too great and may change and correct any valuation either by adding thereto or deducting therefrom, if the sum fixed in the assessment-roll be too small or too great, whether said sum was fixed by the owner or the assessor, and if the board of equalization shall find it necessary to add to the assessed valuation of any property on the assessment-roll they shall direct their clerk to give notice to the persons interested by a letter deposited in the post-office or express or otherwise, naming the day when they shall act in that case, and allowing a reasonable time to appear, and the said board of equalization on the hearing are hereby empowered to issue compulsory process and require the attendance of any person or persons whom they may suspect to have a knowledge of the value or amount of such taxable property, and examine such person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>persons under oath in relation thereto. As soon as possible after the adjournment of the board of equalization in July its clerk shall make out a list of all persons the valuation of whose property has been added to, with the amount so added, on the assessment-roll, who have not appeared before, the board, and the board of supervisors shall cause the same to be published in one newspaper in the county, . . . and any person to the assessed value of whose property there was an amount added not appearing before the board in July may appear before the board in August, and upon making affidavit that he had no knowledge of such increased valuation of his property he shall have a hearing before, the board of equalization; and the determination then had shall be final.\u201d An examination of this statute shows that the original jurisdiction of the board to add to the valuation of property must be exercised at their July sitting, and that action on a day named, after a reasonable notice thereof to the persons interested, is essential as a condition precedent to confer that jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction in August is purely appellate, and is dependent upon the appearance before them of the person to the assessed value of whose property there was an amount added in July, and the affidavit of such person that he had no knowledge of such increased valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">From the return it appears that the original action of the board in adding to the assessed valuation of the property in question was taken on the twelfth day of July; that on that day the superintendent of the company was notified to be present on the nineteenth day of July, which date was named as the day when the board would act in that case; that the superintendent thus notified was not present on that day, or any day thereafter; and the record in the case, as returned by the board, does not furnish any evidence of any action of the board in reference to the property after the twelfth day of July until the first day of August. The minutes of the board, as embodied in their return, are conflicting, the different recitals of the transactions of the board on certain dates being inconsistent with each other. The minutes of the board of the twelfth day of July, as embodied in their return, show that the valuation was added to on the twelfth day of July, 1899, and that notice of such action was that day mailed to the superintendent of the company. The notice published on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>twenty-second day of July likewise states that the valuation was raised.at the July sitting. The. minutes of the first day of August ignore any action of the board other than the proposal to raise the valuation before that date, and recite that: \u201cThe notice having been given on the twelfth day of July that the. board would act on said case on July 19, 1899, and no appearance having been made by said company on that day, or any day since,\u201d that on the first day of August \u201cit is therefore ordered that the raised valuation of the property of the company as proposed on the twelfth day of July be, and the same is hereby, finally fixed as proposed to be raised. \u2019 \u2019 While it is impossible to determine from the conflicting statements contained in the return whether the valuation of the property was increased on July 12th or on August 1st, it is clearly established that it was on one or the oth\u00e9r of those two dates. No record is furnished of any action in the premises by the - board on any other date. An examination of the record as furnished in the return fails to show the jurisdictional facts that would render legal or binding the action of the board in raising the assessment either on the twelfth day of July or the first day of August. In order to give the board jurisdiction to increase the valuation of the property, it was necessary that the act should be performed by the board on a day named, after reasonable notice to the owner. Any action had on the twelfth day of July, other than to name the day when the board would act in that case and give the notice, was without jurisdiction. If the raise was, therefore, definitely made on that date, the district court should have annulled the. action of the board, and set it aside. In order to give the board jurisdiction to raise the valuation of the property on August 1st, it would have been necessary for the board to have taken definite action in July on a day named, after reasonable notice to the owner,-and it would have then been necessary for the owner or its agent to appear before the board on the first day of August, and make affidavit that he (or it) had no knowledge of the action of the board in July raising the valuation. Unless based upon these conditions precedent, any action of the board on the first day of August raising the valuation was without jurisdiction, and the district court should have annulled such action and set it aside for that reason. There is, moreover, a further objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>to the validity of any action of the board in raising the assessment on the first day of August. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>takes effect as a <em>supersedeas </em>upon its being delivered to the officer (or board) to whom it is directed, rendering all subsequent proceedings before him (or it) <em>coram non judice </em>and void. <em>Case </em>v. <em>Shepherd, 2 </em>Johns. Cas. 27; <em>Patchin </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>13 Wend. 664. The writ in this instance was served upon the members of the board on the twenty-eighth day of July, 1899, and commanded them to desist from further proceedings in the matter to be reviewed in relation to the increased assessment made on the twelfth day of July, 1899, referring to the list, and, until the hearing and determination of said matters and proceedings, all further action and proceedings by the board in relation thereto were in specific terms declared to be stayed. This rendered void and without any legal effect any attempted action of the board in the premises after the twenty-eighth day of July, 1899. If the board had raised the assessment on the nineteenth day of July, the. date named in the notice served on the company\u2019s agent, or any day thereafter to which an adjournment was had, prior to the twentieth day of July, a different question would be presented. There is, however, no evidence in the return, and no claim made by the board, that the valuation of the property was raised on a day named in July, after reasonable notice to the owner. The action of the board increasing the valuation of the property was, therefore, without jurisdiction, and the judgment of the district court affirming the proceedings therein is reversed, and it is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the proceedings of the board of equalization of Cochise County, territory of Arizona, as shown by the records of the. twelfth day of July, 1899, and the first day of August, 1899, in the matter of adding to the valuation of the property of the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company, were without jurisdiction, and the same are hereby annulled and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Street, C.
