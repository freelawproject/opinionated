Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>lant, on the other hand, contends that the mark is not \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of its goods under section 2(e) of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e)) and, moreover, it is not generieally descriptive and has become distinctive of appellant\u2019s goods in commerce so as to permit registration under section 2(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f)). We agree with the solicitor that appellant\u2019s contentions frame the questions involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">In a comprehensive opinion dispositive of the issues, the board found and held, one member dissenting, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The designation \u201cSUPERWATER-FINISH\u201d is not only composed of three descriptive words; but the term \u201cWATER FINISH\u201d admittedly has a well-known meaning in the paper industry and manifestly the addition of the term \u201cSUPER\u201d does not in any way change the inherent meaning of the term \u201cWATER FINISH\u201d. * * In fact, since applicant admittedly is applying a water finish to its Kraft paper, the adjectival superlative designation serves only to emphasize or enhance the descriptive significance of \u201cWATER FINISH\u201d, as in the case of a \u201csuper-calendering\u201d finish, rather than lend any distinctive character thereto. As such, \u201cSUPERWATER-FINISH\u201d is merely descriptive of applicant\u2019s Kraft paper which has been treated with applicant\u2019s super water finish. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">****** Although, as alleged by applicant, it may be the only one in the trade to have used the term \u201cSUPERWATER-FINISH\u201d over a seventeen-year period, a word or term such as that involved in this proceeding, which by its very nature conveys a readily understood meaning and significance, is not elevated to the stature of a registrable trademark merely as a result of origination and long use. * * * That applicant may have adopted and used the term \u201cSUPERWATERFINISH\u201d on its goods with an intent that it function as a trademark does not necessarily establish that it has succeeded in that regard. That is to say, the ultimate test in a proceeding of this character is what do the customers for Kraft paper understand by the term \u201cSUPERWATERFINISH\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The board then considered ten letters from appellant\u2019s customers received in reply to appellant\u2019s request to them stating, in essence, that \u201cwe would appreciate your indicating whether or not the mark \u2018SUPERWATERFINISH\u2019 identifies only the products of Chesapeake.\u201d The board found that a majority of the letters generally indicated an association of the mark in question with appellant\u2019s product, stating, however, that the weight to be accorded such letters depends to a large degree on the nature of the mark sought to be registered in each particular case. The board cited several decisions of this court and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">It is our opinion that the designation in issue herein \u201cSUPERWATER-FINISH\u201d * * * falls within the category of marks * * * that may have acquired a \u201cde facto secondary meaning\u201d but which because of its inherent character is not entitled to registration as a trademark under the statute. Admittedly, the record does not show that the composite mark \u201cSUPERWATERFINISH\u201d as such is a common descriptive name of a paper finishing process. But, \u201cWATER-FINISH\u201d is and, as indicated above, the addition of the superlative \u201cSUPER\u201d does not change the inherent significance thereof. Certainly, any manufacturer of Kraft paper treating its product with a water finish which it believes to be superior to similar finishes employed by others should be free to use various adjectives including \u201csuper\u201d to describe or extol its finish. The registration sought by applicant would preclude this right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">We consider it well settled that to show that a <em>common descriptive name </em>has acquired a de facto secondary meaning, in the sense that some or even many people have come to associate it with a particular producer, is not in itself enough to show that it has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>entitled to registration as a trademark. Roselux Chemical Co. v. Parsons Ammonia Co., Inc., 299 F.2d 855, 49 CCPA 931 (1962). However, we do not feel that that statement of law applies to the facts of this case. The board admits, properly we believe, that the composite mark SUPERWATERFINISH as such has not been shown to be a common descriptive name of a paper finishing process. While \u201cwater finish\u201d may be descriptive of an attribute of the paper, more specifically its finish, it cannot be said, based on this record, that the <em>unitary </em>designation here in question is no more than a common descriptive name for kraft paper itself. Appellant\u2019s customers referred to appellant\u2019s product and like products from competitors variously as \u201cModelfinish\u201d or \u201cbutcher paper.\u201d The weight of the evidence indicates that the unitary designation SUPERWATERFINISH is considered to be distinctive of appellant\u2019s goods by those in the trade, and we do not consider it to be so highly descriptive as to be incapable of registration. The situation before us is not unlike that in In re Ada Milling Co., 205 F.2d 315, 40 CCPA 1076 (1953), where this court stated with regard to the mark \u201cStartgrolay\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Here appellant has so combined three words into a unitary notation as to result in a mark which, in our opinion, may suggest but does not necessarily describe the character of its goods. While it is, of course, true that if the mark were dissected, the words \u201cStart,\u201d \u201cgrow,\u201d and \u201clay\u201d might well be descriptive of the characteristics of various types of poultry feed, it is our belief that when the mark is viewed in its entirety, as it is viewed in the market place, it is capable of distinguishing applicants goods from those of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In response to the board\u2019s view that the registration here sought would preclude others from describing the finish of their products, we note this court\u2019s observation in In re Automatic Radio Mfg. Co., 404 F.2d 1391, 56 CCPA 817 (1969), that \u201cdescriptive words <em>may </em>become trademarks and subject to protection <em>as such, </em>without inhibiting the use of the same words in a non-trademark sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The decision of the board is, accordingly, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-24\">.
