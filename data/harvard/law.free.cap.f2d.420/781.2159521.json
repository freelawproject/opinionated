In attacking the conviction he raises on appeal several questions which were previously considered by the Pennsylvania state courts and the district court in denying him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">A careful review of the entire record, including the post-conviction hearing transcripts, supports the findings of the district court and clearly shows, contrary to relator\u2019s allegations, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">(1) he was mentally competent to plead guilty;</p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">(2) his juvenile record was not considered in the sentencing;</p>\n<p id=\"b845-24\">(3) his original confession was not coerced; and</p>\n<p id=\"b845-25\">(4) his guilty pleas were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-26\">Relator also raises on this appeal, for what appears to be the first time, an allegation that he was induced to plead guilty by assurances of his counsel that he would receive only a six year sentence, although he was subsequently sentenced .to eighteen to thirty-six years. Assuming that this new allegation is true, and there is no support for it in the record, relator has not exhausted his state remedies regarding this issue. There is no indication that he raised this issue in any state proceeding. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>deed, it was not raised in the district court, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The judgment of the district court denying relator\u2019s petition for writ of ha-beas corpus will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
