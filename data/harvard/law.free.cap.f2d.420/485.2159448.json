Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-23\">Appellee Hardeman brought this action against the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers, AFL-CIO, seeking damages under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., for unlawful expulsion from the Union. The jury returned a verdict in favor of ap-pellee in the amount of $152,150.00 and the District Court entered a judgment in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">The Union appeals, raising many of the same issues decided against it in International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, etc. v. Braswell, 388 F.2d 193 (5th Cir., 1968), a case arising out of the exact factual situation as that involved in the present case. The Braswell case is dispositive of those issues. We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s other specifications of error and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-25\">The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
