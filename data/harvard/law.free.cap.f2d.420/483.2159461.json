The trial was before Judge Timbers and a jury, and appellant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on each count, the terms to run concurrently; in addition, Mastrian-ni was fined $5,000.00 on the first count. The only issue presented on this appeal is whether the order form requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>of 26 U.S.C. section 4705(a) compel disclosure of incriminating information in violation of the Fifth Amendment. This question, presented in almost identical terms, has been resolved against appellant\u2019s position in this Circuit. United States v. Minor, 398 F.2d 511 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. granted 395 U.S. 932, 89 S.Ct. 2000, 23 L.Ed.2d 447 (1969). See also United States v. Matos, 409 F.2d 1245 (2d Cir. 1969); United States v. Morales, 406 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. 1969); United States v. Oliveros, 398 F.2d 349 (2d Cir. 1968). We adhere to the reasoning of the <em>Minor </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
