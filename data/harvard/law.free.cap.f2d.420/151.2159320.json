His confinement could not have been continued without such a determination, D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (e) (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over his objection, the trial judge charged the jury that the appellant was presumed to be sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-28\">Appellant was committed to St. Eliza-beths in April 1966 following an acquittal by reason of insanity. He was examined by the head of the Larch Ward and diagnosed as having a mental illness. The hospital records continued to show him as suffering from the same disorder until November 30, 1967, more than ten months after the offense of which he presently stands convicted is alleged to have occurred. He was transferred to the' John Howard Pavilion on April 15, 1967, when the hospital received a detainer for him from the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office because he was the main suspect in an armed robbery of a dry cleaning establishment in the neighborhood of St. Elizabeths on January 18, 1967 (at which time he had \u201cClass C\u201d privileges under a \u201cclose check\u201d by hospital personnel). On June 21, 1967, an indictment was filed in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Court charging appellant with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">After his transfer to John Howard, appellant was interviewed by Dr. Eeono-mon, who was to display a very solicitous attitude toward the prosecution over the following months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Obviously, the examination of appellant was taking place under the peculiar circumstance that the hospital found itself with a patient who was accused of perpetrating a robbery while under the hospital\u2019s care and supervision. Seven and a half months elapsed between appellant\u2019s transfer to John Howard and Dr. Economon\u2019s diagnosis. In August 1967 Dr. Economon still had not made up his mind whether appellant was mentally sound; in his words, he intended to \u201cwait and see what the courts would do.\u201d Dr. Economon explained this on the witness stand by saying that he did \u201cnot want to act administratively in conflict with something else\u201d but denied that the court\u2019s or prosecutor\u2019s actions had affected his diagnosis. In October 1967 he responded to an inquiry from the Veterans Administration that appellant was mentally ill. Then on November 28, 1967, he wrote a letter to the United States Attorney in which he said he would \u201cattempt to cooperate with [the U. S. Attorney] in every way in this matter of mutual concern\u201d regarding appellant\u2019s sanity and his ability to stand trial. On November 30, 1967, Dr. Economon diagnosed appellant as \u201cWithout Mental Disorder.\u201d The appellant was released from St. Elizabeths December 19, 1967, and arraigned on January 26, 1968. In March 1968 he was tried and convicted for the January 1967 robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">At trial, the appellant requested the judge to instruct the jury that he was not presumed to be sane at the time of the crime because he was then being held in St. Elizabeths, diagnosed as mentally ill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead the judge charged the jury in the usual language that \u201cevery person is presumed to be sane.\u201d This instruction, despite the judge\u2019s later mention that the jury could consider the confinement in St. Elizabeths as cutting the other way, raises a serious legal question which requires more than the opinionless affirmance herein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, I would grant rehearing <em>en banc. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c) (1968); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-29\">. See Bolton v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 13, 395 F.2d 642, 654 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\">. In addition to the \u201csanity\u201d instruction, the facts of this case raise questions concerning the court-related roles of expert witnesses (see my concurrence in Proctor v. Harris, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 413 F.2d 383 (1969)). In' this regard, Dr. Economon\u2019s conduct was not reassuring, to say the very least. The \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d charge was apparently given on the basis of his testimony, in the face of contrary testimony by the Director of the Larch Ward and the official hospital diagnosis of mental illness at the time of \u2014 and for more than ten months subsequent to \u2014 the alleged offense. In these circumstances, the charge requires particular scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\">. The appellant also requested and was denied another instruction which would have established the irrebuttable presumption that lie had a mental disease at the time of the crime ; if this instruction were proper, the question for the jury would have been limited to whether the act was the product of the disease. <em>Cf. </em>People v. Samman, 408 Ill. 549, 97 N.E.2d 778 (1951) ; State v. Elsea, 251 S.W.2d 650, 651 (Mo.1952) ; Kizer v. State, 130 Tex.
