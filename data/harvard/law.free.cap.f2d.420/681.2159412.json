He claimed 1-0 or, in the alternative, a II-A classification. He received I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">The scope of our review is limited to the question of whether there is a basis in fact for the classification received by appellant. His sincerity in making the 1-0 claim was in issue. The Board resolved that issue against him. Clearly, there was a basis in fact for the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">On the II-A claim, the record supports our conclusion that there was a basis in fact for the Board\u2019s decision that appellant failed to make a prima facie showing that he could not be replaced in his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
