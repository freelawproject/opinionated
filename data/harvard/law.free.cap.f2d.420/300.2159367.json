The company was the insurer of an automobile owned by one Wallin which was involved in an accident on January 25, 1965, with an automobile driven by Michael Sampley, the minor son of the defendants-appellees. The automobile operated by Sampley was not owned by his parents and was not being used on their business or for a family purpose at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">A judgment was obtained against young Sampley in a State court but was not satisfied by him or by his parents. The insurance company paid the judgment under the uninsured motorist clause of its policy with Wallin.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">This action was filed July 2, 1968, by the insurance company against the parents of Sampley to recover the amount of its payment on account of the tort of their minor son.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">In an opinion published at 304 F.Supp. 523, District Judge Frank W. Wilson dismissed the action as barred by the Tennessee one-year statute of limitations relating to torts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">The insurance company, which did not file the present suit until more than three years after the accident, contends that the controlling statute of limitations is T.C.A. \u00a7 28-309,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which prescribes a limitation of six years on actions on contracts not otherwise expressly provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">The single question presented on this appeal is whether the one-year statute of limitations relating to actions sounding in tort is controlling, as held by the District Judge, or whether the six-year statute relating to actions based upon contracts is applicable, as contended by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">The appellee parents assumed liability for the torts of their son at the time he applied for his State driver\u2019s license, as required by T.C.A. \u00a7 59-704(c) and (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Under the provisions of this statute the negligence of a minor child in operating a motor vehicle is imputed to the parents or the other person or persons who signed the application for the driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Based upon the reasoning set forth in the opinion of the District Judge, we hold that this action is barred by the one-year statute of limitations (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">.
