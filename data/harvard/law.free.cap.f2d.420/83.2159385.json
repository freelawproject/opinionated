The fund is (a commingled managing agency account^ similar in most respects to an open-end mutual fund. First National City Bank\u2019s Commingled Investment Account (the Account) and other bank-sponsored funds likely to follow will compete with mutual funds and with those who market their shares. Competitors claiming that the Account is unlawful are the Investment Company Institute (ICl), an association of mutual funds and their investment advisers and underwriters; and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), whose members sell shares in open and closed-end mutual funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The Account was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-l et seq., and approved by the Comptroller of the Currency as a \u00bfbona (fide fiduciary activity (authorized for national banks by \u00a7 92a of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 92a. The NASD intervened before the Securities and Exchange Commission to oppose the grant to the Account of exemptions from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act, and how seeks to set aside the Commission\u2019s orders granting them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ICI sued the Comptroller of the Currency and First National City Bank (the Bank) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment invalidating so much of the Comptroller\u2019s Regulation 9, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.18, as permits national banks to operate this type of account. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court invalidated portions of the regulation and required the Comptroller to rescind approval of the Account. Investment Company Institute v. Camp, 274 F.Supp. 624 (1967). From that judgment, the Comptroller and the Bank appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">Each appeal raises difficult questions of competitors\u2019 standing. While a majority of the court has reservations about standing, these doubts have been resolved in favor of reaching the merits in cases of this consequence. On the merits, we are agreed that the actions taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Comptroller are fully consonant with the statutes committed to their regulatory jurisdictions. Accordingly, we affirm the orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission and reverse on the merits the judgment of the District Court in favor of the Investment Company Institute. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">The opinion of Judge BURGER, in which Judge MILLER concurs, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>opinion of Chief Judge BAZELON, which' follow, set forth the reasons for our action:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">BAZELON, Chief Judge (concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">First National City Bank\u2019s plan to operate(ja collective investment funcj) has generated complex and controversial issues for resolution by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because this innovation in. banking will create massive competition for the mutual fund industry, its members have brought the dispute to court. For the reasons stated at the conclusion of this opinion, I believe that representatives of the mutual fund industry have standing to adjudicate the important legal questions aired at length before the administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On the merits, the cases together present an interplay of administrative decisions designed to serve different but complementary regulatory aims. The Bank\u2019s plan straddles two sets of statutes. The result is a complicated, if sometimes awkward, accommodation of the requirements of each. Petitioners below claim that this accommodation compromises the vital protection to investors and bank customers afforded by the securities and banking laws, and creates a dangerous blend of securities dealing and commercial banking. From an analysis of the relevant statutes and their legislative history, I conclude that the Account, subject to the mutually reinforcing regulations imposed by the Comptroller and the Commission, was established in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Since 1962, the Comptroller has exercised authority under \u00a7 92a of the Fed-j eral Reserve Act to grant national banks. by special permit, the authority to exercise trust and other fiduciary powers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">* * * to act as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, receiver, committee of estates of lunatics, or in any other fiduciary capacity in which State banks, trust companies, or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Section 92a (j) authorizes the Comptroller to issue such rules as he deems necessary to enforce the proper exercise of those powers. In April 1963 the Comptroller issued revised Regulation.. 9, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.18, which authorized for the first time the^ commingling of managing agency accounts under national banks\u2019 fiduciary powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The background of Regulation 9 needs brief mention. Since the thirties, banks have been authorized to act as \u00bfmanaging agents to purchase and sell stock for a single principal) 1934 Fed.Reserve Bull. 609, but the cost of bank management made it prohibitive to offer this service to investors without very substantial assets. For example, the Bank\u2019s minimum for an individual managing agency account is $200,000. Prior to 1963, national banks were authorized by the Federal Reserve Board to commingle and invest customers\u2019 funds only if held in its capacities as trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian, and funds held as part of a tax-exempt pension and profit sharing or stock bonus plan of employers for the benefit of employees. Regulation F, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 206 (1959 Rev.). The Federal Reserve Board, moreover, had consistently taken the view that common trust funds should not be used as a medium to attract customers primarily seeking investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>management of their funds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the responsibility for regulating bank trust powers was transferred to the Comptroller, that office concluded, after study, that existing regulations should be broadened (to extend the advantages of collective investment to managing agency accounts.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">The Bank proposed the establishment of a commingled managing agency account pursuant to the revised regulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Bank\u2019s plan, a customer deposits a minimum of $10,000 under a broad authorization permitting the Bank to invest the funds with those of other participants in the plan) The customer is a principal, and the Bank, his managing agent. The customer receives an undivided interest in the fund, expressed as a \u201cunit of participation.\u201d These units are redeemable at net asset value, and are not transferable except to other participants in the plan. No sales load or redemption charge can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The Account is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and the units of participation are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq. (1964). The Bank is both investment adviser to the Account and statutory underwriter for the units of participation issued. The Account is subject to a Committee with the powers of a board of directors, whose members are elected annually by the participants. The Bank sought and received exemptions from provisions in the Investment Company Act which would have required that a majority of the Committee be unaffiliated with the Bank. The Securities and Exchange Commission required that at least two of the five Committee members must be persons unaffiliated with the Bank, but the other three will normally be officers of its Trust and Investment Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The Account is managed by the Bank pursuant to a management agreement which must be approved by the participants at their first annual meeting. Thereafter, the contract must be approved annually by the participants or by the Committee, including both Committee members unaffiliated with the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The Account is the functional equivalent of an open-end mutual fund, but there are several differences. The Comptroller\u2019s regulations provide that the units of participation or shares may not be marketed through regular channels of public distribution; participation is offered and publicized only through the Trust Department. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.18 (b) (5) (iii) and (iv) (1968). The Bank\u2019s compensation is limited by regulation to the sum of the fees normally charged for separate management of such accounts, namely, % of 1 percent per annum of the average net asset value of the fund. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.18(b) (12). Finally, and most important, the Account is under the supervision of the Comptroller like other banking functions. This includes review of the fund\u2019s ^investments to see that they are in accordance with sound fiduciary principles. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 481 (1964), 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.11(d) (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">VALIDITY OF THE ACCOUNT UNDER THE BANKING LAWS</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The District Court held that the Account is unlawful on two grounds: (1) the commingled managing agency account is not a fiduciary activity within the purview of |_92a_of the Federal Reserve Act and is not open to State banks under the law of New York, and (2) the maintenance of the fund violates \u00a7\u00a7 16, 20, 21, and 32 of the. Glass-Steagall Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 24 (seventh), 377, 378, 78 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">A. <em>The Federal Reserve Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The District Court relied on the differences between the trustee and agency relationships, noting especially the higher standard of care of a trustee, to conclude that a collective managing agency account was not a true fiduciary activity within the purview of \u00a7 92a of the Federal Reserve Act. The differences between the traditional trust relationships of trustee, executor, or administrator and the contractual principal-agent relationship do not, in my view, make the agent any less a fiduciary, fnor does commingling of funds, subject to the principal\u2019s authorization, change the fiduciary character of the duty owed to each; Brown v. Christman, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 203, 126 F.2d 625 (1942). The District Court apparently recognized that the Account might pass muster under the phrase authorizing banks to act \u201cin any other fiduciary capacity,\u201d but held that it did not qualify as an activity open to competing State banks under the New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Section 100-c of the New York Banking Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 2, specifically authorizes trust companies to commingle funds held in the strict trust capacities, but New York law contains no specific grant of authority to commingle funds held as managing agent. The District Court concluded that'the absence of such authority was an implied prohibition. Section 100-c, however, simply permits commingling in cases where the governing trust instrument does not authorize it. The conditions on commingling imposed by \u00a7 100-c have not been imposed upon collective accounts authorized by a trust instrument. The real question, therefore, was whether commingling was permissible under the general authority of \u00a7 100, which empowers a State bank to act as agent for any lawful purpose and to manage a principal\u2019s funds according to the terms of the power conferred upon the bank. N.Y. Banking Law \u00a7 100(1) and (5) (McKinney 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Since the decision of the District Court, the New York State Banking Department has given formal approval of commingled managing agency accounts to two New York banks, stating that the operation of the accounts is authorized by \u00a7 100 of the Banking Law. Appellee ICI describes this approval as a defensive response to enable State banks to meet the national banks\u2019 competition. This is surely true. Prior to the Comptroller\u2019s issuance of revised Regulation 9, no State banks operated commingled managing agency accounts. Still, the Banking Department\u2019s action cannot fairly be dismissed as merely following the Comptroller\u2019s lead. The question of whether collective accounts are a proper fiduciary activity for banks appears to have been open under both Federal and New York law, and both banking agencies could reasonably have resolved it the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">The Bank concedes, of course, that the commingling of managing agency accounts represents a departure from past banking practice of limiting commingling to funds held by the bank in the traditional trust capacities and as trustee of a pension or profit-sharing trust. Regulation 9.18 permits banks to serve multiple principals under a standard agreement vesting the bank with broad discretion to invest their money, (subject to the duties , and liabilities of a managing agent, and not ja_ trustee. &gt; This is a new and free-wheeling form of fiduciary activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>I am persuaded, however, that the Comptroller\u2019s regulations, together with the protection of the customer <em>qua </em>investor afforded by the securities acts, will reasonably assure the proper exercise of this broad fiduciary power. The restrictions imposed by Regulation 9, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9, secure the Comptroller\u2019s powers of, examination and supervision of the Account. (\u00a7\u00a7 9.8, 9.9.) The rules safeguard the fiduciary relationship by requiring the separation of the Account\u2019s funds from other assets (\u00a7\u00a7 9.13, 9.18(b) (2)), by enforcing the obligations to refrain from self-dealing and conflicts of interest (\u00a7\u00a7 229.10, 9.12, 9.18(b) (8)), and by limiting the Bank\u2019s charge to its normal fiduciary compensation (\u00a7\u00a7 9.15, 9.18(b) (12)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The major difference between the Bank\u2019s relationship to the customers of the Account and its relationship to the beneficiaries of other management and trust services is the absence of an individually negotiated agreement. The character of the Bank\u2019s initial advice and ultimate accountability to the customer is necessarily altered by a package deal offered to all comers. TFis was one reason why the Securities and Exchange Commission required registration of the Account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions for disclosure and participant control contained in the securities laws substantially compensate for the drawbacks of a standardized fiduciary service. The Securities Act of 1933 requires that potential customer-investors receive a prospectus describing the management of the Account, its investment objectives and policies, and the rights of participants. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77j (1964). Periodic reports and proxy statements must be issued for inspection by both the participants and the Commission. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-20(a) and 80a-29(d). Pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, participants in the Account will elect their directors (\u00a7 80a-16(a)), retain the power to terminate the contract (\u00a7 80a-15(a) (3)), and ratify the selection of auditors (\u00a7 80a-31(a) (2)). The interests of the principals participating in the Account, though not identical, are bound to be similar; and as a group, they possess a measure of control over the management of their money. Dual regulation by the Comptroller and the Commission should assure the proper operation of the Account. <em>rj^ -</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">B. <em>The Glass-Steagall Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The District Court held that the Comptroller\u2019s authorization of the Account violated four provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act. It held that in the issuance of units of participation, the Bank was engaged in the business of dealing in securities for its own account in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21, and that the relation between the Bank and the account was an affiliation or interlocking directorate between a bank and an organization principally engaged in the securities business in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 32 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">(1) <em>Sections 16 and 21</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act imposes the following limitation upon bank dealing in securities:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">* * * The business of dealing in securities and stock by the [national banking] association shall be limited to purchasing and selling such securities and stock without recourse, solely upon the order, and for the account of, customers, and in no case, for its own account, and the association shall not underwrite any issue of securities or stock * * * [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (seventh).]</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Section 21 of the Act prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the business of \u201cissuing, underwriting, selling or distributing\u201d most types of securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the units of participation in the Account are \"securities, and the Bank is the statutory underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933, the District Court held that the Bank is engaged in the selling and underwriting of securities prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21 in operating the Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The words security and underwriter in the Securities Act of 1933 are terms of art with a high gloss. Their expansive definitions under the Securities Act cannot be imported wholesale into the Glass-Steagall Act when the two statutes serve different purposes, in different contexts of risk to the public. The securities laws are intended to protect investors, primarily through disclosure requirements. Their terms have been interpreted broadly to afford their protection to purchasers of all manner of investment interests, wherever it is needed. The Glass-Steagall Act, by contrast, was enacted to protect bank depositors and the banking system from the risk of insolvency incident to widespread investment of banks\u2019 assets in speculative securities during the twenties. Banks frequently not only invested in speculative securities, but entered the business of investment banking by underwriting original issues. Some of these activities were undertaken directly; others were carried on by securities affiliates formed and controlled by the banks to evade completely the weak restrictions upon direct bank dealing in speculative securities. Section 16 of the Act was addressed to three problems:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">(1) Banks commonly invested their own assets in securities, risking commercial and savings deposits if the securities declined in value.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">(2) Direct bank investment in securities created pressure for banks to make unsound loans to maintain the price of securities or the financial position of companies in which the bank had holdings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">(3) Large city banks frequently acted as issuers, or underwriters of blocks of securities, distributing them at a profit through correspondent country banks. The banks\u2019 pecuniary interest in the ownership, price, or distribution of securities created incentive to steer customers into investing in what the banks had to sell.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">The problem of risk to deposits does not arise here, because the securities in the fund are purchased for^ERe account of the customer, ..not the Bank. The ICI does claim, however, that the Bank\u2019s indirect holdings in the Account may amount to an interest in individual eom-panies sufficient to influence its credit decisions. The short answer is that, since this indirect risk is present in all bank investments in securities for the account of customers, that problem was not within the contemplation of the Glass-Steagall Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">With regard to the third abuse treated by \u00a7 16, the ICI points out that because the Bank\u2019s compensation is tied to the size of the fund, there will be pressure to market the participations to maintain and increase its assets. I agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the Bank is under similar pressure to sell all the services of its trust department. The Bank\u2019s interest in earning a regulated fiduciary charge bears little resemblance to its interest in earning an indeterminate distributing profit from securities which it owns or underwrites, and the interest forbidden by \u00a7 16 is the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Section 21 of the Act prohibits banks from engaging \u201c * * * in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities * * It was enacted to extend the prohibitions of \u00a7 16 to members of the Federal Reserve System who were not national banks. Congress did not intend to bar those banks from buying and selling securities /\u201cfor the account of customers^\u2019 so \u00a7 21 appears to add nothing to the' argument under \u00a7 16. If anything, the language of \u00a7 21 confirms the view that Congress was concerned in both provisions with prohibiting bank dealing in speculative securities for the traditional and direct form of distribution profit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">(2) <em>Sections 20 and 32</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Sections 20 and 32 of the Act were enacted to maintain (the separation between commercial banking and securities dealing by prohibiting interlocks and affiliations of personnel. Section 20 forbids certain types of bank affiliation with any organization \u201cengaged principally\u201d in the same brand of securities dealing forbidden as a direct bank activity by \u00a7 21. One type of prohibited affiliation, defined in \u00a7 221a(b) (3), ordinarily exists when a majority of the directors of a securities organization are also directors of any one member bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Section 32 generally prohibits directors, officers, or employees of organizations \u201cprimarily engaged\u201d in securities dealing from serving in those capacities for a member bank. The Federal Reserve Board has consistently held that \u00a7 32 prohibits bank officials from serving as officials of open-end investment companies because such companies (mutual funds) are primarily engaged in issuing their own shares. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 218.101 (1951). The Board ruled, however, that the Account and the Bank were a single entity for purposes of \u00a7 32, since the Account would be a department of the Bank except for purposes of Investment Company Act. So long as the Account remained under the \u201ceffective control\u201d of the Bank, the Board stated that there was no prohibited interlock under \u00a7 32. 30 Fed.Reg. 12836 (1965), adding 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 218.111 (j) (1965).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The participants\u2019 reserve power to sever the connection with the Bank would be worth something in the event of extraordinary mismanagement, but barring this contingency, the Account will remain part of the Bank\u2019s organization. Under the single entity theory, the Bank cannot interlock with itself but that is not really the point. The clear purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 32 is to prevent banks from entering into prohibited forms of securities dealing by the back door. We have held that the Bank may enter the| business of operating the Account by the front door. The organizational pattern imposed to satisfy the requirements of the Investment Company Act does not in this context create a prohibited interlock or affiliation any more than the Account itself constitutes a forbidden excursion into the securities business.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The establishment of a bank-sponsored collective investment fund is not barred by the banking laws. A commingled managing agency account is a descendant of the individual managing agency account and the common trust fund, fitting within the traditional authority of banks to manage other people\u2019s money in a fiduciary capacity sanctioned by the Federal Reserve Act. Where the fiduciary tie between the bank and multiple principals is looser, the Comptroller\u2019s regulations and the securities laws will take up the slack. The essential element in this judgment on the applicability of the Glass-Steagall Actds the fact that the securities in the Account are bought and sold for the account of customers.\\ The sale of an investment service to a potentially large number of customers gives rise to obligations under the securities laws, but these do not convert otherwise lawful transactions for the account of customers into prohibited securities dealings within the meaning of the Glass-Steagall Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The major consequence of expanded investment service by banks will be a quantitative change in the volume of securities bought, sold, and held by banks. While substantial transactions in securities by banks may be essential for the modern management of their customers\u2019 money, an increase in their already massive securities holdings for the account of customers has some disquieting consequences for the underpinnings of corporate accountability and competition in the economy at large.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The dimensions of the problem are broader, however, than the banking laws on the books. The Glass-Steagall Act enforces the separation of commercial banking and a particular kind of securities dealing. Its legislative history affords little support and even less guidance for a judicial decision to limit bank transactions in securities for customers because today they differ in degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">VALIDITY OF EXEMPTIONS FROM \u00a7 10 OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The NASD, for its part, claims that the Bank\u2019s control of the Account is all too effective. It contests the orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission granting certain of the exemptions from \u00a7. 10 of the' Investment Company Act requested by the Bank prior to registration of the Account as a diversified, open-end management investment company under the Act. The exemptions together permit three or 60 percent <em>oil </em>the Account\u2019s five-member Committee to be persons affiliated with the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Section 10 of the Act was enacted to protect shareholders of investment companies from/exploitation by insiders with conflicting interests in other companies^ or lines of business by requiring that a certain percentage of directors be free of affiliations which may involve divided loyalties. Without the exemptions, \u00a7 10 of the Act would preclude the Account from having a majority of directors who are officers, directors, or employees of (1) a principal underwriter, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-10(b) (2), (2) investment bankers, \u00a7 80a-10(b) (3), and (3) a single bank, \u00a7 80a-10(c). While the Bank fits each of these statutory categories, the overriding issue is the propriety of the exemption granted from \u00a7 10(c) to permit a maximum of three instead of two ,/Bank officers to serve on the five-member Committee. A working majority of Bank directors was essential to allow the Account to function in conformity with the banking laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Before considering the exemption from \u00a7 10(c), it bears emphasis that there is nothing unusual in the fact that the Bank/as investment adviser)has majority control of the Committee of the Account. Open-end investment companies have traditionally been controlled and managed by their investment advisers; investors are buying their advice. Section 10(a) of the Act provides that 60 percent of the directors of an investment company may be affiliated with the investment adviser. Section 10 (d), moreover, permits certain types of \u201cno-load\u201d funds to have only one unaffiliated director if they meet specified conditions. The Bank sought but was denied an exemption which, if granted, would have enabled it to have only one unaffiliated Committee member.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Given these facts, the NASD\u2019s assertion that the Committee will abdicate its supervisory responsibilities because the Bank has \u201ceffective control\u201d of the Account in the eyes of the banking authorities requires a showing of something more than the normal pattern of majority control by an investment adviser. Nothing in the Comptroller\u2019s regulations still applicable precludes the Committee from exercising its responsibilities. Although Regulation 9, as originally promulgated, did not take account of the requirements of the Investment Company Act, all provisions of Regulation 9 inconsistent with that Act were superseded by the Comptroller\u2019s written approval of the Account in the form necessary to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank\u2019s majority control for purposes of day-today management of the fund is a false problem. The real issue is whether exemptions allowing an extra director on') the Bank side will undercut the Commit- \u2019 tee\u2019s watchdog role in areas of potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act empowers the Commission to grant exemptions from the Act, or any rule or regulation adopted under it, \u201c * * * if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions\u201d of the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-6(c). The Commission has exercised this authority to exempt persons not within the intent of the Act and generally to adjust its provisions to take account of special situations not foreseen when the Act was drafted. Transit Investment Corporation, 28 S.E.C. 10, 16 (1948); The Atlantic Coast Line Company, 11 S.E.C. 661, 666-667 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In granting the exemptions at issue, the Commission first observed that the Account differs on the one hand from the bank-dominated securities affiliates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of the twenties whose abuses inspired \u00a7 10 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, on the other, from open-end investment companies (mutual funds) not subject to the supervision of the Comptroller. For these reasons, it was appropriate to consider whether a bank-sponsored fund was a type of investment company requiring the standard measure'of unaffiliated directors or whether exemptions were justified by its novel characteristics. The Commission concluded that the risks of conflict of interest would be adequately controlled by the provisions of the Investment Company Act still applicable, supplemented by the Comptroller\u2019s regulations', and that the exemptions would permit the establishment of a desired new investment medium, still subject to all the safeguards necessary for the protection of its investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The conflict of interest problems created by bank affiliation with investment companies are of a different order when the fund is sponsored by the bank. In the proceedings below, the Commission considered four danger zones, previously cited by former Chairman William L. Cary in testimony before Congress recommending regulation of collective investment funds,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and urged by the NASD as reasons for denying the exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">A. <em>Retention of substantial cash deposits for the Account in the bank</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Commission discounted the danger that the Bank might retain an unwarranted portion of the Account\u2019s assets in cash in order to earn money for the Bank, stating that the temptation to leave funds uninvested would be contrary to the Account\u2019s stated policy of investment for long-term growth of capital and income, and to the Bank\u2019s interest in having the fund\u2019s assets increase. The interest in increasing the assets in the fund dictates not only that funds already held be invested in growth securities, but also, as we have seen, creates pressure to increase the number of participants. The undisputed fact that the Account will compete with the mutual fund industry can be expected to inhibit retention of its income-producing assets in the form of lopsided cash deposits, There is an important point of convergence between the interests of the Bank directors <em>qua </em>commercial bankers and their interest in the success of an investment medium offered as part of the Bank\u2019s services, a convergence not present when Bank personnel serve as directors of independent investment companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The Comptroller\u2019s regulations, moreover, state that funds held in a fiduciary capacity by banks shall not be held un-invested or undistributed for a period longer than is reasonable for the proper management of the particular account. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.10(a). Observance of this regulation is policed through examinations of bank trust departments which occur at least three times in every two years. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 481. The Commission reasonably concluded that the Bank\u2019s interest in holding the Account\u2019s asset in cash was offset by this combination of the carrot and the stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>B. <em>Use of Account investments to shore up Bank loans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Considered under \u00a7 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act was the danger that the Bank might make unsound loans to shore up companies in which it had made investments for the Account. From the standpoint of the Investment Company-Act, the risk is that the Bank will make bad investments for the Account to shore up unsound loans. In a letter to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, Chairman William McChesney Martin of the Federal Reserve Board explained why this area of risk was not regarded as significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">For many years banks have participated in the management of employee-benefit funds and other fiduciary accounts that hold stocks and other securities in an aggregate amount far exceeding those held by the entire mutual fund industry. The examinations conducted by bank supervisory agencies have disclosed practically no such misuse by banks of their investment advisory and management functions. In the case of managing agency funds, an additional safeguard is the prophylactic restrictions and requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, particularly publicity of the financial transactions of registered investment companies, which almost inevitably would expose such malfeasance. A further deterrent would be the adverse impact on a collective fund\u2019s performance \u2014 its comparitive financial record \u2014 if any of its resources were used to make unprofitable investments; the detrimental effect on sales of participations might outweigh any benefits the bank could reasonably expect from its breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">In addition to taking note of the Comptroller\u2019s supervision of investments, the Commission cited its own supervision of transactions involving a joint arrangement between the Bank acting as a principal and the Account under the insider provision of \u00a7 17(d) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-17(d),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and concluded that the margin for misconduct of this sort was narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">C. <em>Purchase by the Account of securities underwritten by the Bank</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The danger that the Account\u2019s funds might be used to promote the Bank\u2019s investment banking business is relevant generally to the exemption from \u00a7 10(c) and specifically to the exemption from \u00a7 10(b) (3). Section 10(b) (3) would have required that a majority of the directors of the Account be unaffiliated with an investment banker. The Bank is in the investment banking business to the extent that it participates in syndicates which underwrite debt securities of governmental authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">I concur in the Commission\u2019s judgment that there is no basis for concern that the Bank can or will use the Account /to further its limited investment banking Sbusiness. The Account is primarily a stock fund. It is not permitted to purchase any securities from the Bank, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-17(a), and cannot purchase government securities from another member of a syndicate where the Bank participates as principal underwriter. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-10(f). The Commission conditioned the exemption by prohibiting purchases from syndicate members even after the Syndicate has terminated but the members hold unsold allotments.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>D. <em>Allocation of brokerage to existing or potential Bank customers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Former Chairman Cary observed that banks often distribute brokerage to those brokers with whom the Bank has or seeks reciprocal dealings, and that this may be contrary to the best interests of the Account\u2019s investors. This is one breed of the \u201cbird-dog\u201d problem presented when bankers direct investment business toward companies whose banking business they desire in return. Such a practice would, of course, depart from the brokerage policy set forth in the prospectus. The Bank\u2019s stated objective in placing orders is to obtain the most favorable prices and execution of orders and, secondarily, to deal with brokers and.dealers who provide the Bank as investment adviser with supplementary research and statistical information or market quotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Reliance on the Bank\u2019s representations is not wholly satisfying. Allocation of brokerage for the Bank\u2019s benefit is a subtler form of self-dealing than questionable purchases of securities or maintenance of an undue cash balance, and one less amenable to control through disclosure and supervision by the agencies. Nonetheless, brokerage may be improperly distributed in the course of banks\u2019 already extensive securities purchases for the account of customers, and it is appropriate to point out that Congress apparently did not consider this threat to be of critical significance when it exempted common trust funds from the Act entirely. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-3(c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Commission\u2019s orders do not rest upon a sanguine assumption that there are no conflicts of interest incident to bank-sponsored investment funds, but rather proceed from a showing that the dangers are significantly different from those involved in other types of bank-investment company affiliations. Because the Bank earns only a regulated fiduciary charge tied to the amount of the Account\u2019s assets, the Bank-affiliated directors\u2019 interest in attracting more customers coincides with the interests of investors and to some degree counteracts the incentive to hold the fund\u2019s assets in the form of commercial deposits.! The restrictions upon Bank underwriting and Bank transactions with the Account make it unlikely that the Bank can profit by using the fund to unload or backstop its bad or indifferent investments, a major function of the bank-dominated securities affiliates of the twenties. To the extent that such hazards as improper brokerage allocation remain, the Commission could reasonably have concluded that two independent directors would perform adequately as watchdogs, with the enforcement powers of the Comptroller adding extra teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Finally, the NASD claims that the Commission made an expedient bargain in granting the exemptions in order to head off legislation to exempt bank-sponsored funds from the securities laws. It is true that the Commission\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over such funds generated legislative proposals, along with some friction between agencies of the Executive ;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but I view the decision differently. Taking due account of the reduced potential for conflicts of interest in bank-sponsored funds and the near-complete coverage of the securities laws, the Commission determined that the supervision of the Comptroller would compensate for the absence of an independent tie-breaker on the Committee of the Account. This was a fair trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">A. <em>Standing of the Investment Company Institute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">The ICI claims standing to challenge competition from banks on the ground that the Comptroller has authorized a competive activity specifically prohibited by Congress in the GlassSteagall Act. <em>Cf. </em>Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Saxon, 261 F.Supp. 247 (D.D.C.1966), affirmed <em>sub nom. </em>Port of New York Authority v. Baker, Watts &amp; Co., 129 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 392 F.2d 497 (1968); Saxon v. Georgia Assn. of Ins. Agents, 399 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">As a general rule, competitors lack standing to challenge competition created or enhanced by governmental action, even if it is illegal, unless they can claim the benefit of an implied or express statutory aid to standing. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Dillon, 118 U.S. App.D.C. 257, 335 F.2d 292, cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>American S. S. Co. v. United States, 379 U.S. 945, 85 S.Ct. 437, 13 L.Ed.2d 543 (1964). The Glass-Steagall Act was not intended by Congress to protect mutual funds from competition from banks, so they do not have standing as intended beneficiaries; and the Act contains no aggrieved party provision. <em>Contrast </em>Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities, 390 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968); F.C.C. v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940). The District Court held, however, that the ICI was an implied, though not an intended beneficiary of the Glass-Steagall Act, and granted it standing to sue as a private attorney general to enforce the separation between commercial banking and securities dealing, despite the absence of an aggrieved party provision to support that role.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We are all agreed that this holding is exceptional, but so is this case. While the majority concludes from the cases that there is no satisfactory authority for standing, I find in those cases no reason to deny standing, and good reason to grant it. First, the authorities for the rule denying competitors standing to challenge unlawful competition are inap-posite. Second, the basic justification for entertaining competitors\u2019 suits to challenge administrative action as statutory aggrieved parties, intended beneficiaries, or licensees is to vindicate a public interest, and not a private right. The absence of a statutory aid to standing in this case is adventitious, and I would grant appellants standing to assert the public interest without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">1. <em>Competitors\u2019 standing to challenge unlawful competition without a statutory aid to standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Analysis of suits by competitors confirms the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201cthe various rules of standing applied by federal courts have not been developed in the abstract. Rather, they have been fashioned with specific reference to the status asserted by the party whose standing is challenged and to the type of question he wishes to have adjudicated.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The general rule denying standing to competitors who can claim no statutory aid to standing is derived from two types of cases in which their interest in attacking allegedly unlawful competition has not been found reasonably proportionate to the burden on governmental agencies of defending against such suits. In one class of cases, privately-owned utilities have been denied standing to challenge legislative public power programs. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464, 58 S.Ct. 300, 82 L.Ed. 374 (1938); Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. T.V.A., 306 U.S. 118, 59 S.Ct. 366, 83 L.Ed. 543 (1933) ; Kansas City Power &amp; Light v. McKay, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 225 F.2d 925, cert. denied, 350 U.S. 884, 76 S.Ct. 137, 100 L.Ed. 780 (1955). These cases draw much of their vitality from considerations of separation of powers and the doctrine \u201cthat a person may not maintain a suit to enjoin the use of Government funds, even if such use is claimed to be in violation of law.\u201d In suits of this nature, \u201c[t]he fact that the plaintiff is suffering an economic detriment from competition assisted by a loan or grant of Government funds, does not give him standing to sue.\u201d Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Saxon, 261 F.Supp. at 249. <em>Cf. </em>Saxon v. Georgia Assn. of Ins. Agents, 399 F.2d at 1020-1021 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>There are similarly sound policy reasons why competitive injury does not confer standing to challenge administrative decisions affording some incidental aid to another competitor or group of competitors in an industry. Minor or speculative economic injury is not worth burdening the agencies and the courts with skirmishes among businesses over comparative advantages resulting from allegedly illegal agency action. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Dillon, 118 U.S.App.D.C. at 262, 335 F.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">These, then are the considerations underlying the many opinions which deny standing with the homily that competition is our economic norm. To acknowledge that cases denying standing to competitors are governed by (1) considerations of separation of powers, and (2) a desire to limit actions against the government, rather than by rigid abstract rules, seems to me only to do justice to the subtleties of standing as an element of justiciability. In suits by competitors, the nature of the claim is plainly relevant to the status of the economic interest asserted as a basis for standing. Here the ICI does not challenge the constitutional propriety of legislation or government spending. It does not ask this court to invoke due process or substantial evidence standards to afford it a remedy for marginal injury from an illegal administrative action. It points out, instead, that national banks operate under a regime of enumerated powers and prohibitions carefully laid down by Congress, and asks us to decide whether the competition authorized by the Comptroller violates specific provisions of the banking laws, one of which carries criminal penalties for bank entry into the securities business. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In these circumstances, to put the ICI out of court with the incantation that competition is our economic norm is insupportable in law and fact. No case stands for the rule that authorization of novel and prohibited \u2014 even criminal\u2014 business activity by administrative agencies is part of the rough-and-tumble of a competitive market. And in point of fact, toe-to-toe competition between mutual funds and commercial banks has never been the norm. The Comptroller\u2019s action introduces a powerful new element into a market previously closed to commercial banks by the rulings of the Federal Reserve Board, enforcing the same prohibitions now largely committed to the supervision of the Comptroller. This case falls outside the authorities for the general rule that competitors lack standing to challenge illegal competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We are not locked into conventional concepts of unfair competition in assessing a competitor\u2019s interest for purposes of standing. <em>Cf. </em>Jaffe, Standing To Secure Judicial Review: Private Actions, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 255, 265-266 (1961). It would not be far-fetched to conclude that competition illegally authorized by an agency which has allegedly ignored statutory prohibitions is unfair. But while there is arguably a private interest meriting protection here, it is plain that the overriding interest in enforcement of the Glass-Steagall Act is a public one. The question is whether the ICI may assert the public interest without a statutory aid to standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">2. <em>Competitors\u2019 standing to challenge unlawful competition with a statutory aid to standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">(a) Aggrieved party statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Since the decision in F.C.C. v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S. Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940), competitors have been granted standing to challenge administrative action under statutory aggrieved party provisions despite the fact that the statute does not require that their competitive interests be given weight by the agency. Competitors need not even be members of the industry subject to a specific regulatory statute to sue under it, so long as they can show aggrievement by administrative action pursuant to the statute. See Clarksburg Publishing Co. v. F.C.C., 96 U.S.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>D.C. 211, 225 F.2d 511 (1955); Philco Corp. v. F.C.C., 103 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 257 F.2d 656 (1958), cert, denied, 358 U.S. 946, 79 S.Ct. 350, 3 L.Ed.2d 352 (1959). Competitors whose interests and injuries are not legally protected or even immediately relevant to a regulatory jurisdiction are given standing as private attorneys general to represent the public interest in the proper administration of a regulatory scheme. Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. F.C.C., 316 U.S. 4, 14, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942); Associated Industries v. Ickes, 134 F.2d 694 (2d Cir.) vacated as moot, 320 U.S. 707, 64 S.Ct. 74, 88 L.Ed. 414 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">(b) Intended beneficiaries</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Long before <em>Sanders, </em>the Supreme Court had held that competitors have standing to challenge unlawful competition when they can show that a statute was intended to afford some protection to their economic interests. Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258, 44 S.Ct. 317, 68 L.Ed. 667 (1924). The <em>Chicago Junction </em>theory is the only logical support for cases holding that a license, grant, or other property interest makes some competitors more worthy plaintiffs than others. The significance of a license for standing is not its conventional status as a property right but the fact that licensing may indicate a legislative intent to limit competition in a market by regulating entry. Licensees may be intended beneficiaries entitled to rely on a regulatory scheme, with standing to enforce it. <em>See </em>Frost v. Corporation Comm\u2019n, 278 U.S. 515, 49 S. Ct. 235, 73 L.Ed. 483 (1929) (Dissenting opinions of Justices Brandeis and Stone).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In Chicago v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry., 357 U.S. 77, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958), the Supreme Court granted standing to a motor carrier to challenge the operation of a new carrier which had not obtained a permit required by statute on the ground that the first carrier was adversely affected and contended that the competition was prohibited by a valid city ordinance. 357 U.S. at 83, 78 S.Ct. 1063. The holding on standing does not even refer to the fact that the plaintiff carrier had a license; the point was that one party was lawfully in business and one allegedly was not. In such cases, the limitation on the number of entrants in a market is not really intended to benefit a licensee, but to assure to the public an adequate level of services from economically viable enterprises. The licensee-plaintiff is vindicating a public interest. His private interest is his reliance on the rules protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Since the enactment of aggrieved party provisions giving competitors standing in most regulated industries, the intended beneficiary theory has conferred standing in exceptional cases where there is no express statutory aid to standing, notably in an action against the TVA and in the spate of suits against the Comptroller. In Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities, 390 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968), the Supreme Court granted standing to a private utility to adjudicate a dispute over statutory area limitations on the expansion of TVA, a comparatively clear case of market allocation by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Competitors in regulated industries have been granted standing as intended beneficiaries of a regulatory scheme where the .statute (1) requires equal treatment of competitors <em>(Chicago Junction), </em>(2) regulates the number of entrants into a market <em>(Chicago v. Atchi-son, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe), </em>and (3) allocates markets among competitors <em>(Hardin). </em>In each case the legislature has concluded that the public interest in an adequate level of efficient services is furthered by .some restriction on competition. When private parties sue to enforce those restrictions, they are necessarily asserting a distinct public interest more important than their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">3. <em>Competitors\u2019 standing to sue the Comptroller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The banking laws affect competition by keeping banks out of specified business activities, but the limitation of competition in certain markets is a by-prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>uct of prohibitions, whose overriding purpose is to protect the banks and.their depositors\u2019 fortunes. Two courts have nonetheless granted standing to a group of insurance agents and a data processing firm to challenge rulings of the Comptroller authorizing banks to enter their bailiwicks on the ground that certain provisions of the banking laws indicate an intent to protect their interests. In Saxon v. Georgia Assn. of Ins. Agents, 399 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1968), the majority held that \u00a7 92 of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 92, permitting banks to act as insurance agents in cities of 5,000 inhabitants or less was intended to protect insurance agents in larger towns from bank competition. But it seems more likely that the sale of insurance was never an activity within the intent .of the statutory provision granting banks \u201call such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24(7), and that the general ban on bank entry into the insurance business was qualified solely for the purpose of strengthening weak banks in small towns. The interest of insurance agents in <em>retaining </em>the implied prohibition in larger communities is unrelated to the intent of Congress in enacting it in the first place. 399 F.2d at 1019 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Similarly, in Wingate Corp v. Industrial National Bank, 408 F.2d 1147 (1st Cir. 1969), the plaintiff data processors argued that solicitation by banks of data processing business from the business community at large was not a power incidental to banking, and that recently enacted limitations on the data processing activities of bank service corporations, jointly formed by small banks to enable them to purchase computer equipment, were intended to protect independent data processing companies.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The First Circuit accepted this argument, relying heavily upon the fact that the National Society of Public Accountants had proposed the limiting amendment. But the fact that the organized accountants pressed for an explicit limitation does not mean it was designed to protect them. Enterprises that lobby for legislation are not necessarily transformed into intended beneficiaries if it passes.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">I agree that the insurance agents and the data processors in these two cases did have .standing, but I am not persuaded that the specific provisions relied upon by the courts were intended to create protected classes of competitors any more than the Glass-Steagall Act was intended to benefit mutual funds or investment bankers. <em>Cf. </em>Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Saxon, 261 F.Supp. 247 (D.D.C.1966), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. </em>Port of New York Authority v. Baker, Watts &amp; Co., 129 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 392 F.2d 497 (1968). It is fruitless to look for an intent to protect these businesses from competition from banks in legislation designed to restrict or prohibit bank activities for reasons having nothing to do with competition. The critical question of congressional intent is this: Did Congress intend to immunize rulings of the Comptroller from judicial review? This is the critical question because substantial immunity is the consequence of denying standing to competitors. They are the only parties likely to challenge the authorization of prohibited bank activity. <em>Cf. </em>Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. F. C.C., 123 U.S.App.D.C. 328, 335, 359 F.2d 994, 1001 (1966). The intended beneficiaries of the banking laws, if the class is narrower than the public, are bank customers who have no immediate and compelling interest in litigation to further long-term sound banking.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">It is fortuitous that there is no aid to standing for these plaintiffs. If underwriters, insurance agents, data processors, and securities dealers are right that banks are prohibited by law from entering their businesses, Congress would never have foreseen that administrative rulings under the banking laws would substantially affect their economic interests. Judging from the purpose and pattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the banking laws, the question of aggrieved non-bank competitors never came up.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">This conclusion finds support in the fact that when Congress anticipated competition problems, it dealt with them in specific terms, notably in provisions of the banking laws equalizing the legal conditions of competition between state and national banks. In dozens of cases, state banks, and recently a state banking agency have had standing to challenge the authorization of new branches of national banks in violation of the statutory limitation of national bank branching to areas where state branches are permitted. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c). <em>See, e. g., </em>Whitney Nat. Bank v. Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., 116 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 323 F. 2d 290 (1963), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 379 U.S. 411, 85 S.Ct. 551, 13 L.Ed.2d 386 (1965); Nuesse v. Camp, 128 U.S.App.D. C. 172, 385 F.2d 694 (1967).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, under the usual rules of standing, a state bank can enjoin illegal branching by national banks, but there is no party who can sue to enforce the separation between commercial banking and the securities business. Given the relative triviality of the threat to the banking system posed by outlaw branch banks as compared to the menace of illegal securities dealing, this result is too bizzarre to have been intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Disappointed license applicants can call the Federal Communications Commission to account for its decisions in the name of the public. Regulated carriers and state banks may challenge unlawful competition because courts have inferred some protection to their interests from a regulatory scheme. In both cases, competitors\u2019 suits are furthering the public interest at stake in the rules. All that is missing in this ease is a \u201clogical nexus\u201d between the competitive interest of the mutual fund industry and the aims of the banking laws. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). It is missing because Congress had more important interests in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Principles of standing in competitors\u2019 suits have operated as rules of thumb to sort out proper plaintiffs and legal issues of competition deemed appropriate for j'udicial resolution. Both are present here. It is not disputed that the members of the ICI are aggrieved by the Comptroller\u2019s ruling. Bank-sponsored diversified investment funds open to $10,000 customers will compete for the cream of the market now cornered by the mutual funds. The ICI presents a question of statutory construction to define the boundaries of official authority, a type of question well within the traditional competence of courts of law. It is the only party likely to assert the public interest in observance of the banking laws by the agency responsible for enforcing them. In the exceptional circumstances of this case, I would grant the ICI standing to vindicate the public interest despite the absence of a statutory aid to standing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>B., <em>Standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The NASD claims standing to seek judicial review under \u00a7 80a-42(a) of the Investment Company Act, which accords a right of review to \u201c[a]ny person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission * * 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-42(a). It relies principally on the case of F.C.C. v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940), to support its standing to .sue as a private attorney general to vindicate the public interest in the proper enforcement of the Investment Company Act. This standing issue is settled by <em>Sanders. </em>There is no requirement that a plaintiff establish a legally protected private interest to sue under \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d statutes. Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. F.C.C., 123 U. S.App.D.C. at 335, 359 F.2d at 1001. The only question is whether the NASD is aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s orders granting the exemptions from the Act to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The NASD represents about 3,700 registered brokers or securities dealers. Most of its members sell shares in mutual funds to investors and are compensated by sales commissions from the \u201cload\u201d charged by the funds. The Bank\u2019s commingled investment Account and similar bank-sponsored funds sure to follow<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> are an addition to the group of \u201cno-load\u201d funds whose shares are not sold at a commission by NASD members. No one denies that bank-sponsored collective investment funds will provide substantial competition to both \u201cload\u201d and \u201cno-load\u201d mutual funds. Limitation of sale of partici-pations to customers with a minimum of $10,000 to invest does not narrow the area of competitive overlap enough to make probable injury insubstantial. Surveys indicate that individual sales of $10,-000 or more have accounted for about half the mutual fund industry\u2019s total dollar .sales.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> NASD members stand to lose commissions earned from the cream of the business. This is enough to show that they are aggrieved parties under \u00a7 80a-42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">It is clear, moreover, that the NASD is aggrieved as a result of the Commission\u2019s orders. Analysis of the legal problems in establishing the Account in conformity with the banking laws confirms the Bank\u2019s concession that without the exemptions, it would be \u201ceffectively precluded\u201d from operating the Account. Both conditions of standing to sue under the aggrieved party provision are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">For these reasons, I join in the decision of the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b148-11\"> These opinions were prepared prior to June 21, 1969 and are issued pursuant to the Judgment of this court entered on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-12\">.

The commentators agree that a conventional \u201clegally protected interest\u201d or statutory aid to standing should not be required in all cases. Professor Davis has long maintained that \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C. \u00a7 701 (Supp. II 1965-66), accords a right of review to any person aggrieved in fact by administrative action. 3 K. C. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 22.02 (1958) ; Standing: Taxpayers and Others, 35 Chi.L.Rev. 601, 619 (1968). Aggrievement in fact is all that is needed to create a case or controversy in the constitutional sense. There is some support for Professor Davis\u2019 interpretation in the legislative history of \u00a7 10, but most courts, including this circuit, have rejected it. Kansas City Power &amp; Light v. McKay, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 225 F.2d 924, cert. denied, 350 U.S. 884, 76 S.Ct. 137, 100 L.Ed. 780 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">Professor Jaffe views the private attorney general theory grafted on to aggrieved party provisions as a variant of the common law public action, rooted in English and American state law. If a party is suing as a private prosecutor, Professor Jaffe regards his individual in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>terest as irrelevant, but in such cases, \u201cjudicial discretion in terms of the size, urgency, and clarity of the issue at stake\u201d should be exercised in the decision to take jurisdiction.

I do so in order to reach consideration of the merits for such aid as some examination at our level may be useful to further judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">As I see it, there are three generally accepted theories of standing which guide the courts in ascertaining whether a plaintiff i.s the appropriate \u201cparty seeking to get his complaint before a federal court.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The first emerges from those cases involving a statutorily defined basis for standing. <em>See, e. g., </em>Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942); FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940). The second evolves from those cases where the plaintiff holds a public license, grant, or recognized property interest which supports his assertion of litigable rights. <em>See, e. g., </em>Frost v. Corporation Com\u2019n., 278 U.S. 515, 49 S.Ct. 235, 73 L.Ed. 483 (1929); Whitney National Bank v. Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., 116 U.S. App.D.C. 285, 323 F.2d 290 (1963), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 379 U.S. 411, 85 S.Ct. 551, 13 L.Ed.2d 386 (1965). A third theory of standing centers around a finding of intended \u201cstatutory protection\u201d which has been bestowed upon the plaintiff thereby entitling him to sue in order to preserve the interests which the statutory scheme has found to be worthy of protection. This third concept of standing supported the development of a less easily identifiable strain of decisions focusing on a theory of \u201cunlawful competition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The \u201cunlawful competition\u201d theory as a basis for standing would seem to have two distinct definitional interpretations: (1) \u201cto compete in any manner, whether legal or illegal techniques are utilized, is \u2018unlawful competition\u2019\u201d; (2) \u201cto engage in non-prohibited competition by utilizing techniques or engaging in activities which are in themself illegal is \u2018unlawful competition\u2019 \u201d. Under the former interpretation, either no one may enter the competition in a given kind or area of endeavor or the particular party seeking to enter the competition has been prohibited from doing so in order to protect those parties already pursuing the activity under some grant, franchise or license. Under the latter interpretation, competition per se is not proscribed but the very conduct which constitutes the competition is in itself illegal. In my view, the first interpretation is a valid one which necessarily emerges from the recognized desire to \u201cprotect\u201d extant interests and can properly form the basis for a claim of standing. The second finds no support in a close analysis of the myriad cases reviewing the prerequisites to standing, is a misinterpretation of the conceptual genesis of the theory of unlawful competition, and cannot support a claim of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">An illustration of this can be seen in the distinction drawn in the recent Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co., 390 U.S. 1, 5-6, 88 S.Ct. 651, 654, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968) ease. There, the Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">[T]he economic injury which results from <em>lawful competition </em>cannot, in and of itself, confer standing on the injured business to question the <em>legality </em>of any aspect of its competitor\u2019s <em>operations </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The reasonable corollary of this proposition would be that a party could question the legality of its competitor\u2019s operations if, independently, it could demonstrate that the competition per se was \u201cunlawful.\u201d In its subsequent analysis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Court made clear that by utilizing the term \u201cunlawful competition\u201d it meant to preserve the operative distinction between an evaluation of the lawfulness of the competition itself and an evaluation of the legality of the particular conduct which produces the competition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">To resolve the standing question the Court did not find it necessary to inquire into the legality or illegality of the implementing operations which the Tennessee Valley Authority was to utilize to enter the market for selling electricity in the areas in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All that was necessary was a finding that \u201cone of the primary purposes of the area limitations in \u00a7 15d of the [Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 as amended] was to protect private utilities from TVA competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 88 S.Ct., at 655. An area limitation, of course, lends itself to ready interpretation, hence competition per se by TVA would be \u201cunlawful\u201d if TVA had in fact encroached upon the market area which had been reserved for the local utility companies and from which TVA\u2019s entry had been prohibited. Because Kentucky Utilities Co. was a member of the class so meant to be protected, it had standing to litigate to obtain an adjudication of its substantive rights under the protective statutory scheme, and \u201cno explicit statutory provision [was] necessary to confer standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The rationale underlying this finding of standing is that Congress affirmatively intended Kentucky Utilities to be protected from TVA competition. In essence, it was a clearly identifiable beneficiary of a statutory grant of protection, and as such, it was entitled to sue to protect the rights conferred. Whether TVA\u2019s operations which led to the competition were in themselves legal or illegal was irrelevant to the determination of Kentucky Utilities\u2019 standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">In addition to these three categories of standing cases, some hybrid variations\u2014 some of which are valid, others not \u2014 have emerged. They include: (1) the Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra, </em>provision for taxpayer challenges of federal expenditures allegedly in violation of specific constitutional limitations; (2) the unique application of the \u201cconsumer aggrievement\u201d concept articulated in Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 123 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>App.D.C. 328, 359 F.2d 994 (1966), pursuant to the \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d provision of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 309(d) (1964); (3) the discretionary standing theory broached in Curran v.

As set forth in the preceding opinion, Appellee-Institute is a national association representing 177 open-end management investment companies commonly designated as \u201cmutual funds\u201d and the 88 investment advisers and 78 principal underwriters of these funds. The mutual fund members of the Institute represent 94 percent of all such companies in the United States. The Institute membership also includes several investment advisers and principal underwriters of individual mutual funds which are individual Appellees in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The major basis for Appellees\u2019 claim of standing to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s regulations is that the entry of the national banks into the so-called \u201cmutual fund industry\u201d would constitute \u201cunlawful competition\u201d which Appellees as representatives of the industry may challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, an analysis of the facts of this controversy illustrates Appellees\u2019 reliance on an incorrect interpretation of the concept of \u201cunlawful competition.\u201d To perceive the faulty basis of the claims of Appellees, their precise contentions must be studied.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Appellees are complaining of unauthorized administrative action creating a form of competition specifically prohibited by Congress in the Gla^s-Stea-gall Act. The challenged regulations authorize banks to engage in unlawful competition, permitting them to enter the mutual fund business and engage in <em>issuirig, selling, distributing </em>and <em>underwriting securities </em>in violation of Sections 16, 20, 21 and 32 of the Glass-St\u00e9agall Act. Appellees are not merely challenging a program of governmental assistance, financial or otherwise, to lawful competitors <em>whose competitive activities </em>have been specifically authorized by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Brief for Appellees 66 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">Appellees then go on with sweeping contentions \u201cthat competitors have the right to challenge new competition, authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>by administrative action, which has been prohibited by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Furthermore, there is <em>no justification </em>for the gloss which Appellants attempt to put on <em>Hardin requiring a specific and express Congressional intent to protect particular plaintiffs in order to confer standing on them, </em>to challenge regulations which create unlawful competition. The well-established rule, in this Court, the Supreme Court, and other courts, is directly to the contrary. <em>Where the effect of the statutory prohibition is to bar competition, </em>those subject to such illegal competition created by administrative regulation have the standing to challenge the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Brief for Appellees 66, 67, 73 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellees have thus sought to shift the focus to the activity of the Bank and its alleged violation of the strictures of the Glass-Steagall Act; their burden is to establish their own status as intended statutory beneficiaries of a freedom from competition by national banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In a recent decision denying standing in a suit brought by the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations and Data Systems, Inc.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> challenging allegedly improper national bank entrance into the data processing business, the Eighth Circuit made some cogent observations :</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Much of the confusion on standing seems to arise from the emphasis upon the issues to be adjudicated or upon the possible merits of the substantive claim rather than upon an examination of the status of the complaining plaintiff. <em>Whether or not a defendant is alleged to be engaged in illegal competition cannot by itself </em>determine a plaintiff\u2019s standing to complain * * * The fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">[I]t seems clear that an allegation of \u201cillegal competition\u201d is not the balancing determinant of a plaintiff\u2019s standing. The primary search must rest on whether the plaintiff\u2019s status is one which enjoys a private interest entitled to protection or is one which the law recognizes to be of such legal significance to allow a party to act as a public representative for a public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 406 F.2d 837 (8th Cir., Feb. 6, 1969) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">That Court found that the plaintiffs were \u201ccompeting in a non-regulatory field of free competition,\u201d they were not members of any class \u201cdesignedly protected by statute,\u201d and they possessed no legal interest \u201crecognized at law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843. Accordingly, they had no standing to challenge the new rulings by the Comptroller which allowed the bank to offer these new services.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">As previously indicated, the Glass-Steagall Act does not contain the familiar provisions which constitute an aid to standing in terms of allowing a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d to challenge administrative decisions or promulgations made pursuant to the Act. Nor can Appellees validly assert any \u201clicense, grant, or recognized property interest\u201d entitling them to standing. It is equally clear that giving even the broadest reading of the legislative history embellishing the Act will not support the conclusion that Congress meant to bestow upon Appellees any protection from competitive injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>these bases of standing foreclosed, Ap-pellees necessarily turn to the inaccurate definition of \u201cunlawful competition\u201d which I find to be without support in an analysis of the \u201ccompetition\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">For the most part the cases relied on by Appellees are readily distinguishable. In American Trucking Ass\u2019n v. United States, 364 U.S. 1, 80 S.Ct. 1570, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1527 (1960), the Court found a statutory purpose to protect \u201call modes of transportation\u201d and the complaining party had the benefit of a specific \u201cparty in interest\u201d aid to standing. Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 305(g). Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry., 357 U.S. 77, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958), involved a plaintiff which held a license, thereby entitling it to oppose another carrier\u2019s operation without obtaining a license. In <em>Frost, supra, </em>the Court found that a cotton gin licensee had a \u201cproperty right\u201d and could challenge the invasion of this right by another without a valid license. In <em>Whitney Nat\u2019l. Bank, supra, </em>the Court allowed a state bank to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s authorization of new branch banks from national bank competition. The <em>Georgia Insurance Ass\u2019n. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>involved a provision of the National Bank Act which evidenced an affirmative legislative intent to protect local insurance agents from the competition of national banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Some of the language in <em>Port of New York Authority, supra, </em>is more troublesome. There, a group of investment bankers challenged the Comptroller\u2019s authority under Glass-Steagall to permit national banks to distribute revenue bonds not backed by the taxing power of the public body issuing the bonds. In acknowledging standing for the investment bankers to pursue their challenge, the District Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">While no one may maintain a suit to restrain lawful competition merely because he is suffering an economic detriment, nevertheless, a person has a standing to complain against <em>illegal competition, </em>or <em>specifically, against competition on the part of a person who lacks the legal right or power to pursue the competitive activities. </em>In this respect this action is precisely parallel to cases in which a State bank has been permitted to maintain suit to restrain the Comptroller of the Currency from granting permission to a national bank to establish a branch that would compete with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\"><em>Id. </em>261 F.Supp. at 248, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">It seems to me that the District Court gave undue weight to the claim of unlawful competition and in effect equated it with competition created by illegal <em>activities. </em>This made it possible to rely on the \u201cbranch banking cases\u201d which are not really applicable, since those cases turn on the provisions of the National Bank Act which limit branch banking of national banks specifically in order to protect state banks from the unrestricted competition of national banks. <em>See, </em>Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Dillon, 118 U.S. App.D.C. 257, 335 F.2d 292, cert. denied <em>sub nom., </em>American Hawaiian S.S. Co. v. Dillon, 379 U.S. 945, 85 S.Ct. 437, 13 L.Ed.2d 543 (1964); Whitney National Bank v. Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., 116 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 323 F.2d 290 (1963), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>U.S.. 411, 85 S.Ct. 551, 13 L.Ed.2d 386 (1965).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Appellees here pursue their associational livelihood in a securities marketing industry which thrives on competition in the quest for the investment dollar. The entry of the national bank commingled investment accounts into this competition admittedly adds a whole new category of competitors but it is fundamentally not different from the situation which arises, for example, when \u201cgas stations\u201d sell candy bars, soft drinks and other staples for which travellers have need. Nevertheless, before Appellees may sue to prevent bank competition which affects their private financial interests, they must establish that the Glass-Steagall Act contemplated that they were to be protected from this competition in their pursuits. Even assuming that the competing activity of the Appellant Bank may be otherwise violative of a provision of the Act, I can find no indication that the Act intended to afford protection to securities dealers generally. My position therefore is one of reservation amounting to virtual disbelief in any standing in Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Persuasive arguments can be advanced that the pressure for someone with standing to challenge conduct in matters of large public interest is so great that irreconcilable abstractions and distortions have emerged to satisfy what are thought to be the needs. Quite often courts pursued a \u201cbootstrap\u201d or circular logic by initially analyzing the merits, in order that a finding of standing to challenge actions seems more palatable because the court has already found a possible encroachment of \u201crights\u201d which it desires to review. To evaluate standing solely or even primarily on such visceral reactions does violence to the judicially created concepts of standing:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">The fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses <em>on the party </em>seeking to get his complaint before a federal court <em>and not on the issues </em>he wishes to have adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\"><em>Flast, supra, </em>392 U.S., at 99, 88 S.Ct., at 1952 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">Evaluating Appellees\u2019 qualifications as prospective litigants on behalf of their own private economic interests and the public\u2019s interests, it becomes evident that they are indeed adverse both as respects their actual prosecution of this litigation and in regard to their fundamental challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s authority to allow the national banks to engage in this type of securities activity. Their financial interest in these proceedings has been examined in the preceding opinion, and when this is coupled with authoritative prognostications of impending financial harm to their interests if the Comptroller\u2019s regulations are allowed to stand,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is obvious that there exists one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>cogent qualification of a challenger in the reasonable probability of factual ag-grievement sufficient to insure the spirited adverseness necessary to judicial resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">With this element satisfied, on this record the alternative to a grant of Ap-pellees\u2019 claim to standing would be to effectively frustrate any challenge to the regulations in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Because of the factors discussed heretofore I am unable to set aside my grave doubts as to Appellees\u2019 standing to institute and maintain these .suits. However, in the uncertain state of the law as to standing, there is something to be said on both sides of that question. I therefore resolve my doubts in favor of the Appellees and concur in the result of that portion of the foregoing opinion which holds that the Appellees have standing. I am influenced substantially, as I indicated at the outset, by the need for judicial examination of the important questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The record before us reflects that the Federal Reserve Board and other government agencies involved gave careful and comprehensive study to all aspects of this problem before taking the actions challenged by the mutual fund industry. Our review function is narrow and limited; it does not include the power to decide whether the public will be better served by one or the other modes of investing funds so as to achieve diversification, yield, safety or low cost. All that is the primary responsibility of the special regulatory bodies established by Congress for that purpose. On the face of the record there is, of course, nothing very startling about the decisions of the Comptroller, the Commission or of the Federal Reserve Board. In one form or another banks have been holding, managing and investing funds for customers for a long time. Indeed, when one considers the historical background it could be reasonably argued by banks that \u201cinvestment trusts\u201d and more recently \u201cmutual funds\u201d have invaded their domain. However, such arguments are of a kind which are for the regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Here the Comptroller of the Currency, after study, has decided that the commingled managing agency account is a function which is authorized by law for banks and is in the public interest; the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board have approved. Other state and federal regulatory bodies are in accord. The regulatory bodies charged by Congress with these large responsibilities have construed the grant of power and with their accumulated expert experience have decided these issues. Their decisions are entitled to substantial deference and on this record I see no basis for disturbing their conclusions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">. In the language following the above-quoted statement, the Court continued: But competitive injury provided no basis for standing in the above-eases simply because the statutory and consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tutional requirements that the plaintiff sought to enforce were in no way concerned with protecting against competitive injury. In contrast, it has been the rule at least since the Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258, 44 S.Ct. 317, 68 L.Ed. 667 (1924), that when the particular statutory provision invoked does reflect a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest, the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">390 U.S. at 6, 88 S.Ct., at 654.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">.
