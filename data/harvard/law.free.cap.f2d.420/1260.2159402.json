We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-22\">On March 26, 1963, Moore was convicted of armed robbery and was sentenced to a term of from twenty to forty years imprisonment. Barbee and Mag-by, who were tried with Moore, were found guilty and not guilty, respectively. The convictions of Moore and Barbee were affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court, People v. Moore, 35 Ill.2d 399, 220 N.E.2d 443 (1966), and a petition for rehearing to that court was denied. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-23\">The habeas corpus petition was filed October 18, 1967, alleging denial of Fourteenth Amendment due process rights at the state armed robbery trial by prejudicial conduct of the prosecutor; denial of the Fourth Amendment right by an unreasonable search of an automobile and seizure of a shotgun; and denial of the Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness against himself by introduction of evidence of Moore\u2019s refusal to answer questions while in custody before arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-24\">The district court examined the transcript of the state trial proceedings and found a fair trial had been held with no violation of Moore\u2019s constitutional rights. The court also \u201cexamined and considered\u201d the Illinois Supreme Court opinion affirming Moore\u2019s conviction and found itself \u201cin accord\u201d with the opinion. Although the district court dismissed the petition, it certified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>\u201cthere may exist probable cause for an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The state conviction arose from a robbery which occurred in July, 1962. Moore was not arrested until the following October when he was taken into custody in connection with shots fired at a Chicago policeman, Thomas Clifford. After the firing of the shots, two men were seen fleeing from a parked automobile. Clifford called more police, and the additional officers made a warrant-less search of the automobile. A loaded \u201csawed-off\u201d shotgun was found.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two policemen were staked out near the suspect car and, a few hours after the shooting, Moore and Barbee were arrested as they returned, to enter the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor was detailing the events which led to the defendants\u2019 arrests. He said the policeman \u201csaw them [the defendants] this way because he was fired upon.\u201d Later, a police officer witness was asked under what circumstances Barbee was being held. He answered, \u201cHe was being held after his arrest during the previous evening * * * and there was [sic] guns found in his car and he had fired on a police car.\u201d Motions for mistrial for the opening statement and the policeman\u2019s testimony were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">On appeal after conviction, the Illinois Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion in denying the motions for mistrial because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the challenged testimony and also because a request for a cautionary instruction as to the comment in the opening statement was withdrawn, and there was no showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecution. Similarly, the Illinois Supreme Court found no reversible error with respect to Moore\u2019s claim of unfairness in the prosecution\u2019s display of the five firearms, similar to those the defendants had carried during the robbery, before the jury prior to receiving three of them in evidence. People v. Moore, 35 Ill.2d at 403-405, 220 N.E.2d at 445-447 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">The Illinois court\u2019s decisions on these questions were decisions of law upon uncontroverted facts. They were not presented to that court as federal constitutional questions. Had they been, we would not be bound by the court\u2019s decisions with respect to them. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed.2d 770 (1963). However, we are persuaded by the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s careful review of the relevant facts and its reasoning in disposing of the claimed state procedural errors at the trial, and accept that reasoning as fairly dispositive of Moore\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process claim made here. We hold that the district court did not err in deciding that there was no denial of due process in the state trial court\u2019s rejection of the motions for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">The Illinois Supreme Court also rejected the contention that the search of the automobile was unreasonable and invalid under Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964). The court thought the search was reasonable in light of the fact that shots were fired from the parked automobile in the middle of the night, that the police had no way of knowing if the defendants would return or, if they did return, whether they would attempt to take a weapon from the car and attempt an escape. Though we are not bound by the state court\u2019s decision on this federal constitutional question, Townsend v. Sain, <em>swpra, </em>we again accept the reasoning of the Illinois court as a correct decision dispositive of Moore\u2019s similarly stated Fourth Amendment violation claim here. We hold that the warrantless search of the automobile was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">The facts before us are not like those in Mosco v. United States, 301 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1962), where a search of defendant\u2019s apartment was made prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>his arrest. The court held a search made prior to an arrest and at a time when the officers were \u201cphysically unable\u201d to make an arrest could not be regarded as incident to an arrest. There was no valid reason found why the officers could not have obtained a warrant. Nor is United States v. Stevenson, 409 F.2d 354 (7th Cir. 1969), applicable. In the case before us the police had reason to believe the guns were used in the shooting incident and might be used against the staked-out police should the two men return to the automobile from which the police had already been fired upon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">We see no basis for a claim of prejudice in testimonial reference to a shoulder holster on Moore, where it was hot in evidence. The officer was detailing what was found on defendants when they were arrested, and there was no emphasis placed on the existence of the holster. The fact that Moore denied having one is not conclusive in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The only question raised here which was not raised in the Illinois Supreme Court is that Moore\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself was violated by testimony that Moore \u201crefused\u201d to answer questions during a pre-trial custodial examination. The policeman testified that he asked Moore his name and address. Moore answered. Then the following questions and answers were given:</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">Q. * * * did you ask him any other questions ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">A. Yes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">Q. Did he give you any other answers ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">A. No sir, no other answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">Moore does not deny that no comment was made about this \u201crefusal\u201d to answer, during the two-week trial. Consequently, Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 610, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1964), does not apply. We think this contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">For the reasons given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">The court expresses its appreciation to Mr. James B. Fadim, of the Illinois Bar, for his dedicated services as court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">. Moore is currently in the Cook County, Illinois jail under a death sentence following conviction in May, 1964, by a jury, of murder. This conviction was affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court, and a petition for rehearing was denied March 25, 1969. Petition for certiorari from that decision is now pending in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1326-12\">.
