The Court further ordered that the administration and faculty be reassigned so that a ratio of one out of every six full time faculty and staff members would be of a race different from the majority of such school faculty and staff for the school year 1969-1970, and that when the implementation of the pupil assignment had been completed no faculty or staff would be identifiable as being tailored for a heavy concentration of Negro or white students. Appellants seek summary reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-18\">Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19; United States v.
