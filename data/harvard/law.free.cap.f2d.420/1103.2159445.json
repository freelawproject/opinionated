On that day Paul Case, an employee of Smith Petroleum Service, Inc. (Smith), was fatally burned while working atop an oil drilling rig in the Brookhaven Field in Lincoln County, Mississippi. Smith was employed by Monsanto Chemical Company (Monsanto) to perform a workover job on Monsanto's Lucien No. 1 well in the Brookhaven Field. The work at the well was done pursuant to an oral agreement entered into by Monsanto\u2019s field superintendent, Marvin McGraw, .and Smith\u2019s manager, J. L. Francis. This agreement, which included no specific provision for indemnity in the event of an injury, contemplated that Smith would provide.the necessary crew, tools, and rig for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-16\">Work was commenced on May 21,1963, when the crew changed the pump in an attempt to make the well produce. When this proved unsuccessful, the pump was changed for a second time, but the result was again unsatisfactory. When Charles Barfield, production foreman for Monsanto, was advised of the situation, he ordered a dialog test run to determine whether any tubing in the well leaked or needed to be replaced. On the basis of the dialog test, he decided to have the tubing pulled so that certain lengths of tubing could be replaced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-17\">McGraw and Francis agreed upon a plan to be used in pulling the tubing: salt water would first be poured into the well, then a standing valve would be dropped, and finally the tubing would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>be filled with salt water. Barfield, however, decided to drop the standing valve first and add fifty barrels of salt water later. At trial Monsanto experts testified that putting the salt water in ahead of the valve would damage the well; Smith experts testified to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">When the actual pulling of the tubing began on May 24, the valve and the salt water had already been inserted in the well under Barfield\u2019s direction. At one point on May 24 Barfield ordered the operation shut down temporarily while blowout preventers were installed in the casing and stabbing valves were brought to the derrick. He also instructed the Smith employee who was operating the motor that he was not to exceed a specified pulling power while removing the tubing from the well. After requesting these safety measures, Barfield left the well site for a time. Upon returning he parked his car about 150 feet from the well and remained in the car, doing paper work which was apparently unrelated to the work on the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">The Smith crew proceeded to remove the tubing at the well site, and as the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth joints were pulled to the surface they noticed a brown fluid spilling from the joints. They immediately ceased the operation, and the motor that operated the draw works was shut down. But when the flow from the tubing ceased after a few minutes, Smith\u2019s foreman ordered the operation resumed. Then, as the thirty-sixth joint was raised to about fifteen feet above the derrick floor, oil gushed from the tubing into the derrick. Because of the tremendous pressure from the hole the crew was unable to lower the tubing. Oil came in contact with the draw-works motor exhaust and ignited. Mr. Case, who was working on the derrick, was engulfed by the flames and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">Smith paid workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to Case\u2019s family, and thereafter Case\u2019s widow instituted suit against Monsanto <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court of Hinds County, Mississippi. Monsanto removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on the ground of diversity of citizenship and filed a third party complaint against Smith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 28, 1965, Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), Smith\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier, filed a petition to intervene, seeking to recover the sum Travelers had paid to Case\u2019s survivors and beneficiaries under the Mississippi Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">On July 10, 1965, Mrs. Case and Monsanto entered into a provisional settlement for $25,000.00. They then moved the district court to approve the settlement. The court did approve the settlement on August 27, 1965, dismissing Mrs. Case\u2019s claim against Monsanto without prejudice to the right of Travelers to pursue its subrogation claim. The case proceeded to trial with Monsanto\u2019s claim against Smith and Travelers\u2019 claim for reimbursement still to be decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Hearing the case without a jury, the district court found \u201cthat Monsanto and Smith were equally guilty of negligence\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and held that Smith should bear one-half the cost of Monsanto\u2019s settlement and attorney\u2019s fees and' expenses. The court further held that Travelers was entitled to recover from Monsanto the amount of compensation benefits it had paid. Smith appeals the judgment against it in favor of Monsanto, and Monsanto cross appeals. Monsanto also appeals the judgment against it in favor of Travelers. We reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Monsanto asserts that it is entitled to indemnity from Smith, and in support of this claim Monsanto invokes two theories. The first is that Smith in carrying out its duties at the well breached its implied warranty to perform in a workmanlike manner, giving rise to indemnity under the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine. The second is that on the facts of this case Smith was actively negligent while Monsanto was only passively negligent, and thus Smith must indemnify Monsanto because of Smith\u2019s more serious tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">We consider first the <em>Ryan </em>issue. In Ryan Stevedoring Company v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, 1956, 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133, the stevedoring company (Ryan) by informal agreement had contracted with the steamship company (Pan-Atlantic) to perform all its coastal stevedoring operations. While unloading cargo on one of Pan-Atlantic\u2019s ships, a Ryan employee was injured when he was struck by a heavy roll of pulpboard which had been improperly stowed. The employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>brought suit against the shipowner and recovered because the ship was found to be unseaworthy. The shipowner in turn sued the stevedore, seeking reimbursement for the damage paid to the injured employee. The Supreme Court held that the shipowner\u2019s action for indemnity could be maintained. In reaching this result, the Court held that the action was not barred by the exclusive-liability provision of section 5 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-4\">\u201cWhile the Compensation Act protects a stevedoring contractor from actions brought against it by its employee on account of the contractor\u2019s tortious conduct causing injury to the employee, the contractor has no logical ground for relief from the full consequences of its independent contractual obligation, voluntarily assumed to the shipowner, to load the cargo properly.\u201d 350 U.S. at 131, 76 S.Ct. at 236, 100 L.Ed. at 140.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Moreover, in the absence of an express indemnification agreement, the Court held that a stevedore\u2019s contract with a shipowner includes an implied warranty of workmanlike performance: eludes petitioner\u2019s obligation not only to stow the pulp rolls, but to stow them properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken. This obligation is not a quasi-contractual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual relationship. It is of the essence of petitioner\u2019s steve-doring contract. It is petitioner\u2019s warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product.\u201d 350 U.S. at 133-134, 76 S.Ct. at 237, 100 L.Ed. at 141-142.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-6\">\u201cThe shipowner here holds petitioner\u2019s uncontroverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner\u2019s stevedor-ing operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily in-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">In construing <em>Ryan, </em>we note at the outset that the shipowner\u2019s remedy is grounded conceptually in the <em>contract </em>with the stevedore and not in the negligence of the stevedore.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Italia Societa v. Oregon Stevedoring Company, 1964, 376 U.S. 315, 84 S.Ct. 748, 11 L. Ed.2d 732; Waterman Steamship Corporation v. Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc., 1960, 364 U.S. 421, 81 S.Ct. 200, 5 L. Ed.2d 169; Crumady v. Joachim Hend-rik Fisser, 1959, 358 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed.2d 413; Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company v. Nacirema Operating Company, 1958, 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491. This court has repeatedly recognized the contract rationale underlying <em>Ryan </em>and its progeny. Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service of Texas, Inc., 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, 1040; Loffland Brothers Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>v.

Norton Drilling Company, 5 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 431, 434-435, cert. denied, 374 U.S. 829, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\">Moreover, we deem it of fundamental importance to recall that <em>Ryan </em>was conceived as an admiralty concept to meet special problems which had arisen in the law of admiralty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mindful of its origins in the realm of admiralty law, this court has consistently refused to extend its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>application to non-maritime situations. We have held on numerous occasions that <em>Ryan </em>stops at the water\u2019s edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">For example, in General Electric Company v. Cuban American Nickel Company, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 89, 92, Judge Wisdom wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-5\">\u201cThe complexities and nuances involved in application of the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine in admiralty do not now concern us: The instant case turns on Louisiana law, not on federal admiralty law. We consider the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine inapplicable to the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">In the same vein, <em>Ryan </em>was declared to be waterborne and not landbased in the words of Judge Tuttle in General Dynamics Corporation v. Adams, 5 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 271, 279:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-7\">\u201cWe are here concerned with the Florida rule with respect to the right of indemnity for, while the right to proceed in a third party action is established by Federal rule, such right depends upon the existence of a state created liability. Thus, the Supreme Court decisions in Maritime cases, * * * recognizing the right of a shipowner to recover against a steve-doring company when successfully sued by an employee of the stevedoring concern, are not in point here.\u201d (Case citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">Compelling policy reasons for confining <em>Ryan </em>to the admiralty domain where it achieved its nascence were convincingly articulated by Judge Gewin in Centraal Stikstof Verkoopkanter, N.V. v. Walsh Stevedoring Company, 5 Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 523, 529:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-11\">\u201cThe <em>Ryan </em>doctrine establishes a severe and harsh rule which imposes a substantial and heavy burden on the stevedore or one similarly situated. * * * Because of the weight of this burden, and because of the far reaching implications of the doctrine if applied outside its original context, we have been slow to expand the scope of the doctrine beyond the original factual circumstances in which it arose. * * * The implied warranty established in <em>Ryan </em>is a product of the admiralty courts and a creature of admiralty law. It is tied closely to the duties and obligations which the admiralty law imposes on shipowners with respect to those employed by and who work on a ship. * * * Those cases in which the doctrine has been applied have been admiralty cases which presented substantially similar circumstances to those existing in <em>Ryan. </em>* * * We are accordingly hesitant to apply the doctrine to this, a non-maritime case, which is controlled by Alabama and not federal maritime law. * * *\u201d (Case citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-16\">Aware of these reasons, this court in other recent cases has reiterated the conviction that <em>Ryan </em>should not be extended beyond the scope of the admiralty situations in which it arose. See, e. g., Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service of Texas, Inc., 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, 1041 (Brown, C. J.) (\u201c * * * the <em>Ryan </em>theory is conceptually unrelated to local tort principles * * *.\u201d); United States v. Seckinger, 5 Cir. 1969, 408 F.2d 146, 153, cert. granted, 396 U.S. 815, 90 S.Ct. 104, 24 L.Ed.2d 67 (Brown, C. J.) (\u201cSo far this Court has kept this newly formed concept strictly confined to salt water or at least amphibious applications.\u201d); Loffland Brothers Company v. Roberts, 5 Cir. 1967, 386 F. 2d 540, 549, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1040, 88 S.Ct. 778, 19 L.Ed.2d 830 (Gewin, J.) (\u201cRecognizing this unique obligation on the part of a shipowner, we have held that the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine is closely tied to a vessel and this obligation which the shipowner owes to those employed on the vessel. * * * We are accordingly extremely hesitant to extend the burdensome <em>Ryan </em>doctrine to situations not substantially similar to those which gave birth to the doctrine.\u201d); Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Company v. Berry Brothers Oilfield Service, Inc., 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 511, 513, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 849, 88 S.Ct. 102, 19 L.Ed.2d 118 (Thornberry, J.) (\u201cWhile freely implementing this contractual obligation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>the stevedore to indemnify the shipowner in accordance with the liberal spirit of <em>Ryan, </em>we have hesitated, however, to extend it beyond those controversies involving the \u2018special rules governing the obligations and liability of shipowners\u2019 which necessitated its formulation and justify its application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">In short, <em>Ryan </em>was conceived as an admiralty concept, and its explicatory progeny have not denied its paternal thesis. We find nothing in the wake of <em>Ryan </em>to lead us to apply its principles to landlubbers. It is abundantly clear that no tributary of <em>Ryan </em>reaches the Brookhaven Oil Field in Lincoln County, Mississippi, which is many miles inland from both the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Consequently, in deciding this issue we cannot distill Mississippi law through a federal sieve; we must completely abandon the admiralty domain and repair to Mississippi\u2019s inland terrain. Looking solely to Mississippi\u2019s independent jurisprudence, we are unable to find any authority clearly indicating that Mississippi recognizes a Ryan-type implied contract of indemnity in a situation such as the case before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must conclude that Monsanto is not entitled to indemnity on the basis of its contract theory. The trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Monsanto\u2019s second theory in support of its claim of indemnity is a tort theory. Monsanto contends that Smith is liable to Monsanto under the common law theory of indemnity because Smith\u2019s negligence was \u201cactive\u201d while Monsanto\u2019s negligence was only \u201cpassive.\u201d As we view the facts, however, this contention has no merit. Monsanto and Smith were in pari delicto; each was guilty of acts or omissions which could have proximately caused the death of Paul Case. We have examined the record and find adequate support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat Monsanto and Smith were equally guilty of negligence.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">Even if this were not the case, Smith would be shielded from liability to Monsanto on a tort theory by the exclusive-remedy provisions of the Mississippi Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The statute\u2019s remedial exclusivity is set forth in section 5 of the Act, Mississippi Code \u00a7 6998-05:</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">The liability of an employer to pay compensation shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next-of-kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages at common law or from such employer on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this act, an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under this act, or to maintain an action at law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>for damages on account of such injury or death. In such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, nor that the employee assumed the risk of his employment, nor that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">In considering this provision of the Act, we acknowledge that no Mississippi court has passed on the precise question before us. In this jurisprudential void, after we have engaged in futile searching to find the law, <em>Erie </em>requires us to surrogate for Mississippi until it speaks authoritatively. In fulfilling the <em>Erie </em>mandate, we hold that, because of the provisions of Mississippi Code \u00a7 6998-05, a third party which has been held liable to an employee may not receive indemnity from the employer on a tort theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">We are aided in reaching this conclusion by similar holdings concerning workmen\u2019s compensation statutes in other jurisdictions. See, e. g., General Electric Company v. Cuban American Nickel Company, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 89 (Louisiana law); O\u2019Steen v. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, N.D.Ga.1968, 294 F. Supp. 409, <em>followed </em>in Central of Georgia Railway Company v. Lester, 1968, 118 Ga.App. 794, 165 S.E.2d 587; <em>cf. </em>General Dynamics Corporation v. Adams, 5 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 271, 278 (Florida law). These decisions are grounded in the concept that the workmen\u2019s compensation scheme has \u201ccompletely abolished an employer\u2019s <em>tort </em>liability for injuries to his employees.\u201d Halliburton Company v. Norton Drilling Company, 5 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 431, 434, cert.denied, 374 U.S. 829, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1052. A workmen\u2019s compensation scheme is, in effect, a state-enforced \u201cbargain\u201d between employee and employer, in which each party gains something: \u201cThe injured employee is provided with a <em>certain </em>recovery, [and] the employer is * * * shielded from any tort action arising from the injury.\u201d General Electric Company v. Cuban American Nickel Company, <em>supra, </em>396 F.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">The Mississippi Legislature has clearly denied to an employee the right to bring an action in tort directly against his employer. Mississippi Code \u00a7 6998-OS. See L. B. Priester &amp; Son, Inc. v. Dependents of Bynum, 1962, 244 Miss. 185, 137 So.2d 907, 141 So.2d 246, 142 So.2d 30, 31. Courts construing Mississippi law should not allow an employee to do indirectly (through a third party) what he has been forbidden to do directly. \u201c[H]aving paid compensation for an injury to its employee one time, the [employer] cannot be liable again in tort.\u201d O\u2019Steen v. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, <em>supra, </em>294 F.S.upp. at 412. Thus, even if Monsanto were correct in asserting that its negligence was \u201cpassive\u201d while Smith\u2019s was \u201cactive,\u201d the exclusive-liability provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act would stand as a Horatio at the bridge to bar Monsanto\u2019s claim to indemnity from Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">In our consideration of the indemnity issue, one confusing aspect of the trial court\u2019s opinion is deserving of comment. The court concluded \u201cthat Smith should bear one-half the cost of Monsanto\u2019s settlement and attorney fees and expenses.\u201d 277 F.Supp. at 292. This apportionment of damages might seem to indicate that the trial court was awarding contribution rather than indemnity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>However, the remainder of the trial court\u2019s opinion deals with the concept of indemnity; all the cases cited in the trial court\u2019s opinion are indemnity cases; and the parties involved in this appeal have briefed and argued the case in terms of indemnity rather than contribution. Consequently, despite the trial court's rather confusing award of damages, we are firm in our conviction that the concept of contribution is not involved in this ease, and we do not reach any issue related to that concept. Viewing this case as one involving the concept of indemnity, we hold that Monsanto is entitled to recover nothing from Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">In a separate appeal Monsanto contests the judgment rendered against it in favor of Travelers, Smith\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. The trial court allowed Travelers to intervene and awarded Travelers a judgment in the amount of $3,117.05, the amount Travelers had paid in compensation benefits. Monsanto contends that the trial court erred in several respects concerning Travelers\u2019 intervention. First, Monsanto asserts that the district court erred in assuming jurisdiction over Travelers\u2019 claim. Second, Monsanto argues that Travelers\u2019 petition to intervene should have been dismissed on the ground that it was not timely filed. Finally, Monsanto contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss Travelers\u2019 suit at the conclusion of the evidence offered by Travelers. For the reasons hereinafter given, we find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">Monsanto\u2019s first assertion of error is that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the claim of Travelers. Characterizing Travelers\u2019 intervention as permissive intervention under Rule 24(b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Monsanto relies on the rule that such permissive intervention requires an independent jurisdictional basis, i. e., that the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332 must be pleaded and proved. These requirements are, of course, (1) an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000.00, and (2) diversity of citizenship.

Moreover, we consider it relevant to note that Travelers gave a reason for its delay: in its petition to intervene Travelers stated that it had delayed its intervention at the request of Mrs. Case\u2019s attorneys who felt that intervention by Travelers might adversely affect her cause of action. In addition, we are unable to perceive any way in which any party could have been prejudiced by the timing of Travelers\u2019 intervention. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Travelers\u2019 motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Monsanto also contends that the district court erred in overruling Monsanto\u2019s motion to dismiss at the conclusion of Travelers\u2019 evidence. At that point in the case, Monsanto tells us, there was no showing of any fault or responsibility on the part of Monsanto for the death of Paul Case. Consequently, Monsanto maintains, the trial court was compelled by Rule 41(b)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to dismiss Travelers\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Even if we were to assume that Monsanto is correct in its assessment of the evidence at that point in the trial, Monsanto\u2019s view of the law is incorrect. The trial court was not required to rule on the motion to dismiss at that time. Under Rule 41(b), when the defendant moves for a dismissal at the completion of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of evidence, the trial court has two options: (1) The court \u201cas trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff,\u201d or (2) the court \u201cmay decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.\u201d In this case the trial court properly exercised the second option, reserving a ruling on the motion to dismiss. The court\u2019s action was clearly in compliance with Rule 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">An additional problem remains for disposition. In awarding judgment for Travelers, the court below ordered that Travelers be reimbursed by Monsanto. Although we agree with the trial court that Travelers is entitled to reimbursement for the amount of compensation payments which it paid to the dependents of Paul Case, Monsanto is not the proper source of reimbursement. Instead, in accordance with the provisions of Mississippi Code \u00a7 6998-36,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Travelers should be reimbursed from the settlement which Monsanto paid to Mrs. Case. The judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>ment below should be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">In its quest for indemnity, Monsanto must suffer disappointment. Neither its invocation of the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine nor its incantation of the magic words \u201cactive-passive\u201d can subject Smith to indemnity. Monsanto must leave this court with empty hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">More successful is the quest of Travelers for reimbursement. Travelers is entitled to recover, but the source of its recovery must be the settlement paid by Monsanto to Mrs. Case and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">The judgment is reversed in part and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1169-12\">.

However, since there is now no claim that Monsanto is not the real party in interest, the joinder of Liberty Mutual as a possible real party in interest has no bearing on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">. 277 F.Supp. at 292. See <em>id. </em>at 290-291:</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">\u201cThere is no question of Smith\u2019s negligence. Francis and Walker conceded that they gave the crew no specific safety instructions as each man was supposed to be an experienced oil field worker and capable of taking care of himself; conceded that no safety line had been provided as an escape route other than the guy lines from the outside of the derrick to the ground; nor was Case instructed to come down if oil began flowing. In the event of a flow, the purpose of the stabbing valves was to control the flow. The Court finds that the failure of the crew to install the stabbing valve in the interval following the first flow, and thereby allowing the well to become out of control may well have been one cause of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">\u201cMonsanto\u2019s negligence was not so patent, but there were several areas in which a jury could have found Monsanto liable * * *. [Barfield] was a petroleum engineer with exjjerienee in the oil field and was in charge of outlining to Smith and its supervisory employees the over-all procedure in the work-over job. * * * [It appears that there was not] enough salt water [in the well] to prevent the well\u2019s heading. * * * As the amount of water necessary was Barfield\u2019s calculation based on his engineering knowledge, the Court finds that he had a corresponding duty to see that enough was in the well before the crew pulled the tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">\u201c * * * Monsanto [furnished] the working area for this crew, including the location of the eyes imbedded in the concrete floor to which the crew attached their rig. It was conceded that the rig, including the draw-works motor, would have been as operable if placed further from the well-head than it was, thereby reducing the hazard of oil splashing on or around the motor. Neither McGraw nor Barfield felt it necessary to suggest such a move, yet Barfield did insist on a cessation in the tube pulling until blow-out prevent-ers were installed and stabbing valves were present on the floor of the well. Barfield denied that he was aware of the spillage between the 35th and 36th joints or the cutting off of the motor and work stoppage, yet he was there in his car at a crucial time in the operation where he could and said he would have directed some procedure other than losing control of the well had he known it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-17\">\u201cThe Court finds that the omissions of responsibility assumed by Monsanto, in not seeing that the procedures outlined by its supervisory employees were carried out, were negligence and could have been the proximate cause of the unexpected flow of oil resulting in the flash fire and fatal injuries to Case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">.

The view taken by this court and by other courts that the Supreme Court in <em>Ryan </em>was announcing an admiralty doctrine applicable to shipowners rather than a general rule is buttressed, we think, not only by the facts in <em>Ryan, </em>by the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ryan, </em>and by decisions subsequent to <em>Ryan, </em>but also by scholarly appraisals of the <em>Ryan </em>decision. Law review writers have characterized the indemnity theory announced in <em>Ryan </em>as a concept designed to meet special admiralty law problems involving shipowners and stevedores. In the words of one commentator, <em>Ryan </em>must be viewed in the light of \u201cthe never-ending dispute between shipowners and their Contracting stevedores as to which party ultimately is to respond in damages, assuming that the longshoreman\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries against the vessel owner is a meritorious one.\u201d Bue, Admiralty Law in the Fifth Circuit \u2014 A Compendium for Practitioners: I, 4 Houston L. Rev. 347, 408 (1966). In the wake of Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (extending the shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness to longshoremen employed by an independent contracting stevedore), shipowners found themselves in \u201ca most unenviable position.\u201d Bue, <em>supra, </em>at 409. \u201c * * * They were cast in liability under the expanding theory of unseaworthiness in instances frequently involving circumstances which pointed to the conclusion that shipowner and stevedore were joint tort-feasors; yet the shipowner was denied any recourse against the stevedore because of the hallowed common-law doctrine engrafted onto the maritime law that there would be no contribution between joint tort-feasors except in both-to-blame situations in collision cases. In the case of Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling &amp; Refitting Corp. [1952, 342 U.S. 282, 76 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318] a jury had apportioned twenty-five per cent of the responsibility for the longshoreman\u2019s injuries to the shipowner and seventy-five per cent to the stevedore, but the Supreme Court denied any relief to the shipowner by enunciating the ancient no-contribution principle. The Court\u2019s position was reaffirmed shortly thereafter, insofar as maritime personal injury suits were concerned, in Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn [1953, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143], and there the matter stood until the advent of <em>Ryan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-13\">\u00abi\u00ed ^</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-14\">\u201cAs courts are occasionally wont to do, the Supreme Court saw fit to devise a way to circumvent the legal roadblock of the rule against contribution between joint tort-feasors, and <em>Ryan </em>was the case in which they did it. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-15\">\u201cViewed in the light of its prior decisions in <em>Halcyon </em>and <em>Hawn, </em>the Court\u2019s departure from tort law to embrace contractual concepts in order to permit indemnity was strongly motivated by a recognition of the highly inequitable position which shipowners occupied following <em>Sieraeki.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-16\">Bue, <em>supra, </em>at 409-10 (footnotes omitted).

Monsanto cites a number of cases in support of its contention that this type of indemnity does exist under Mississippi law. The eases cited by Monsanto fall into three categories: (1) maritime cases, i. e., <em>Ryan </em>and its progeny, (2) non-maritime cases from jurisdictions other than Mississippi, and (3) Mississippi cases. The maritime cases are not applicable for the reasons given in the text of this opinion. Moreover, the non-maritime cases from other jurisdictions clearly cannot indicate what the law is in Mississippi. Only two Mississippi cases are cited. Bowyer &amp; Johnson Construction Co. v. White, 5 Cir. 1958, 255 F.2d 482 (applying Mississippi law); Nasif v. Booth, 1954, 221 Miss. 126, 72 So.2d 440. These cases are simply in-apposite. They cannot fairly be read to support the proposition that where two tortfeasors are guilty of concurrent acts of negligence, Mississippi law requires one to indemnify the other.</p>\n<p id=\"ArUV\">It should be noted that Bowyer &amp; Johnson Construction Co. v. White, <em>supra, </em>was the only non-maritime case cited in the opinion of the district court.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b):</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. For failure of the plaintiff to j)rosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. If the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in Rule 52 (a). Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">.
