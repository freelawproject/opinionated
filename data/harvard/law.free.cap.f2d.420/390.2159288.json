(Adair\u2019s), several affiliated corporations and Adair\u2019s president and principal stockholder, Gerald P. Adair, from violating the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Act and to restrain the continued withholding of unpaid wages due twenty-seven employees of the central bakery. The singular contention in a trial to the court alleged that the Adair corporations were an enterprise within the coverage of the Act and that the employees of Adair\u2019s Catering Service, Inc., not being the proper subjects of a \u00a7 213 exemption, have been paid substandard wages according to \u00a7 206, and have not been compensated at the statutory rate for overtime hours, under \u00a7 207. The court concluded that the multi-corporation complex was fully within the coverage provisions of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but was exempted from compliance with the wage and hour provisions vis-a-vis \u00a7 213.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conclusions relate that while the multi-unit organization is an \u201centerprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d for coverage purposes, the \u201centerprise\u201d is deemed a \u201cretail establishment\u201d for purposes of exemption. This deduction was sustained by concluding that the bakery is functionally integrated with the retail cafeterias and restaurant; that the bakery employees are essentially in a local retailing capacity; that the physical disconnection of the bakery from the cafeterias is immaterial; and that if the entire cluster of corporate businesses is unitarily considered for bringing the \u201centerprise\u201d within the Act\u2019s coverage, it must likewise be considered as a unit for exemption. Upon these grounds the appellees rest their case for exemption under \u00a7\u00a7 213(a) (2) (ii), (a) (2) (iv), and (a) (20).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">The attendant facts are not disputed and appear substantially as the trial court found. Adair\u2019s is a holding company, ninety-nine per cent owned by Gerald and Ralph Adair, which manages a restaurant, six cafeterias and Adair\u2019s Catering Service, Inc. (the bakery). During the years from 1965 through January, 1967,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the total annual gross volume of sales of all the corporate defendants exceeded one million dollars exclusive of excise taxes, and they collectively purchased or received interstate goods for resale in the total annual amount of $250,000 or more. The annual volume of the bakery was consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ently less than $250,000, with a small fraction of its purchases made out-of-state. All corporate defendants are independently managed and have no connection with each other, save the element of common control and the fact that all operate in related activities for a common business purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Adair\u2019s maintains its central offices at N.E. 63rd Street, Oklahoma City. The warehouse and bakery are located in the same facility. Our attention here is focused on the twenty-seven employees engaged primarily in the preparation and delivery of pies and other pasteries from the bakery location to the eating establishments situated in and about Oklahoma City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Originally each eating establishment had its. own bakery to provide the daily pastry needs. Mainly for skilled labor shortage reasons, Adair\u2019s was motivated to centralize its baking function into one operation, physically separate from all cafeterias, and incorporate it to provide pastries to the eating outlets. Equipment was gathered from the several cafeterias and installed at the 63rd Street location and various of the cafeteria-bakery personnel were transferred to the new locale. With the installation of automated equipment, the bakery produces a superior and, perhaps, more economical pastry product. Retail sales are not made out of the bakery; the intercorporation transactions have been conducted on a retail credit system, maintained in Adair\u2019s central offices. The physical plant apparently is not the characteristic warehousing facility, but has, during the critical period, warehoused bakery supplies, pastry ingredients, meats purchased for cafeteria distribution, and cafeteria-restaurant supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The introductory inquiry in cases of Fair Labor Standards Act application is coverage. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(b) essentially requires every employer to pay each person employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, as defined in \u00a7 203(s) (1), (2) or (4), or by an establishment described in \u00a7 203(s) (3) or (5), a minimum wage as described therein. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a) (2) summarily provides that an employer shall not cause workers who are employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce, as defined in \u00a7 203(s) (1) or (4), or by an establishment described in \u00a7 203(s) (3), to weekly work beyond specified hourly m\u00e1ximums without receiving remuneration above the regular hour wage as the statute provides. That the Adair concerns are within these coverage provisions is not appealed and we henceforth presume its application. The question presented here for decision is threefold: (a) is the \u201crestaurant\u201d exception in \u00a7 213(a) (2) (ii) an enterprise exception; (b) does the Adair corporate enterprise qualify as a \u00a7 213(a) (2) retail or service establishment; and (c) is the bakery itself a retail or service establishment?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">The enactment of this federal law was an attempt by Congress to insure laboring men and women a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As remedial legislation its exceptions must be narrowly construed, \u201cgiving due regard to the plain meaning of statutory language and the intent of Congress.\u201d A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. at 493, 65 S.Ct. at 808. The statutes under which retribution is sought, are keyed to the words \u201centerprises\u201d and \u201cestablishments\u201d as explained in \u00a7 203(s). An enterprise is clearly defined in \u00a7 203(r) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>but the Act is devoid of an \u201cestablishment\u201d definition. Notwithstanding, it is implicit in the Act that Congress did not employ these words synonymously; indeed they are contradistinguished and set out disjunctively throughout the definitional and coverage sections of the statute. The legislation tacitly suggests that the corporate structure envisaged embraces an enterprise composed of individual establishments. From the differentiation between \u201cestablishment\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d in \u00a7 213(a) (2) it is clear that Congress meant to use the terms in a precise way in that section as well as in the definition and coverage sections. We are aware of no cases and find no reason within the Act to justify a contrary application in \u00a7 213 than that appearing in \u00a7\u00a7 203, 206 and 207. By its very terms \u00a7 213(a) (2) applies on an \u201cestablishment\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The lower court refused to test the Adair enterprise, for exemption, on an individual establishment basis. Instead, all businesses, including the bakery, were viewed together as being proprie-tarily united and functionally integrated, and physical separation was considered immaterial. This proposition runs directly contrary to the letter and spirit of the Fair Labor Standards Act and does not comport with the cases interpreting that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Early in the life of this Act the same argument was posed before the Supreme Court and rejected as being obviously without merit. A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095, 157 A.L.R. 876 (1945) stands squarely for the lesson that an integrated enterprise function, performed in a physically distinct location, requires an independent determination of that establishment\u2019s exemption status. The Court therein defined \u201cestablishment\u201d as a distinct physical place of business. The key to the case was the physical distinction of the retail stores from the wholesale functions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The holding of this case teaches that merely because a warehouse is within a dominantly retail enterprise, that fact alone will not conclusively require exemption of the storage place as being part of a larger, exempt chain of retail establishments. Restated, one establishment may not borrow the identity of an exempt establishment simply because of their corporate relationship. The fact that the warehouse in Phillips served stores out-of-state while Adair\u2019s operates strictly intrastate does not demand a different l\u2019esult here. \u201cWhile the Supreme Court mentioned * * * [it] that fact clearly did not form a basis for the * * * decision.\u201d Mitchell v. Sunshine Department Stores, Inc., 292 F.2d 645, 647 (5th Cir. 1961). Mitchell v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 352 U.S. 1027, 77 S.Ct. 593, 1 L.Ed.2d 589 (1957) added lustre to Phillips by flatly rejecting a ease which held it \u201cpossible for one business located in several buildings, neither contiguous nor widely scattered, to be one establishment * * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The physical identity concept of Phillips has been persistently adhered to <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we see no reason to distinguish this case from that generally accepted rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">The exemption in \u00a7 213(a) (2) has a limited reach, touching only those retail or service establishments as are comparable to the local corner grocery store, local drug store or local department store which sells directly to the ultimate consumer. Prosperous retail businesses eventually lose their identity as establishments exempt from the Act. It may occur through an increased volume of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>terstate sales or, as here, by physically serving a non-exempt establishment. A company operating numerous food stores cannot include as a part of its retail business its candy kitchens. Fred Wolferman, Inc. v. Gustafson, 169 F.2d 759 (8th Cir. 1948). The operator of sandwich counters cannot include as retail its commissary where sandwiches are prepared. Armstrong Co. v. Walling, 161 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1947). Similarly, a restaurant-cafeteria chain may not include its bakery as part of its retail establishments. Appellee cites two cases as supportive of the concept that retail outlets and their warehouses are single establishments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both cases are factually distinguishable and in that light are not inconsistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Alternative grounds for dismissal in the trial court were \u00a7 213(a) (2) (iv) and (a) (20). As a predicate to implementing either, Adair must show the bakery to be a retail or service establishment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which is defined as \u201can establishment 75 per centum of whose annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or both) is not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or service in the particular industry.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a) (2). The bakery is an establishment but acts in neither a service nor retail capacity. Likewise it is not strictly a wholesale operation. However, categorically speaking, the bakery is more analogous to a wholesale than a retail establishment and thereby precludes exemption under either \u00a7 213(a) (2) (iv) or (a) (20).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As was stated in Roland Electric Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 675, 66 S.Ct. 413, 90 L.Ed. 383 (1946), \u201cretail\u201d means to sell commodities in small quantities directly to ultimate consumers to meet personal rather than commercial and industrial needs, and it is correspondingly accurate to restrict the word \u201cservices\u201d to ultimate users of them for personal rather than commercial purposes. The only business of this bakery was providing pastries to Adair eating establishments. The public was not invited nor allowed to purchase from the bakery. The bakery did not possess sufficient indicia to characterize it as a retail or service establishment under the exemption sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">. Act of June 25, 1938, e. 676, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, <em>et seq. </em>All references hereinafter made are to the Act as amended in 1961, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\">. It is somewhat difficult to determine the precise grounds upon which the exemption was granted, since the court refers to \u00a7 213(a) (2) but then, as if to cite that subsection, quotes directly from \u00a7 213(a) (20). Although it is not plain from the record, we surmise another basis for decision to be \u00a7 213(a) (2) (iv). In an attempt to fully consider each ground for appeal, we will consider each alternatively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b456-16\">. The record alludes to violations occurring subsequent to the effective date of the 1966 amendments but the briefs are barren of reference to any post-February 1, 1967, violations and the trial court\u2019s conclusions specifically refer to the Act prior to the 1966 amendments\u2019 effective date. It should also be noted that prior to trial, plaintiff dropped its request for an injunction for future violations since defendant was then in substantial compliance with the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. By pretrial stipulation it was conceded that all corporate defendants are exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213 (a) (2) (ii), except Adair\u2019s Catering Service. Inc., its parent corporation Adair's Cafeterias. Inc., and the latter's president and principal stockholder, Gerald Adair, and that Ralph Adair possessed no legal responsibility therein. Adair's also concedes that if the Act applies and if no exception is available, the 27 bakery employees were underpaid under \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 and are due approximately $9730.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b457-15\">.
