How may the taxpayer attack the summons? Is a judgment of contempt for failure to obey the summons a final order? We hold that the Commissioner need make no particularized showing in order to summon a taxpayer and his records, but that if the purpose of the summons is to harass the taxpayer or solely to build a criminal prosecution, the courts will not enforce the summons. Moreover, a taxpayer is entitled to appropriate discovery procedures under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to prove this purpose. He must raise defenses of self-incrimination with regard to individual questions or specific records. Finally, when compliance with a district court\u2019s order that is later vacated would require surrender of the individual\u2019s defenses, and when the individual has effectively appealed that order before failing to comply, his failure to secure a stay will not, in the absence of willfulness, justify a contempt conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In September of 1966, an IRS agent served a summons upon the taxpayer, William H. Roundtree. The Summons directed him to appear at the Eau Gal-lie, Florida, office of the IRS, there to produce books and records bearing on his and his wife\u2019s income tax liability for the years 1963, 1964, and 1965, and to testify in that regard. Roundtree appeared, but refused either to produce his records or to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">In December 1966 the Government petitioned under sections 7402(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 7604 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for a court order to enforce the summons. Roundtree filed an answer and counterclaimed for injunctive relief against further IRS proceedings. When the Government failed to answer this counterclaim within sixty days, the Clerk of the district court entered a default against the Government. But after a previously scheduled hearing held in September 1967, the district court set aside the default and granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim. The court also denied Round-tree\u2019s request for a jury trial, his motion for a writ of prohibition against the Tax Court in a deficiency proceeding relating to the year 1963,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>requests for admissions and interrogatories he had propounded to the IRS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court, however, granted the motion of Mrs. Roundtree to intervene, and allowed both taxpayers to file amended answers and counterclaims. The court subsequently quashed the Roundtrees\u2019 Notice of Taking Deposition of the IRS agent in charge of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In October 1967 the Roundtrees filed an amended answer and counterclaim alleging that IRS agents had systematically harassed them; that enforcement of the summons would violate the fourth amendment and would be \u201cin violation of the due process of law because of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution\u201d; that the material sought was \u201cfor the improper purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a criminal prosecution against the Respondents\u201d \u2014 indeed, that this was its \u201csole objective\u201d; that enforcement would violate the attorney-client privilege existing between Roundtree as attorney and his wife as client; and that the IRS was \u201cabusing legal process unconstitutionally by filing the petition in this cause in this court\u201d. They demanded that the IRS be enjoined from any further proceedings until it could show \u201cgood cause for lawful and reasonable administrative procedure and/or legal action\u201d. The Government answered and moved to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">At a hearing on October 10, 1968, Roundtree stated that the \u201cgist\u201d of his defense was that the Government must show probable cause before the district court could enforce its summons. The district court dismissed the amended counterclaim, granted the Government\u2019s objections to further interrogatories, and ordered enforcement of the summons against Roundtree as to the years 1964 and 1965.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Roundtree and his wife appealed this order, but failed to seek a stay of its enforcement from the district court. Instead, Roundtree appeared at IRS offices on the appointed dates and refused to testify or produce his records, asserting that he was exercising his fourth and fifth amendment rights. At the hearing of an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court, Roundtree again asserted his fifth amendment rights. The Government maintained that he had never before raised the privilege against self-incrimination. The district court adjudged Roundtree in contempt on November 8, and fined him $500, but did not enter a written order. Roundtree appealed. The district court entered a written order of contempt on November 19, and once more ordered Roundtree to produce his books and records. He again appealed and this time moved for a stay of execution of the order and any further proceedings. The district court denied Roundtree\u2019s motion for a stay; this Court granted it pending his appeal. The taxpayer appeals from the three district court orders of October 10 (judgment enforcing the summons), November 8 (oral judgment of contempt), and November 19, 1968 (written judgment of contempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">United States v. Powell, 1964, 379 U. S. 48, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112, dealt explicitly with the statutorily imposed standards that the Commissioner must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>meet in order to enforce his summons. Section 7605(b) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Code prohibits \u201cunnecessary examination or investigations\u201d. In <em>Powell, </em>the running of the statute of limitations precluded any <em>civil </em>liability. Yet, the Supreme Court held that the Commissioner could secure judicial enforcement of his summons consistently with \u00a7 7605(b) even though he had no probable cause to suspect fraud. The opinion states that \u201cthe Commissioner need not meet any standard of probable cause to obtain enforcement of his summons, either before or after the three-year statute of limitations on ordinary tax liabilities has expired\u201d. The statutory scheme requires only that he show that \u201cthe investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose\u201d, that he did not already have the information he sought, and that he had followed the Code\u2019s administrative steps. 379 U.S. at 57-58, 85 S.Ct. at 255. The Court, importantly, went on to admonish that</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">[i]t is the court\u2019s process which is invoked to enforce the administrative summons and a court may not permit its process to be abused. Such an abuse would take place if the summons had been issued for an improper purpose, such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute, or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation. 379 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\"><em>Powell </em>did not explicitly consider constitutional limitations on the Commissioner\u2019s power. But in our view, Ca-mara v. Municipal Court, 1967, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930, and See v. City of Seattle, 1967, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943, two recent fourth amendment decisions, compel no different result. In those two cases the Court set out to \u201creexamine whether administrative inspection programs, as presently authorized and conducted, violate Fourth Amendment rights\u201d. 387 U.S. at 525, 87 S.Ct. at 1729.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Camara </em>found that the fourth amendment\u2019s basic purpose is \u201cto safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials\u201d. 387 U.S. at 528, 87 S.Ct. at 1730. The use of a search warrant is necessary, the Court ruled, even in a case where the state court had found that the search was \u201c \u2018part of a regulatory scheme which is essentially civil rather than criminal in nature, * * * [and the] right of inspection * * * is limited in scope and may not be exercised under unreasonable conditions\u2019 \u201d. 387 U.S. at 528, 87 S.Ct. at 1730.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">In terms of protection to the individual, a summons submitted to a court for enforcement is at least equivalent to a search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our task is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>to apply to the process the analysis of interests that <em>Camara </em>considered requisite to the issuance of a search warrant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The <em>Camara </em>Court spoke in terms of \u201cbalancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails\u201d. 387 U.S. at 537, 87 S.Ct. at 1735. It weighed the history of judicial and public acceptance of a search, the significance of the public interest demanding satisfaction and the probable unavailability of alternative means to satisfy it, and the extent of the invasion of privacy. In tax investigations, courts have certainly long been enforcing the Commissioner\u2019s summons, and have considered it an acceptable way of ensuring compliance with the revenue laws. <em>See </em>Sale v. United States, 8 Cir.1956, 228 F. 2d 682, 684, cert. denied, 1956, 350 U.S. 1006, 76 S.Ct. 650, 100 L.Ed. 868. <em>See generally Powell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The individual taxpayer on whom an audit has focussed is no doubt reluctant to see his records disclosed to the taxing authorities, but we are unable to say that the public has exhibited a strong animosity toward this method of securing proper compliance with the revenue laws. The significance of the public interest, governmental revenue, is beyond dispute. The fact is that Congress built the tax code upon the principle of self-assessment and voluntary compliance with the Code\u2019s rules and regulations. To determine deviations from its rules, the IRS must place unusual reliance upon the taxpayer\u2019s own records and statements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The final factor, the invasion of privacy, is difficult to evaluate. In <em>Ca-mara </em>the Court noted that the search there was neither criminally oriented nor personal in nature. . Although the IRS summons does not involve a search of the person of the taxpayer but an examination of his papers and his testimony,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> typically it is unclear whether a given tax investigation will lead to criminal proceedings. The IRS often must see the taxpayer\u2019s records before it can make that determination. <em>Powell, </em>379 U.S. at 53-54, 85 S.Ct. 248. But in balancing the need to investigate against the invasion, we conclude that the resolution reached in <em>Powell </em>is still correct. Like the <em>Camara </em>housing inspections, the effective operation of the revenue system requires that the Commissioner be free to inspect taxpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ers\u2019 records in order to ensure compliance with the revenue laws. Furthermore, courts may limit the invasion of privacy through the judicial scrutiny to which a summons is subject for its enforcement and through the standards enumerated in <em>Powell </em>of legitimate purpose, proper procedure, relevance, and refusal to allow abuse of the courts\u2019 process. Thus, although our reiteration in Venn v. United States, 5 Cir.1968, 400 F.2d 207, 210, of <em>Powell\u2019s </em>language that probable cause is unnecessary may be misleading in light of <em>Camara </em>and <em>See, </em>we are satisfied that the Commissioner meets the standard of probable cause when he meets the requirements of <em>Powell </em>and <em>Venn.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Roundtree, however, contends that the summons issued against him did not meet the <em>Powell </em>and <em>Venn </em>requirements. He makes two significant <em>arguments: </em>(1) that the sole purpose of the summons is the establishment of a criminal case against him, and (2) that the IRS and its agents are bent upon a considered course of personal harassment toward him. We declared in <em>Venn </em>that it \u201cwould be a misuse of the tax summons for the IRS to endeavor to use it to obtain evidence for use in an <em>existing </em>criminal prosecution\u201d, but that \u201cthe mere fact that the evidence obtained through the summons may be later used against the taxpayer in a criminal prosecution is no barrier to enforcement\u201d. 400 F.2d at 210. This rule is consistent with \u00a7 7602, authorizing a summons \u201c[f]or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax -x- * As the Ninth Circuit has pointed out, the statute \u201cdoes not limit the examination it authorizes <em>solely </em>to the issue of correctness\u201d. Boren v. Tucker, 9 Cir.1956, 239 F.2d 767, 772. So long as the IRS does have this purpose, other purposes need not vitiate its authority. Lash v. Nighosian, 1 Cir. 1959, 273 F.2d 185, 188, cert. denied, 1960, 362 U.S. 904, 80 S.Ct. 610, 4 L. Ed.2d 554; <em>see </em>United States v. Mercurio, 5 Cir. Oct. 30, 1969, 418 F.2d 1213. In light of the fact that the IRS has filed deficiency notices for all of the years in question,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the taxpayer faces a difficult task in proving that the sole purpose of the summons was criminal prosecution. Of course, if he proves harassment, we will not allow the judicial process to be abused by assisting in that harassment. <em>Powell, </em>379 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. 248. The Supreme Court has said and we have repeated that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer. 379 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. 248; <em>Venn, </em>400 F.2d at 210. The IRS has denied both allegations and submitted affidavits to buttress its position. But Roundtree argues that the district court prevented his meeting the burden of proof by \u201cden[ying] every effort of the taxpayers to use pre-hearing discovery\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">A proceeding to enforce a summons is an adversary proceeding. Reisman v. Caplin, 1964, 375 U.S. 440, 446, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459; Dunn v. Ross, 5 Cir.1966, 356 F.2d 664, 667. In the absence of other statutory directions, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply. Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a) (3); <em>Powell, </em>379 U.S. at 58 n. 18, 85 S.Ct. 248; United States v. McKay, 5 Cir. 1967, 372 F.2d 174. We have construed the thrust of this determination to be that \u201cthe parties must be given a full opportunity in an adversary hearing to present their case\u201d. <em>Venn, </em>400 F.2d 212 n. 12. We do not disturb the district court\u2019s dismissal of the interrogatories, requests for admissions, and motion to produce propounded by the taxpayer, for they were clearly irrelevant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>overbroad.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But we cannot agree with the court\u2019s granting of the Government\u2019s motion to quash the taxpayer\u2019s attempted deposition of the agent in charge of this case. The Government argued that because it had instituted \u201ca summary proceeding in aid of an administrative investigation rather than a plenary action\u201d, the district court should exercise its discretion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a) (3) to deny all discovery, and now seeks to justify that denial on appeal. We have been careful to avoid ruling \u201cthat discovery would always be improper in cases of this nature\u201d, 400 F.2d at 212 n. 12. We conclude that the taxpayer is entitled to investigate the IRS\u2019s purpose where such purpose has been put in issue and may affect the legality of the summons.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rule 26(b) instructs us that a party is entitled to examine a deponent on \u201cany matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action\u201d. The district court has authority to curtail the deposition if it is conducted unreasonably. Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(d); United States v. Howard, 3 Cir.1966, 360 F.2d 373, 381. But if the taxpayer succeeds in producing evidence that would repel a motion for summary judgment under Rule 54, the district court should allow him to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We may quickly dispose of Roundtree\u2019s contentions as to self-incrimination and the objections of the IRS. The fact situation could assume one of several postures on remand. We have already pointed out that if Round-tree is able to prove that the sole purpose of the summons is to build a criminal prosecution, the summons must fail. Roundtree\u2019s pleadings adequately preserved this defense. If the IRS sustains its contention that this is a civil investigation, the mere fact that evidence <em>might </em>be used against Roundtree in a later prosecution will not support a claim of self-incrimination. 400 F.2d at 210-212.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If, however, Roundtree can show that the investigation has become \u201can inquiry with dominant crimin\u00e1l overtones\u201d, he is entitled to raise his fifth amendment objections. Stuart v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 459. But even if the danger of self-incrimination is great, Roundtree\u2019s remedy is not to voice a blanket refusal to produce his records or to testify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, he must present himself with his records for questioning, and as to each question and each record elect to raise or not to raise the defense. The district court may then determine by reviewing Round-tree\u2019s records and by considering each question whether, in each instance, the claim of self-incrimination is well-founded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since a blanket refusal is unacceptable, we are unwilling to say that Roundtree waived this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">There remains the question whether despite our remand, Roundtree\u2019s conviction for contempt should nevertheless stand. The Government points to Roundtree\u2019s failure to request a stay of the district court\u2019s order before violating it, and refers us to cases such as Walker v. City of Birmingham, 1967, 388 U.S. 307, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210, and United States v. United Mine Workers, 1947, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884, in support of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The Government admits that Round-tree did properly file his appeal from the district court\u2019s order enforcing the summons. Roundtree accomplished this before the dates on which the order directed him to produce his records. Clearly he had the right to such an appeal. Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. at 449, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459. Had he testified or produced his records on the appointed dates, he would of course have mooted the appeal. Baldridge v. United States, 5 Cir.1969, 406 F.2d 526. Nor is Roundtree attempting collaterally to attack by disobedience an order which he had not appealed. The order is properly before us on direct appeal. Consequently, the only question is whether Roundtree\u2019s neglect to secure a stay of the order which we are now reversing amounted to contempt. Since there is no contention that the failure was wilful, we conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We do not find <em>United Mine Workers </em>or <em>Walker </em>persuasive authority to the contrary. <em>Walker </em>involved relationships between two branches of the federal system. The Supreme Court determined not to interfere with the state judiciary\u2019s method of ensuring respect for its mandate. That factor of comity is not present in our review of a federal district court. Furthermore, despite the arguments that might have been raised to limit the authority of an ex parte order, the Supreme Court used that consideration against the contemnors. It reasoned that one who had not yet argued his position before the state court ought not to violate its mandate without giving it the benefit of his argument. Again, Roundtree had fully presented his position to the district court. In addition, the contemnors in <em>Walker </em>arguably would not have entirely forfeited their first amendment rights by delaying their civil rights march, although admittedly its impact would have diminished with the passing of Easter. Here, Roundtree stood to forfeit his defenses entirely. In <em>United Mine Workers, </em>the district court\u2019s order was eventually upheld on appeal, and again the contemnors arguably would not have forfeited their right to strike by delaying it. Most importantly, however, the decree in this case was not of the significance of the decrees in <em>United Mine Workers </em>and <em>Walker. </em>Those cases sought respectively to halt a nationwide coal strike, and to implement the \u201clegitimate state concern\u201d of the \u201cprevention of public disorder and violence\u201d. <em>Walker, </em>388 U.S. at 316, 87 S.Ct. at 1829. The challenge to the district court\u2019s authority here is much less significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">We emphasize that we do not approve Roundtree's failure to seek a stay of the district court\u2019s order. But in the absence of evidence of wilfulness, we reverse the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">We deal summarily with taxpayer Roundtree\u2019s remaining contentions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(e) prohibits entry of default judgment against the United States, its officers or agencies, \u201cunless the claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court\u201d. Thus, the district court correctly set aside the Government\u2019s default in answering Round-tree\u2019s counterclaim, and treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>claim on the merits. Furthermore, Roundtree has an adequate remedy in the defenses he can raise to enforcement of the summons. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that he is not entitled to injunctive relief. <em>See </em>Reisman v. Cap-lin. We note the rest of Roundtree\u2019s contentions, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We reverse and remand for further disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-9\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402(b) (1964) :</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to produce books, papers, or other data, the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or may be found shall have jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, or other data.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604 (1964) :</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">(a) [Substantially similar to \u00a7 7402 (b), note 1 <em>supra]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">(b) Whenever any person summoned under section 6420(e) (2), 6421(f) (2), 6424(d) (2), or 7602 neglects or refuses to obey such summons, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, or to give testimony, as required, the Secretary or his delegate may apply to the judge of the district court or to a United States commissioner for the district within which the person so summoned resides or is found for an attachment against him as for a contempt.

Among other things, Roundtree sought to elicit detailed information concerning publicly reported oases of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping by the IRS; to inspect all the IRS\u2019s records and files relating to himself and his wife; and to ascertain the basis for the IRS claim of deficiency against him and his wife for 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b912-12\">. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b913-5\">. U.S.C. \u00a7 7605(b) (1964) :</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations, and only one inspection of a taxpayer\u2019s books of account shall be made for each taxable year unless the tax-X&gt;ayer requests otherwise or unless the Secretary or his delegate, after investigation, notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">. <em>Camara </em>and <em>See </em>considered fourth amendment rights as they are enforced against the states under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">. The requirement of judicial enforcement marks the important distinction of this ease from Mancusi v. DeForte, 1968, 392 U.S. 364, 371, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L. Ed.2d 1154, where the Supreme Court found. insufficient under fourth amendment standards an administrative search warrant not subjected to the review of a \u201cneutral and detached magistrate\u201d. Some commentators have argued that service of <em>a </em>summons upon a taxpayer is itself so coercive that a taxpayer, unaware of his right to compel the IRS to go to the district court for enforcement, may be persuaded to prejudice his fourth and fifth amendment rights by automatically surrendering his books and giving testimony. <em>See, e. g., </em>Lipton, Constitutional Rights in Criminal Tax Investigations, 45 F.R.D. 323, 328 n. 24 (1968). If that is so, a colorable argument can be made that certain warnings, analogous to those re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>quired by Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, are necessary in order to ensure that the waiver of constitutional rights is voluntary and intelligent. <em>See </em>Lipton at 333-340. <em>But cf. </em>United States v. Jernigan, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 471, 472. But that set of circumstances is not properly before us here. Taxpayer Roundtree was well aware of his rights, compelled the IRS to petition the district court for enforcement, and preserved his constitutional objections. So long as the summons is subjected to court review, it certainly meets the requirements of a search warrant regardless of whether it is criminally oriented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. We note in passing that the Supreme Court\u2019s use of probable cause as \u201cthe standard by which a particular decision to search is tested against the constitutional mandate of reasonableness\u201d, 387 U.S. at 534, 87 S.Ct. at 1734, implicitly rejects the terminology of <em>Powell </em>and our adoption of that language in Venn v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 207, 210 that the courts should not \u201chold the IRS to a showing of the nature of probable cause\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\">. <em>See </em>Bolich v.
