He failed to report as ordered and did not submit to induction. At his trial for violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462 (Supp. IV, 1965-68) his sole defense was that he should have been classified as a conscientious objector. He based his attack on the validity of his I-A classification not on any procedural irregularity but on a contention that the provision of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 which allows exemption for conscientious objectors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutional as applied to him. At a pre-trial hearing, Judge Wyatt ruled that evidence as to Gillette\u2019s belief that American intervention in Vietnam was unconstitutional, illegal or immoral would be inadmissible. Finding the induction order to be valid, Judge Wyatt limited the jury trial to the issue of whether Gillette\u2019s failure to report was knowing and willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Evidence derived from Gillette\u2019s selective service file and from his testimony before Judge Wyatt reveals' that Gillette\u2019s beliefs were based on humanism and were specifically directed against the war in Vietnam. His position seems to include a willingness to defend his homeland if it were attacked and to fight to enforce a United Nations decision against a country accused of breaking the peace. Judge Wyatt found that Gillette\u2019s views were based \u201con an opinion, a feeling, a belief that the Vietnam war is immoral and unjust\u201d and that the draft board could properly conclude that \u201cthose views did not meet the standards laid down by Congress for determining a conscientious objector.\u201d He expressly refused to rule that the board had denied the request for exemption because Gillette\u2019s views were non-religious.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cThe constitutional power of Congress to raise and support armies and to make all laws necessary and proper to that end is broad and sweeping.\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 755-758, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L. Ed. 1694 (1948); Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L. Ed. 349 (1918). The exercise of this power to conscript and train men does not depend on the contemporaneous existence of a war. It may be exercised in time of peace. United States v. Henderson, 180 F.2d 711, 713 (7th Cir. 1950). We reaffirm our holdings in United States v. Mitchell, 369 F.2d 323 (2d Cir. 1966) and United States v. Bolton, 192 F.2d 805 (2d Cir. 1951) that allegations that a particular employment of the armed services is in violation of the Constitution, international treaties or a moral code do not raise a defense to a prosecution for failure to report for induction into the armed forces. For these reasons Gillette cannot successfully challenge the legality of the war in Vietnam in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> The contention that the conscientious objector provision of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j), is unconstitutional as applied in this case is based on the recent decision of Judge Wyzanski in United States v. Sisson, 297 F.Supp. 902 (D.Mass.1969), <em>prob. juris, noted, </em>396 U.S. 812, 90 S.Ct. 92, 24 L.Ed.2d 65 (U.S. Oct. 14, 1969) (No. 305). The future effect of that decision upon the application of the Act to so-called \u201cselective\u201d conscientious objectors and \u201cnonreligious\u201d conscientious objectors must await a determination by the Supreme Court. In this connection we note that there was no finding below as to whether Gillette\u2019s views were \u201cby reason of religious training and belief\u201d or were \u201cessentially political, sociological, or philosophical.\u201d Even assuming that his views were \u201creligious\u201d as that word is construed to insure the constitutionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the Act, the Act requires opposition \u201cto participation in war in any form.\u201d To exact such a prerequisite for exemption from induction into the armed forces is not to overstep the powers granted to Congress to raise and support armies. The mere potentiality, arising upon his induction, that Gillette would have to violate his conscientious objection to service in Vietnam is not sufficient to outweigh the application of this exercise of Congressional power to him. See United States v. Henderson, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Bolton, <em>supra. Contra, </em>United States v. Sisson, <em>supra, </em>297 F. Supp. at 906-911.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Gillette also asserts that there was error below in the refusal to allow him to explain his reasons for not appearing for induction to the jury and in the denial of his motion to dismiss for failure to prove a prima facie case. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(j) (Supp. IV, 1965-68) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u201cNothing contained in this title shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. As used in this subsection, the term \u2018religious training and belief\u2019 does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
