The Board found the letter an unfair labor practice, making it appropriate for the regional director to have set aside the subsequent election which the union lost. It now seeks the customary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-24\">We read the opinion in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 1969, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547, as indicating two ways in which an employer\u2019s predictions as to possible unhappy consequences of unionization might transgress. The prediction might indicate that unnecessary consequences would be deliberately inflicted by the employer, in other words, a threat of retaliation. Alternatively, consequences not within the control of the employer might be described as probable or likely, when in fact there was no objective evidence of any such likelihood. This would not be a retaliatory threat, but it would be an improper threat nonetheless. <em>See </em>395 U.S. 575 at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The instant letter was phrased in the form of questions. It is true that a question may not be as strong as a positive statement. Nevertheless, the posing of a question indicates that there is some reason for asking it. The Board was warranted in finding that respondent\u2019s questions, as put, suggested unpleasant answers. Many were fair. However, we cannot say that the Board was unwarranted in finding that the suggested answers to three of these questions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fell within one or the other of the Court\u2019s interdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-12\">. \u201cWill you still be able to get advances on your pay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">\u201cWill you be able to take off for three months in the Summer and go to Portugal as many people have done in the past?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-27\">\u201cWill the company be able to sign papers for your friends and relatives to come over from Portugal?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
