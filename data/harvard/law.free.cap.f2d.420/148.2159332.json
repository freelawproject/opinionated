The Trial Examiner found from conflicting testimony that the increase was consented to by a union official having apparent authority to do so; and the Board adopted this finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The Board also ruled that a claim of an 8(a) (3) violation growing out of the same wage increase was unfounded because the employer had been motivated only by a need to combat the high turnover in personnel it was experiencing because of higher rates being paid by competitors in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">On the evidence making up the record before the Board, we see no occasion to disturb the Board\u2019s resolution of these issues and its dismissal of the complaint. It is urged upon us, however, that the union was improperly restricted in its presentation of evidence. This controversy in large part swirls about a dispute as to the precise scope of the complaint. The union insists that, in addition to a charge that the June 6 base rate increase constituted bargaining in bad faith, Paragraph 15 of the complaint, set out in the margin, alleged general bad faith bargaining on or about June 6 or thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The General Counsel denied at the hearing that this was true, but he did not accept the seemingly sensible suggestion of the Trial Examiner that he amend his complaint by striking out Paragraph 15; and his failure to do so has generated unnecessary confusion and controversy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We think the evidence issue justifies remand of this case to the Board, and upon that remand appropriate action may be taken to clarify the status of Paragraph 15. Over and above the question of the admissibility of evidence assertedly relevant to Paragraph 15, however, we think that at least some of the evidence offered by the union was relevant to the good faith of the employer\u2019s June 6 increase. Central to our concern in this regard is the evidence offered by the union of the course of the negotiations from the time the decertification movement was initiated in May of 1966 to the giving of further wage increases in September of that year. We think that the proof offered by the union in this regard should have been admitted as relevant to the employer\u2019s purposes in respect of the June 6 increase,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> wholly apart from whether a general bad faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>issue was regarded as in the case. We remand to the Board for further consideration in the light of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-16\">. A differentiation made by the Trial Examiner between base and premium rates, and a consequent determination by him that there had been a unilateral increase in premium pay violative of Section 8(a) (5), was not adopted by the Board. We find no reason to disagree with the Board\u2019s conclusion on this point that the employer\u2019s increase in premium rates was merely the usual adjustment of premium rates to the base rate, and was understood as comprehended within the base pay increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. Commencing on or about June 6, 1966, and at all times thereafter, Respondents negotiated with the Union in bad faith and with no intention of entering into any final or binding collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. The Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations provide as follows (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.17) :</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Any such complaint may be amended upon such terms as may be deemed just, prior to the hearing, bv the regional director issuing the complaint; at the hearing and until the case has been transferred to the Board pursuant to \u00a7 102.45, upon motion, by the trial examiner designated to conduct the hearing; and after the case has been transferred to the Board pursuant to \u00a7 102.45, at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon, upon motion, by the Board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">. Paragraph 13 of the complaint charged that \u201con or about June 6, 1966, Respondents granted the wage increase described above in paragraph 12, to their employees at their Springdale, Arkansas, plants.\u201d Paragraph 14 charged that \u201con or about June 6, 1966, Respondents granted the wage increases described above in paragraphs 12 and 13, to their employees at their Springdale, Arkansas, plants, without notification to, or bargaining with the Union, and also in order to undermine the Union and to encourage their employees to decertify the Union as their collective bargaining representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that the granting of the wage increase was not, in and of itself, a violation of Section 8(a) (5) of the Act as a unilateral change pending bargaining was supported, as we have noted, by the finding that the wage increase was accepted by a union agent with apparent authority to do so. These conclusions do not, in our view, foreclose a finding in this case that the raise was nonetheless part of an illegal plan to undermine the union in violation of Section 8(a) (3) of the Act. Of course, the agreement and the circumstances surrounding it are facts which the Board must consider in assessing the charge against the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
