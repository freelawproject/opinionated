They are before us on appellants\u2019 motions for summary reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-30\">Notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, the District Court approved freedom of choice plans. We reversed in Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 801, and ordered the District Court to adopt plans for the complete elimination of the dual systems. Plans to do so were submitted by HEW on July 5, 1969. The District Court, however, approved plans proposed by the school boards which do not establish ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>cially unitary school systems. Appellants seek summary reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19; United States v.

Holmes County, and the terms, provisions and conditions (including the times specified) in <em>Singleton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The mandate in this ease shall issue forthwith.
