Appellants petitioned for removal to the federal district court in Massachusetts, but that court granted appellees\u2019 motion to remand to the state court. Appellants bring this appeal to contest that order of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-20\">We are satisfied that appellants\u2019 initial and amended petitions for removal can be treated as being founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. We do not believe that the district court\u2019s order of remand divested appellants of their right to appeal, since appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), as amended, can only be taken after such order, and we have already rejected \u2014 by order of December 16, 1969 \u2014appellees\u2019 contention that appellants waived their right to appeal by proceeding in state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We move to the merits of appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>Appellants properly concede that their petition for removal cannot succeed under subsection (1) of section 1443, which requires a person to demonstrate that he is \u201cdenied or cannot enforce in the courts\u201d of any state \u201ca right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States * We conclude that appellants have failed to bring themselves within subsection (2) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court held in City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 824, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 1816, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966), after considerable discussion of the \u201ccolor of authority\u201d provision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-5\">\u201c * * * the second subsection of \u00a7 1443 confers a privilege of removal only upon federal officers or agents and those authorized to act with or for them in affirmatively executing duties under any federal law providing for equal civil rights.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">It is patently clear that appellants are not \u201cfederal officers or agents\u201d in any meaningful sense of those words. Thus, the dispositive question in this case is whether appellants were \u201cauthorized to act with or for\u201d any federal officers or agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">Appellants\u2019 claim is that they \u2014a group of tenants \u2014 were sued by their landlord for reporting alleged housing code violations to local and state housing authorities. They have never alleged that any federal officers or agents or any federal law \u201cauthorized\u201d them to act as they did, or that they assisted any federal officers in the performance of their official duties. The allegation that they were asserting some federal right cannot satisfy section 1443 (2), for if the mere assertion of a federal right places one \u201cunder color of authority\u201d for purposes of subsection (2), subsection (1) becomes wholly superfluous. As the Second Circuit stated in People of State of New York v. Galamison, 342 F.2d 255, 264, 8 A.L.R.3d 263 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 977, 85 S. Ct. 1342, 14 L.Ed.2d 272 (1965),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-13\">\u201cIt necessarily follows that \u2018under col- or of authority derived from\u2019 in \u00a7 1443(2) has <em>a narrower meaning </em>than \u2018a right under\u2019 in \u00a7 1443(1), since otherwise * * * the requirement of showing denial or inability to enforce would be avoided by resort to the second.\u201d [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-14\">We read the <em>Peacock </em>decision to suggest a substantive difference between a federal right and federal authorization when the Court limits section 1443(2) to those acting under some federal authorization. Thus, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 does not help appellants in this case, for even assuming that it confers a federal right on appellants to \u201cgive evidence\u201d of housing code violations to the proper authorities, that section in no way purports to confer \u201cauthority\u201d to act on anyone. Moreover, the fact that there may be federal laws and federal officials whose purpose is the same as appellants\u2019 purpose here does not place their acts \u201cunder color of authority\u201d any more than a similar situation in <em>Peacock </em>helped appellants there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-15\">Appellants not having acted \u201cunder color of authority\u201d within the meaning of section 1443(2), we have no occasion to consider the other prerequisites of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-16\">The District Court\u2019s order of remand is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1205-21\">. In the ordinary remand situation an order of remand is not appealable. Indeed, even tlie district court may not reconsider its order once the remand has been perfected. In re La Providencia Development Corp., 406 F.2d 251 (1st Cir. 1969). However, since an appeal does lie in section 1443 cases, and since, absent a supersedeas, an appeal does not vacate orders of the district court, further state proceedings are not avoidable and par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>ticipating therein cannot constitute an involuntary waiver of appeal. Non constat there may be an intentional waiver of appeal, but this we did not find.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 1443.
