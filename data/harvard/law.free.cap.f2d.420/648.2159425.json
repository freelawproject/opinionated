BROWN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-20\">The Secretary of Labor brought these actions under one of the modern shields of women\u2019s rights <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206(d) (1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was commissioned the champion of the female worker by the Act, which was enacted as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and seeks to' recover for the female employees of these two banks <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the difference between what they were paid and what male employees, allegedly doing equal work, received. And, in addition, he seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>enjoin the banks from future discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">It is the Secretary\u2019s contention that these relatively small banks paid women bookkeepers and tellers substantially less than was paid to male employees performing the same work. He relies heavily on the actual pay differentials at both the First Victoria National Bank <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the American Bank of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Commerce of Victoria<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to demonstrate this. The banks, however, argued that there has been no violation of the Equal Pay Act. First, they contended the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>equality in pay was due to differences in the work performed. Second, they claimed that the differential was, to quote the statute, based on a \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d. (See note 2, <em>swpm.) </em>This factor was \u201ca bona fide training program\u201d \u2014 a \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d approved by the Secretary\u2019s Interpretative Bulletin. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.148.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Secretary makes a triple response by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>attempting to show that (1) the jobs performed by the employees were the same, (2) the alleged training program was not a \u201cbona fide training program\u201d within the meaning of the Department\u2019s Interpretative Bulletin nor (3) was it a \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d within the meaning of the statutory exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The District Court found it unnecessary to pass on the similarity of the various jobs performed by the employees involved here since it found that the pay differential was based upon a \u201cbona fide training program.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since this approach impliedly assumed that there was in fact unequal pay for equal work we need consider only whether the District Court was correct in its construction of the statute and of the Interpretative Bulletin. Since we believe that the training program found to exist and to be the basis of the unequal pay was neither a \u201cbona fide training program\u201d within the meaning of the Bulletin nor within the statutory exemption,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we must reverse and remand the cases for the District Court to compare the jobs performed by the employees involved here and decide whether in fact under the appropriate burden of proof there was unequal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">The training programs that the District Court found to exist and to be the justification for the unequal pay were informal, unwritten,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, if not imaginary, consisted of little more than the recognition of the ability of employees to work their way up the ranks. The training program was supposed to provide rotation for the \u201ctrainee\u201d through the various departments of the bank so the employee would more fully compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>hend the banks\u2019 operations. Such rotation of the male \u201ctrainees\u201d was, however, not distinguishable from the normal course of employment for the female employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The rotation of the \u201ctrainee\u201d has apparently been unpredictable, sporadic, and unplanned. The time spent in each department varied widely and was in fact based not upon any concept of training but upon the banks\u2019 personnel needs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Moreover, there was no definite understanding or agreement between the banks and their male employees concerning a training program. Mr. Sheffield, Vice President of First Victoria in charge of personnel, testified that when he hired an employee he did not know if that employee would be \u201ctrained\u201d to be an officer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Yet, the male employees were started at substantially higher salaries than female employees performing the same task. For example, Gary Prai started work for First Victoria in 1961 as a paying and receiving teller at $300.00 a month (Table A, Item 1, col. a), while LaRose Halsey, who had worked at the position since 1946 (Table A, Item 2, col. a), received only $290.00 per month.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Thus it is apparent that the training programs that the District Court found to exist and be the motivation for the discrimination were not specific and their metes and bounds were at best poorly surveyed. As structured and operated it was little more than a post-event justification for disparate pay to men and women from the commencement of employment up through advancement. The training was essentially the acquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>of skills, and experience and knowledge of the business through continued performance of regular tasks.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this sense every job in every type of business would be training, and nothing would be left for the operation of the Interpretative Bulletin Training program. This was not the Secretary\u2019s intention. In addition, the imprecision, in and of itself, of the Banks\u2019 training program is not in keeping with the Secretary\u2019s Interpretative Bulletin on training programs. (See note 7, <em>swpra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"> Moreover, such imprecise programs are outside the scope of the broad statutory exception \u2014 \u201ca factor other than sex\u201d \u2014 (See 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206(d) (1) (iv)) because they are not in harmony with the Congressional purpose: The elimination of those subjective assumptions and traditional stereotyped misconceptions regarding the value of women\u2019s work.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These programs are inconsistent since in actual operation the work and role of the male employees\u2014 \u201ctrainees\u201d cannot be distinguished from the female workers who do the same jobs and who are likewise learning and growing in the business but without the title of trainee.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The Congressional purpose is clear whether divined by traditional doctrines of statutory construction or, more plausibly, the legislative history with respect to the statutory exception. This legislative intent is expressed by the report of the House committee that favorably reported the bill to the floor: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>serve as a valid defense to a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201cThis language recognizes that there are many factors which may be used to measure the relationships between jobs and which establish a valid basis for a difference in pay. These factors will be found in a majority of the job classification systems. Thus, it is anticipated that a bona fide job classification program that does not discriminate on the basis of sex will</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Three specific exceptions and one broad general exception are also listed. It is the intent of this committee that any discrimination based upon any of these exceptions shall be exempted from the operation of this statute. As it is impossible to list each and every exception, the broad general exclusion has been also included. Thus, among other things, shift differentials, restrictions on or differences based on time of day worked, hours of work, lifting or moving heavy objects, differences based on experience, training, or ability would also be excluded. It also recognizes certain special circumstances, such as \u201cred circle rates.\u201d This term is borrowed from War Labor Board parlance and describes certain unusual, higher than normal wage rates which are maintained for many valid reasons. For instance, it is not uncommon for an employer who must reduce help in a skilled job to transfer employees to other less demanding jobs but to continue to pay them a premium rate in order to have them available when they are again needed for their former jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-24\">109 Cong.Rec. 9210.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-25\">Important as are the exceptions, to sustain these so-called training programs as a justification for disparate pay would mean that \u201cthe exception will swallow the rule.\u201d Weeks v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 228, 235. And, this \u201crule\u201d \u2014 equal pay for equal work \u2014 was not laid down simply out of concern about the injustice of discrimination,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> important as that was. It was also laid down out of concern about the economic and social consequences of disparate wages<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> paid to a major portion of the nation\u2019s labor force.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such wages not only depressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the living standard of those who received them, they also depressed wages for all workers and particularly workers in certain industries.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Nor is any such swallowing of the \u201crule\u201d compelled or suggested by our recent construction of that other rank in the phalanx of legislation designed to protect the employment rights of women \u2014 equal job opportunity \u2014 conferred by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e et seq.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp.,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we held that there was no discrimination based on sex when another criterion of employment, even one related as closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to sex as motherhood, is coupled with sex. 411 F.2d at 3-4. Here, however, under the training program relied upon as the justification for unequal pay there was lacking \u201cany factor other than sex\u201d, since the work performed and the employment roles of the male and female employees were the same. Thus it was sex itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">This is borne out also by the discriminatory manner in which these training programs were administered.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Since the commencement of this proceeding both banks made female employees officers.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Both banks thus obviously recognized that some of their women employees had the capacity and the drive to become officers. Both banks, nevertheless, included none of these women in the \u201ctraining programs\u201d. Thus the system starts with discrimination on sex with no showing yet that any exception would justify it. This will be true whether this is an Equal Pay Act problem or a Title VII<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> problem and whether the differential justification is based on the exceptions in the Equal Pay Act, the business-justification exception of \u00a7 703(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(e), or concepts akin to Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">These vague, almost illusory, training programs that were applied in a discriminatory manner may have been \u201ca better reason\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> than the maleness or femaleness of employees for the inequality in pay. But, they were not \u201cfactors other than sex\u201d within the meaning of the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Reversed and remanded.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">.

And, in the First Victoria Bank Florence Payne had worked as a bookkeeper, a paying and receiving teller and a mail teller (Table A, Item 5, col. a); Jean Ann Payne had worked as a bookkeeper, note teller, and savings teller (Table A, Item 8, cols, a-b) ; and all the other women cited in the above tables, except Evelyn Langston, had worked in at least two departments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">.

In addition, the American Bank of Commerce kept Lester Dorton \u201ctraining\u201d as a note teller for two years (Table D, Item 1, cols. a-d).

The difference was exaggerated as time passed, although there is no indication that Prai was selected to train to be an officer.

Representative Donahue speaking in behalf of this legislation characterized the need for the Equal Pay Act to eliminate these assumptions:</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">\u201cWe all realize that the origin of the wage rate differential for men and women performing comparable jobs is the false concept that a woman, because of her very nature, somehow or other should not be given as much money as a man for similar work.

Our economy today depends upon women in the labor force. One out of three workers is a woman. Today, there are almost 25 million women employed, and their number is rising faster than the number of men in the labor force. It is extremely important that adequate provision be made for reasonable levels of income to them, for the care of the children * * * and for the protection of the family unit * * *. Today one out of five of these working mothers has children under three. Two out of five have children of school age. Among the remainder, about 50 percent have husbands who earn less than $5,000 a year \u2014 many of them much less.

The proportion of working wives is materially higher among families in the low-income groups.\u201d [1963 Senate Hearings, p. 16]</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">See also Representative Green (109 Cong.Rec. 9199):</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">\u201cThere are approximately 25 million working women in the labor force today, and we are simply asking, by this legislation, to look at the facts as they face us in 1963, in instances where there is unequal pay. * * * Women are the heads of 4.6 million families in the United States; one-tenth of all the families in this country. Nearly one million working women have husbands who are not employed, mainly because they are disabled or retired. Nearly 6 million working women are single. The proportion of married women who work is materially higher in the low-income families, and, according to the testimony that was presented to the committee, some 7.5 million women workers supplement the income of male wage earners who make less than $3,000 a year.

During the debate of the 1962 bill, which was substantially similar to the final legislation, it was said that men \u201cworkers as well as women workers, their families, and employers benefit from equal pay. Women benefit by receiving the rate for the job instead of a lower rate based on sex. Men benefit through increased job security since employers are discouraged from replacing them with lower paid women.\u201d Statement by Rep.
