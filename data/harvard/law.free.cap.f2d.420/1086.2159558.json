(Section 2(e) (1) Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1052(e).) The board also said: \u201cIf said term were applied to a type of whiskey other than bourbon it could well be misdescriptive thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>While appellant concedes that the mark is not purely arbitrary, it urges that it does not describe any ingredient, condition, or quality of the whiskey but merely suggest the aging of whiskey and serves as no more than a vague association with excellence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">A mark may be \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d and not registrable if it only describes a characteristic of the goods. In re Walker Manufacturing Co., 359 F. 2d 474, 53 CCPA 1133 (1966); In re Preformed Line Products Co., 323 F.2d 1007, 51 CCPA 775 (1963); Roselux Chem. Co. v. Parsons Ammonia Co., 299 F.2d 855, 49 CCPA 931 (1962). On the other hand, a legal distinction has been drawn between merely descriptive terms and terms that are only suggestive of the goods or their characteristics. In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 55 CCPA 1049 (1968); Audio Fidelity, Inc. v. London Records, Inc., 332 F.2d 577, 51 CCPA 1429 (1964). The issue is whether, as applied to whiskey, \u201cCHARRED KEG\u201d is merely descriptive or merely suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Appellant\u2019s application sets forth that the mark has been used \u201cFor Whiskey,\u201d but the specimen label shows it is applied to \u201cSTRAIGHT BOURBON WHISKEY.\u201d Certain background facts must be considered in resolving the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Bourbon whiskey, as defined in Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (1966), is. \u201ca whiskey distilled from a mash containing at least 51 percent corn, the rest being malt and rye, and aged in new charred oak containers.\u201d Corn whiskey, however, is defined as \u201cwhiskey distilled from a mash made up of not less than 80 percent corn and aged in an uncharred or used oak container.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">The regulations under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 5, section 5.10 provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">(j) <em>Age. </em>* * * In the case of American type whiskies produced on or after July 1, 1936, other than corn whisky, straight corn whiskies, blended corn whisky, and blends of straight corn whisky \u201cage\u201d means the period during which the whisky has been kept in charred new oak containers.</p>\n<p id=\"A02\">In support of its position that the term \u201cCHARRED KEG\u201d is suggestive rather than descriptive, appellant relies on In re Colonial Stores, supra. The court there indicated that one of the tests used to determine whether a given mark is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d is based upon what it would mean to a potential customer when applied to applicant\u2019s goods. In that case it was held that the term \u201cSUGAR &amp; SPICE\u201d applied to bakery goods did not tell the potential customer only what the_ goods were, their functions, characteristics, use, or ingredients, but would, by virtue of the old nursery rhyme, evoke an association with \u201ceverything nice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">Appellant also cites In re Sunbeam Corp., 370 F.2d 358, 54 CCPA 901 (1967), wherein it was held that the mark \u201cSpray Mist\u201d as applied to an electric pressing iron, although suggestive of one feature of function of the goods, was not merely descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">In the <em>Roselux </em>case, supra, it was sought to register \u201cSudsy\u201d as a trademark for ammonia containing synthetic detergent. The product was a new type of household ammonia which became sudsy when the bottle was shaken. We held that \u201csudsy ammonia\u201d was a common descriptive name for the product, stating (299 F.2d p. 860, 49 CCPA pp. 937-938):</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">One common descriptive name of the product to which \u201csudsy\u201d is applied is \u201cdetergent ammonia\u201d but proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>this fact does not establish that \u201csudsy ammonia\u201d is not also a common descriptive name. Another descriptive name is \u201cammonium hydroxide solution containing synthetic detergent\u201d. However, in considering whether \u201csudsy ammonia\u201d is a <em>common </em>descriptive name of the product we cannot fail to take into consideration the class of people who will commonly be using it and what they will commonly call it. The record here shows, through the testimony of Mr. Ingham and in other respects, that the product is intended, not for chemists, but in his words for \u201cMrs. Consumer,\u201d the average housewife. Assuming her familiarity with clear ammonia or cloudy ammonia or even pine-scented ammonia, the thing she is most likely to remember about this new product, especially after having once used it or seen it demonstrated, is that it is <em>sudsy </em>ammonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In the instant case, while it appears that bourbon is an American-type whiskey which has been aged in charred containers, it does not, in our opinion, follow that \u201cCHARRED KEG\u201d when used on whiskey conveys to the consuming public that it is a particular type of whiskey, though it may suggest that it is one which has been aged in charred containers. The record does not show that bourbon or other whiskey is actually aged in \u201ckegs.\u201d Registration will not interfere with the right of the trade to state the fact that its whiskey has been aged in charred oak barrels, vats or other containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">On the misdescriptive question, which we cannot regard as a ground of rejection, it may be that the Patent Office will wish to reconsider, in light of our reversal of the rejection for deseriptiveness, whether the description of the goods is too broad in view of the specimens which show use only on bourbon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">.

These indicate that bourbon and American type whiskeys, except corn whiskey, are aged in charred oak containers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
