Applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity were filed and processed. In due course a prehearing conference was held to properly frame the issues. Just prior to this conference, several \u201cConcerned Citizens,\u201d the Palisades Citizens Association, \u00a1Inc., and a group known as the Committee Against National (hereinafter collectively known as \u201cCitizens\u201d or \u201cpetitioners\u201d) filed petitions for leave to intervene in the proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Their papers alleged a keen interest in the reduction of noise, air pollution and safety hazards attendant to the air traffic above their property. They requested permission to intervene formally in the determination pending before the Board either as formal parties pursuant to Rule 15 of the Board\u2019s Rules of Practice, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.15 (1968) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or as interested persons under Rule 14 of the Rules, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.14 (1968).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They asserted, basically, that inquiry into these areas of public inconvenience and hazard was most relevant to the Board\u2019s statutory study as set out in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(d) (J) (1964),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, as such, were areas best presented by those most significantly affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">On June 26, 1967, prior to acting on the petitions for intervention, the hearing examiner held the final prehearing conference in which all petitioners participated. At this time the Citizens requested that the applicants be made to demonstrate, at the hearing, the facts respecting the degree of environmental impact flowing from their proposed service. This request was denied in the examiner\u2019s prehearing report of June 28, 1967. However, the report did indicate that petitioners would be permitted to appear and testify at the hearing relative to their interests under either Rule 14 or 15 intervention (J.A. 54). Exceptions were taken to this report and denied. Thereafter, on July 28, 1967, the examiner ruled \u201cthat the appearance of petitioners as formal parties [under Rule 15] will unduly broaden the issues and delay the proceedings, whereas their interests may be adequately advanced under the provisions of Rule 14(b) of the Rules of Practice.\u201d (J.A. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">The Citizens appealed the denial of formal intervention to the Board contending that the merits of their \u201cimpact\u201d argument demanded attention and that denial of formal intervention was error. The Board, in an opinion and order issued September 19, 1967 (with two members dissenting), held that although the consideration of the environmental impact question need not be undertaken at that time, it would uphold the examiner respecting his ruling on intervention (J.A. 8). The Board pointed out that the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(c) (1964), did not confer upon members of the public a \u201cright\u201d to intervene in these proceedings but only permitted interested parties to file opposition to the grant of certificates. On the other hand, the Board indicated that control of procedural questions of intervention was governed by Rules 14 and 15 of its Rules of Practice. After an analysis of both the opportunities and duties under each of these rules the Board reasoned \u201cthat petitioners\u2019 interests are not so substantial as to require or warrant intervention by them, and that Rule 14(b) participation will be adequate.\u201d (J.A. 9.) The Board concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">[i]f each [petitioner] were allowed to intervene an'd participate as a full party, proceedings which are already burdened by numerous parties would become nearly uncontrollable. Rule 14(b) participation strikes the practical balance between the general public\u2019s interest in viable administrative proceedings and the private interests of individual members of the general public. This is especially so where, as here, the representation of the Department of Transportation in addition to the applicants\u2019 participation through Rule 14, may be expected to amply articulate the broad public interest in environmental impact from which the applicants special interest are derived [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">(J.A. 11.) The Citizens appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In affirming the Board\u2019s order in this case let us first caution the Board that q\u00fcestions relating to environmental impact of proposed services upon persons and property lying below the routes are substantial and clearly relevant to the Board\u2019s certification inquiry. Section 1302 of Title 49 of the Code requires the Board, in determining the public convenience and necessity, to consider \u201camong other things\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">(a) The encouragement and development of an air-transportation system properly adapted to the present and future needs of the * * * domestic commerce of the United States * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">(b) The regulation of air transportation in such manner as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of, assure the highest degree of safety in, and foster sound economic conditions in, such transportation * * * [and]</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">(f) The promotion, encouragement, and development of civil aeronautics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Actually the spirit of the first two quoted provisions is summed up in paragraph (f) \u2014 the \u201cpromotion, encouragement, and development of civil aeronautics.\u201d That is truly the three-foot mark on the yardstick of public interest and a basic measure of the Board\u2019s responsibilities. No agency entrusted with determinations of public convenience and necessity is an island. It fits within a national system of regulatory control of industry. Its decisions affect not only its primary interest groups but also the general public at large. For example, were the Civil Aeronautics Board to award a route certificate to a carrier which employs aircraft powered by chlorine gas due to its assertion of cheaper rates to the air traveler, the impact of such an award would not only affect the competing carriers but also the air-breathing public below. Regardless of the efficiency of the air service, the deadly pollution must nullify the grant. To say that the environmental impact of that service is not a proper consideration of the Board in its certification hearing is folly.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Since the arrival of the airplane as a convenient mode of travel there has been a.continuing controversy over who has primary use of airspace\u2014 the airline or the property owner. It has been held that one owns \u201cso much of the space above the ground as [one] can occupy or make use of, in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>with the enjoyment of [his] land.\u201d Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport, 84 F.2d 755, 758 (9th Cir. 1936), cert. denied, 300 U.S. 655, 57 S.Ct. 431, 81 L.Ed. 865 (1937). It is true that Congress, by statute, has declared \u201cexclusive national sovereignty in the airspace of the United States * * *\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (1964) and has defined navigable airspace as all airspace \u201cabove the minimum altitudes of flight prescribed by regulations * * * \u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301 (1964). However, \u201c[r]egardless of any congressional limitations, the land owner, as an incident to his ownership, has a claim to the superadjacent airspace\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the extent that a reasonable use of his land involves such space. Accordingly, an \u201cinvasion of the \u2018superadjacent airspace\u2019 will often \u2018affect the use of the surface land itself.\u2019 [United States v. Causby] 328 U.S. at 265 [66 S.Ct. at 1068, 90 L.Ed. 1206].\u201d Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84, 89, 82 S.Ct. 531, 533, 7 L.Ed.2d 585 (1962). Moreover, where that invasion is destructive of the landowner\u2019s right to possess and use his land, it is compensable either through private tort actions or under the fifth amendment where the use, by the government, amounts to a \u201ctaking.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 265, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 90 L.Ed. 1206 (1946) and Griggs v. Allegheny County, <em>supra. </em>It follows, therefore, that the public interest in the \u201cpromotion, encouragement, and development of civil aeronautics\u201d demands consideration by the Board of the extent to which a grant will affect persons and property on the ground below the route. A certificate to a carrier (or the institution of a service) which would substantially increase the intensity of noise, degree of air pollution or the probability of accidents would be contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Federal Aviation Act. The Civil Aeronautics Board has been given the scales of public interest. ;It must effect a balance. This is so even though we recognize that certain other governmental departments have been given the explicit authority to consider the various aspects of environmental impact specifically. It is true that the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration have been given the duty of prescribing standards relative to aircraft noise abatement. <em>See </em>Department of Transportation Act, 49 U.S. C. \u00a7 1653(a) (Supp. IV, 1965-1968) and Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431 (Supp. IV, 1965-1968). We are aware, also, that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has been given the duty of determining, by study and report, the air pollution effects of jet and conventional aircraft engine emissions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6d(b) (Supp. IV, 1965-1968). Finally, we realize that a complex set of safety regulations has been promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration in an effort to carry out its statutory duty of establishing a safe air transportation system pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421-1430 (1964). These determinations, however, are merely narrow studies of the \u201cspecies\u201d of the \u201cgenus\u201d environmental impact. There still exists the \u201cfamily\u201d of public interest in which each of these species belong. As such, the Board must account for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Having found that questions of environmental impact are proper \u201cpublic interest\u201d questions in the Board\u2019s certification inquiry, we turn to the determination of whether denial of formal intervention to petitioners was error. We look first to the statute. Section 1371 (c) of Title 49 of the Code provides that upon the filing of applications for certificates under section (b), \u201c[a]ny interested person may file with the Board a protest or memorandum of opposition to or in support of * * * a certificate.\u201d In implementing this statute through regulation the Board has provided for two kinds of participation \u2014 informal and formal. Informal participation is achieved under 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.14(b) (1968) which provides, in pertinent part, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Any person * * * <em>may </em>appear at any hearing * * * and present any evidence that is relevant to the issues. * * * [SJuch person <em>may </em>also cross-examine witnesses directly. Such person <em>may </em>also present to the examiner a written statement on the issues * * *. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Formal intervention, on the other hand, is governed by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.15 which provides, in part, that</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">(a) * * * Any person whose intervention will be conducive to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the conduct of such proceeding <em>may </em>be permitted to intervene. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">From the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in these sections it is apparent that intervention is discretionary. In exercising that discretion the Board is to take into account, \u201camong other things,\u201d the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">(1) The nature of the petitioner\u2019s right under the statute to be made a party of the proceeding; (2) the nature * * * of the property, financial or other interest of the petitioner; (3) the effect of the order which may be entered in the proceeding on petitioner\u2019s interest; (4) the availability of other means whereby the petitioner\u2019s interest may be protected; (5) the extent to which petitioner\u2019s interest will be represented by existing parties; (6) the extent to which petitioner\u2019s participation may reasonably be expected to assist in the development of a sound record; and (7) the extent to which participation of the petitioner will broaden the issue or delay the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">14 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.15(b) (1968). Since the filing of the briefs in this case, the Board has effected the hearing, initial decision and final order. Our review of the proceedings and the resultant opinions discloses that the petitioners were given the opportunity to participate in the proceedings by the presentation of exhibits, the cross-examination of witnesses and in oral argument before the examiner. Furthermore, the Department of Transportation, a formal inter-venor, advanced its position on environmental impact through testimony and submittal of exhibits. The Board weighed the impact question against the need for the service and found the latter consideration persuasive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">In appraising the Board\u2019s determination in light of the statute and regulations, we hold that denial of formal intervention to petitioners was reasonable in view of the full record. In any event the denial amounted to a reduction of petitioners\u2019 status in form only, rather than in substance, for that which might have been accomplished under Rule 15 was, in fact, effected through Rule 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">In closing we wish only to note that Board proceedings entail determinations of the many-faceted public interest. It is for the Board to determine who will best serve to amplify the facts pertinent to that interest and unless there is evidence of clear error, the Board\u2019s order will stand. The statute, the rules and the proceedings below have been carried out reasonably, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">.
