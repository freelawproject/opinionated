United States, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904 (1925) that we should order appellant acquitted on the ground that the well-known presumption which was found not to contravene the protections of the. Fifth Amendment in <em>Yee Hem </em>does, despite <em>Yee Hem, </em>violate that Amendment\u2019s right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Though we admire the assiduous efforts of assigned counsel, Yee Hem v. United States continues to be controlling in the Courts of Appeal, and we are, as counsel is fully aware, bound by that holding. See opinion in United States v. Quarles, 2 Cir., 420 F.2d 660 <em>(per curiam) </em>decided by us this day, citing United States v. Armone, 363 F.2d 385, 391-393 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, Viscardi v. United States, 385 U.S. 957, 87 S.Ct. 391, 17 L.Ed.2d 303 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Appellant also argues that it was error for the judge to fail to tell the jury, despite defendant\u2019s specific request, that the jury did not have to make the inference permitted by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. Although it would have been better for the judge to have followed United States v. Peeples, 377 F.2d 205, 210-211 (2 Cir. 1967) and said in so many words that the jury could refuse to make the inference of importation from the fact of possession and therefore could acquit, it would appear that the judge conveyed that meaning although not in the explicit language that counsel requested be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">.
