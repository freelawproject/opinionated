A statement of the basic facts will put the case in perspective and elucidate the trial court\u2019s judgment and our modification of that part of the judgment based on the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The Fischers successfully bid on approximately $1,600,000 of highway contracts with the state of Oklahoma and Fireman\u2019s agreed to provide the statutorily-required performance and payment bonds for these jobs, subject to conditions expressed in a letter agreement. In this letter the Fischers agreed to set up a separate \u201cspecial\u201d bank account of $200,000, to deposit in that account all funds received in payment on these contracts, and to use that account exclusively for payment of contract expenses. The letter also required a Subordination Agreement by T. R. Benedum, to which a duplicate deposit slip in the amount of $200,000 was to be attached. The Fisch-ers obtained a short-term loan of $200,-000 and deposited it in a special account, submitting the deposit slip to Fireman\u2019s. The bonds were then issued. Five days after deposit the Fischers repaid the loan from the same account.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Eleven months after the contracts were let Fireman\u2019s began to receive complaints from the Fischers\u2019 creditors and sent a representative to look at their books. He discovered approximately $320,000 in outstanding bills on the contracts. The absence of the $200,000 from the special account was discovered at about the same time and the report of the later-appointed receiver shows that substantially all of the Fischers\u2019 construction equipment was encumbered at this time. On the basis of the information discovered Fireman\u2019s ordered the state of Oklahoma to stop paying the Fischers on the contracts. Fireman\u2019s representatives conferred with the Fischers a week later and gathered more data from their books. Two days after that conference Raymond Fischer signed a statement of default on the contracts for Fireman\u2019s attorney. A week later Fireman\u2019s retained an out-of-state contractor to estimate the cost of completing the work and informed the Fischers that they would not be allowed to complete the contracts. On the same day, in their own attorney\u2019s office, Fischers signed letters admitting default, copies of which were sent to the Highway Department and the prime contractor. Fireman\u2019s then negotiated two contracts for the completion of the work and paid all unpaid bills, suffering a loss of $555,928.97.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">A few months later Fireman\u2019s filed their complaint seeking appointment of a receiver for the Fischers and indemnification under its indemnity agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>with the Fischers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A receiver was appointed without objection. In its motion for summary judgment on its claim, Fireman\u2019s specifically alleged facts which it said constituted fraudulent inducement to become surety and sought judgment for the loss incurred in the completion of the work, either as a loss resulting from these fraudulent acts or as a loss reimbursible under its indemnity agreement with Fischers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">At the hearing on the motion Fisch-ers\u2019 counsel conceded that Fireman\u2019s was entitled to the judgment on the basis of the indemnity agreement because of Fischers\u2019 default on their contracts, but refused to concede that Fischers had fraudulently secured the bonds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court declined summary judgment on either theory to afford the Fischers an opportunity to answer Fireman\u2019s fraud allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The Fischers then answered and counterclaimed. Contrary to the admissions at the summary judgment hearing, the answer denied default. It also denied fraud and asserted that Fireman\u2019s had spent excessive amounts in completing the work. The counterclaim alleged two separate torts by Fireman\u2019s and sought actual and punitive damages for both. The first tort asserted was that the Fischers\u2019 insolvency resulted from Fireman\u2019s negligent investigation and wrongful interference with the contract payments. The second tort alleged was that subsequent to its stopping of the contract payments Fireman\u2019s agreed to release the payments and to finance the Fischers if they would admit insolvency, that the Fischers issued payroll checks in reliance on that agreement, and that Fireman\u2019s then breached the agreement. This breach allegedly injured the Fisch-ers by bringing on their insolvency and angering employees who, upon receiving the \u201cbouncing\u201d paychecks, destroyed some of the Fischers\u2019 construction equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The trial court first dismissed the counterclaim and then, by a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order treated the dismissal as a summary judgment for Fireman\u2019s. In its <em>nunc pro tunc </em>judgment the court found that Fischers were insolvent and unable to pay their bills when the contract payments were stopped and that Fireman\u2019s had a right to stop the payments, take possession of the premises and complete the work. The dismissal and summary judgment were held to be non-appealable orders in two prior attempted appeals by the Fischers. The summary judgment is now appropriately here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Although the subsequent pretrial order included among defendant\u2019s contentions both torts of the counterclaim, the summary judgment was undoubtedly intended to remove the issue of wrongful stoppage of payments from the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>leaving only the second part of the counterclaim, i. e., breach of an agreement to release funds. On trial the court accordingly refused to admit the Fischers\u2019 proof of non-default because of their admissions, but did allow evidence on the alleged agreement to release payments and finance the Fischers. At the close of the Fischers\u2019 evidence, however, the court directed a verdict on the counterclaim, thus taking from the jury the second tort alleged in the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Consistently with the summary judgment on the stoppage of payments issue and the directed verdict on the agreement to release payments issue, the court instructed the jury, without objection, that the Fischers were insolvent as a matter of law at the time in question and had admitted Fireman\u2019s right to finish the work. The effect of these instructions was to establish as a matter of law the Fischers\u2019 liability to Fireman\u2019s under its indemnity agreement, leaving to the jury only the questions of the Fischers\u2019 alleged fraud as an alternative basis of recovery and the reasonableness of completion costs in the calculation of Fireman\u2019s loss under either <em>theory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The jury was told that Fireman\u2019s claimed it had been induced to become surety on the bonds by the Fischers\u2019 fraudulent representations and that the Fischers denied they had committed fraud. The jury was conventionally instructed on fraud as a basis of recovery. The court even went so far as to comment on the evidence as it related to the fraud issue, but finally cautioned the jury to disregard the comment. The jury returned a verdict of $200,000 for Fireman\u2019s, apparently on the indemnity agreement, and specifically exonerated the Fischers on the fraud issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The Fischers\u2019 appeal challenges the summary judgment and directed verdict on the counterclaim and the denial of a motion for new trial. Fireman\u2019s cross-appeal asserts as error the trial court\u2019s denial of judgment n. o. v. on the fraud theory and the denial of judgment n. o. v. for the full amount of its loss under either theory. We must thus determine whether the summary judgment and the directed verdict correctly disposed of the counterclaim, whether Fireman\u2019s completion costs were reasonable, and whether Fireman\u2019s was entitled, as a matter of law, to a finding that Fischers had committed fraud. We note, initially, that if we were to adopt the admission of default and liability under the indemnity agreement made by the Fischers\u2019 attorney at the summary judgment hearing there would be no question concerning the propriety of the summary judgment and directed verdict. We will, however, consider the propriety of these rulings in light of all the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">While different rules have been promulgated to explicate directed verdicts and summary judgments, in the final analysis they both turn on whether any genuine issue of fact survives the pleadings and depositions or evidence, requiring fact-findings. Thus, we have often said summary judgment is justified only if no material issue of fact survives the pleadings, affidavits and depositional proof. Well Surveys, Inc. v. Perfo-Log, Inc., 396 F.2d 15 (10th Cir. 1968); H. B. Zachry Co. v. O\u2019Brien, 378 F.2d 423 (10th Cir. 1967); McCullough Tool Co. v. Well Surveys, Inc., 395 F.2d 230 (10th Cir. 1968); Jensen v. Voyles, 393 F.2d 131 (10th Cir. 1968); Bumgarner v. Joe Brown Co., 376 F.2d 749 (10th Cir. 1967) ; Wagoner v. Mountain Savings &amp; Loan Association, 311 F.2d 403 (10th Cir. 1962). The prevailing rule on directed verdicts, at least in this Circuit, seems to be that a directed verdict is justified only if the proof is all one way or so overwhelmingly preponderant in favor of the movant as to permit no other rational conclusion. Weeks v. Latter-Day Saints Hospital, 418 F.2d 1035 (10th Cir. 1969); Derr v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 404 F.2d 634 (10th Cir. 1968) ; Gulf Insurance Co. v. Kolob Corp., 404 F.2d 115 (10th Cir. 1968); C. H. Codding &amp; Sons v. Armour and Co., 404 F.2d 1 (10th Cir. 1968). In practical effect the underlying rule is the same and in both instances the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>court is empowered and enjoined to look through transparency to substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We think the court rightly decided there was no genuine issue of fact concerning Fireman\u2019s stoppage of payments. The Fischers\u2019 allegation of solvency was conclusively refuted by the established fact of unpaid bills of over $300,000 on the Fireman\u2019s contracts and over $190,000 on other bonded contracts and the further fact that all of Fischers\u2019 construction equipment was encumbered. The alleged negligent investigation of Fischers\u2019 insolvency was conclusively countered by the facts of the Fischers\u2019 conference with Fireman\u2019s, leading to the discovery of Fischers\u2019 due and unpaid bills. The allegation that Fischers\u2019 default statement to Fireman\u2019s attorney was untrue and given only to secure Fireman\u2019s release of the contract payments was conclusively countered by the fact that the Fischers, with advice of counsel, also admitted default in a letter <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> written after learning that Fireman\u2019s would not release the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The Fischers argue that the trial court applied the wrong test of insolvency in finding, on the basis of these facts, that they were insolvent and that Fireman\u2019s rightly stopped the contract payments. They deny that the standard of solvency apparently applied by the trial court, i. e., inability to discharge debts in the ordinary course of business, is applicable here. Instead, they rely upon cases involving statutory definitions of insolvency, notably in the context of bankruptcy and assignments for the benefits of creditors, which, tersely stated, define insolvency as an excess of liabilities over assets, i. e., see Lakeshore Apartments, Inc. v. United States, 351 F.2d 349, 353 (10th Cir. 1965); United States v. Press Wireless, Inc., 187 F.2d 294 (2d Cir. 1951); United States v. Gotwals, 156 F.2d 692, 169 A. L.R. 619 (10th Cir. 1946). We fail to see the relevance of the Fischers\u2019 insolvency arguments to Fireman\u2019s right to take over the contracts. The question must be and is whether at the time of the take-over the Fischers were insolvent in the sense of being financially unable to perform their contracts and were therefore in default on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Considering the unpaid bills and the Fischers\u2019 admissions of default, made with the advice of counsel, it is clear the Fischers were financially unable to perform their work and therefore in default. The court properly concluded that Fireman\u2019s had the right and duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to take over performance of the bonded contracts. As the court observed, \u201c[w] hen you have $300,000 * * * of bills you can't pay, you are in default. There isn\u2019t any escaping that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As we have seen, the second tort alleged in the Fischers\u2019 counterclaim was that Fireman\u2019s breach of an agreement to release the contract payments, after the Fischers had released payroll checks to employees in reliance on the agreement, caused the Fischers\u2019 insolvency and prompted the destruction of their construction equipment by angered employees. This tort was not removed from the litigation by the summary judgment since Raymond Fischer\u2019s deposition in support of the allegations had not been conclusively refuted by Fireman\u2019s at the time of the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On trial, Raymond Fischer testified that after stoppage of payments Fireman\u2019s representatives confirmed their agreement to release the contract payments and to allow the Fischers to finish the work. He testified that they told him that he could continue to write his own checks but that one of their representatives would have to approve payments made by Fischers. They are said to have told him that they were going to set up the mechanics to release the money and to meet the payrolls pursuant to the agreement. Fischer further testified that he believed his statement of default to Fireman\u2019s attorney was necessary to secure the release and that he continued to believe the money would be released until Fireman\u2019s informed him to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"> We think the directed verdict on this issue was proper. Assuming the existence and breach of an agreement, there is nothing here to support the allegation that the breach precipitated or contributed to Fischers\u2019 insolvency. As we have seen, the summary judgment on the first part of the counterclaim properly concluded that the Fischers were already insolvent at the point at which Fireman\u2019s stopped the contract payments. Nor is there any support for the allegations that the Fischers, in reliance on the agreement, issued payroll checks which were not covered by sufficient funds because of Fireman\u2019s breach. And, finally, there was no evidence that the Fischers\u2019 employees did any damage to the construction equipment. Having failed to prove actual damages, the Fischers were not entitled to punitive damages under the laws of Oklahoma. Eckels v. Traverse, 362 P.2d 680 (Okl. 1961); Mathies v. Kittrell, 354 P.2d 413 (Okl. 1960); 23 O.S.A. \u00a7 9 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">This brings us, finally, to the judgment of the court on the jury verdict. Under the instructions of the court the only issues submitted to the jury were the fraud theory of recovery and the reasonableness of completion costs in calculating Fireman\u2019s loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury was told without objection,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the Fischers were insolvent at the time of Fireman\u2019s investigation and continued to be insolvent to the time of the lawsuit and the appointment of the receiver. They were also told that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Fischers admitted their default, admitted Fireman\u2019s right and duty to take over and complete the contracts, and admitted that Fireman\u2019s had incurred a net loss of $555,928.97 in completing the work and paying the bills. The jury was further instructed, however, that the Fischers asserted that Fireman\u2019s had \u201cpaid excessive prices for the completion of the contracts\u201d and if the jury found any of Fireman\u2019s expenditures were not reasonable, necessary or proper, they should reduce Fireman\u2019s recovery accordingly. But the jury was also told that the burden was on the Fischers ' to prove this claim of excessive expenditures. Since we affirm the summary judgment and the judgment on the directed verdict, these instructions are the dimensions of our lawsuit. And if the jury understood and followed the court\u2019s instructions, they apparently thought the completion expenditures were excessive, since the verdict was for only $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">If we interpret the verdict as a finding that the net loss should have been $200,000 rather than the $555,928.-97 actually incurred, the question is whether the verdict is supported by the evidence. Otherwise stated, the question is whether the Fischers\u2019 proof impugned the integrity of the admitted net loss, and, if so, to what extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The only countervailing evidence on the completion costs was the testimony of John and Raymond Fischer. John Fischer who admitted that he was concerned with the \u201cfield\u201d aspects of the work and did not keep track of costs, testified that he estimated the labor costs in completing two of the contracts at from $15,000 to $18,000 and the cost of completing a third at from $2500 to $3000 a week' for 25 or 30 working days. This witness was admittedly unfamiliar with the projection of costs of construction and his calculations failed to take account of the costs other than labor incurred by the completing contractors and of the variables entering into the calculation of the labor cost itself. The contrast between the generality of his labor cost estimates and the completeness and specificity of Fireman\u2019s actual completion costs emphasizes his statement\u2019s lack of probative value. Indeed, we are unable to determine with any degree of accuracy what the total cost of completion would be under John Fischer\u2019s calculations, and nothing in the briefing sheds any light on this theory of the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For these reasons we cannot regard his testimony as in derogation of the reasonableness of Fireman\u2019s completion costs, nor as in support of the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The issue thus turns on the probity of Raymond Fischer\u2019s testimony. On the basis of his own cost accounting records, he testified that the value of work remaining to be completed in the contracts was $188,000 and that he and his brother could have completed the work for $87,000, resulting in a total loss of $30,000 after completion and paying all bills. The manner in which the $30,000 loss was calculated was never explained, nor was there any explanation of how work valued at $188,000 could be completed for $87,000. The briefing is also noticeably deficient in this respect. The $188,000 in work to be completed is likewise without a rational basis. Raymond Fischer obtained that figure by subtracting the amount earned on the contracts (plus the value of materials on the job sites) from the total bid price of the contracts. This calculation rested on the assumption that Fischers\u2019 total bid price was equivalent to the actual cost of performance. The validity of this assumption is completely dissipated by the fact that he was unable to pay bills of $400,000 on the contracts to the time of Fireman\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">We do not think Raymond Fischer\u2019s testimony provides any support for the $200,000 verdict, not do we think it de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tracts from the reasonableness of Fireman\u2019s admitted net loss. Fireman\u2019s is, therefore, entitled to judgment n. o. v. for the full amount of its admitted net loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">' Inasmuch as the Fischers\u2019 liability under its indemnity agreement with Fireman\u2019s was not in any way contingent on the existence of fraud, the verdict of the jury absolving the Fischers of fraud is of no consequence. It neither added to nor detracted from the right of recovery on the indemnity agreement. And, in any event, we are unwilling to say that the Fischers were guilty of fraud as a matter of law. The judgment is accordingly reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the sum of $555,928.97.

We regret that this situation exists, but believe that in view of all the facts, it will be to the best interests of all parties concerned if said contracts be cancelled and annulled immediately. In order to expedite the cancellation thereof, we waive notice of annullment as set forth in Standard Specifications for Highway Construction of the State of Oklahoma, and particularly as set forth in Paragraph 108.10 thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">\u201cYou are assured of our desire to cooperate in every possible manner with the State of Oklahoma and our surety in completing the work covered by the above contracts at the earliest possible date and with the least expense to all parties concerned.

Fischer\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. We think Fischers\u2019 contention that the court should have allowed the jury to set off against Fireman\u2019s recovery the damages which Fireman\u2019s caused Fischers is merely a restatement of their counterclaim and is meritless since the counterclaim was properly taken from the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. At the conclusion of the court\u2019s instructions, Fischers\u2019 counsel objected to \u201cthe statement stated to the jury by the Court because it does not as a matter of fact reflect the proof of the defendant, and that it is prejudicial to the case of the defendant.\u201d We do not read this objection as referring specifically to the court\u2019s instruction on Fischers\u2019 insolvency and admission of Fireman\u2019s right to take over and complete the contracts. Indeed, the generality of the objection leaves us in doubt concerning its intended meaning. In view of the court's instructions and comments on fraud, it seems likely that the objection was directed to that issue alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Similarly, the Fischers complain on appeal of the court\u2019s failure to give requested instructions, but these instructions are not brought forward on appeal and therefore cannot bo considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. The only support for the verdict offered by the Fischers\u2019 brief was that the cost of completion should have been $35,000 rather than the $317,000 actually spent, reducing the net loss to approximately $218,000. This calculation was based on labor costs alone and failed to take account of the other obvious costs incurred under the completion contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
