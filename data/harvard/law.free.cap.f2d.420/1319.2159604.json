ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">Appellant was tried before a jury in the District Court upon an indictment charging housebreaking<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and grand larceny<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> consisting in the theft of a console from an apartment. The tenant thereof, Juanita A. Young, testified that she left the apartment about 4:30 p. m. on March 11, 1967, and that her combination radio-television-phonograph was stolen during her absence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A 12-year old boy testified that he saw appellant roll the console out of the apartment into a truck and ride away.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The defense was an alibi, predicated on testimony by two brothers, Raleigh and Lloyd Haskins, who resided next door to appellant, that he was at their home for at least a half hour from 5:30 p. m. on the offense date,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on testimony by appellant\u2019s wife that appellant arrived at his own home just before 8:00 p. m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury accepted the Government\u2019s evidence and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-20\">This appeal presents but one issue, arising from the trial judge\u2019s questioning of the Haskins brothers on certain aspects of the testimony they gave in support of appellant\u2019s alibi claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the questioning amounted to advocacy against the alibi theory in the presence of the jury, and constituted error for which the conviction must be reversed. We disagree, and so we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-21\">A trial judge is not \u201ca mere moderator\u201d;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his function extends to necessary assistance to \u201cthe inexperienced laymen in the [jury] box in finding the truth in the confusing conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>of contradictory evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His participation in the examination of witnesses may well be justified where the testimonial presentation promotes fuzziness, as where testimony is inarticulately or reluctantly given.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus we have recognized \u201cthe right of a trial judge to make proper inquiry of any witness when he deems that the end of justice may be served thereby and for the purpose of making the case clear to the jurors.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have also acknowledged that, to achieve such objectives, the inquiry may be directed to alibi witnesses for the defense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">Nonetheless, the judge must remain \u201ca disinterested and objective participant in the proceedings,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and principles both fundamental and indestructible in our criminal law exhort him to hold to a minimum his questioning of witnesses in a jury trial. Interrogation of witnesses tends to assimilate the court\u2019s role with the advocate\u2019s,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and may tread over the line separating the provinces of judge and jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The presumption of innocence may be jeopardized by an assumption of guilt radiated by overzealous quizzing by the judge,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the right to fair trial may be imperiled by an apparent breach of the atmosphere of judicial evenhandedness that should pervade the courtroom.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is the risk that the questioning may bear \u201cthe seeds of tilting the balance against the accused\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and place \u201cthe judge in the eyes of some jurors, on the side of the prosecution.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is also the danger that the judge may elicit from the witness responses hurtful to the accused \u2014 responses to which the jury may assign peculiar weight because of their ostensible judicial sponsorship.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">It is for reasons of this caliber that we have admonished that \u201cin a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>case, a trial judge should exercise restraint and caution because of the possible prejudicial consequences of the presider\u2019s intervention.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For \u201cjurors hold the robed trial judge in great awe and reverence\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and \u201chis lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Like the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[w]e realize that an alert and capable judge at times feels that he can assist in developing the evidence by participating in the interrogation of witnesses\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but, particularly with alternatives available,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201che would ordinarily do well to forego such intrusion upon the functions of counsel, thus maintaining the court\u2019s position of impartiality, in the eyes of the ever-observant jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">In the case at bar, the judge\u2019s questioning of the Haskins brothers, though somewhat extensive, did not in our view overstep the bounds of propriety. Despite the best efforts \u2014 indeed, praiseworthy efforts \u2014 of counsel on both sides, the testimony of each of these witnesses left something to be desired in terms of one\u2019s understanding of it. By our reading of the trial transcript, the judge\u2019s inquiries were efforts toward much needed clarification rather than challenges of the testimony.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We feel that the record justifies the judge in such an endeavor, and that it was not pursued to excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-17\">Moreover, these and other circumstances combine to persuade us that in any event the questioning complained of could hardly have been prejudicial to appellant. It was not significantly different in nature from the judge\u2019s questioning of Mrs. Young, a vital witness for the Government.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Importantly, even full acceptance of the testimony of the Haskins brothers would still have left the jury free to find that appellant committed the offenses, for even at face value that testimony would not have closed a gaping hole in appellant\u2019s alibi<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>There is to be considered, too, the on-the-spot evaluation of defense counsel<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> who, after completion of the judge\u2019s inquiries, submitted no additional questions to the witnesses, nor did he in either instance object to those propounded by the judge.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> At most, the judge\u2019s examination of the two alibi witnesses is not likely to have had more than minimal effect upon the result reached by the jury. Certainly it did not rise to the magnitude of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">The judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1384-11\">.

The record indicates that this was a first-floor apartment, the intruder\u2019s access to which was gained through an unlocked rear window. Appellant knew Mrs. Young through his friendship with her niece, who lived with her until two weeks prior to the offenses, and appellant had occasionally visited the niece in the room where the combination stayed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">. According to the testimony of this' witness, appellant, whom he knew, knocked on the door to the apartment and was told by the witness that Mrs. Young was not at home. Appellant then went to the rear of the building and very shortly thereafter the witness saw lights go on in the apartment, followed by appellant\u2019s exit therefrom with the combination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1384-23\">.

An understanding by the jury that such was the judge\u2019s purpose was facilitated by his instructions.
