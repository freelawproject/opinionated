The factual heart of appellant\u2019s complaint was the allegation that the railroad had lost all rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the subject lands through abandonment and non-use and the assertion of valid title in appellant. The trial court concluded that appellant had no standing to maintain the action in view of two state district court decisions that had negated appellant\u2019s claims and so dismissed the actions as subject to the rule of <em>res judi-cata,. </em>Both state district court judgments were then on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Since perfection of appeal to \u25a0 this court, the Supreme Court of New Mexico has reversed one of its lower court judgments and stated specifically in the opinion that the issue of abandonment \u201cshall not be deemed res judicata should it be presented in this or any subsequent action.\u201d Timberlake v. Southern Pacific Co., 461 P.2d 903 (decided November 20, 1969). It follows that the premise of the federal district court\u2019s judgment is no longer valid under state law and that the judgment must be vacated and the cause remanded for further consideration in light of the judgment and opinion of the New Mexico Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">It is so ordered. No costs are awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
