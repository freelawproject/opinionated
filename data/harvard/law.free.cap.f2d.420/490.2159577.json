Although storage charges, insurance premiums, and property taxes are normally deductible as ordinary expenses, they are not deductible where they are incurred as an integal part of a capital transaction. The Tax Court\u2019s determination that the pre-payments here made were incurred as part of a capital transaction is essentially a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">On review of the record we cannot say that the factual determination made by the Tax Court is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, and accordingly its Decision will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
