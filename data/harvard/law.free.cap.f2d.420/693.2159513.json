The removal was pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 and the remand order was appealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\u201cAny of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State court may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-16\">\u201c(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof; \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-17\"><em>\u201c(2) </em>For any act Under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">In Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808 at page 824, 86 S.Ct. 1800 at page 1810, 16 L.Ed.2d 944, it was said that the second subsection of Section 1\u2019443 \u201cconfers a privilege of removal only upon federal officers or agents and those authorized to act with or for them in affirmatively executing duties under any federal law providing for equal civil rights.\u201d Here the Attorney General of the United States, as authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, brought an action to compel the school board to desegregate its public schools and to provide equal civil rights to all those attending the schools involved. The board undertook to carry out the directions of the federal court in an order which was authorized by federal civil rights statutes, and was an act under color of authority derived from a law conferring specific rights of racial equality. In its activities the board was acting with and for federal officers in executing their duties under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the state court action seeking to enjoin its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>activities was removable under \u00a7 1443 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The remand order is vacated and the case reinstated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\">. The allegations of the state court petition disclose that it is a direct attack upon the desegregation plan filed in the federal court action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. The history of the civil rights removal statute was considered in Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966), which dealt principally with removability under \u00a7 1443 (1). Section 1443(2) was treated in a companion ease, Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed. 2d 944 (1966). See also Board of Ed. of City of New York v. City-Wide Com. for Integration, 342 F.2d 284 (2 Cir. 1965): People of State of New York v. Galamison, 342 F.2d 255, 8 A.L.R. 3d 263 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 977, 85 S.Ct. 1342, 14 L.Ed.2d 272; O\u2019Keefe v. New York City Board of Elections, 246 F.Supp. 978 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) ; the court in Burns v. Board of School Com\u2019rs of City of Indianapolis, Ind., 302 F.Supp. 309 (S.D.Ind.1969), considered a like case and held it to be removable under \u00a7 1443(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
