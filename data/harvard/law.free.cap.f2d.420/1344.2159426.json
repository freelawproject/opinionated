The case was heard upon appellees\u2019 return to an order to show cause, in which return appellees moved the dismissal of the petition for the writ for want of subject matter jurisdiction or, alternatively, for failure to state a cause of action. The District Court, in a bare order which made no reference to these alternative claims, dismissed the petition. For the reasons set forth hereinafter, this was error; and we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">In September of 1967 appellant enlisted in the Army, and entered upon active duty early in 1968. He successfully applied for Officers\u2019 Candidate School, and emerged from that in November of 1968 as a second lieutenant in the infantry. While serving at Fort Knox as an infantry training officer, appellant asked for a psychiatric examination, which resulted in his being classified by a Medical Board as unsuited for combat. As suggested by his Battalion Commander because of this restriction, appellant sought a transfer to another branch, but his application to this end was denied, and orders were issued assigning appellant to Viet Nam for noncombatant duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While on leave pending shipment abroad, appellant filed with the Military District of Washington at Fort McNair an application for discharge from the Army as one who had become a conscientious objector after enlistment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-21\">Army Regulation No. 635-20, issued January 22, 1969, under the authority of Department of Defense Directive 1300.6, dated May 10, 1968, embodies the policies and procedures to be observed in the case of \u201cmilitary personnel who, by reason of religious training and belief, claim conscientious objection to participation in war in any form.\u201d The general policy is stated to be that consideration will be given to separation requests \u201cwhen such (conscientious) objection develops subsequent to entry into the active military service.\u201d But it is also said that \u201c[rjequests for discharge after entering military service will not be accepted when\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-22\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-23\">(3) Based on essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or on a merely personal moral code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>******</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">As contemplated by the procedure prescribed in AR 635-20, appellant was interviewed by an Army chaplain, an Army psychiatrist, and an officer \u201cin the grade of 0-3 or higher, who is knowledgeable in policies and procedures relating to conscientious objector matters.\u201d Their findings and recommendations were made part of appellant\u2019s application file, which was forwarded to the Adjutant General at Army Headquarters in Washington. There it was reviewed by a board of three officers, and thereafter the Adjutant General notified appellant that, \u201cby order of the Secretary of the Army,\u201d his application was disapproved. The reason given was that \u201c[ejvidence presented indicates your objection to service is based upon a personal moral code and is politically and sociologically oriented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">In his application, appellant related his upbringing in the Jewish faith, to which he continues actively to adhere. His answer to the query in the application form as to the basis of his claim of conscientious objection is set forth in full in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Elsewhere he represents his belief to be that moral force is the only kind of force in which he believes, because it \u201ccomes from God alone.\u201d Attached to his application are letters from two rabbis, including the leader of the congregation with which appellant has been affiliated throughout his life, testifying to the sincerity of his convictions, their direct derivation from his religious training and beliefs, and their legitimacy in terms of a Jewish religious tradition which, although \u201cnot exclusively pacifist in principle,\u201d contains within itself \u201ca strong and authentic strand of thought * * * which supports conscientious objection to war and seeks to limit the exercise of violence of any kind. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">There are letters from school and college teachers, and fellow students, of appellant who report his religious participation and sensitivity while under their observation, and who profess complete confidence in the sincerity of the conclusions to which his religious feelings have brought him. There is a letter from an Army officer \u2014 an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate at Fort Knox\u2014 who counseled appellant about the potentially serious consequences to himself entailed in his decision to persist in conscientious objection, and who concludes his letter by saying that \u201cit is my opinion that his present actions are motivated by his strong personal and religious convictions of objection to participation in war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">The function of the Army psychiatrist who interviewed appellant once his ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>plication was filed was not to do more than make certain that he was free from psychiatric disease and capable of knowing what he was doing. He found that appellant was \u201cmentally responsible, able to distinguish right from wrong and to adhere to the right, has the mental capacity to understand and participate in Board proceedings, and * * * is able to cooperate in his own defense.\u201d The interviewing Army chaplain recommended that appellant\u2019s application be granted; the basis for this recommendation was stated in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdHt\">\u201cI believe that he is completely sincere in declaring himself to be an objector to participation in any type of violence. It is my opinion that Lieutenant Sheldon, who is a sensitive person seeking to establish his own identity and purpose in life, has agonized between a desire to perform his obligation as a citizen and yet live in accordance with his own nature. I believe that his views crystallized when his military assignment as an officer training men for combat clashed with seeds of thought that had been implanted earlier, in his home, his synagogue, in Quaker camps he attended, and in his college. I believe that frustrated attempts to transfer to another Branch (other than his basic, Infantry) led to his growing conviction that he could not, in conscience, be a part of any war effort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-11\">The third interviewing officer characterized appellant as giving \u201cevery evidence of being a very sincere and sensitive person * * * raised in a religious atmosphere * * * \u201d and possessed of a Jewish-oriented higher education and training in philosophy \u201cbecause of his close adherence to the faith of Judaism and his strong belief in God.\u201d This officer, however, found \u201cthe sudden onset of [appellant\u2019s] strong convictions\u201d to be \u201cperplexing.\u201d He thought that there might be more than coincidence in the crystallization of appellant\u2019s doubts after the denial of his branch transfer and his assignment to foreign service. Although he concluded that appellant strongly opposes war and military service,\u201d he doubted that that \u201copposition arises <em>solely </em>(emphasis supplied) from religious convictions and belief in God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-12\">Each of the officers making up the reviewing board at Army Headquarters recommended disapproval. Two of such officers explicitly characterized appellant as \u201csincere\u201d in the convictions he professed, and the third did not question that sincerity. Each, however, expressed the opinion that these convictions were founded upon a personal moral code rather than a religious feeling or belief. Two immediately coupled these expressions with a reference to appellant\u2019s motivation as residing in the circumstances of the branch transfer denial and the orders for Viet Nam.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Department of Defense Directive 1300.6, by reference to which AR 635-20 was issued, reflects a policy determination to extend to persons already within the armed services the rights of conscientious objection conferred by Congress upon those subject to the Selective Service Act. The relevant provision of that statute is Section 6(j) (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j)) which, as revised June 30, 1967, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it is that judicial precedents involving claims to exemption from entry into military service because of conscientious objection are applicable to requests for discharge on the same ground by those who voluntarily entered the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">There is not now before us any dispute between the parties as to the propriety of <em>habeas </em>relief upon a proper showing. Neither are the parties in contention as to the standard by which a court is to weigh the disposition by the military of a claim to the status of a conscientious objector. That standard is the one now identified by Congress in the Selective Service Act of 1967 (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3)) as authorizing judicial scrutiny of draft classifications \u201conly when there is no basis in fact for the classification assigned to such registrant.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">Appellant asserts that his file as it reached Army Headquarters was replete with proof that (1) his inability to serve longer in the Army consistently with his conscience was formulated in good faith and sincerely embraced, and (2) his conscientious objection was rooted in his religious training and beliefs, and rests, in the last analysis, upon the concept he entertains of the necessities of his relationship with God. The Government argues to us, contrarily, that there were \u201cobjective facts present here, <em>i. e., </em>the timing of the application, the psychiatric history, and the transfer to Viet Nam [which] support the conclusions reached by the Army that [appellant\u2019s] claim, though enunciated sincerely, can be traced to his personal abhorrence of violence and emotional reaction to combat command.\u201d In other words, so we are told by the Government, although appellant is concededly sincere in his belief that he must oppose all participation on his part in the military, this objection derives not from religious instinct or conviction but from his innate disaffection with violence and his personal dissatisfaction with the turn taken by his military fortunes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">The Supreme Court has long since declared, however, that the \u201cultimate question in conscientious objector cases is the sincerity of the registrant in objecting, on religious grounds, to participation in war in any form.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Army,, on the record before us, is in the anomalous position of accepting, in one breath, the sincerity of appellant\u2019s professed opposition to war on grounds of conscience but, in the other, asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>that appellant is motivated in reality by a distaste for contact with the violent side of military life. If the Army felt that such \u201cobjective facts\u201d as the timing of the application and the issuance of the Viet Nam orders accounted for appellant\u2019s application, it should have said so in denying it \u2014 and issue would have been joined on the \u201cultimate question\u201d of his sincerity. Instead, it represented to appellant that denial of his application was due to the fact that appellant\u2019s conscientious objection was \u201cbased upon a personal moral code,\u201d and was \u201cpolitically and sociologically oriented.\u201d That is, perhaps, a more graceful way of telling appellant he was faking, but the message is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">We do not think that the conclusion reached and stated by the Army, when accompanied by a concession of appellant\u2019s sincerity, has the requisite basis in fact. The record contains a strong showing of the origins of appellant\u2019s conscientious objection in his lengthy history of religious training and experience, and in the doctrines of his faith. Appellant says that a tendency towards conscientious objection, latent in his religious background, took concrete shape only after close exposure to the realities of military life. The Army does not question the good faith of this assertion. It might have gone the other way, and bluntly stated its belief to be that appellant\u2019s objection was not to war or even to military service in all its forms, but only to his personal transfer to Viet Nam, even in a noncombatant capacity. But the Army did not do that, at least in express terms; and the terms it did use appear to us to be without support in the unchallenged facts appearing in the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-9\">The result we reach here is very much in harmony with, and strongly supported by, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Brooks, </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>and the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Bates v. Commander, First Coast Guard District, 413 F.2d 475 (1969). Although the Government does not appear to make a similar contention here, in <em>Brooks </em>it was argued that release should be denied because the release application there was found to have been based in part \u201cupon personal morals.\u201d The court rejected this argument because it was \u201csatisfied that even if petitioner was motivated in part by a personal moral code, he is still entitled to the exemption because of the unquestioned finding that he was also substantially motivated by views derived from religious training and belief.\u201d It read <em>Seeger </em>as holding that a disqualifying personal belief or motivation is one constituting the sole basis for conscientious objection. <em>See also </em>Fleming v. United States, 344 F.2d 912, 915-916 (10th Cir. 1965). Thus, even if appellant\u2019s religious aversion to military service was reinforced by a personal distaste for it, the genuineness of the first would appear to require its recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">We are not here concerned with the controversy over whether conscientious objection must have a base in traditional religion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant has not relied upon a personal conviction unrelated to divine teachings of a similar character associated with organized religion. His showing was, rather, that his feelings proceed from his acceptance of the God of Judaism and his compulsion to act in accordance with what he conceives to be the will of that divinity. When the Government concedes that appellant\u2019s conscientious objection is sincerely held, we think this record points inescapably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>towards- the conclusion that that objection is grounded in appellant\u2019s religious faith and not in any purely personal code of conduct, or any political or sociological tenet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">Appellant was entitled to the issuance of the writ, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith. In this regard we direct the attention of the District Court to the manner of proceeding suggested by the Fourth Circuit in its disposition of Brooks v. Clifford, note 1 <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1409-11\">. The assertion of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction was derived from appellant\u2019s failure to apply to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records for relief after his discharge was denied. 10 U.S. [C.] \u00a7 1552. Subsequent to the entry of the District Court\u2019s order, appellant made such an application, which was denied after appellees\u2019 main brief was filed in this appeal, pressing the necessity of the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a condition of <em>habeas </em>jurisdiction. By a supplemental brief filed shortly before argument, the Government advised us not only of appellant\u2019s application and its denial, but also of the Government\u2019s independent abandonment of the contention that such action was necessary to clothe the District Court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Brooks v. Clifford, 409 F.2d 700 (4th Cir. 1969), with which compare Craycroft v. Ferrall, 408 F.2d 587 (9th Cir. 1969). But <em>see </em>the Ninth Circuit\u2019s later decision in Krieger v. Terry, 413 F.2d 73 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1409-25\">. A stay of the execution of these orders pending appeal was denied by the District Court, but such relief was granted upon application to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">. A description of the nature of my belief which is the basis of my claim is my belief in the soul and the sense, in me, of the growth of my responsibility to God. This sense of growing responsibility is as important to me as breathing. It is the sense of the soul breathing in my thoughts, of God breathing in my life. Answering questions honestly means answering them myself. There is one God in Judiasm [sic], and one truth, God\u2019s Truth. Accepting anything but this Truth, for me, is rationalization. To rationalize is to worship idols, which, in Judiasm, is to break the covenant with God.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">I went into the Army, and did not attempt to avoid it, because I received notice from my draft board and had questions about the world and my responsibility in the world. I was not a conscientious objector at the time. It is since I have been in military service that I have come to the conclusion that no thought justifies killing a human being. I have come to believe that only God should take the life of a human being. It is after being commissioned in the Infantry, and being assigned to Fort Knox as a Training Officer and being in contact with weapons and having as my mission to train individuals to kill, that I have come to the conclusion that serving in the military and killing men is not the way for me to express my responsibility to God and other human beings. I have come to the conclusion that being a part of the war effort in any way is contributing to the destruction of lives. Even noncombatant duty contributes to the mission of the military and gives tacit consent to its goals. Because of my beliefs I cannot and will not continue to serve in the military.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">. The three recommendations in full are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">Recommend disapproval. Evidence shows officer\u2019s beliefs based on personal moral code not religious beliefs. Documents indicate that this officer\u2019s objections are primarily based on denial of branch transfer and his assignment to RVN. As indicated in the Chaplain\u2019s statement and Interviewing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">s/ [Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">Recommend disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">Application appears to be based on a sincere desire by Lt. Sheldon to do what he feels is absolutely right. I found Lt. Sheldon\u2019s request to be consistent throughout, based on the sequence of events in his life. It is my opinion, however, that the request is based on a personal moral code which prevents participation in killing individuals rather than on religious teachings of his faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">s/ J.

Sheldon is convincingly sincere in his opposition to war and killing, it does not appear to have grown out of his religious convictions. This statement is basically moral and is politically &amp; sociologically oriented. His motivation for making application seems specifically prompted by his failure to get a branch transfer and his receipt of orders to Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-17\">s/ William Lyman Sale, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-18\">Chaplain (OPT) USA</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">. \u201c(j) Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.

It was reaffirmed in the context of conscientious objection in United States v.
