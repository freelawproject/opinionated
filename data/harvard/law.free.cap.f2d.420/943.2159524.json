Accordingly, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this fact in writing. See 5th Cir. R. 18; Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The district judge below approved and adopted the order of the Referee in Bankruptcy denying Stanley McCarty\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. In an earlier successful loan application to the Small Business Administration, McCarty had failed to list among his liabilities a debt owed to his brother. His bankruptcy petition listed the debt as predating the loan application. The referee concluded and the district court agreed that .the omission amounted to a materially false statement under \u00a7 14(c) (3) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c) (3) (1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, McCarty argues that the Referee failed to make a necessary finding of intent to defraud and that the SBA failed to meet the burden of proof necessary to support the denial of a discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">In a very similar case, this Court upheld the actions of a district court \u201con the basis of its [the district court\u2019s] opinion\u201d. Sellers v. Small Business Administration, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 402, aff\u2019g Matter of Sellers, 295 F.Supp. 1354 (S.D.Tex.1968). The district court had ruled that once the Government had proved \u201cthe existence of debts owed by the bankrupt not listed on the financial statement submitted to the S.B.A., certainly the Referee had reasonable grounds for believing that the acts charged in the specification had been committed. Hence, at this stage, the burden of proof rested with the bankrupt.\u201d 295 F.Supp. at 1356. The district court proceeded to affirm the denial of a discharge because the bankrupt\u2019s evidence was \u201cinsufficient to establish the absence of an intent to deceive\u201d. 295 F.Supp. at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">In McCarty\u2019s case, the Referee found that McCarty knew that he owed his brother a debt of $14,180 that he had not divulged to the S.B.A., and that the justification he offered \u2014 that he had the option to consider the debt as either a gift or a loan \u2014 was \u201cimplausible\u201d. The district court found that the record supported the Referee\u2019s conclusions. In our posture as a reviewing court, we do not find these findings \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The proof below amply meets the standards set out in <em>Sellers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c) (3) (1964):</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">The court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has * * * (3) while engaged in business as a sole proprietor, partnership, or as an executive of a corporation, obtained for such business money or property on credit or as an extension or renewal of credit by making or publishing or causing to be made or published in any manner whatsoever a materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition or the financial condition, of such partnership or corporation ; * * * <em>Provided, </em>that if, upon the hearing of an objection to a discharge, tlu&gt; objector shall show to the satisfaction of the court that there are reasonable grounds for; believing that the bankrupt lias committed any of the acts which, under this subdivision, would prevent his discharge in bankruptcy, then the burden of proving that he has not committed any of such acts shall be upon the bankrupt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
