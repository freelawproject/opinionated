ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1377-28\">On August 20 or 21, 1967, an apartment was burglarized, and a saxophone and other items were purloined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 21, a man identifying himself as Wilson Terry pawned the saxophone, signing \u201cWilson Terry\u201d on the pawnbroker\u2019s copy of the ticket evidencing the transaction. The p\u00e1wnbroker\u2019s appraiser spotted appellant in the pawnshop on the following September 18 and, believing him to be the man who had brought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>stolen saxophone in, promptly called the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After conversations with appellant and the manager of the pawnshop, who made a similar identification, the police officers placed appellant under arrest. A search of his person produced a copy of the pawn ticket for the saxophone and identification cards bearing the name \u201cWilson F. Terry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">Indicted in counts of housebreaking<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and grand larceny,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellant stood trial in the District Court before a jury. The real Wilson F. Terry testified that he had lost the identification cards, and denied signing the \u201cWilson Terry\u201d on the pawn ticket. A handwriting expert expressed the opinion that appellant had made that signature,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>and the two employees of the pawnshop reiterated their identifications of appellant as the party who had pawned the saxophone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">As is evident, the Government\u2019s theory that appellant had broken into the apartment and filched the saxophone was based wholly upon an inference from its possession by appellant shortly after it was stolen. Appellant offered no witnesses in his own behalf and, for reasons hereinafter elucidated, did not take the witness stand himself. The prosecuting attorney argued to the jury that it should, and the trial court charged the jury that it might, infer appellant\u2019s guilt of either or both of the offenses charged from unexplained possession of the saxophone so closely on the heels of its theft from the apartment.\u00ae The jury convicted on both counts, and the court sentenced appellant to imprisonment for a maximum term of 12 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-19\"> The principal argument on appeal, and the only contention meriting discussion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is that the court misapplied our Luck<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> doctrine in ruling on appellant\u2019s request for testimonial immunity from impeachment by the use of criminal convictions which he had accumulated. We held in <em>Luck </em>that trial judges have discretion to limit or ban impeachment of that type where \u201cthe cause of truth would be helped more by letting the jury hear the defendant\u2019s story than by the defendant foregoing that opportunity because of the fear of prejudice founded upon a prior conviction.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s challenge thus commands our scrutiny of the record with a view to ascertaining whether the teachings of <em>Luck </em>and its progeny<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were honored in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-20\">At the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief, defense counsel<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>proached the bench and informed the trial judge that he \u201cwould like to put the defendant on the stand if we can have the benefit of the <em>Luck </em>decision. In other words, what I am interested in is not having his record spread before the jury.\u201d Without further inquiry of any sort, the trial judge, citing our Gordon<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> holding, stated that \u201c[ajnything that has to do with cheating and stealing is admissible,\u201d and proceeded at once to examine appellant\u2019s criminal record. Going down the list of past offenses, he excluded one,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but ruled that the Government could use a conviction for housebreaking and larceny, an additional larceny conviction, and three convictions of false pretenses. The judge then concluded the inquiry, appellant elected not to testify and, as we have observed, the case went to the jury on the Government\u2019s evidence alone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">In <em>Gordon,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that \"as a rule of thumb\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> convictions evidencing dishonest conduct go to testimonial credibility while those involving assaultive or violent conduct do not,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the trial judge made that distinction here. <em>Gordon </em>also emphasized other considerations highly relevant to an adjudication on impeachment by prior convictions, but we find no indication that they were assigned a role in this case. One such consideration is the remoteness, in point of time, of a conviction;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> another is its similarity to the offense for which the accused is on trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Still another is the importance, in the search for truth, of giving the triers of fact the benefit of the accused\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here the housebreaking and larceny conviction came in 1959; when the others occurred we know not. Moreover, two of the convictions the judge would have let in were for larceny, one of the offenses with which appellant was charged. And notwithstanding the judge\u2019s elimination of some of the convictions, we discern no effort to weigh the prejudicial effect of impeachment by those remaining upon such testimonial contribution as appellant could have been expected to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">Even more importantly, we have recognized, from early in the <em>Luck </em>era, that \u201cwhere inferences founded upon unexplained acts are likely to be heavily operative, the court\u2019s discretion to let the jury hear the accused\u2019s story, unaccompanied by a recital of his past misdeeds, may play an important part in the achievement of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the case at bar, appellant\u2019s version of the affair, unembarrassed by mention of his previous difficulties with the law, could very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>well have been crucial. The success of the prosecution depended entirely upon the strength of an inference from appellant\u2019s possession of the stolen saxophone that he was the housebreaker who stole it. Unless the fact of possession was refuted or satisfactorily explained \u2014 and ostensibly only appellant could possibly do either \u2014 that fact was \u201clikely to be -heavily operative\u201d against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The Government argues, however, that appellant should not benefit from an application of <em>Luck </em>principles because appellant\u2019s trial counsel made no representation as to what appellant\u2019s testimony would be, or as to the unavailability of other witnesses to establish his defense. We have said many times that it is for defense counsel to invoke Lwcfc,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and to invoke it in a meaningful way,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and this, of course, will necessitate initially some explanation of the theory and testimonial details of the defense where, as usually is the case, they cannot otherwise be made known to the court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> At the same time, we have admonished that, once the <em>Luck </em>issue is raised, defense counsel\u2019s shortcomings <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> do not mitigate the need for an exercise of judicial discretion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Certainly there is nothing to commend a requirement that defense counsel delineate that which is already plainly apparent to all concerned.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">When, after the Government rested in this ease, appellant\u2019s attorney requested the <em>Luck </em>ruling, it was manifest that the Government had hung its entire effort on the inference permitted by an unexplained possession of recently stolen property. It was equally clear that the Government in its endeavor to win the verdict, was forced to ask for an appropriate instruction on that score. In that setting, appellant\u2019s proposed testimony, if it was to be helpful at all, had to be directed toward an explanation of his possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>saxophone, or toward a denial of that possession and an explanation as to how he came to have the pawn ticket. Indeed, in the same monologue which contained his dispositoin of the <em>Luck </em>issue, the trial judge said to defense counsel: \u201cWhat is your defense? He didn\u2019t do it and didn\u2019t go in there and didn\u2019t have it. That is all you can say.\u201d And we realize, as we think the trial judge also should have done, that all too frequently the innocent have no witnesses other than themselves who can - testify on such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">We hold that the circumstances here emphatically enough called upon the trial judge to strike the balance that <em>Luck </em>demands and, in the process, \u201cto make sufficient inquiry to inform himself on the relevant considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We mean, not that all impeachment by appellant\u2019s past record was necessarily to be ruled out, but that a suitable exploration and a sound discretionary exercise became requisite. But since, in some though certainly not in all respects, the Government\u2019s case was strong,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we are not prepared to say that the judge\u2019s omission to do so entitles appellant to a new trial. Any sound disposition of this litigation must follow an inquiry as to what result a proper exercise of <em>Luck </em>discretion would have produced, and whether the failure to achieve that result prejudiced appellant.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Such a probe, in turn necessitates precise knowledge as to what appellant would have said from the witness stand and, in somewhat smaller degree, as to the availability of other witnesses who could have said the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">Accordingly, we remand this case for a <em>Gordon-ty^e </em>hearing<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in which these and any other relevant points may be investigated.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Unless the trial judge, after considering all the circumstances, old and new alike, can say \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that the verdict \u201cwas not substantially swayed by the <em>Luck </em>error,\u201d if any there was, appellant must be awarded a new trial.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1377-18\">. The exact time of the housebreaking and theft \u2014 a matter of some importance here, see Travers v. United States, 118 U.S. App.D.C. 276, 280, 335 F.2d 698, 702 (1964) \u2014 is uncertain.

Appellant presents two additional claims.

United States, <em>supra </em>note 6. The instruction did not meet all of the standards we recently laid down in <em>Pendergrast, </em>but there was no objection to it and we do not' consider its shortcomings such plain error as to justify reversal.

One Samuel R. Pillow, a resident of the District of Columbia, left the city for a period of nine days. During that time his apartment was burglarized and he lost $700 worth of personal property including a saxophone valued at $175. Subsequently, Mr. Pillow alerted the police department of his loss. The police located the saxophone in a pawn shop in the northwest section of Washington.

Less than one month later the store attendant called the police and notified them that the person who pawned the saxophone was again in the store. The police arrived at the store and placed appellant under arrest. When appellant was searched incident to this arrest the police discovered on his person the other half of the pawn ticket bearing the name \u201cWilson Terry.\u201d At trial, Wilson Terry testified that he had lost the various identification cards previously mentioned and that he had not signed the pawn ticket. Both attendants at the store positively identified appellant as the person who pawned the saxophone. In addition, a handwriting expert testified that it was his opinion that appellant\u2019s signature matched the signature of Wilson Terry on the pawn ticket. Appellant did not take the stand and offered neither witnesses nor evidence in his behalf. Needless to say, the jury convicted appellant as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">On these facts the majority reverses appellant\u2019s conviction and remands for a <em>Luck</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>-Gordon</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing to determine whether the verdict was \u201csubstantially swayed by the <em>Luck </em>error.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear from the record that the evidence against appellant is overwhelming and that any <em>Luck </em>error by the trial judge surely must be classified as \u201charmless\u201d under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>accord, </em>Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). Under my reading of the relevant authority in the <em>Luck </em>area, it is-not at all clear that the appellant in this case ever meaningfully invoked the rule, since he proffered absolutely no defense when queried by the trial judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I believe that the court need not reach its ponderous consideration of any Luck problem since even if the trial judge did not conduct a completely proper <em>Luck </em>hearing any error was clearly not prejudicial under both Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) and <em>Chapman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\">Since appellant refused to take the stand, appellant\u2019s defense was presented to the jury by his counsel in his opening statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">[I] t is our contention that the defendant did not pawn the saxophone nor . did he enter the house and take it out (Tr. 88).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">It is my opinion that the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt is so overwhelming that whether he took the stand or whether his past convictions were introduced are factors which have a <em>de minimis </em>effect upon the conviction which he now seeks to vacate. After reading thoroughly the majority\u2019s exercise in judicial time-wasting, one must wonder exactly what appellant\u2019s defense will be on the remand. Given this new opportunity, however, perhaps he will be able to explain: (1) if he did not enter the apartment, how he came into possession of the saxophone, and (2) if he did not pawn the saxophone, why he had the other half of the pawn ticket in his possession and why his handwriting matched that on the pawn ticket. The majority might do well to answer these questions for the members of the public who are not well versed in all the technical nuances of the criminal law and who wonder why our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>trial courts have such backlogs and delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">Our court dockets are crowded and this court has repeatedly emphasized the necessity and desirability of speedy trials for all defendants. Yet, with this in mind and for reasons more philosophical than legal, the majority' remands this case to the already busy district judge with directions to hold a hearing at which appellant can proffer his \u201calibi.\u201d I must dissent from this further impediment to the achievement of justice in this case despite my acknowledgment of the submissive fatalism with which bench and bar calmly accept the inevitability of endless delay in the termination of criminal prosecutions. I feel it is essential that appellate courts develop an eye for the forest of reality as a necessary substitute for the prevailing sense of the trees of abstract theory. Since my reading of the record discloses insurmountable evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt and no \u201cerror * * * affect[ing] substantial rights\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of appellant, I would affirm his conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">.
