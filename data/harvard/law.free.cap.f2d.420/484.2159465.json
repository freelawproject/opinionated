See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-24\">The National Labor Relations Board found that Mrs. Baird\u2019s Bread, of Dallas, Texas, had violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by coer-cively interrogating L. T. Mason about his Union activities and that \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act had been violated in the demotion of L. T. Mason for similar reasons, 171 N.L.R.B. No. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-25\">The sole issue on this petition for enforcement is whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-26\">Much of the evidence, and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom, are in direct conflict. Never.the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>less, taking into consideration the credibility determinations and choice of inferences which devolve upon the Board, we have no doubt that the findings are amply supported. See, in particular, N. L. R. B. v. Gibbs Corporation, 5 Cir., 1962, 297 F.2d 649, 651; N. L. R. B. v. Monroe Equipment Company, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 559, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It necessarily follows that the Order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
