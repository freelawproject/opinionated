Hunter\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Plunter, who is imprisoned after conviction of first degree manslaughter, claims: (1) that he was deprived of a fair trial when the prosecutor informed the jury in his opening statement that Hunter had previously been convicted of a felony similar to the count in the indictment relating to use of a dangerous weapon, former N.Y.Penal Law, Consol. Laws, c. 40, \u00a7 1897(1); (2) that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to provide him with a free copy of the trial transcript although one was available to retained counsel who represented Hunter on his appeal in the State court; and (3) that the state trial court stenographer\u2019s failure to transcribe the opening and closing statements at the trial denied him due process of law. For the reasons stated in the opinion of Judge Frankel, 307 F.Supp. 1023 (S.D.N.Y.1969), we hold that the petition was properly denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
