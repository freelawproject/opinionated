Dade County School Board, etc. et al., 303 F.Supp. 1068. Appellant here attacks only a segment of the \u201cInterim Plan\u201d approved by the Court below; nevertheless it is apparent from the record before us that, without passing on the merits of the present limited appeal, the cause must be reversed and remanded for immediate compliance by the lower Court with changed decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">Alexander v.

Holmes County, is to shift the burden from the standpoint of time for converting to unitary school systems. The shift is from a status of litigation to one of unitary operation pending litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">We reverse and remand this case with directions to the District Court to enter an order in conformity with all terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>provisions and conditions (including times) specified by this Court in <em>Singleton, </em>supra, parts I and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The mandate in this cause shall issue forthwith.

Under the stringent requirements of Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1989, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19, which this Court has carried out in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 417 F.2d 852, (5th Cir., 1969), this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school segregation cases have to be suitably adapted to assure that each system, whose case is before us, \u201cbegin immediately to operate as unitary school systems\u201d. Upon consideration of the record, the Court has proceeded to dispose of this case as an extraordinary matter. Buie 2, FBAP.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
