Thereafter, on October 31, the court imposed sentences totalling 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Petitioner alleges that, on the day of his plea, his attorney drew him aside in the courtroom, and stated that \u201c25 years was the best that he could do for me.\u201d Immediately upon sentencing, his attorney informed the court that he and the county attorney \u201chad an understanding * * * that I would get 25 years. Mr. Harrod [the county attorney] stepped forward and said he agreed to 25 or more.\u201d The court did not alter the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The journal entry does not reflect this alleged colloquy, but does disclose that prior to sentencing, both of petitioner\u2019s attorneys presented argument in mitigation of punishment, and represented to the court what would be the testimony of certain witnesses bearing on mitigation were they called to testify. After sentencing, defense counsel moved to withdraw the pleas. This motion was denied, and although a notice of appeal was filed, none was ever perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Mr. Harrod, the county attorney, testified that it was his policy, unlike that of his predecessor (who was one of Well-nitz\u2019 two attorneys) not to make sentence recommendations to the district judge. Instead his practice, followed in this case, was to submit to the sentencing judge with the approval of defense counsel, a form styled \u201ca case summary sheet\u201d in which the arresting agency could, if it wished, offer any information about the case and remarks regarding the sentence to be imposed which it thought needful and appropriate. The summary in this case recited Welenitz\u2019 admission of 27 robberies in Oklahoma City over a seven-month period, and the opinion of one Lt. Miller that \u201cthis subject should have not less than 25 years in the State Penitentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Petitioner admitted that he knew the charged offenses were capital crimes, and that he understood, when he appeared to plead, that he \u201ccould get the chair.\u201d He did not question his attorney\u2019s statement that \u201c25 years was the best he could do,\u201d but \u201cassumed\u201d that a maximum term of 25 years had been agreed upon. Petitioner\u2019s attorneys knew of Harrod\u2019s policy and recalled no negotiations with him for a recommendation in exchange for a plea of guilty. Neither recalled making the statement upon which petitioner bases his claim, or seeking to withdraw the pleas after sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\"><em>\u201cA </em>guilty plea, if induced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act, is void.\u201d Machriboda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487 at 493, 82 S.Ct. 510 at 513, 7 L.Ed. 2d 473 (1962). The ultimate determination to be made is whether the plea was coerced or otherwise invalid. United States ex rel. Rosa v. Follette, 395 F.2d 721 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 892, 89 S.Ct. 216, 21 L.Ed.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">Certainly, if an attorney recklessly promises his client that a specific sentence will follow upon a guilty plea, or otherwise unfairly holds out an assurance of leniency in exchange for a confession of guilt, the question may arise whether such assurances were coercive, or whether such representation may be deemed constitutionally ineffective. Brown v. Beto, 377 F.2d 950 (5th Cir. 1967). However, an attorney may offer his client a prediction, based upon his experience or instinct, of the sentence possibilities the accused should weigh in determining upon a plea. An erroneous sentence estimate by defense counsel does not render a plea involuntary. Bailey v. United States, 312 F.2d 679 (10th Cir. 1963); United States ex rel. Bullock v. Warden, 408 F.2d 1326 (4th Cir. 1969); United States v. Horton, 334 F.2d 153 (2d Cir. 1964). And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>a defendant\u2019s erroneous expectation, based on his attorney\u2019s erroneous estimate, likewise does not render a plea involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">After hearing the testimony of petitioner, his two attorneys, and the prosecutor, the district court determined that Wellnitz\u2019 pleas of guilty were \"absolutely voluntary.\u201d Its finding is not clearly erroneous and must be sustained. Linebarger v. State of Oklahoma, 404 F.2d 1092 (10th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 938, 89 S.Ct. 1218, 22 L.Ed.2d 470; Lattin v. Cox, 355 F.2d 397 (10th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
