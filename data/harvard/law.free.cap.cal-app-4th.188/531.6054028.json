Morrell III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>(collectively referred to as defendants) for invasion of privacy and abuse of process. Mallard\u2019s claims were based on defendants\u2019 conduct of seeking discovery of her mental health records by subpoenaing third party health care providers, in preparation of Progressive\u2019s defense against Mallard\u2019s uninsured motorist claim. Mallard served Morrell but not Progressive with service of process, and, in response, Morrell filed an anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion to strike the complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. (All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.) The trial court granted the anti-SLAPP motion, dismissed the entire complaint against defendants with prejudice, and awarded Morrell attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We affirm the order granting Morrell\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. Insurance Code section 11580.2 requires that automobile insurance policies include a provision whereby the insured and the insurer agree to submit uninsured motorist claim disputes to contractual arbitration and also expressly authorizes the use of subpoenas in connection with such proceedings. We hold the use of subpoenas to conduct discovery in the context of a contractual arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim dispute under the Insurance Code constitutes a writing in connection with \u201cany other official proceeding authorized by law,\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). Morrell thus met his burden of demonstrating the acts underlying the complaint arose from protected activity. As Mallard failed to meet the burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on the complaint, the trial court did not err by granting the anti-SLAPP motion as to Morrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing Mallard\u2019s claims against Progressive, however, because Progressive was never served in the action, did not appear before the trial court, and did not make an anti-SLAPP motion on its own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We also affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting Morrell\u2019s motion for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c). As described in detail <em>post, </em>Mallard failed to show the trial court abused its discretion in awarding mandatory fees under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Progressive issued an automobile insurance policy to Mallard, which included coverage up to $5,000 for payment of and reimbursement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>medical expenses incurred as a result of a motor vehicle accident. During the policy period, on April 29, 2005, Mallard was involved in an automobile accident, which Mallard contended caused her to incur medical expenses exceeding $5,000. She asserted an uninsured motorist claim because the driver of the other car involved in the accident did not have liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Attorney Morrell was retained by Progressive with regard to Mallard\u2019s claim. Morrell propounded form interrogatories to Mallard on Progressive\u2019s behalf. In her verified responses to the form interrogatories, Mallard asserted claims of injuries involving her neck, arm, wrists, and back. She also asserted she had difficulty sleeping, and suffered \u201c[sjhock\u201d and \u201c[njervous anxiety.\u201d In addition, she stated she was pursuing a claim for loss of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As pertinent to the issues on appeal, Mallard\u2019s mental health records were subpoenaed from health care providers identified in her verified responses. Mallard\u2019s counsel contacted Morrell and requested that Morrell withdraw the subpoenas or he would seek a protective order ex parte. Morrell did not withdraw the subpoenas and Mallard\u2019s counsel did not file a motion for a protective order or a motion to quash any of the subpoenas. Mallard did not otherwise object in court to the subpoenas as seeking privileged matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Mallard petitioned the trial court \u201cto appoint a fair and impartial arbitrator\u201d to resolve her uninsured motorist claim dispute with Progressive on the ground Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f) requires that such disputes be resolved by arbitration and the parties had \u201cbeen unable to agree upon a suitable arbitrator.\u201d The trial court appointed an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Mallard filed a complaint alleging claims for invasion of privacy and abuse of process against defendants, based on the act of subpoenaing third parties to obtain Mallard\u2019s mental health records. Mallard served only Morrell with the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Morrell filed an anti-SLAPP motion to strike the complaint, which was opposed by Mallard. The trial court granted the anti-SLAPP motion and ordered the complaint dismissed with prejudice as to both defendants. Mallard appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The trial court granted Morrell\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs, awarding him $13,756.64 in attorney fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c). Mallard separately appealed from the trial court\u2019s order awarding Morrell attorney fees and costs. On this court\u2019s own motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Mallard\u2019s appeal from the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion and Mallard\u2019s appeal from the order awarding Morrell attorney fees were consolidated for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The Trial Court Did Not Err by Granting the Anti-SLAPP Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\n<em>Section 425.16 and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\u201cSection 425.16, subdivision (b)(1) requires the court to engage in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken \u2018in furtherance of the [defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u2019 as defined in the statute. [Citation.] If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim. Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the trial court in making these determinations considers \u2018the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].) \u201c \u2018The defendant has the burden on the first issue, the threshold issue; the plaintiff has the burden on the second issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kajima Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 921, 928 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 187].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">We independently review the trial court\u2019s order granting the anti-SLAPP motion de novo. <em>(Flatley </em>v. <em>Mauro </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 325-326 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2].) \u201c \u2018We consider \u201cthe pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits . . . upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d [Citation.] However, we neither \u201cweigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\n<em>Morrell Carried His Burden of Demonstrating the Acts Underlying the Complaint Arose from Protected Activity Within the Meaning of Section 425.16, Subdivision (b)(1).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">To carry the initial burden in bringing an anti-SLAPP motion, \u201c \u2018[t]he only thing the defendant needs to establish to invoke the [potential] protection of the SLAPP statute is that the challenged lawsuit arose from an act on the part of the defendant in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 61.) Section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2) provides that an act \u201c \u2018in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech\u2019 \u201d includes a \u201cwritten or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Here, Mallard\u2019s claims are entirely based on Morrell\u2019s alleged conduct, as Progressive\u2019s counsel, of subpoenaing third party health care providers under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f), to obtain Mallard\u2019s mental health records to defend against her uninsured motorist claim. Mallard does not contend any of the subject subpoenas fails to qualify as a writing within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). Morrell\u2019s alleged conduct was not made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body. (See <em>Century 21 Chamberlain &amp; Associates v. Haberman </em>(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1, 8 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 249] <em>(Century 21) </em>[\u201cArbitration is not a judicial proceeding\u2014it is an alternative thereto[;] \u2018[arbitration claims ... are not filed in <em>courts </em>and they do not initiate <em>judicial </em>proceedings.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We therefore consider whether Morrell\u2019s alleged conduct was made in connection with an issue under consideration in an official proceeding authorized by law within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). Mallard\u2019s arguments on appeal assume the subject subpoenas were issued \u201cin connection with\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(2)) contractual arbitration required under Insurance Code section 11580.2 to resolve her uninsured motorist claim dispute with Progressive; she does not argue otherwise. Therefore, the issue we address, <em>post, </em>is whether contractual arbitration under Insurance Code section 11580.2 constitutes an official proceeding authorized by law within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In <em>Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at page 9, a panel of this court explained: \u201cWhen nongovernmental entities are involved, courts have limited \u2018official proceeding\u2019 anti-SLAPP protection to (1) quasi-judicial proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>that are part of a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 statutory licensing scheme and \u2018subject to judicial review by administrative mandate\u2019 [citation], and (2) proceedings \u2018established by statute to address a particular type of dispute\u2019 [citations].\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Philipson &amp; Simon v. Gulsvig </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 347, 358 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 504] [\u201c[W]e have little trouble concluding that the initiation of a State Bar-sponsored fee arbitration proceeding is likewise covered; after all, it is an official proceeding established by statute to address a particular type of dispute.\u201d].) For the reasons we explain <em>post, </em>we hold that Morrell\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct occurred in connection with an issue under consideration by an official proceeding authorized by law within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2), because it occurred in the context of statutorily mandated contractual arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.2, every automobile liability insurance policy that covers bodily injury must also provide coverage for bodily injury damages caused by an uninsured motorist. In <em>Pilimai v. Farmers Ins. Exchange Co. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 133, 140 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 760, 137 P.3d 939] <em>(Pilimai), </em>the California Supreme Court stated; \u201cInsurance Code section 11580.2 governs the provision of uninsured and underinsured motorist arbitration. As we explained in <em>Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178]...: \u2018At its core, in Insurance Code section 11580.2, the law states that, generally, an automobile liability insurance policy that an insurer issues or delivers to an insured owner or operator covering damages that a third party shall be legally entitled to. recover for bodily injury from the insured owner or operator shall also cover damages that the insured owner or operator shall be legally entitled to recover for bodily injury from an uninsured owner or operator. [Citation.] In this aspect, its purpose is to require a \u201ctype of self-protection\u201d on the part of insured owners or operators. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As further stated in <em>Pilimai, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at page 140, Insurance Code section 11580.2 mandates contractual arbitration of uninsured motorist claim disputes. The <em>Pilimai </em>court explained: \u201c \u2018[I]n Insurance Code section 11580.2, the law states that such an automobile liability insurance policy <em>shall </em>also \u201cprovide that the determination as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to recover damages, and if so entitled, the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer or, in the event of disagreement, by arbitration\u201d\u2014meaning <em>contractual </em>arbitration. [Citation.] In <em>this </em>aspect, its purpose is to offer a means of resolving disputes that is more expeditious and less expensive than litigation. [Citations.] <em>Its beneficiaries include the insurer and the insured, </em>who are each thereby given a right against litigating these issues. [Citation.] <em>But they also include the courts themselves, which are thereby freed from entertaining such litiga</em>tion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pilimai, supra, </em>at p. 140, first, fourth, and fifth italics added; see <em>Brehm </em>v. <em>21st Century Ins. Co. </em>(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1243 [83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 410] [the contractual arbitration provision for uninsured and underinsured motorist claim disputes in an insurer\u2019s policy \u201cis mandated by the statutory scheme\u201d requiring uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage]; Cal. Uninsured Motorist Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2010) \u00a7 1.60, p. 51 [Cal.\u2019s uninsured motorist law requires all automobile liability insurance policies to provide for contractual arbitration of disputes between insurers and insureds regarding liability, damages, or both].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f) specifically authorizes the use of subpoenas and other discovery devices in litigating uninsured motorist claim disputes through contractual arbitration by stating in relevant part: <em>\u201cThe arbitration shall be deemed to be a proceeding and the hearing before the arbitrator shall be deemed to be the trial of an issue therein for purposes of issuance of a subpoena by an attorney of a party to the arbitration under Section 1985 of the Code of Civil Procedure. </em>Title 4 (commencing with Section 2016.010) of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable to these determinations, and all rights, remedies, obligations, liabilities and procedures set forth in Title 4 (commencing with Section 2016.010) of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be available to both the insured and the insurer at any time after the accident, both before and after the commencement of arbitration . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Insurance Code section 11580.2 requires the submission of uninsured motorist claim disputes to contractual arbitration for resolution, \u201cwhich generally results in a binding and final decision\u201d <em>(Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 338 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178]), and authorizes the issuance of subpoenas in such proceedings. Therefore, Morrell carried his burden of showing defendants\u2019 use of subpoenas to conduct discovery in the preparation of Progressive\u2019s defense against Mallard\u2019s uninsured motorist claim constituted a writing in connection with \u201cany other official proceeding authorized by law\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Citing <em>Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at page 5, Mallard argues Morrell\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct is not protected under the anti-SLAPP law because it occurred in the context of a \u201cprivate contractual arbitration,\u201d which does not qualify as an official proceeding under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). Mallard\u2019s argument is without merit because the arbitration of uninsured motorist claim disputes under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f) does not constitute a \u201cprivate contractual arbitration\u201d as that term is used in <em>Century 21.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\"><em>Century 21 </em>did not involve or address contractual arbitration under Insurance Code section 11580.2. In <em>Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>pages 5-6, the trial court denied an anti-SLAPP motion challenging claims which were based on a client\u2019s demand to arbitrate her claim of negligent marketing of real property against her realtors. In affirming the denial of the anti-SLAPP motion, the appellate court held, \u201cthe anti-SLAPP statute does not protect the act of initiating private contractual arbitration\u201d because such' arbitration is \u201ca private alternative to a judicial proceeding,\u201d and \u201cis not an \u2018official proceeding\u2019 because it is a nongovernmental activity not reviewable by administrative mandate or required by statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further stated its holding applied to \u201conly private contractual arbitration,\u201d clarifying that \u201c[arbitration required by law may be subject to anti-SLAPP protection.\u201d <em>(Century 21, supra, </em>at p. 8, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>Pilimai, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at page 141, the California Supreme Court, reiterating its holding in <em>Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 332, stated that \u201carbitration pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.2 is a form of contractual arbitration governed by the CAA [(California Arbitration Act)] . . . . because the uninsured motorist coverage law requires an automobile liability insurance policy, which is a contract [citation], to provide for arbitration.\u2019 \u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Pilimai, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at page 137, however, did not address the applicability of the anti-SLAPP law to the arbitration of uninsured motorist claim disputes under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As discussed <em>ante, </em>unlike the privately negotiated arbitration agreement at issue in <em>Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th 1, the parties here were not simply statutorily required to submit claims to arbitration pursuant to their private agreement to arbitrate, they were <em>statutorily required to contractually agree </em>to submit any dispute regarding uninsured motorist claims to contractual arbitration under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f). Therefore, they were statutorily required to give up the right to resolve any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>dispute in a court of law, absent an exception to the enforcement of the contractual arbitration provision such as waiver or consolidation of the matter with a pending court action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>Pilimai, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 140 [noting the beneficiaries of Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2 include the courts which are \u201c \u2018freed from entertaining such litigation\u2019 \u201d].) Arbitration under these circumstances is \u201crequired by statute\u201d within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP law. <em>(Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at p. 9.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Mallard also contends Morrell was without standing to file an antiSLAPP motion on his own behalf because \u201che was only a helper to the party which actually had the right to petition.\u201d Mallard\u2019s argument is without merit because an attorney representing a client in litigation may invoke the anti-SLAPP statute to challenge claims alleged against him or her. <em>(Briggs v.

County of Shasta, supra, </em>at pp. 961-962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">As Mallard has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating a possibility of prevailing on her claims, the trial court did not err by granting Morrell\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>We Reverse the Trial Court\u2019s Order Dismissing Mallard\u2019s Claims Against Progressive.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">After granting Morrell\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court dismissed Mallard\u2019s claims against defendants, even though Progressive had not been served in the case, much less filed an anti-SLAPP motion on its own behalf. Thus, the trial court erred by dismissing Mallard\u2019s claims against Progressive, solely based on Morrell\u2019s successful anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Attorney Fees Order</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Section 425.16, subdivision (c) makes an award of attorney fees and costs to a defendant who prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion mandatory. <em>(Ketchum v. Moses </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735].) We review the amount of attorney fees awarded for abuse of discretion. <em>(Christian Research Institute v. Alnor </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1322 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 866].) An attorney fee award will not be set aside \u201cabsent a showing that it is manifestly excessive in the circumstances.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>(Children\u2019s Hospital &amp; Medical Center v. Bont\u03ac </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 782 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">On appeal, Mallard challenges the trial court\u2019s order granting Morrell attorney fees under the anti-SLAPP statute, on the ground the motion should have been denied as untimely because it was filed \u201cmore than ... 15 days after the judgment was entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Under rule 3.1702(b) of the California Rules of Court, a motion seeking fees following an order granting an anti-SLAPP motion must be served and filed within the time limits for filing a notice of appeal. (Weil et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2010) f 7:1185, p. 7(H)-53 (rev. # 1, 2009).) Under California Rules of Court, rule 8.104(a) and (f), a notice of appeal must be filed on or before 60 days after service of a document entitled \u201cNotice of Entry\u201d of the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion by the superior court clerk or a party; otherwise, the notice of appeal must be filed on or before 180 days after the entry of the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The record does not contain a document entitled \u201cNotice of Entry\u201d of the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion, served by either the superior court clerk or a party, and Mallard does not contend otherwise. The motion for attorney fees was filed well before the 180th day following the court\u2019s order granting the anti-SLAPP motion. Hence, the motion for attorney fees was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Mallard also contends the trial court abused its discretion in granting Morrell\u2019s motion for attorney fees by failing to consider Mallard\u2019s opposition to the motion. The record shows the trial court permitted Mallard to file an untimely opposition, and considered her arguments opposing the motion for attorney fees at the hearing on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Mallard further contends the award of attorney fees was excessive. Mallard does not identify which fees she considers inappropriate or provide any explanation for her argument. \u201cThe assertion [that] is unaccompanied by any citation to the record or any explanation of which fees were unreasonable or duplicative\u201d is insufficient to disturb the trial court\u2019s discretionary award of attorney fees. <em>(Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1248 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Mallard has failed to show the trial court abused its discretion in granting Morrell\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The order dismissing Mallard\u2019s claims against Progressive is reversed.

Although section 1281.2 <em>\u201cgenerally </em>mandates a trial court to compel\u201d contractual arbitration, it \u201cmay decline to do so\u201d if (1) \u201cthe petitioning party has waived its right\u201d; (2) \u201cgrounds exist to \u2018revoke\u2019 the underlying arbitration agreement by rescission\u201d; or (3) \u201cthere is an issue of law or fact common to the arbitration and a pending action or proceeding with a third party and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings thereon\u201d in which case the court may consolidate the matters. <em>(Mercury Ins.

The Supreme Court held in that case the trial court had the authority \u201cto consolidate a contractual arbitration proceeding between an insurer and an insured as to uninsured motorist coverage in the insured\u2019s pending action against third parties\u2014that is, to join the insurer as a defendant as to uninsured motorist coverage issues\u2014for all purposes, including trial, in order to avoid conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 345.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> In <em>Century 21, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at page 9, the appellate court stated, \u201c[t]he bare fact that statutes govern arbitration (\u00a7 1280 et seq.) does not mean arbitration is subject to anti-SLAPP protection. Statutes govern nonjudicial foreclosure, but that is not an \u2018official proceeding authorized by law.\u2019 [Citation.] Statutes also govern stop notices, but such notices do not constitute \u2018 \u201cofficial proceeding^] authorized by law,\u201d \u2019 either.\u201d Unlike the statutory requirement that the parties agree to submit to contractual arbitration for the resolution of uninsured motorist claim disputes, \u201c[n]onjudicial foreclosure merely provides a nonjudicial, private <em>alternative </em>to judicial foreclosure.\u201d <em>(Garretson </em>v. <em>Post </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1521 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 230], italics added.)
