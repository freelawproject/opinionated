We conclude that such language does not revive a previous order that has become final and is nonappealable. It does not turn an otherwise nonappealable order into an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Appellant Shaun R., a minor, challenges the imposition of several conditions of probation, five of which are gang related, in two Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 proceedings. After a contested jurisdictional hearing, the court sustained the allegations of the prosecution\u2019s fourth petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>involving the minor and found that the minor had committed the following offenses; attempted auto burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 459, 460, subd. (b), a felony);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> misdemeanor vandalism (\u00a7 594, subds. (a), (b)(1)); and misdemeanor exhibiting a deadly weapon (\u00a7 417, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">At a disposition hearing in 2009, the court ordered the minor to remain in custody at juvenile hall, pending an opening at a designated group home, and imposed numerous conditions of probation, including conditions that prohibit the use of drugs or alcohol, association with gang members, and other gang-related activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">On appeal, the minor challenges the 2009 disposition order and disposition orders issued in 2008 in another case. He contends that certain conditions of his probation are vague and overbroad because they (1) fail to give fair notice of their inconsistencies with probation conditions imposed in previous orders of probation; (2) do not contain a knowledge requirement; (3) do not define the terms \u201cgang\u201d and \u201cgang-related\u201d; (4) infringe on his right of free expression; and (5) are otherwise overbroad or vague. The Attorney General agrees that some of the conditions in the 2009 order must be modified. However, he argues that some of the conditions that the minor has placed at issue, which were imposed as part of the 2008 disposition orders in a previous case, are not properly before this court. We conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to address the minor\u2019s arguments regarding the probation conditions imposed in 2008. With regard to the 2009 disposition order, we modify a number of the probation conditions, and, as so modified, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">\n<em>Prior Offenses and Petitions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Since the age of 10, the minor has appeared before the juvenile court on a variety of charges, most of which were handled informally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">In June 2008, at age 15, the minor was declared a ward of the court and placed on probation after admitting allegations in his third Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition (case No. 302JV25631C; hereafter Petition C), which charged the minor with carrying a concealed dirk or dagger (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(4), a felony), resisting arrest (\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1), a misdemeanor), and exhibiting a deadly weapon (\u00a7 417, subd. (a)(1), also a misdemeanor). When the minor was arrested on the charges in Petition C, he was under the influence of alcohol, was wearing gang clothing, had gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>references on his cell phone, had two tattoos, and told the officers he had been \u201cnorte\u201d for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">At the disposition hearing in 2008, the court returned the minor to the custody of his mother on probation under the supervision of the probation officer and imposed several conditions of probation. The probation conditions are documented in two written orders in which the court ordered that the minor (1) not possess or use drugs or alcohol (Condition 15/21);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) not associate with probationers, parolees, or gang members (Condition 18/24); (3) not frequent areas of gang activity or participate in gang activity (Condition 19/25); (4) not possess, wear, or display gang clothing or gang paraphernalia (Condition 20/26); (5) not obtain any new gang-related tattoos (Condition 21/27); and (6) not use or possess dangerous or deadly weapons (Condition 22/28). We shall hereafter refer to the disposition orders on Petition C as the \u201c2008 Orders.\u201d Although the minor did not appeal the 2008 Orders, he challenges some of the probation conditions imposed at that time in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">\n<em>Current Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">In the current case, the minor\u2019s fourth Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition (case No. 302JV25631D; hereafter Petition D), the prosecution charged the minor with attempted auto burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 459, 460, subd. (b), a felony), vandalism of $400 or more (\u00a7 594, subds. (a), (b)(1), a misdemeanor), and exhibiting a deadly weapon (\u00a7 417, subd. (a)(1), a misdemeanor) arising from an incident on July 13, 2009. The minor was 16 years old at the time of the offenses. One of the victims saw the minor walking around the victims\u2019 car with a metal object similar to a \u201cslim jim.\u201d The victims then heard the sound of breaking glass. A few minutes later, when one of the victims confronted the minor and his cohorts in the parking lot, the minor threatened him with a hammer. The victims discovered that the side view mirrors on their car were broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">After a contested jurisdictional hearing, the court found the allegations of the petition true beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>The minor subsequently told his probation officer that he had been affiliated with the Norteno gang for seven years and that he \u201cjumped in\u201d at age nine. By July 2009, the minor had acquired additional tattoos: (1) a single dot on the index finger of his right hand and four dots on the fingers of his left hand, signifying the number 14, which is associated with the Norteno gang, and (2) a \u201c \u2018Northern Star\u2019 \u201d on the right side of his neck. He admitted to his probation officer that he violated probation by wearing gang clothing, associating with gang members, violating curfew, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">At the disposition hearing in November 2009, the court ordered the minor to remain under the custody of the probation officer and reside in a group home until January 2010, at which time a family reunification plan would be reassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The court imposed several conditions of probation, six of which are at issue on appeal. The court ordered that the minor (1) \u201cnot use, possess, or be under the influence of alcohol or any form of controlled or illegal substance without the legal right to do so and submit to drug and substance abuse testing as directed by the Probation Officer\u201d (Condition 8); (2) \u201cnot knowingly associate with any person whom he knows, to be a probationer, parolee, or gang member\u201d (Condition 14); (3) \u201cnot knowingly participate in any gang activity and/or visit any areas of gang-related activity that are known to him unless he has prior permission from his Probation Officer\u201d (Condition 15); (4) \u201cnot knowingly possess, display or wear any insignia, clothing, logos, emblems, badges, or buttons or display any gang signs or gestures which he knows to be gang-related\u201d (Condition 16); (5) \u201cnot obtain any new tattoos that he knows to be gang-related\u201d (Condition 17); and (6) \u201cnot knowingly post, display, or transmit any symbols or information that the minor knows to be gang-related\u201d (Condition 18). Unlike the 2008 Orders, the disposition order on Petition D did not contain a \u201cno weapons\u201d condition. The court also ordered that \u201cAll previous Orders of the Court not inconsistent with today\u2019s Orders remain in full force and effect.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall hereafter refer to the disposition order on Petition D as the \u201c2009 Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">In this appeal from the judgment on Petition D, the minor challenges probation conditions imposed in the 2008 Orders on Petition C, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>conditions imposed in the 2009 Order on Petition D. The Attorney General argues that the conditions imposed in the 2008 Orders are not properly challenged in this appeal, since the minor could have but did not appeal those orders in 2008. As we explain, we agree that the 2008 Orders are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">With regard to the minor\u2019s challenges to the conditions imposed in the 2009 Order, the Attorney General agrees that some of the conditions must be modified. We will address each of the conditions that the minor has placed at issue from that order separately. We will also address the minor\u2019s contention that the 2009 Order is vague because it fails to inform the minor of the ways in which it conflicts with the 2008 Orders. We begin by discussing the appealability of the 2008 Orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">I. <em>Appealability of 2008 Orders on Petition C</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">The minor attacks the 2008 Orders on several specific grounds, arguing (1) that Conditions 15/21, 21/27, and 22/28 lack a knowledge requirement; (2) that Conditions 18/24, 19/25, 20/26, and 21/27 fail to define the terms \u201cgang\u201d and \u201cgang-related\u201d; (3) that the terms \u201cfrequent\u201d and \u201careas\u201d in Condition 19/25 are vague and overbroad; (4) that Conditions 20/26 and 21/27 violate his right of free expression; and (5) that Condition 22/28 (the no weapons condition) is vague. The minor also argues that the 2009 Order is vague and overboard because the wording of the 2009 Order conflicts with that of the 2008 Orders. He generally \u201cdisputes the validity of all the terms imposed on both dates, and requests that the juvenile court specify each condition that [he] must comply with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">The Attorney General argues that the conditions imposed in the 2008 Orders are not properly challenged in this appeal, since the minor could have, but did not appeal those orders in 2008. The minor responds that there has been no waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">We conclude that the 2008 Orders are not appealable for two reasons. First, the minor\u2019s appeal from the 2008 Orders is not timely. Second, the minor failed to specify the 2008 Orders in his notice of appeal. We also reject the minor\u2019s contention that by ordering that \u201call previous Orders of the Court not inconsistent with today\u2019s Orders remain in full force and effect,\u201d \u201c[a]ll prior orders not in conflict remain in effect,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll prior orders not in conflict with today\u2019s orders to remain in full force and effect\u201d (hereafter the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions) in the 2009 Order, the court reimposed the conditions in the 2008 Orders that do not conflict with the 2009 Order and that those provisions are therefore appealable in this appeal from the 2009 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>A. <em>Timeliness of Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">A minor may appeal a judgment in a Welfare and Institutions Code section 601 or 602 proceeding \u201cin the same manner as any final judgment.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 800, subd. (a).) The juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings are not immediately appealable and the appeal is taken from the order made after the disposition hearing. <em>(In re James J. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1339 [232 Cal.Rptr. 456].) The minor may also appeal any subsequent order in such proceedings \u201cas from an order after judgment.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 800, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">An appeal in a juvenile case must generally be filed \u201cwithin 60 days after the rendition of the judgment or the making of the order being appealed.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.406(a)(1) &amp; former rule 8.400(d).) \u201cA timely notice of appeal, as a general matter, is \u2018essential to appellate jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1084, 1094 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 969 P.2d 146].) \u201cIn general, an appealable order that is not appealed becomes final and binding and may not subsequently be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order or judgment.\u201d <em>(People v. Ramirez </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1421 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">The court made the disposition orders on Petition C (the 2008 Orders) on June 20, 2008. The 60-day deadline for appealing those orders was August 19, 2008. The minor did not appeal from those orders. On July 15, 2009, the prosecution filed a new petition (Petition D) alleging new criminal offenses. The court made its disposition order on Petition D (the 2009 Order) on November 13, 2009. The minor filed a timely notice of appeal from that order on December 10, 2009. However, that notice of appeal was filed well beyond the 60-day deadline for noticing an appeal of the 2008 Orders. The minor\u2019s appeal of the 2008 Orders is therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">B. <em>Failure to Designate 2008 Orders in Notice of Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">In addition, deficiencies in the minor\u2019s notice of appeal preclude us from addressing issues related to the 2008 Orders. A notice of appeal is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.405(a)(3) &amp; former rule 8.400(c)(2).) The notice of appeal here lists only the separate case number for Petition D and states that the minor \u201cappeals the judgment, after trial, entered ... on or about November 13, 2009.\u201d It does not mention the 2008 Orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">In <em>In re Melvin J., </em>the court held that a minor was precluded from raising certain contentions on appeal because he did not appeal from a disposition order entered in October 1998. <em>(In re Melvin J. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 742 [96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 917], disapproved of on another ground in <em>John L. v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 158, 181, fn. 7 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 261, 91 P.3d 205].) The court explained: \u201cThe notice of appeal filed in this case states that the minor appealed only from the order of November 18, 1998, and the hearing conducted on that day. . . . The notice of appeal does not purport to be from the order entered on October 23, 1998, and that order was separately appealable as a final disposition order. Since the minor never appealed the order of October 23, 1998, he is precluded from raising issues relating to that order.\u201d <em>(Melvin J., </em>at p. 753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The notice of appeal in this case lists only the case number on Petition D and the 2009 Order; it does not state that the minor is appealing from the 2008 Orders. The minor is precluded from raising any issues related to the 2008 Orders in this appeal because he failed to list them in his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">C. <em>Effect of \u201cAll Prior Orders\u201d Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">At oral argument, the minor argued that the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions in the 2009 Order reimposed the probation conditions from the 2008 Orders that do not conflict with the 2009 Order and that those conditions are therefore properly before this court in this appeal. Of the conditions that the minor has placed at issue on appeal, the only condition from the 2008 Orders that does not have a counterpart in the 2009 Order is the weapons condition (Condition 22/28).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The minor did not appeal the 2008 Orders and they have become final. We do not agree that the routine continuation of a previous order without change revives the right to appeal the merits of a previous order that has become final. We note that in the context of dependency cases, courts have held that orders that have become final may not be reviewed in a later appeal from another appealable order. <em>(In re Meranda P. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1143, 1149-1150, 1156 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 913]; <em>In re Melvin A. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1250-1252 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 844].) And the same is true of criminal appeals. <em>(People v. Ramirez, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">In his concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Mihara reasons that the 2009 Order \u201cdisplaces\u201d the 2008 Orders, that the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions in the 2009 Order <em>\u201cadopted and reimposed </em>the 2008 weapons condition,\u201d and that the minor may therefore challenge the weapons condition in his appeal from the 2009 Order. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1147.) In our view, the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions did not reimpose the court\u2019s previous orders. They expressly instructed the minor that the court\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>orders that did not conflict with the 2009 Order \u201cremain[ed] in effect\u201d or in \u201cfull force and effect.\u201d We interpret that language to mean that the prior orders were not terminated or revoked by the new dispositional order. We agree with our colleague that every time a ward appears for disposition, the court may consider the minor\u2019s entire history and the order must be all encompassing. However, in our view that is separate and apart from the question of the appealability of a final order of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The cases that Justice Mihara relies on in his separate opinion <em>(In re Michael B. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 548 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173] <em>(Michael B.); In re Ruben M. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 690 [158 Cal.Rptr. 197] <em>(Ruben M.), </em>disapproved of on another ground in <em>Michael B., </em>at p. 554; <em>In re Scott K. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 273 [203 Cal.Rptr. 268] <em>(Scott K.)) </em>do not address the appealability question presented here or the meaning of the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Michael B. </em>and <em>Ruben M., </em>the appellate courts stated the general rule that after a new Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition is sustained, the juvenile court may consider all of the minor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>prior record in determining the disposition in the new case. <em>(Michael B., </em>at p. 553; <em>Ruben M., </em>at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We also disagree with our colleague\u2019s conclusions regarding the effect of our interpretation of the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions. He concludes that our decision precludes the juvenile court \u201cfrom incorporating provisions of a prior dispositional order into a new dispositional order by means of an \u2018all prior orders\u2019 provision in the new dispositional order\u201d and that, as a result, \u201cthose prior orders would no longer be in force,\u201d which means that Shaun R. would no longer be subject to a weapons condition. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1148.) However, under our interpretation of the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions, the opposite is true. Since the weapons condition does not conflict with any of the conditions in the 2009 Order, it remains in full force and effect. Shaun is still subject to the weapons condition, he just cannot appeal from the order imposing it. Finally, if the juvenile court wishes to reimpose or incorporate a condition or term from a previous disposition order that has become final into a new disposition order, the court may do so by express reimposition or incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the 2009 Order did not create a right to appeal the 2008 Orders that were already final, that the appeal of the 2008 Orders is not properly before us, and that we are without jurisdiction to entertain the minor\u2019s arguments with regard to the 2008 Orders. Consequently, we shall not address those arguments further. We observe that the minor is not without a remedy because he may seek modification of the weapons condition in the juvenile court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 775, 778; <em>In re Luis F. </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 176, 192 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 174] <em>(Luis F.); In re Brian K. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 39, 44 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 580].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">We conclude, however, that the minor\u2019s argument that the 2009 Order is vague and overbroad because it does not advise the minor which conditions from the 2008 Orders are in conflict with the 2009 Order is properly before us because it challenges the 2009 Order, not the 2008 Orders. We shall address this argument at the end of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>II. <em>General Rules Governing Probation Conditions; Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">\u201cThe California Legislature has given trial courts broad discretion to devise appropriate conditions of probation, so long as they are intended to promote the \u2018reformation and rehabilitation\u2019 of the probationer. (. . . \u00a7 1203.1, subd. (j).)\u201d <em>(Luis P, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">In cases involving juvenile offenders, Welfare and Institutions Code section 730, subdivision (b) provides that when a minor who is adjudged a ward of the court \u201cis placed under the supervision of the probation officer . . ., the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the conduct of the ward .... The court may impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">\u201cSection 730 grants courts broad discretion in establishing conditions of probation in juvenile cases. [Citation.] \u2018[T]he power of the juvenile court is even broader than that of a criminal court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Christopher M. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 684, 692 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 61].) As the court explained in <em>In re Antonio R. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 937, 941 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 212], \u201cjuvenile [probation] conditions may be broader than those pertaining to adult offenders. This is because juveniles are deemed to be more in need of guidance and supervision than adults, and because a minor\u2019s constitutional rights are more circumscribed. The state, when it asserts jurisdiction over a minor, stands in the shoes of the parents. And a parent may \u2018curtail a child\u2019s exercise of the constitutional rights . . . [because a] parent\u2019s own constitutionally protected \u201cliberty\u201d includes the right to \u201cbring up children\u201d [citation] and to \u201cdirect the upbringing and education of children.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Even conditions that infringe on constitutional rights may be valid if they are specifically tailored to fit the needs of the juvenile. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">\u201cIn distinguishing between the permissible exercise of discretion in probationary sentencing by the juvenile court and that allowed in \u2018adult\u2019 court,\u201d our state Supreme Court has \u201cadvised that, \u2018[although the goal of both types of probation is the rehabilitation of the offender, \u201c[j]uvenile probation is not, as with an adult, an act of leniency in lieu of statutory punishment. . . .\u201d [][] In light of this difference, a condition of probation that would be unconstitutional or otherwise improper for an adult probationer may be permissible for a minor under the supervision of the juvenile court. . . .

[Citations.] \u2018If available alternative means exist which are less violative of the constitutional right and are narrowly drawn so as to correlate more closely with the purposes contemplated, those alternatives should be used.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Luis F., supra, </em>177 Cal.App.4th at p. 189, quoting <em>Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 889-890.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Although the minor did not object to any of the conditions at issue when they were imposed in the juvenile court, we do not deem the issues forfeited on appeal, since the failure to object on the ground that a probation condition is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad is not forfeited on appeal. <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 889.)

He argues, for example, that a condition in the 2009 Order that contains a knowledge requirement may conflict with an earlier condition addressing the same subject matter that does not contain such a requirement and that the court\u2019s \u201cfailure to specify where such conflicts are deemed to exist is itself an example of vagueness and overbreadth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>\u201c[T]he underpinning of a vagueness challenge is the due process concept of \u2018fair warning.\u2019 [Citation.] The rule of fair warning consists of \u2018the due process concepts of preventing arbitrary law enforcement and providing adequate notice to potential offenders\u2019 [citation], protections that are \u2018embodied in the due process clauses of the federal and California Constitutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.) \u201cIn deciding the adequacy of any notice afforded those bound by a legal restriction, we are guided by the principles that \u2018abstract legal commands must be applied in a specific <em>context,\u2019\u2019 </em>and that, although not admitting of \u2018mathematical certainty,\u2019 the language used must have \u2018 <em>\u201creasonable </em>specificity.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cA probation condition \u2018must be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him, and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated,\u2019 if it is to withstand a challenge on the ground of vagueness.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">With regard to the probation conditions that the minor has placed at issue, a number of the conditions in the 2009 Order address the same topics as those in the 2008 Orders (i.e., clothing and paraphernalia, areas of gang activity, and tattoos). While the probation conditions in the 2008 Orders and the 2009 Order address the same topics, they differ because they lack a knowledge requirement, delegation of authority to the probation officer, or definition of the terms \u201cgang\u201d and \u201cgang-related,\u201d and are thus inconsistent or in conflict with one another. The \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions state that such prior inconsistent orders shall not remain in effect. We find no merit to the minor\u2019s contention that a 16 year old would not be able to determine that these probation conditions, which address the same topic, but are worded differently from one another, are in conflict with one another. To the extent that a new condition addresses the same subject matter as a condition that was previously imposed, the new condition controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">The only condition that the minor has placed at issue that was imposed in 2008 but was not imposed in 2009 was the weapons condition. In our view, even a teenager is able to understand that a 2008 condition that has no counterpart in the 2009 Order is not inconsistent with the new order and therefore still applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Finally, the minor\u2019s suggestion that the court specify where the conflicts exist between the terms of a new disposition order and a previous order places too great a burden on the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">For these reasons, we conclude the \u201call prior orders\u201d provisions are not vague or overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We modify Condition 8 to read as follows: \u201cThe minor shall not knowingly use, possess, or be under the influence of alcohol or any form of controlled or illegal substance without the legal right to do so and the minor shall submit to drug and substance abuse testing as directed by the Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">We modify Condition 15 to read as follows: \u201cThe minor shall not participate in any gang activity and shall not visit or remain in any specific location known to him to be, or that the Probation Officer informs him to be, an area of gang-related activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">We modify Condition 16 to read: \u201cThe minor shall not knowingly possess, display or wear any insignia, clothing, logos, emblems, badges, or buttons, or display any gang signs or gestures that he knows to be, or that the Probation Officer informs him to be, gang-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">We modify Condition 17 to read: \u201cThe minor shall not obtain any new tattoos that he knows to be, or that the Probation Officer informs him to be, gang-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">We modify Condition 18 to read: \u201cThe minor shall not post, display or transmit on or through his cell phone any symbols or information that the minor knows to be, or that the Probation Officer informs the minor to be, gang-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">We modify the probation conditions in the 2009 Order to include the following definitional clause at the end: \u201cFor the purposes of these probation conditions, the words \u2018gang\u2019 and \u2018gang-related\u2019 mean a \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 as defined in Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">As so modified, the 2009 Order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P.

Although many of the probation conditions in those two orders address the same issues, they are numbered differently and some are worded differently from one another.

The court concluded that a separate petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 777 was not required, but that \u201ca petition under section 602 must contain notice of the intent to rely upon previous sustained petitions under section 602, in order to aggregate the maximum period of confinement on the basis of those petitions.\u201d <em>(Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">In <em>Ruben M., </em>the court addressed the procedural question \u201cwhether when a new 602 petition is sustained the court may include all of the prior cases for which the minor is presently on probation in determining the maximum period of confinement without initiating separate proceedings under section 777 Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d and held that \u201cwhen a new [Welfare and Institutions Code] section 602 petition is filed no additional petition under [Welfare and Institutions Code] section <em>111 </em>is required in order to include the prior cases in the (aggregate) maximum term of commitment.\u201d <em>(Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at pp. 696, 698.)

The court observed that when his new Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition was sustained and the court decided to \u201cplace the minor in the California Youth Authority the prior camp-community program was effectively terminated.\u201d (96 Cal.App.3d at p. 699.)

They agree with the Attorney General\u2019s claim that the weapons condition is \u201cnot properly challenged in this appeal\u201d because Shaun \u201ccould have challenged\u201d it in an appeal from the 2008 dispositional order. Although I agree that Shaun is precluded from challenging the 2008 dispositional order itself in this appeal from the 2009 dispositional order, I do not agree that Shaun\u2019s appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>challenge to the weapons condition is a challenge to the 2008 order rather than to a provision of the 2009 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s 2008 order declaring Shaun to be a ward of the court and returning him to his parents\u2019 custody included a number of probation conditions, among them the weapons condition. In 2009, the juvenile court issued an order continuing Shaun\u2019s wardship and removing him from his parents\u2019 custody. The 2009 order, which included a number of probation conditions but no weapons condition, also provided that \u201cAll prior orders not in conflict remain in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Shaun\u2019s timely appeal from the 2009 order, he challenges, among other things, the constitutionality of the weapons condition, which is the only 2008 probation condition which was \u201cnot in conflict\u201d with (or identical to) any of the 2009 probation conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">My colleagues conclude that the \u201call prior orders\u201d provision in the 2009 order was a \u201croutine continuation of a previous order without change\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1139) that did not reimpose, adopt, or incorporate by reference the weapons condition in the 2008 order. I disagree. In my view, the \u201call prior orders\u201d provision in the juvenile court\u2019s 2009 order <em>reimposed </em>any 2008 probation condition that was \u201cnot in conflict\u201d with the probation conditions set forth in the 2009 order and thereby made any such probation condition part of the 2009 order, which Shaun could properly challenge in his appeal from the 2009 order. My disagreement with my colleagues stems from their belief that a previous juvenile delinquency dispositional order continues in force after a subsequent juvenile delinquency dispositional order has been entered as to the same juvenile. Their belief reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of juvenile delinquency dispositional orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">When a juvenile has already been declared a ward and a dispositional order is therefore in place, additional misconduct by the minor may be alleged in either a new Welfare and Institutions Code section 602<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petition or a section 777 notice. (See <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 548, 552-553 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173] <em>(Michael); In re Eddie M. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 480 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 119, 73 P.3d 1115].) \u201cAfter a new petition is sustained under section 602, ... the court may consider the juvenile\u2019s entire record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>exercising its discretion at the dispositional hearing . . . and may rely on prior sustained section 602 petitions in determining the proper disposition and maximum period of confinement.\u201d <em>(Michael, </em>at p. 553.)

Because a subsequent dispositional order \u201ceffectively terminate[s]\u201d a prior dispositional order, the prior dispositional order does <em>not </em>ordinarily continue to be in force after the entry of the subsequent dispositional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">\u201cThe stated central objective of the law with respect to delinquent children is to provide the \u2018care, treatment and guidance which is consistent with their best interest, which holds them accountable for their behavior, and which is appropriate for their circumstances.\u2019 (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).) To determine what is appropriate under a given set of circumstances, a court must review those circumstances <em>every time the minor appears for a dispositional hearing.\u201d (In re Ronnie P. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1087-1088 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 875], italics added.) \u201cEach time a ward comes before the court, whether the result of a subsequent section 602 or 777 petition, the goal of any resulting dispositional order is to rehabilitate the minor. <em>Thus, a dispositional order should be all encompassing. This may simply require the juvenile court to adopt previous orders of the court or make wholesale changes </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Scott K. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 273, 277 [203 Cal.Rptr. 268], boldface &amp; italics added <em>(Scott K.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Because the new dispositional order on a subsequent section 602 petition must be \u201call encompassing\u201d <em>(Scott K., supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d at p. 277) and \u201ceffectively terminate[s]\u201d <em>(Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at p. 699) the earlier dispositional order on the prior section 602 petition, the new dispositional order in a delinquency case <em>displaces </em>the earlier dispositional order, and the only means available to the court by which the provisions of the earlier order may be continued in force is a provision in the later order incorporating into the later order provisions of the earlier order. The juvenile court\u2019s \u201call prior orders\u201d provision in its 2009 dispositional order was precisely such a provision. It <em>adopted and reimposed </em>the 2008 weapons condition. Since the weapons condition was <em>reimposed </em>by the 2009 order, Shaun may properly challenge the weapons condition in his timely appeal from the 2009 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">My colleagues cite no authority for their rejection of my analysis, but they discount my analysis apparently on the ground that the law set forth in the cases I cite above was not part of the <em>holdings </em>in those cases. I readily concede that there is no case with a holding precisely on point. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number><em>absence </em>of a case with a <em>holding </em>that supports my analysis does not establish that my analysis is invalid. Indeed, it is because the principles upon which I rely are so well accepted that it has never been necessary for an appellate court to publish a decision containing a holding on this point. Unfortunately, my colleagues now publish a decision which discards these principles and substitutes their apparent conclusion that a juvenile court is precluded from incorporating provisions of a prior dispositional order into a new dispositional order by means of an \u201call prior orders\u201d provision in the new dispositional order. As I have explained, their conclusion would mean that those prior orders would no longer be in force. In this case, where Shaun has a history of involvement with weapons, my colleagues\u2019 conclusion would mean that Shaun would no longer be subject to a weapons condition, which could hardly have been the juvenile court\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">I dissent from my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that Shaun is precluded from challenging the weapons condition because that condition was not part of the 2009 dispositional order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 19, 2011, S187935.
