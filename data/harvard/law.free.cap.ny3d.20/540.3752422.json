Under either the substantial evidence or arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the Niagara Falls Board of Education\u2019s decision was rationally based and should be upheld. <em>(Matter of Jennings v New York State Off. of Mental Health, </em>90 NY2d 227; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist.

Petitioner was entitled to a hearing prior to being terminated for allegedly violating respondents\u2019 residency policy because, as a tenured teacher, she enjoyed a constitutionally protected property interest in her continued public employment. <em>(Matter of Gould v Board of Educ. of Sewanhaka Cent.

The Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Niagara Falls and Cynthia A.

III. The Appellate Division erred by reversing the Supreme Court determination because the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Niagara Falls\u2019 and Cynthia A. Bianco\u2019s action terminating petitioner was arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of O\u2019Connor v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of Niagara Falls, </em>48 AD3d 1254, 10 NY3d 928; <em>Matter of Gigliotti v Bianco, </em>82 AD3d 1636; <em>Matter of Krajkowski v Bianco, </em>85 AD3d 1577; <em>Matter of Beck-Nichols v Bianco, </em>89 AD3d 1405; <em>Matter of Luchey v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of the City of Niagara Falls, </em>92 AD3d 1276; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist.

Roxanne Adrian was not entitled to a hearing under Education Law \u00a7 3020-a because her removal was the result of her violation of a condition of employment rather than misconduct or incompetency. <em>(Matter of Orens v Novello, </em>99 NY2d 180; <em>Matter of Auerbach v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>86 NY2d 198; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205; <em>Matter of Mannix v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>21 NY2d 455; <em>Matter of Fitzpatrick v Board of Educ. of Mamaroneck Union Free School Dist., </em>96 AD2d 557; <em>Matter of Coriou v Nyquist, </em>33 AD2d 580; <em>Matter of O\u2019Connor v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of Niagara Falls, </em>48 AD3d 1254; <em>Matter of Felix v New York City Dept. of Citywide Admin.

The standard of review by the Court is whether the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Niagara Falls\u2019 decision to terminate Roxanne Adrian was arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Chauvel v Nyquist, </em>43 NY2d 48; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist.

The Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Niagara Falls\u2019 finding that Roxanne Adrian was not in compliance with the residency policy was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Stone v Gross, </em>25 AD2d 753, 19 NY2d 675; <em>Town of Huntington v Park Shore Country Day Camp of Dix Hills, </em>47 NY2d 61; <em>Marcus Assoc. v Town of Huntington, </em>45 NY2d 501; <em>Robert E.

The appropriate standard of review on appeal in this matter is whether the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Niagara Falls\u2019 determination was arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist.

The policy\u2019s implementing regulations define \u201cresidency\u201d as \u201can individual\u2019s actual principal domicile at which he or she maintains usual personal and household effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\n<em>Karri Beck-Nichols</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The District hired Beck-Nichols as a computer operator in July 1994, and promoted her to the position of production control manager in 2005. When she first began to work for the District, Beck-Nichols resided at a house on J. Avenue in Niagara Falls, which she and her husband owned. In 2001, Beck-Nichols and her husband purchased a house in Lewiston, New York, and, upon being asked, Beck-Nichols informed the District\u2019s Administrator for Human Resources (the Administrator) that she remained domiciled in Niagara Falls. Beck-Nichols again assured the District she was domiciled in Niagara Falls on December 3, 2003, when she signed a \u201cresidency confirmation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">By letter dated June 7, 2004, the Administrator directed Beck-Nichols to attend an \u201cinterview conference\u201d for her to present information substantiating compliance with the residency policy. At this meeting, Beck-Nichols, who was accompanied by her attorney, stated that she was residing with her parents and a nephew, of whom she had custody, at her parent\u2019s house on C. Avenue in Niagara Falls; that she and her husband were renting out their house on J. Avenue, but intended eventually to return there; and that her husband and three children were residing at the house in Lewiston, where the children attended school.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">On January 21, 2009, Beck-Nichols filed an \u201cEmployee Change of Address Form\u201d with the District\u2019s Office of Human Resources, claiming residency at the J. Avenue address again. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>On February 10, 2009, the Administrator wrote to Beck-Nichols, telling her that the District had \u201creason to believe that [she was] in violation of [the residency] policy\u201d; and scheduling a \u201cresidency affirmation meeting\u201d with her for the District \u201cto secure additional information and/or documentation supporting [her] affirmation and continued residency in [Niagara Falls].\u201d This letter was prompted by a Westlaw database search conducted in December 2008, which turned up the Lewiston address for Beck-Nichols.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Beck-Nichols, with her attorney, appeared at the meeting, held on March 25, 2009. To verify compliance with the residency policy, she supplied copies of utility bills and a cable bill addressed to her at the J. Avenue address; a recent voter registration card and driver\u2019s license, showing her address as J. Avenue; and a statement for a home equity line of credit for the J. Avenue house, addressed to Beck-Nichols and her husband. At this meeting, the District\u2019s attorney brought up the application for exemption from school property taxes under the New York State School Tax Relief Program (STAR), signed by Beck-Nichols and her husband on May 10, 2001 as \u201cresident owners,\u201d in which they certified that they owned the Lewiston property; that it was their \u201cprimary residence\u201d; and that they understood their obligation to notify the assessor if they relocated to another primary residence. He also raised information showing that tax bills for the J. Avenue property were sent to Beck-Nichols and her husband at the Lewiston address.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Meanwhile, the District had engaged a private company to conduct surveillance, which took place on four days in February, three in March and one in May. The investigators observed Beck-Nichols at the Lewiston address on the first two days of surveillance in February, which were weekdays that she did not work, and on the third day, another weekday, they spotted her vehicle in the parking lot at her workplace. On the fourth day, the investigators followed Beck-Nichols from work to the J. Avenue address, which she entered and exited eight minutes later, and to another residence in Niagara Falls, which she entered and exited 36 minutes later. The investigators noted that as they continued mobile surveillance, Beck-Nichols \u201c[began] driving at high rates of speed and somewhat evasively\u201d; and that she \u201ccontinue[d] to travel at a high rate of speed pulling into [the] driveway and directly into the garage\u201d at the Lewiston address. Surveillance was discontinued at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The first day of surveillance in March, a Sunday, Beck-Nichols was observed at the Lewiston address; the second day, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>weekday, she drove after work to the J. Avenue address, which she entered and exited 29 minutes later; she then drove to the Lewiston address, and \u201cquickly pull[ed] into the garage as the door close[d] behind\u201d; surveillance was discontinued at 8:00 p.m. On the third day, a weekday, an investigator observed Beck-Nichols leaving the J. Avenue address in the morning, on her way to work. On the single day of surveillance in May, a weekday, Beck-Nichols drove to the Lewiston address after work; she left at 11:40 p.m., \u201ctravelling] at high rates of speed and rather evasively\u201d toward Niagara Falls. She arrived at the J. Avenue address at 11:56 p.m., where she appeared to \u201ctake[ ] notice\u201d of a second investigator\u2019s \u201csurveillance position[,] . . . walk[ing] around [the] vehicle before entering the residence.\u201d The investigators then established a different observation point; they discontinued surveillance at 1:00 a.m. since it seemed that Beck-Nichols had retired for the night. In the case summary for the investigation, the author noted that Beck-Nichols \u201cappeared to be very suspicious of our surveillance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">On July 10, 2009, the Administrator wrote Beck-Nichols, enclosing a summary of the March 25th meeting and copies of documents referred to in the summary, as well as a copy of the new STAR application for the Lewiston property, dated June 9, 2009, which she had supplied to him the previous day. This application was signed only by Beck-Nichols\u2019 husband as \u201cresident owner[ ].\u201d The Administrator noted that all this information would be submitted to the Niagara Falls Board of Education (the Board) for review, and later in July, the Board considered Beck-Nichols\u2019 case. Based on the record compiled, the Board concluded that Beck-Nichols did not appear to comply with the residency policy. In accordance with the policy\u2019s implementing regulations, the Administrator sent Beck-Nichols a \u201cseven-day letter,\u201d dated July 30, 2009, to notify her that the Board had \u201creason to believe\u201d that she was in violation of the policy, and to give her seven days to respond in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">By letter dated August 4, 2009, Beck-Nichols replied that she had maintained the J. Avenue address as her \u201cpermanent domicile\u201d throughout 15 years of employment in the District, and had furnished \u201cvoter registration, utility bills, driver\u2019s license, and other information\u201d to prove this was the case; that her promotion in 2005 led her to believe that the 2004 investigation had ended in her favor; and that she was a tireless worker whose record was \u201cwithout blemish.\u201d She requested the Board reconsider. By letter dated August 14, 2009, the Administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>offered to meet with Beck-Nichols on August 18, 2009, to provide additional documents. At this meeting, Beck-Nichols was given a copy of the surveillance report; she and her attorney acknowledged that, at some point, she knew she was being followed. On August 21, 2009, the Administrator sent Beck-Nichols a \u201c30-day letter\u201d to notify her that, at the Board\u2019s September meeting, the Superintendent of Schools (the Superintendent) would recommend termination of her services for failure to comply with the residency policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On September 24, 2009, the Board terminated Beck-Nichols\u2019 employment, effective the next day;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on December 21, 2009, she commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding against the Superintendent, the Board\u2019s President, the Board and the District, seeking to set aside the Board\u2019s determination. Beck-Nichols argued that the termination of her employment was arbitrary and capricious because the District did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that she had abandoned her domicile in Niagara Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Supreme Court transferred the case to the Appellate Division, which annulled the determination, on the law, and granted the petition (89 AD3d 1405 [4th Dept 2011]). The court noted \u201cat the outset\u201d that Supreme Court had improperly transferred the case because the Board\u2019s decision did \u201cnot involve a substantial evidence issue\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1406, citing <em>Matter of Krajkowski v Bianco, </em>85 AD3d 1577, 1578 [4th Dept 2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 712 [2011]). Nonetheless, the Appellate Division reached the merits \u201cin the interest of judicial economy\u201d <em>{id. </em>[internal quotation marks omitted]). The Court agreed with Beck-Nichols that the District was required to muster clear and convincing evidence to show that she had changed her domicile, and did not meet this burden. We subsequently granted leave to appeal (18 NY3d 807 [2012]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\"><em>Roxanne Adrian </em>and <em>Keli-Koran Luchey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\n<em>Adrian</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Adrian was appointed a teacher in the District as of September 1, 2003, and later acquired tenure. When hired, she signed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>employment agreement, acknowledging that she was required to establish residency in Niagara Falls, within the meaning of the residency policy, within six months of her initial appointment; in this agreement, she identified her domicile at the time as an address in Williamsville, New York. On December 12, 2003, the Administrator wrote to Adrian, reminding her that the six-month grace period ended on March 1, 2004. In response, Adrian requested an extension, which the Board granted. On August 11, 2004, Adrian submitted a change of address form, notifying the District that she resided in Niagara Falls at an address on 73rd Street. On August 15, 2006, she submitted a change of address for mailing only; the mailing address was a post office box in Niagara Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">A Westlaw database search, conducted in January 2009, indicated that Adrian still resided at the Williamsville address; a record maintained by the State Education Department, obtained in March 2009, disclosed that Adrian had apparently used the Williamsville address when she applied for permanent certification, which was granted in 2007. On April 1, 2009, the Administrator wrote to Adrian, informing her that the District had \u201creason to believe that [she was] in violation of [the residency] policy\u201d; and scheduling an \u201cinterview conference\u201d with her for the District \u201cto secure additional information and/or documentation supporting [her] affirmation and continued residency in [Niagara Falls].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">At this meeting, held on May 12, 2009, Adrian, accompanied by her attorney and union representatives, identified the 73rd Street address in Niagara Falls as her residence. She claimed to live on the second floor in an apartment with a bathroom, bedroom and living room, and a kitchen with a small refrigerator and microwave oven; she produced a lease for the period September 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009, and receipts for rent payments of $350 per month since September 2008. She provided copies of correspondence or documents identifying her address as 73rd Street in Niagara Falls\u2014i.e., cable bills, a voter registration card, a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration card. Adrian said that she resided at the Williamsville address with a friend only in the summertime, although she helped out the friend, who suffered from migraine headaches, in the morning before going to work; she did not pay rent at Williamsville; and there was a phone listing for her there, but not at the 73rd Street address.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In the meantime, surveillance was conducted on behalf of the District on two days in March, one in April and two in May. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>company engaged by the District to perform this investigation reported that Adrian was observed leaving for work from, or returning from work to, the Williamsville address; she was never seen at the 73rd Street address, including the one occasion when a second investigator was stationed there throughout the afternoon/evening hours until 8:00 a.m. the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Based on the record compiled, the Board in July.2009 concluded that Adrian did not appear to comply with the residency policy. In accordance with the policy\u2019s implementing regulations, the Administrator sent Adrian a \u201cseven-day letter,\u201d dated July 30, 2009, to notify her that the Board had \u201creason to believe\u201d that she was in violation of the policy, and to give her seven days to respond in writing. On August 4, 2009, Adrian\u2019s attorney wrote to the Administrator, seeking advice \u201cas to what steps [were] necessary to resolve this matter to [his] client\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d By letter dated August 14, 2009, the Administrator offered to meet with Adrian on August 18, 2009 to provide additional documents. At this meeting, attended by both Adrian\u2019s attorney and union representatives, the District\u2019s attorney handed over a copy of the surveillance report. By letter dated August 20, 2009, Adrian\u2019s attorney furnished the District\u2019s attorney with a voter registration card and a letter and bill from the cable company, all showing a new address for Adrian on C. Avenue in Niagara Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On August 21, 2009, the Administrator sent Adrian a \u201c30-day letter\u201d to notify her that, at the Board\u2019s September meeting, the Superintendent would recommend termination of her services for failure to comply with the residency policy. Adrian\u2019s attorney then wrote the District\u2019s attorney, inquiring as to \u201cwhat other documentation [would be] necessary\u201d to prevent this from happening; the District\u2019s attorney replied on September 10, 2009 that, after reviewing the information submitted by Adrian as to her change of address to C. Avenue in Niagara Falls, the Board \u201cremain[ed] of the opinion\u201d that she was out of compliance with the policy. By letter dated September 11, 2009, Adrian\u2019s attorney sent the District\u2019s attorney a lease signed by Adrian to rent the C. Avenue property as a personal residence for Adrian and two other individuals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>On September 24, 2009, the Board terminated Adrian\u2019s employment, effective the next day; on December 18, 2009, she commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding against the Board and the Superintendent. Adrian contended that, as a tenured employee, she was entitled to a pre-termination hearing complying with Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 2509 (2), 3020 and 3020-a; that the Board terminated her employment \u201cwithout sound basis in reason or regard to the facts\u201d; and that the Superintendent failed to establish administrative procedures to carry out the residency policy, rendering both the policy and the Board\u2019s action \u201cincomplete, null, void and of no force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\n<em>Luchey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Luchey signed an affirmation on November 2, 1999, signifying her understanding that she was required to become a resident of Niagara Falls within six months of her appointment to a position in the District, in accordance with the residency policy. On November 19, 1999, she signed an employment agreement to the same effect; in the agreement, she identified her domicile at the time as North Tonawanda, New York. Luchey\u2019s appointment as a school counselor was effective on December 13, 1999. By letter dated March 15, 2000, the Administrator reminded Luchey that the six-month grace period ended on June 13, 2000. In response, Luchey requested an extension, which the Board granted. Before the extension ended, she supplied the District proof of residency at an address on W. Avenue in Niagara Falls; in the fall of 2001, she supplied proof of residency at a new address, E Road in Niagara Falls. On December 8, 2003, Luchey signed an affirmation in which she declared that her residence was E Road in Niagara Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">A Westlaw database search, conducted in December 2008, indicated that Luchey resided at an address in Amherst, New York. On April 1, 2009, the Administrator wrote to Luchey, informing her that the District had \u201creason to believe that [she was] in violation of [the residency] policy\u201d; and scheduling an \u201cinterview conference\u201d with her for the District \u201cto secure additional information and/or documentation supporting [her] affirmation and continued residency in [Niagara Falls].\u201d At this meeting, held on April 28, 2009, Luchey, accompanied by her attorney and union representatives, identified an address on L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Avenue in Niagara Falls as her residence. She submitted her driver\u2019s license, car registration, voter registration card, bank statements and other bills or documents listing, or addressed to her at, this address. Luchey described her residence at L. Avenue as a heated basement, with its own shower and kitchen, in a single-family home; she stated that she paid her rent in cash, and had no receipts. Luchey also represented that she and her ex-husband had reached an oral agreement for their seven-year-old son to reside with him in Amherst, although Luchey retained full custody; her son attended school in Amherst.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Prior to the meeting, surveillance had been conducted on behalf of the District during five days in March (four workdays and a Sunday). In four separate observations (on one of the workdays, the investigator was unable to locate Luchey\u2019s vehicle in the school\u2019s parking lot), Luchey was never seen at her purported Niagara Falls address; instead, she left for work from, and returned from work to, the Amherst address discovered in the database search.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On July 10, 2009, the Administrator supplied Luchey with a summary of the April 28th meeting, and asked for further documentation verifying rent payment. Based on the record compiled, the Board in July 2009 concluded that Luchey did not appear to comply with the residency policy. In accordance with the policy\u2019s implementing regulations, the Administrator sent Luchey a \u201cseven-day letter,\u201d dated July 30, 2009, to notify her that the Board had \u201creason to believe\u201d that she was in violation of the policy, and to give her seven days to respond in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Luchey\u2019s attorney wrote to the Administrator on August 4, 2009, submitting four receipts for rent paid by Luchey, prepared by the owner of the residence at the L. Avenue address; and requesting copies of the documentation relied on by the District. By letter dated August 14, 2009, the Administrator offered to meet with Luchey on August 18, 2009 to provide additional documents related to her compliance with the residency policy. When Luchey did not attend the meeting, apparently because her attorney was unavailable, the surveillance report was telefaxed to a union representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">On September 24, 2009, the Board terminated Luchey\u2019s employment, effective the next day; on December 18, 2009, she commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding against the Board and the Superintendent. Like Adrian, Luchey contended that, as a tenured employee, she was entitled to a pre-termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>hearing complying with Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 2509 (2), 3020 and 3020-a; that the Board terminated her employment \u201cwithout sound basis in reason or regard to the facts\u201d; and that the Superintendent failed to establish administrative procedures to carry out the residency policy, rendering both the policy and the Board\u2019s action \u201cincomplete, null, void and of no force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Decisions Below</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Although Adrian\u2019s and Luchey\u2019s lawsuits were not consolidated, their claims were identical, and Supreme Court considered and granted their petitions together. The judge noted that petitioners were not entitled to pre-termination hearings because the residency requirement was \u201cmerely a . . . condition of employment,\u201d citing <em>Matter of Felix v New York City Dept. of Citywide Admin. Servs. </em>(3 NY3d 498 [2004]). But considering the basis for petitioners\u2019 job loss, he characterized the policy\u2019s definition of residency as creating a \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d standard which, coupled with the Superintendent\u2019s failure to develop adequate procedures and guidelines, \u201cresulted in varied and subjective interpretations leading to disparate results.\u201d The judge therefore held that the residency requirement was unenforceable, and that any termination of Adrian\u2019s and Luchey\u2019s employment based on it was therefore arbitrary and capricious. He directed their reinstatement with full back pay and benefits. The Board and Superintendent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Appellate Division considered these appeals separately. One panel reversed the judgment as to Adrian (92 AD3d 1272 [4th Dept 2012]). In the court\u2019s view, the District established that Adrian was not domiciled in Niagara Falls, and therefore the Board\u2019s determination was not arbitrary and capricious. The court also rejected Adrian\u2019s alternative ground for affirmance\u2014i.e., that the District did not conduct a pre-termination trial-type hearing\u2014on the ground that this was not mandated by law. We granted Adrian leave to appeal (19 NY3d 804 [2012]), and now affirm. The other panel affirmed the judgment as to Luchey, without opinion (92 AD3d 1276 [4th Dept 2012]). We granted the Board and Superintendent leave to appeal (20 NY3d 851 [2012]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">A residency policy for municipal workers serves \u201cthe legitimate purpose of encouraging city employees to maintain a commitment and involvement with the government which employs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>them by living within the city [citations omitted]\u201d <em>(Felix, </em>3 NY3d at 505, quoting <em>Mandelkern v City of Buffalo, </em>64 AD2d 279, 281 [4th Dept 1978, Simons, J.]). The District\u2019s residency policy states simply that \u201c[t]he Niagara Falls Board of Education requires that employees hired or promoted after the effective date of this policyt ] be residents of the City of Niagara Falls and maintain their residency during their term of employment.\u201d The implementing regulations, as noted earlier, define \u201cresidency\u201d as \u201can individual\u2019s actual principal domicile at which he or she maintains usual personal and household effects.\u201d This definition may be criticized for redundancy or surplusage, but not ambiguity. The word \u201cdomicile\u201d alone is enough to convey the sense that the Board mandates that District employees live in Niagara Falls \u201cwith intent to make it a fixed and permanent home\u201d <em>(see Matter of Newcomb, </em>192 NY 238, 250 [1908]).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Further, the regulations provide for notifying employees of the residency policy upon initial appointment and promotion; give employees six months after appointment to come into compliance, and allow the Board, in its discretion, to extend this grace period for another six months; provide for a \u201cseven-day letter\u201d to afford an employee the opportunity to respond to allegations of noncompliance; include a hardship waiver; and exempt nonadministrative employees hired prior to the policy\u2019s effective date, subject to certain conditions. The regulations also include detailed forms to carry out the policy. These forms, in one way or another, call for employees to acknowledge that they have read, understand and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In short, the residency policy and its implementing regulations make clear that District personnel are expected to be domiciled in Niagara Falls within no more than a year after appointment, and throughout their subsequent employment. Nothing in the policy or regulations might reasonably lead a prospective employee into supposing that a mail drop or pied-\u00e1terre in the City was sufficient. Indeed, the policy would be pointless if this were enough to satisfy the residency obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Next, we have held that a residency requirement defines eligibility for employment, and so is \u201cunrelated to job performance, misconduct or competency\u201d (see <em>Felix, </em>3 NY3d at 505; <em>see also Matter of New York State Off. of Children &amp; Family Servs. v Lanterman, </em>14 NY3d 275, 282 [2010]). Consequently, Adrian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and Luchey were not entitled to hearings complying with Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 2509 (2), 3020 and 3020-a, which deal with teacher discipline <em>(see Matter of O\u2019Connor v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of Niagara Falls, </em>48 AD3d 1254 [4th Dept 2008], <em>lv dismissed </em>10 NY3d 928 [2008]). And due process mandates only notice and some opportunity to respond <em>(see Matter of Prue v Hunt, </em>78 NY2d 364, 368 [1991] [applying <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v Loudermill, </em>470 US 532, 543 (1985)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Here, the Administrator notified Beck-Nichols, Adrian and Luchey that they were suspected of violating the residency policy. There ensued individual meetings at which they appeared with counsel (and union representatives in two instances), where the District received and offered evidence bearing on their residency. Information developed as a result of the meetings and through surveillance was shared with the employees and submitted to the Board, which concluded that there was reason to believe that Beck-Nichols, Adrian and Luchey were violating the policy. The Administrator then sent a \u201cseven-day letter,\u201d which afforded a last-chance opportunity for these employees to make the case that they, in fact, resided in Niagara Falls within the meaning of the policy. When the evidence or argument presented in response to the letters proved unpersuasive, the Administrator issued a \u201c30-day letter\u201d to inform Beck-Nichols, Adrian and Luchey that the Superintendent would recommend at the next Board meeting that their services be terminated for failure to comply with the residency policy. These notice-and-hearing procedures, which are more extensive than the regulations\u2019 provision for a single notification and opportunity to respond via a \u201cseven-day letter,\u201d easily comply with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Finally, the proper standard for judicial review in these cases is whether the Board\u2019s determination was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion <em>(see </em>CPLR 7803 [3]). This standard is, of course, an extremely deferential one: \u201cThe courts cannot interfere [with an administrative tribunal\u2019s exercise of discretion] unless there is <em>no rational basis </em>for [its] exercise ... or the action complained of is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d a test which \u201cchiefly relates to whether a particular action should have been taken or is justified . . . and whether the administrative action is <em>without foundation in fact\u201d (see Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist. No. 1 of Towns of Scarsdale &amp; Mamaroneck, Westchester County, </em>34 NY2d 222, 231 [1974] [citations and internal quotation marks omitted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>emphases added]). Beck-Nichols seeks to create a higher standard by arguing that because she was concededly domiciled in Niagara Falls when hired (unlike Adrian and Luchey), the District was obliged to prove by clear and convincing evidence that she abandoned her domicile; that the District did not meet this standard; and so the Board\u2019s decision to end her employment was perforce arbitrary and capricious. She relies principally on our decision in <em>Matter of Hosley v Curry </em>(85 NY2d 447 [1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In that case, Hosley sought an order disqualifying Curry, the district attorney of Hamilton County, from acting in that capacity on the basis that Curry was, in fact, a resident of Warren County, and so did not satisfy <em>the </em>residency requirements of Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 30. Section 3 (1) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be capable of holding a civil office who shall not . . . [be] a resident of the political subdivision ... of the state for which he shall be chosen\u201d; section 30 (1) (d) concomitantly specifies that \u201c[e]very office shall be vacant upon . . . [the incumbent\u2019s] ceasing to be an inhabitant ... of the political subdivision ... of which he is required to be a resident when chosen.\u201d Curry owned residences in both Hamilton and Warren Counties. Supreme Court decided that Hosley had not met the burden of proof necessary to declare that Curry was a nonresident of Hamilton County. The Appellate Division reversed, declaring that \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s conclusion could not be reached under any fair interpretation of the [facts],\u201d which were essentially undisputed (207 AD2d 116, 118 [3d Dept 1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">First, we held that the terms \u201cresident\u201d and \u201cinhabitant\u201d in sections 3 and 30 were \u201cproperly understood to be synonymous with domicile\u201d <em>(Curry, </em>85 NY2d at 451). Next, we interpreted these statutory provisions to incorporate the definition of domicile and standard of proof specified in <em>Newcomb, </em>a will contest where the decedent\u2019s domicile at death was disputed. As a result, we held that Hosley, who was alleging a change in Curry\u2019s domicile from Hamilton to Warren County, bore the burden to demonstrate by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the district attorney possessed a \u201cpresent, definite and honest purpose to abandon the Hamilton County domicile and make the Warren County residence his fixed and permanent home\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 452). We \u201cconclude[d] that Supreme Court\u2019s determination that [Hosley] failed to sustain the burden more nearly comport[ed] with the weight of the evidence\u201d <em>{id.; see also </em>CPLR 5501 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Beck-Nichols invites us to extend <em>Curry, </em>which involved the interpretation of statutes governing public officers, to municipal residency requirements applicable to public employees and enforced through administrative, decision making. We decline to make this leap. In any event, there is clear and convincing and, indeed, dispositive evidence that Beck-Nichols abandoned her domicile in Niagara Falls after her initial appointment; namely, in May 2001 she and her husband signed a STAR application in which they certified that the Lewiston address was their \u201cprimary residence.\u201d The Board was certainly entitled to disregard the new STAR application filed for the Lewiston property in June 2009 and signed only by Beck-Nichols\u2019 husband. This happened after, and the Board might have reasonably concluded solely because, the District\u2019s attorney questioned Beck-Nichols about the 2001 application at the meeting held in March 2009 to review her residency status. Additionally, of course, Beck-Nichols\u2019 husband and family lived at the Lewiston residence; her children attended school in Lewiston; and Beck-Nichols, who apparently early on figured out that she was being followed and sought to evade surveillance, spent little time at the J.

She lived in Williamsville when initially appointed, and the evidence developed during the investigation, discussed earlier, might have reasonably caused the Board to conclude that she never abandoned her domicile there. The trial judge did not decide whether the Board\u2019s decision with respect to Luchey\u2019s residency was rational because he disposed of her case (and Adrian\u2019s) on the ground the policy was unenforceable. We can surmise that the Appellate Division affirmed in <em>Luchey </em>on alternative grounds, given its decision in <em>Adrian </em>upholding the Board\u2019s application of the policy. The Appellate Division affirmed in <em>Luchey </em>without opinion, though, so we do not know the basis for its ruling. In light of this circumstance, we must presume that the Appellate Division, like Supreme Court, did not consider the merits; therefore, we remit for Supreme Court to resolve in the first instance whether the Board\u2019s determination that Luchey did not comply with the residency policy was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Accordingly, in <em>Beck-Nichols </em>the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed; in <em>Adrian, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>be affirmed, with costs; and in <em>Luchey, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith and Pigott concur; Judge Rivera taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Matter of Beck-Nichols v Bianco: </em>Judgment reversed, with costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In <em>Matter of Adrian v Board of Educ. of City Sch.

According to the District\u2019s attorney, the Board considered the residency of 27 employees, and final determinations were made with respect to 20 of them. Of these 20, seven were sent letters indicating that they complied with the residency policy; the employment of six employees (including Beck-Nichols) was terminated; court action blocked action in one case; four employees resigned; one employee retired; and another employee agreed in writing to comply with the residency policy within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">.
