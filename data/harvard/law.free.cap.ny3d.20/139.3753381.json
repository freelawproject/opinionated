We hold that respondent exceeded his statutory authority and that the Appellate Division\u2019s decision to issue a writ of prohibition proscribing enforcement of his orders was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The genesis of this appeal stems from an investigation initiated by petitioner and other agencies in June 2006 relating to the illegal sale of steroids and other prescription drugs over the Internet. As a result of this investigation, an Albany County grand jury returned an indictment against the defendants in early 2007. Petitioner then obtained two successive superseding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>indictments. The defendants challenged the third indictment and respondent partially granted their motion to dismiss with leave to the People to re-present. After petitioner procured a fourth indictment, respondent, once again, granted the defendants\u2019 dismissal motion, but this time without leave to the People to re-present.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The People appealed respondent\u2019s dismissal of the fourth indictment to the Appellate Division. The court modified respondent\u2019s order by granting the People leave to re-present <em>(see People v Loomis, </em>70 AD3d 1199, 1201 [3d Dept 2010]). During the pendency of the People\u2019s appeal, the defendants commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against petitioner and his staff, alleging, among other claims, that their federal constitutional rights had been violated during the prosecution of the criminal case. The defendants further asserted Florida state law causes of action. As the federal civil case proceeded, petitioner obtained a fifth indictment against the defendants. Shortly after this indictment was returned, Federal District Court issued a decision, concluding that petitioner was not entitled to immunity or summary judgment with respect to the constitutional claims lodged against him and his staff. District Court also denied petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the state common-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Meanwhile, the defendants moved in County Court to dismiss the fifth indictment. By order dated November 15, 2010, respondent granted the dismissal motion with leave to re-present, but disqualified the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cfrom further prosecution of this matter.\u201d Respondent reasoned that the pending civil lawsuit against petitioner and his staff created \u201ca conflict of interest sufficient to warrant dismissal of the indictment\u201d in that their \u201cpersonal, professional and financial stake in the outcome of both the civil and criminal cases\u201d establishes a \u201cdemonstrable potential for prejudice.\u201d In a subsequent order, dated November 22, 2010, respondent appointed a special district attorney from the community to handle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">As a result, petitioner commenced a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 in the Appellate Division seeking to prohibit enforcement of respondent\u2019s orders <em>(see </em>CPLR 506 [b] [1]). With two Justices dissenting, the Appellate Division granted the petition, vacated the orders and prohibited respondent \u201cfrom taking any action in reliance on said orders\u201d <em>(Matter of Soares v Herrick, </em>88 AD3d 148, 157 [3d Dept 2011]). As a threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>matter, the majority determined that respondent\u2019s actions were \u201creviewable by way of a proceeding in the nature of prohibition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 152). Addressing the merits, the majority held that respondent exceeded his authority when he disqualified petitioner and appointed a special district attorney under County Law \u00a7 701 <em>(see id.). </em>The majority observed that \u201c[t]he appearance of impropriety, standing alone, may not cause the disqualification of a district attorney\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 152) and concluded that the defendants here have failed to \u201cdemonstrate [ ] that petitioner\u2019s continued prosecution of their cases would result in actual prejudice\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 154 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The dissenting Justices would have dismissed the petition. In their view, respondent did not exceed his authority when he disqualified petitioner \u201con the basis of a conflict of interest\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 154-155). Citing to our decision in <em>Matter of Kavanagh v Vogt </em>(58 NY2d 678 [1982]), the dissenters further opined that the question of whether such conflict warranted disqualification was \u201ca question of law not reviewable by way of prohibition\u201d <em>(Matter of Soares, </em>88 AD3d at 155). The defendants appeal as of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a) and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Our analysis begins with the recognition that a \u201c[djistrict [a]ttorney is a constitutional officer chosen by the electors of a county\u201d <em>(Matter of Dondi v Jones, </em>40 NY2d 8, 19 [1976], citing NY Const, art XIII, \u00a7 13). County Law \u00a7 700 vests a district attorney with certain statutory duties including the duty \u201cto conduct all prosecutions for crimes and offenses cognizable by the courts of the county for which he or she shall have been elected or appointed\u201d (County Law \u00a7 700 [1]; <em>Matter of Dondi, </em>40 NY2d at 19). We have observed that a district attorney\u2019s broad statutory authority to prosecute all crimes and offenses within his or her jurisdiction is generally nondelegable <em>(see People v Soddano, </em>86 NY2d 727, 728 [1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">However, there are certain circumstances where a court may substitute the elected district attorney and appoint a special district attorney. As relevant here, County Law \u00a7 701 (1) allows a court to appoint a special district attorney in situations where the district attorney is \u201cdisqualified from acting in a particular case to discharge his or her duties at a term of any court.\u201d In <em>People v Leahy </em>(72 NY2d 510 [1988]), we stated that the legislature designed this statute \u201cnarrowly by its terms and by its purpose to fill emergency gaps in an elected prosecutorial official\u2019s responsibility\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 513). Acknowledging that a court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>authority under County Law \u00a7 701 \u201cto displace a duly elected [district [a]ttorney\u201d raises separation of power concerns, we cautioned that \u201c[t]his exceptional superseder authority should not be expansively interpreted\u201d <em>(Leahy, </em>72 NY2d at 513-514).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">With this background in place, the defendants argue that respondent\u2019s decision to disqualify petitioner and appoint a special district attorney was in accordance with County Law \u00a7 701. They further contend that, in any event, relief through a writ of prohibition is unavailable to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201c It is familiar law that an article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition will not lie to correct procedural or substantive errors of law\u201d <em>(Matter of Schumer v Holtzman, </em>60 NY2d 46, 51 [1983], citing <em>Matter of Morgenthau v Erlbaum, </em>59 NY2d 143, 147 [1983]). Rather, the extraordinary remedy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cof prohibition may be obtained only when a clear legal right of a petitioner is threatened by a body or officer acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity \u2018without jurisdiction in a matter over which it has no power over the subject matter or where it exceeds its authorized powers in a proceeding of which it has jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Morgenthau, </em>59 NY2d at 147, quoting <em>Matter of Dondi, </em>40 NY2d at 13).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In the context of this case, we have recognized that \u201cprohibition is an appropriate remedy to void the improper appointment of a [special] prosecutor when made by a court\u201d <em>(Matter of Schumer, </em>60 NY2d at 54). To the extent that <em>Matter of Kavanagh v Vogt </em>(58 NY2d 678 [1982]) stands for the proposition that a court\u2019s decision to disqualify a district attorney is not reviewable by way of prohibition, that case is no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Of course, even where prohibition is an available remedy, it \u201cis not mandatory, but may issue in the sound discretion of the court\u201d <em>(La Rocca v Lane, </em>37 NY2d 575, 579 [1975]).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cIn exercising this discretion, various factors are to be considered, such as the gravity of the harm caused by the excess of power, the availability or unavailability of an adequate remedy on appeal or at law or in equity and the remedial effectiveness of prohibition if such an adequate remedy does not exist\u201d (M<em>atter of Dondi, </em>40 NY2d at 13; <em>see La Rocca, </em>37 NY2d at 579-580).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Applying these principles to the facts presented in this case, we conclude that respondent exceeded his authority under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>County Law \u00a7 701 in disqualifying petitioner. In <em>Matter of Schumer, </em>we opined that \u201ccourts, as a general rule, should remove a public prosecutor <em>only </em>to protect a defendant from <em>actual prejudice </em>arising from a demonstrated conflict of interest or a substantial risk of an abuse of confidence\u201d (60 NY2d at 55 [emphasis added]). Here, there is no record support for the conclusion that the defendants suffered actual prejudice or any risk thereof in connection with petitioner\u2019s prosecution of the criminal case. On that note, the defendants do not quarrel with the Appellate Division\u2019s previous determination that petitioner\u2019s handling of this criminal case during the time he secured the first four indictments lacked \u201cany improper motive\u201d or was rooted in \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or \u201cbad faith\u201d <em>(Loomis, </em>70 AD3d at 1201-1202; <em>see Matter of Soares, 88 </em>AD3d at 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Instead, the defendants contend that the disqualification of petitioner was proper because of the necessary conflict of interest that arose from the civil lawsuit they initiated after respondent dismissed the fourth indictment. We cannot agree. Under our precedent, the existence of a conflict of interest between the district attorney and a defendant, by itself, does not warrant the removal of the district attorney; in addition, a defendant \u201cshould demonstrate actual prejudice or so substantial a risk thereof as could not be ignored\u201d <em>(Matter of Schumer, </em>60 NY2d at 55). Here, the defendants do not point to any prejudice suffered in connection with the fifth indictment returned by the Albany County grand jury. Indeed, this indictment contains virtually identical charges to the fourth indictment, which was obtained well before the defendants filed the civil lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Moreover, respondent\u2019s rationale for removing petitioner is likewise unavailing. In his written decision, respondent identifies the purported conflict\u2014petitioner\u2019s \u201cpersonal, professional and financial stake in the outcome of both the civil and criminal cases\u201d\u2014and cites the mere \u201cpotential for prejudice\u201d as his basis for disqualifying petitioner and his staff.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Given the absence of a finding by respondent of \u201cactual prejudice\u201d <em>(id.) </em>and, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>again, acknowledging that a court\u2019s \u201cexceptional superseder authority should not be expansively interpreted\u201d <em>(Leahy, </em>72 NY2d at 513-514), respondent\u2019s decision to disqualify petitioner and to appoint a special district attorney was in excess of his authority under County Law \u00a7 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In sum, while we refrain from concluding that a civil lawsuit commenced by a criminal defendant against a duly elected district attorney in the midst of a pending prosecution will never warrant the disqualification of such district attorney, we see no basis for petitioner\u2019s disqualification here. Thus, having determined that respondent exceeded his statutory authority, we further conclude that the Appellate Division weighed the relevant factors in determining whether to exercise its discretion in issuing the writ of prohibition and that the court\u2019s decision to do so was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Judgment affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> At this juncture in the federal lawsuit, the federal constitutional claims against petitioner and his staff have been dismissed. Following District Court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court, concluding that summary judgment should have been granted in favor of petitioner on the federal claims <em>(see Signature Pharm., Inc. v Soares, </em>448 Fed Appx 917 [11th Cir 2011]). On October 1, 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari (\u2014 US \u2014, 133 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Ct 167 [2012]). Thus, the only claims that remain pending are the Florida common-law causes of action. We agree with the Appellate Division that these claims \u201cfall far short of demonstrating the actual prejudice needed to remove [him] from prosecution of the case\u201d <em>(Matter of Soares, </em>88 AD3d at 154 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
