Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>75 NY2d 711.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b600-6\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The question presented on this appeal is whether claimant\u2019s <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plea should be given preclusive effect in a subsequent workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. Because it cannot be said that the guilty plea necessarily resolved the issue raised in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, preclusive effect should not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In March 2003, claimant, David Howard, sustained a back injury while employed by respondent Stature Electric, Inc. He applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. At a workers\u2019 compensation hearing, when asked, claimant testified that he had no employment outside of his job with Stature Electric.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">In November 2005, claimant was arrested and faced four charges: insurance fraud in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 176.20), grand larceny in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 155.35), offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 175.35), and a violation of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 114, entitled \u201cPenalties For Fraudulent Practices,\u201d which defines various fraudulent acts under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and classifies them as E felonies. Ultimately, claimant entered a plea of guilty to only one charge, insurance fraud in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 176.15), in satisfaction of all charges. He did so, according to the record, by entering an <em>\u201cAlford </em>plea,\u201d i.e., he was pleading guilty as defense counsel said, because of the \u201crisks involved in going to trial\u201d and \u201cwithout an admission of [any] wrongdoing.\u201d The court accepted his plea without any allocution as to the facts underlying it, and sentenced him to an agreed-upon conditional discharge, restitution of an unknown amount, and a certificate of relief from disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">At a subsequent workers\u2019 compensation hearing, the State Insurance Fund (SIF), Stature Electric\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, sought to preclude claimant from further benefits based upon the guilty plea. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge denied the application on the ground that the plea \u201cdid not contain a factual allocution such that it could be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that the plea matched the carrier\u2019s claim of a violation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board modified, by giving preclusive effect to Howard\u2019s guilty plea and finding that Howard violated Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 114-a. The Appellate Division reversed and remitted for further proceedings, reasoning that \u201cthe requirement of identicality was not met and collateral estoppel does not apply\u201d because, when claimant entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, he made no factual admissions and the transcript of the plea proceedings lacked any discussion of the factual basis for the charge <em>(Matter of Howard v Stature Elec., Inc., </em>72 AD3d 1167, 1170 [3d Dept 2010]). We agree and therefore affirm the final Workers\u2019 Compensation Board decision and the Appellate Division order brought up for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In New York, <em>\u201cAlford </em>pleas are\u2014and should be\u2014rare\u201d <em>(Matter of Silmon v Travis, </em>95 NY2d 470, 474 [2000]). Such a plea is allowed only when, as <em>in Alford </em>itself, \u201cit is the product of a voluntary and rational choice, and the record before the court contains strong evidence of actual guilt\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 475). And we have said that \u201cfrom the State\u2019s perspective <em>[.Alford </em>pleas] are no different from other guilty pleas; it would otherwise be unconscionable for a court to sentence an individual to a term of imprisonment\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Indeed, we have made clear that an <em>Alford </em>plea may generally be used for the same purposes as any other conviction and that, like any other guilty plea, it may be used as a predicate for civil and criminal penalties <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Thus, as we would with any plea, we consider two factors when determining whether preclusive effect should be given: First, whether the identical issue was necessarily decided in the prior action or proceeding and is decisive of the present action, and second, whether the party who is attempting to relitigate the issue had a full and fair opportunity to contest it in the prior action or proceeding <em>(see Kaufman v Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 449, 455 [1985]). Importantly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201c[t]he party seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel has the burden of demonstrating the identity of the issues in the present litigation and the prior determination, whereas the party attempting to defeat its application has the burden of establishing the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 456).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Here, the plea colloquy preceding claimant\u2019s insurance fraud conviction included no reference to the facts underlying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>conviction, so it is impossible to conclude that the conviction was based upon the same circumstances alleged to be fraudulent in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. SIF therefore failed to meet its burden of proving identity of issue. As a result, the plea did not prohibit claimant from challenging the workers\u2019 compensation violation alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read and Smith concur; Judge Rivera taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> <em>North Carolina v Alford, </em>400 US 25 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
