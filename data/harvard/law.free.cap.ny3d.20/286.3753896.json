(EchoStar), a national satellite television provider, better known as \u201cDISH Network,\u201d operates a number of orbital satellites that broadcast television signals directly to the homes of millions of its subscribers. In order to deliver the programming, EchoStar supplies a customer with a satellite dish and other equipment, including a \u201clow-noise block feedhorn\u201d (LNBF), a set-top box receiver, a switch and a remote control. The LNBF is a component part, attached to the dish, that receives the satellite signals and converts them to a lower frequency for transmittal to a receiver. The receiver, in turn, translates the data and projects images onto a television screen. The switch allows a subscriber to watch different programs on multiple receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Prior to 2000, EchoStar required a subscriber to purchase the necessary equipment at the commencement of a service contract. In May 2000, it changed this practice and began renting the equipment to subscribers through customer lease agreements. Under this new procedure, EchoStar would take possession of the equipment upon the termination of a customer\u2019s programming service and refurbish the equipment for use by another subscriber.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although EchoStar did not issue separate bills for the equipment rentals, its invoices separately listed a $5 monthly \u201cequipment fee\u201d for each receiver. The lease agreement also indicated that the annual cost for an additional receiver was $60, or $5 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Between March 2000 and February 2004, EchoStar did not pay sales or use taxes on its equipment purchases from the manufacturers. Instead, EchoStar collected sales taxes from its customers at the time the equipment was leased to them. The sales taxes collected from the subscribers\u2014totaling approximately $2 million\u2014were remitted to the Department of Taxation and Finance (the Department). Following a lengthy audit in 2005, the Department issued a notice of determination assessing EchoStar an additional $1.8 million in use taxes for the same period on the basis that EchoStar owed taxes at the time it purchased the equipment from manufacturers. When the Department refused to credit the $2 million EchoStar had previously remitted toward the new assessment, EchoStar paid the additional taxes under protest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge agreed with the Department\u2019s analysis and, on appeal, respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) upheld the notice of determination. Although EchoStar charged its customers an equipment fee, the Tribunal did not consider this arrangement the equivalent of a \u201clease\u201d and it viewed the equipment as \u201cpurely incidental\u201d to EchoStar\u2019s primary business of selling satellite television programming.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Appellate Division confirmed the Tribunal\u2019s determination in a subsequent CPLR article 78 proceeding, similarly holding that \u201cthe equipment was provided as a part of petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>services and the additional charge in its monthly bills was merely an \u2018add-on\u2019 for the use of the equipment, not a true rental\u201d <em>(Matter of EchoStar Satellite Corp. v Tax Appeals Trib. of the State of N.Y., </em>79 AD3d 1307, 1309 [3d Dept 2010] [some internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted]). We granted EchoStar\u2019s motion for leave to appeal (17 NY3d 701 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Article 28 of the Tax Law sets forth the definitions of a \u201cretail sale\u201d and a \u201csale\u201d and creates an exemption from sales and use taxes for purchases made for resale. Specifically, Tax Law \u00a7 1110 (a) states that \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that property or services have already been or will be subject to the sales tax under this article, there is hereby imposed on every person a use tax for the use within this state ... of any tangible personal property <em>purchased at </em>retail\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A \u201cretail sale\u201d is described as \u201c[a] sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose, other than . . . <em>for resale as </em>such\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 1101 [b] [4] [i] [A] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, the statute imposes a use tax on EchoStar\u2019s purchases except for property that is bought for \u201cresale as such.\u201d The resale exemption is the focus of EchoStar\u2019s challenge to the Tribunal\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Although the statute does not define the term \u201cresale,\u201d we have deemed its definition to be coextensive with that of \u201csale\u201d <em>(see Matter of Albany Calcium Light Co. v State Tax Commn., </em>44 NY2d 986, 987 [1978]). Tax Law \u00a7 1101 (b) (5) broadly provides that the term \u201csale\u201d includes \u201c[a]ny transfer of title or possession or both, . . . rental, lease or license to use or consume ... in any manner or by any means whatsoever for a consideration, or any agreement therefor.\u201d Hence, we have made clear that \u201ca purchaser who acquires an item for the purpose of sale or rental . . . purchases it for resale within the meaning of the statute\u201d <em>(Matter of Albany Calcium Light Co., </em>44 NY2d at 987).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">EchoStar asserts that it obtained the satellite equipment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>order to resell or lease it to its customers, qualifying its equipment purchases for the resale exemption. Consistent with this position, it contends that it properly collected taxes upon the subsequent leases of the equipment to its subscribers. The Department concedes that in those instances when EchoStar\u2019s customers exercised the option to purchase the equipment, the transactions were eligible for the resale exclusion. But it maintains that the other arrangement\u2014the furnishing of equipment for a monthly fee\u2014did not qualify as a \u201clease\u201d and, consequently, was not a resale under the Tax Law. The dispositive issue then is whether EchoStar \u201cleased\u201d the equipment to its customers within the meaning of the statute. We agree with EchoStar that it did and therefore reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Our analysis begins with <em>Matter of Galileo Intl. Partnership v Tax Appeals Trib. of Dept. of Taxation &amp; Fin. of State of N.Y. </em>(31 AD3d 1072 [3d Dept 2006]), which informs the outcome of this appeal. In <em>Galileo, </em>the Appellate Division upheld the Department\u2019s assessment of sales and use taxes on a company\u2019s provision of computer equipment to its service subscribers <em>(id. </em>at 1075). The company operated a proprietary computer reservation system through which its clients (mostly travel agencies) could obtain information and make reservations for flights, car rentals, hotels and cruises. Together with the software, the company furnished the subscribing agencies with computer equipment for use in accessing the system. The company retained title to the equipment and, presumably, the right to repossess it upon termination of the service agreement. In confirming the Department\u2019s determination that the provision of the equipment constituted a lease arrangement, the Appellate Division emphasized that the subscriber agreements were structured as leases, the contracts referred to the computers as being \u201cleased,\u201d the monthly charges were proportional to the volume of the equipment provided, and the travel agents could use the terminals for business purposes other than connection to the company\u2019s reservation system <em>(id. </em>at 1074-1075). As a result, the tax was properly imposed on the company\u2019s leasing of the equipment to its customers rather than at the time it purchased the equipment from manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The Department\u2019s imposition of a use tax on EchoStar\u2019s initial procurement of the satellite equipment in this case is difficult to reconcile with <em>Galileo, </em>where it assessed the tax on the subsequent equipment leases. Moreover, nearly all of the factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>considered in <em>Galileo </em>to denote a lease are present here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Competent evidence adduced at the administrative hearing indicates that EchoStar\u2019s customer agreements were structured as leases, distinguishing the service component from the provision of equipment; the equipment rental fees were directly proportional to the number of receivers provided; and the equipment charges were separately delineated on monthly invoices. The record demonstrates that EchoStar plainly satisfied its burden of proving that, as in <em>Galileo, </em>\u201cthe transfer of equipment was a lease and that such was a significant part of the transaction, not merely a trivial element of a contract for services\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1075). Hence, we conclude that EchoStar purchased the equipment for \u201cresale\u201d consistent with the definition of the tax exemption afforded by Tax Law \u00a7 1101 (b) (4) (i) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Contrary to the Department\u2019s position, we see no distinction, for the purpose of the resale exclusion, between the outright purchase of equipment and its temporary transfer for valuable consideration. Both types of transactions fit comfortably within the statutory definition of \u201csale\u201d as they involve either the transfer of title or possession <em>(see </em>Tax Law \u00a7 1101 [b] [5]). Furthermore, EchoStar\u2019s provision of satellite equipment is far from \u201cincidental.\u201d Unlike the petitioner in <em>Matter of Albany Calcium Light Co. </em>(44 NY2d at 988), whose rental charges were conditioned on the customers\u2019 failure to timely return its property, EchoStar\u2019s equipment charges were consistently part of its business model, either in the context of purchases or incorporated within its lease agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Finally, it cannot be overlooked that the result sought by the Department\u2014the State\u2019s retention of the $2 million in sales tax that EchoStar collected from its customers when it leased the equipment in addition to the levy of $1.8 million in use taxes on EchoStar\u2019s equipment purchases from the manufacturers\u2014 would amount to an unwarranted windfall to the State <em>(see Matter of Burger King v State Tax Commn., </em>51 NY2d 614, 623 [1980] [the general purpose underlying our sales tax law \u201cis to impose the tax only upon the sale to the ultimate consumer, at which time the price paid for the taxable item would presumably be at its highest\u201d]; <em>Matter of Pantelopoulos v Commissioner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>213 AD2d 768, 769 [3d Dept 1995]). As such, the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal must be annulled and EchoStar is entitled to a refund of the $1.8 million payment plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Accordingly, the judgment should be reversed, with costs, respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal\u2019s determination annulled and the matter remitted to the Appellate Division, Third Department, with directions to remand to respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs, determination of respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal annulled, and matter remitted to the Appellate Division, Third Department, with directions to remand to respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. According to EchoStar\u2019s senior accounting manager, the company continued to offer the purchase option to its subscribers but approximately 90% of them elected to lease the equipment during the time period relevant to this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. Together with interest, this second payment totaled more than $2.4 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">. The use tax is generally employed \u201cto complement the sales tax by taxing property brought into and used within the State under circumstances that prevent collection of the sales tax\u201d <em>(Matter of Datascope Corp. v Tax Appeals Trib. of State of N.Y., </em>196 AD2d 35, 39 [3d Dept 1994]). In this case, Echo-Star\u2019s purchases of the equipment at issue occurred outside the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\">. A \u201c[p]urchase at retail\u201d is similarly defined as \u201c[a] purchase by any person for any purpose other than\u201d for resale as such (Tax Law \u00a7 1101 [b] [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">. The Department attempts to distinguish <em>Galileo </em>on the basis that Echo-Star\u2019s customers could not use the satellite equipment for any other purpose. However, we do not consider this distinction to be dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
