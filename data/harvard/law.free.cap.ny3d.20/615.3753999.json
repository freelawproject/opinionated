L., who was in her mid-80s, was steered to defendant Gerard Ippolito, an accountant, to help her deal with delinquent property taxes on her Rochester residence. On June 27th of that year, she executed a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>short-form durable general power of attorney (the POA), which granted Ippolito unlimited powers to act in her \u201cNAME, PLACE AND STEAD in any way which [she herself] could do, if [she] were personally present... to the extent that [she was] permitted by law to act through an agent\u201d with respect to a long list of subjects, including \u201creal estate transactions,\u201d \u201cbanking transactions,\u201d \u201ctax matters,\u201d and \u201call other matters.\u201d The POA was recorded at the Monroe County Clerk\u2019s Office on July 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Shortly after securing the POA, Ippolito set up a business checking account at HSBC Bank denominated \u201cEastside Professional Services[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Special Escrow Account for Katherine M. [L.],\u201d under his sole control, into which he funneled Katherine M. L.\u2019s income from Social Security, a pension, and payments from two trusts. By the time Katherine M. L. revoked the POA on July 28, 2006, Ippolito had allegedly stolen at least $696,000 from her. Additionally, he did not pay all required federal and state taxes on Katherine M. L.\u2019s income while he was managing her affairs, which resulted in a tax liability of roughly $500,000. Ippolito was accused of carrying out his thefts principally by making out checks to Katherine M. L. or obtaining bank checks made out to her from the HSBC account, endorsing these checks in her name, and depositing the proceeds into accounts he maintained at another bank. Ippolito did not indicate on the checks that he, rather than Katherine M. L., was the actual signer of her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The grand jury handed down a 46-count indictment charging Ippolito with one count of second-degree grand larceny, a class C felony (Penal Law \u00a7 155.40 [1] [the value of the property alleged to have been stolen exceeds $50,000]), and 45 counts of second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument (CPFI), a class D felony (Penal Law \u00a7 170.25), 42 of which related to the checks that he endorsed in Katherine M. L.\u2019s name, and three of which involved other instruments (a certificate of incorporation and two specific powers of attorney). At Ippolito\u2019s jury trial in September 2007, the People presented evidence that the customary practice when signing a principal\u2019s name pursuant to a power of attorney was for the agent to sign his own name as well, along with the letters \u201cPOA\u201d; they argued that Ippolito defrauded the bank by neglecting to do this. At the close of the People\u2019s case and again at the close of proof, Ippolito\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>attorney unsuccessfully sought a trial order of dismissal. He maintained that because the POA vested Ippolito with the legal right to sign Katherine M. L.\u2019s name on the checks, his act in doing so was not forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Just as the judge began to charge the jury, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cTRIAL JUROR: Can I ask a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re not supposed to, but go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cTRIAL JUROR: I just want to know if we would have a copy of the law in the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Good question. The answer to that is no. I\u2019ll read it to you as many times as you request, but you cannot get a copy to go back there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The jury found Ippolito guilty on all counts of the indictment save two: count 16, which related to a check Ippolito endorsed by signing both \u201cEastside Prof Services Escrow Acct\u201d and Katherine M. L.\u2019s name; and count 27, which related to a check he endorsed by signing his own name in addition to Katherine M. L.\u2019s. On October 31, 2007, the judge sentenced Ippolito as a second felony offender to 14V2 to 29 years in prison, and ordered him to pay $696,595.14 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">On appeal, Ippolito made three arguments: that the proof was legally insufficient to support his convictions of the 40 check-related crimes; that the judge committed reversible error by answering the juror\u2019s question without consulting the parties; and that the judge was required to hold a hearing with respect to the amount of restitution. By decision dated November 10, 2011, the Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, reversed Ippolito\u2019s 40 check-related CPFI convictions and dismissed those counts of the indictment;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> vacated the amount of restitution ordered and remitted for a hearing to determine the proper sum; and otherwise affirmed (89 AD3d 1369 [4th Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The court concluded that the evidence was not legally sufficient to convict Ippolito of the 40 check-related crimes because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201cthe ostensible maker of the checks, i.e., the victim, authorized the actual maker of the checks, i.e., defendant, to make the checks, \u2018which purport[ ] to be [the] authentic creation[s]\u2019 of the victim. Thus, it cannot be said that the checks in question were falsely made, although \u2018recitals in the instrument may be false\u2019 or defendant may have exceeded the scope of authority delegated to him by the victim\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1369-1370 [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Citing Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 (2), the court further ruled that the judge was required to conduct a hearing to determine the amount of restitution upon Ippolito\u2019s request and \u201cirrespective of the level of evidence in the record\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1370 [internal quotation marks omitted]); and considered the alleged error in responding to the juror\u2019s question to be unpreserved and, in any event, meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The dissenting Justice disagreed only with the majority\u2019s reversal of the 40 check-related CPFI convictions. In his view, the checks were forgeries because Katherine M. L. testified that she did not \u201cgive [Ippolito] permission\u201d to sign her name on the individual checks, which \u201cbore no indication that [he] was acting in a representative capacity or under the authority of a power of attorney\u201d; and the jury \u201cobviously concluded\u201d as a factual matter \u201cthat [Ippolito] did not act under the [POA]\u2014 regardless of any authority that it may have conferred upon him\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1370-1371 [Garni, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The dissenting Justice granted the People\u2019s motion for leave to appeal (18 NY3d 929 [2012]);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereafter, a Judge of this Court granted Ippolito permission to appeal as well (18 NY3d 925 [2012]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">A person is guilty of second-degree CPFI \u201cwhen, with knowledge that it is forged and with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he utters or possesses any forged instrument\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 170.25); and a written instrument, such as a check, is \u201cforged\u201d when \u201cfalsely made, completed or altered\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 170.00 [7]). A \u201cfalsely made\u201d written instrument \u201cpurports to be an authentic creation of its ostensible maker or drawer, but... is not such either because the ostensible maker or drawer is fictitious or <em>because, if real, he did not authorize </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>the making or drawing thereof\u2019 </em>(Penal Law \u00a7 170.00 [4] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The People assert that \u201c[e]ach time [Ippolito] signed [Katherine M. L.\u2019s] name, without indicating the POA relationship, and offered the check, he presented an instrument which purported to be what it was not, the personal act of [Katherine M. L.].\u201d They liken this case (as did the dissent below) to <em>People v Shanley </em>(132 App Div 821 [1st Dept 1909], <em>affd on op below </em>196 NY 574 [1909]), stating that in both instances \u201can agent sign[ed] the principal\u2019s name without any POA notation thereby offering a false instrument as being the personal act and signature of the principal, and in turn obtaining proceeds to benefit himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In <em>Shanley, </em>the defendant, an attorney, was convicted of first-degree forgery (former Penal Law \u00a7 884)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in signing and uttering as true an instrument satisfying a mortgage on which he admittedly signed the name of his client, Miss Julia A. Smith, and to which an acknowledgment was annexed. He received $25,000 in discharge of the mortgage, and spent it for his own purposes. When the fraud was discovered, the defendant fled the state. He subsequently surrendered under an agreement that he would not be indicted for grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">According to the trial testimony of the commissioner of deeds, who took the acknowledgment, the defendant introduced him to \u201ca lady, Miss Smith\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 823). Although the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\u201chad. never met that woman before,\u201d and she did not sign the satisfaction piece in his presence, \u201cshe acknowledged it\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 823-824). He added that this \u201cMiss Julia A. Smith\u201d was not the same person as the Miss Julia A. Smith whom he later met at the district attorney\u2019s office, and who was present in the courtroom. The defendant disputed this. He testified that he reached Miss Smith on the telephone and asked her to tell the commissioner, who was in his office at the time, that it was \u201call right\u201d for him to have signed her name on the mortgage satisfaction; and that after speaking with Miss Smith over the telephone, the commissioner certified that she had executed this document <em>(id. </em>at 823). Miss Smith denied that any such conversation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">As the Appellate Division recounted, the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201chaving admitted that he signed the name Julia A. Smith to the satisfaction of the mortgage, and having attempted to justify the acknowledgment by his story of a telephonic acknowledgment to [the commissioner, then sought] to justify this transaction upon the ground that he was acting under a power of attorney\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 824).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Miss Smith had indeed given the defendant a power of attorney, which he contended was sufficiently broad so as to permit him to sign her name to the satisfaction of mortgage and to procure the acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201c[w]hatever authority may have been conferred by that power of attorney[J it certainly did not authorize the execution and acknowledgment of the instrument set up in the indictment. That instrument, upon its face, was a forgery; <em>upon its face it purported to bear the signature of Julia A. Smith, and that she had personally acknowledged it before the commissioner of deeds. </em>As it is conceded that she did not sign it, and as the evidence establishes that she did not appear personally before the commissioner of deeds and acknowledge the same, the People established in the first instance that it was a forged instrument. The burden of explanation then fell upon the defendant, who undertook to explain <em>dehors </em>the instrument that it had been executed by authority, and, therefore, he was not guilty of forgery\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 829 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The Appellate Division, in affirming Shanley\u2019s conviction, considered his agency defense unavailing because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cas [a] matter of law . . . [the] power of attorney was not authority for the execution and delivery of the satisfaction of the mortgage and the acknowledgment thereto .... The whole instrument was a forgery; it purported to be what it was not, viz., <em>the personal act of Julia A. Smith in both signing and appearing personally before the commissioner of deeds and acknowledging her signature\u201d (id. </em>at 830 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Although the People characterize <em>Shanley </em>as a \u201ccritical Court of Appeals case\u201d that is \u201cright on point both factually and legally,\u201d this is simply not so. <em>Shanley </em>is factually very different from this case, involving, as it does, the execution of an acknowledgment falsely verifying that Miss Smith personally signed the satisfaction of mortgage. Additionally, there was some dispute as to the scope of the power of attorney, which is not the situation here. And further, when <em>Shanley </em>was decided New York\u2019s Penal Law did not define \u201cfalse making,\u201d whereas the revised Penal Law, adopted in 1965, clarifies that this term does not encompass documents whose making or drawing is authorized <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 170.00 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Finally, no matter what, if any, potency <em>Shanley </em>may retain as precedent, it does not, as the People claim, endorse the proposition that a written instrument is falsely made any time an agent signs the principal\u2019s name without indicating the principal-agent relationship. Precedent predating 1909 held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201cwhile it is the preferable way for an agent in executing any instrument in the name of the principal to add his own name as agent, so that the instrument may show by what person the signature was written, <em>still in law the writing of the name of the principal alone is sufficient\u201d (Youngs v Perry, </em>42 App Div 247, 248 [2d Dept 1899] [emphasis added]; <em>see also </em>1 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 296 at 564 [1920] [\u201c(T)hough it is desirable for the agent to indicate that the principal\u2019s name has been signed by the agent, and not by the principal personally, it is legally a sufficient execution to bind the principal if the agent, without disclosing in the body of the instrument or in the signature that the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>was not acting personally signs the name of the principal\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at 564 n 73 [commenting that the rule stated in <em>Wood v Goodridge </em>(60 Mass 117 [1850]), \u201cthat it should appear on the face of the instrument that it was executed by an agent and by virtue of authority delegated to him, cannot be supported\u201d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In 2008, though, the legislature amended the General Obligations Law to mandate that agents engaging in a transaction where a handwritten signature is required must sign in a way that discloses the principal-agent relationship <em>(see </em>L 2008, ch 644; General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-1507 [1] [a]; <em>see also </em>General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-1507 [1] [b] [third parties do not incur any liability for accepting a handwritten signature that does not conform to the statutory requirements]).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Here, the POA (until revoked) vested Ippolito with unlimited power to sign Katherine M. L.\u2019s name on written instruments. As a result, the checks cannot have been forgeries <em>(see People v Cannarozzo, </em>62 AD2d 503, 504 [4th Dept 1978, Simons, J.], <em>affd </em>48 NY2d 687 [1979] [\u201c(A) person does not \u2018falsely make\u2019 an instrument when he is authorized to execute it\u201d]). Put another way, where the ostensible maker or drawer of a written instrument is a real person, a signature is not forged unless unauthorized <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 170.00 [4]). Since Ippolito was empowered to sign Katherine M. L.\u2019s name at the times when he drew or endorsed the 40 checks at issue on this appeal, the People\u2019s proof was legally insufficient to convict him of CPFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Ippolito disputes his convictions for grand larceny and the three non-check-related counts of CPFI on the ground that the trial judge committed reversible error when he answered a juror\u2019s question without first soliciting comments from the parties. As related earlier, just as the judge began to charge the jury a juror spoke up, asking whether jurors \u201cwould have a copy of the law\u201d in the jury room, and the judge immediately answered that he would not permit this. Counsel must be afforded an opportunity to suggest a meaningful response to any jury question arising during deliberations <em>(see People v O\u2019Rama, </em>78 NY2d 270 [1991]; <em>see also </em>CPL 310.30 [a deliberating jury may request additional information or instruction \u201cwith respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>to any . . . matter pertinent to (its) consideration of the case . . . (and) the court . . . after notice to both the people and counsel for the defendant . . . must give such requested information or instruction as (it) deems proper\u201d]). Whether or not section 310.30, as interpreted in <em>O\u2019Rama, </em>applies in this situation, where a juror voices a question in open court before deliberations begin, Ippolito\u2019s attorney was required to make a timely objection. He was present when the question was asked and answered, yet failed to object at that time, when the judge could have easily cured the claimed error <em>(see People v Ramirez, </em>15 NY3d 824, 826 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith and Pigott concur; Judge Rivera taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">. \u201cEastside Professional Services\u201d was the corporate name of Ippolito\u2019s business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-13\">.
