In the CBA, the City agreed to offer its firefighters the option of enrolling in one of two retirement plans, and agreed that it would bear \u201cthe complete cost\u201d of contributions, \u201cpursuant to . . . State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In 2009, in response to the fiscal crisis, Governor Paterson and the legislature ended the right of newly hired firefighters to join such noncontributory pension plans. The legislature enacted article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, effective in January 2010, which placed new members of the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System in a new tier of pension benefits\u2014tier 5\u2014requiring members to contribute 3% of their salaries toward their pensions <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 1204).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The focus of this appeal is a narrow exception provided in section 8 of the 2009 legislation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, nothing in this act shall limit the eligibility of any member of an employee organization to join a special retirement plan open to him or her pursuant to a collectively negotiated agreement with any state or local government employer, where such agreement is <em>in effect </em>on the effective date of this act and so long as such agreement remains in effect thereafter; <em>provided, however, that any such eligibility shall not apply upon termination of such agreement </em>for employees otherwise subject to the provisions of article twenty-two of the retirement and social security law\u201d (L 2009, ch 504, part A, \u00a7 8 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Following the 2009 legislation, no agreement on a new CBA was reached in Yonkers. The City, noting the June 30, 2009 termination date of the CBA, required firefighters who were hired after that date to pay 3% of their wages towards retirement benefits. In response, the Union filed an improper practice charge with the New York State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), alleging that the City had erred in failing to apply the CBA to firefighters hired by the City after the CBA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>termination date. The Union relied on the exception contained in section 8, as well as Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (e), often referred to as the Triborough Law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">After PERB referred the matter to arbitration, the City commenced this proceeding for a permanent stay of arbitration on the ground that arbitration is barred by Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4) and Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 470. Supreme Court rejected this argument, and dismissed the proceeding; but the Appellate Division reversed, and granted the petition, holding that the statutes cited are a bar to arbitration. \u201c[T]he CBA, which terminated by its own terms in June 2009, was no longer \u2018in effect\u2019 at the time of the effective date of article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law,\u201d with the result that \u201cthe exception set forth in section 8 of that article is inapplicable\u201d (90 AD3d 1043, 1044-1045 [2d Dept 2011]). We granted the Union leave to appeal (19 NY3d 802 [2012]), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">A grievance may be submitted to arbitration only if (1) it is lawful for the parties to arbitrate the dispute and (2) the parties agreed to arbitrate that kind of dispute (see <em>e.g. Matter of City of Johnstown [Johnstown Police Benevolent Assn.], </em>99 NY2d 273, 278 [2002]). The City argues that the first condition is not met, because arbitration of the present dispute is prohibited by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Public employers executing a CBA are prohibited from negotiating and granting retirement benefits that are not already expressly provided under state law. (A CBA may provide for retirement benefits as authorized by law, which is why the CBA here was valid until article 22 was enacted.) Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4) prohibits the negotiation of \u201cbenefits provided by or to be provided by a public retirement system, or payments to a fund or insurer to provide an income for retirees, or payment to retirees or their beneficiaries.\u201d Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 470 similarly proscribes \u201c[c]hanges negotiated between any public employer and public employee . . . with respect to any benefit provided by or to be provided by a public retirement system, or payments to a fund or insurer to provide an income for retirees or payment to retirees or their beneficiaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>As the parties frame their dispute, whether the arbitration sought by the Union would amount to negotiation prohibited by these statutes depends on whether the CBA was \u201cin effect\u201d pursuant to section 8, when article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law became effective, or had terminated within the meaning of that statute. If it was not \u201cin effect,\u201d then arbitration would be an attempt at negotiation of the 3% now imposed on new firefighters and is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The Triborough doctrine, upon which the Union relies, was codified by the enactment of Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a <em>(see </em>L 1982, ch 868). With an exception not applicable here, that section provides that it is \u201can improper practice for a public employer or its agents deliberately ... to refuse to continue all the terms of an <em>expired </em>agreement until a new agreement is negotiated\u201d (Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a [1] [e] [emphasis added]). The law \u201crequires an employer to continue all the terms of an expired CBA while a new agreement is being negotiated . . . [U]nder the statute, the assumption is that all terms of a CBA remain in effect during collective bargaining of a successor agreement\u201d <em>(Matter of Professional Staff Congress-City Univ. of N.Y. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>7 NY3d 458, 466, 469 [2006]). The purpose is \u201cto preserve the status quo in situations where a [CBA] between a public employer and its employees has expired and a new one has yet to be agreed upon\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 467, quoting <em>Matter of Goodman [Barnard Coll.\u2014Commissioner of Labor], </em>95 NY2d 15, 22 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Because no successor CBA was negotiated in the present case, the Triborough Law would apply, and the CBA\u2019s terms would be continued, unless contradicted by statute. Here, however, the part of the CBA that required noncontributory plans is rendered unlawful by article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which prohibits such plans, unless the section 8 exception is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The Union argues that the section 8 exception applies because it extends to CBAs that have expired but are deemed to remain in effect because of the Triborough Law. This was not the legislature\u2019s intent. If the legislature had intended to invoke the Triborough doctrine, it would certainly have made that explicit. Instead, the legislature, having set forth the section 8 exception for CBAs that are \u201cin effect,\u201d expressly states that eligibility to join a CBA\u2019s retirement plan \u201cshall not apply upon termination of such agreement\u201d (L 2009, ch 504, part A, \u00a7 8). This language makes clear that the legislature did not intend to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>exception to agreements that had expired and could only be deemed to continue through the Triborough Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">This interpretation is further supported by the legislative history. Governor Paterson noted in a Program Bill Memorandum that section 8 of the bill ensures \u201cthat members of an employee organization that are eligible to join a special retirement plan pursuant to a collectively negotiated agreement with any state or local government employer, would be able to continue to enroll in that special plan after the enactment of this bill, <em>until the date on which such agreement </em>terminates\u201d (Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, Bill Jacket, L 2009, ch 504 at 9 [emphasis added]). Again, the chosen language indicates that a noncontributory plan does not outlast the expiration of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Under the Union\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the legislature would have been creating a loophole whereby a union, by the simple expedient of refusing to reach agreement on a new CBA, could ensure the continuation of noncontributory pension benefits to new hires, conceivably ad infinitum. Instead, it is clear that the legislature intended to honor only agreements providing for noncontributory status that had not expired at the time the statute became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The Union further argues that if section 8 did not encompass a CBA deemed to continue under the Triborough Law, then section 8 would run afoul of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution\u2014\u201cNo State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts\u201d (US Const, art I, \u00a7 10 [1]). This argument begs the question of whether the contract at issue here remains in effect. Under our analysis, there were no contractual obligations to impair.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Finally, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s position that the language of tier 6 (L 2012, ch 18, \u00a7 80) is evidence that, in enacting article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, the legislature intended to authorize participation in noncontributory pension benefits pursuant to agreements that had expired. Significantly, the dissent points to no legislative history supporting its theory that the express references to \u201cunexpired\u201d CBAs were included in 2012 because the legislature reached a different policy judgment than it had in 2009. Rather, the natural inference is that the legislature intended to be more plain, the second time around, and avoid language that would invite disputes such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">We conclude that the exception to Retirement and Social Security Law article 22 contained in section 8 (L 2009, ch 504, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>part A) does not apply to the CBA at issue here, so that the noncontributory pension benefits to which firefighters were entitled pursuant to the CBA are prohibited by article 22, despite the Triborough Law. Therefore, the arbitration sought by the Union is barred, as an impermissible negotiation of pension benefits, by Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4) and Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\"> <em>See Matter of Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel Auth.

Article 15 states, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\u201c[m] embers shall be entitled, pursuant to existing State law . . . alternate optional retirement plans as follows: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201c[a] Twenty (20) year retirement plan as authorized by law with the City pay[ing] the complete cost of said pension plan . . . and . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">\u201c[a] Twenty-five (25) year retirement plan ... to be paid for in full by the City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Article 29 of the CBA sets forth that disputes between the parties are to be resolved through a multi-level grievance procedure, and unresolved grievances may be submitted for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">The majority errs in determining that the CBA was not \u201cin effect\u201d for purposes of article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law. Under the <em>Triborough </em>doctrine, it is improper for a public employer \u201cto refuse to continue all the terms of an expired [employment] agreement until a new agreement is negotiated\u201d (Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a [1] [e]). Section 8 states that nothing in article 22 will prevent an employee from joining a special retirement plan pursuant to a CBA that is \u201cin effect,\u201d mirroring our Court\u2019s language in <em>Matter of Professional Staff Congress-City Univ. of N.Y. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd. </em>(7 NY3d 458, 469 [2006]). This Court stated clearly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Matter of Professional Staff Congress </em>that \u201call terms of a CBA remain <em>in effect </em>during collective bargaining of a successor agreement\u201d (7 NY3d at 469 [emphasis added]). Consequently, when the Yonkers CBA expired in June 2009, the agreement between the City and the Union continued to be in effect until a new CBA was negotiated <em>(see generally Association of Surrogates &amp; Supreme Ct. Reporters Within City of N.Y. v State of New York, </em>79 NY2d 39, 45 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">It follows that the newly hired firefighters, who were employed under a CBA \u201cin effect\u201d within the meaning of well-known New York law, fall within the section 8 exception to the requirement of joining contributory retirement plans. Absent action by the legislature, the Court cannot ignore the provisions of the <em>Triborough </em>doctrine. The majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute, in reality, does just that. Under section 8, employees covered by CBAs, which are \u201cin effect\u201d and offer noncontributory pension plans, have the option of participating in such plans. It was unnecessary for the legislature to invoke the <em>Triborough </em>doctrine explicitly in section 8, as the majority\u2019s ruling suggests. The plain language of section 8 expresses the legislature\u2019s intention, and the similarity between the wording in section 8 and <em>Matter of Professional Staff Congress </em>cannot be ascribed to mere coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Moreover, when the legislature revisited the pension contribution issue by creating tier 6 in March 2012, the drafters changed the statutory language and specified that the exception to the 3% contribution applied to \u201cunexpired\u201d CBAs (L 2012, ch 18, \u00a7 80). The legislature also stated in the tier 6 language that members who join PFRS <em>after </em>the effective date of the legislation are not authorized to participate in specified noncontributory retirement plans <em>(id.). </em>None of this language was included in article 22 of the Retirement and Social Security Law. The contrast between the tier 5 and tier 6 statutory language is compelling evidence that the two statutes must be interpreted differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The proviso in section 8, \u201cthat any such eligibility shall not apply upon termination of such agreement,\u201d does not alter the analysis. Termination of a CBA is not the equivalent of expiration, and the legislature made clear with the tier 6 statutory language that they understood the term \u201cexpired\u201d and its meaning. The \u201ctermination\u201d language also does not render the \u201cin effect\u201d language meaningless, as they can and should be read together. The Governor\u2019s 2009 Program Bill Memorandum, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>only legislative history cited by the majority, in no way detracts from a harmonized view of these terms. It should be apparent, absent a strained interpretation inconsistent with the legislative language, that a terminated agreement under section 8 refers to an agreement that is superceded by a newly negotiated CBA. The majority\u2019s interpretation incorrectly adds the term \u201cunexpired\u201d to the section 8 language and imposes the legislature\u2019s newly created tier 6 rule on this earlier legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">While the controlling of governmental costs is a commendable aim, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute is belied by the language of section 8, which must control. The stated concern that a union would refuse to reach agreement on a new CBA to allow its new membership to participate in noncontributory pension plans (under the Union\u2019s interpretation of section 8) fails to accord with reality. This Court has previously explained in <em>Matter of Professional Staff Congress </em>that \u201c[t]he concern that continuation of [a contract term] after expiration of a CBA will result in [the term being in effect] \u2018in perpetuity\u2019 is unfounded\u201d because a party may propose that the term be amended to include a sunset clause or taken out during the course of future collective bargaining (7 NY3d at 469). Unmistakably, it is self-defeating for unions to forever defer negotiating new CBAs for the singular purpose of permitting its new members to participate in noncontributory pension plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Furthermore, in concluding that arbitration is barred by statute, the Court\u2019s ruling fundamentally misconstrues the nature of the present dispute as one involving the negotiation of retirement benefits. The majority relies on Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4) and Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 470 for the proposition that arbitration is prohibited. Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4) states \u201cbenefits provided by or to be provided by a public retirement system\u201d are not to be \u201cnegotiated pursuant to this article, and any benefits so negotiated shall be void.\u201d Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 470 likewise conveys that \u201c[c]hanges negotiated between any public employer and public employee . . . with respect to any benefit provided by or to be provided by a public retirement system . . . shall be prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Here, the Union is seeking arbitration to interpret an existing CBA provision, not to negotiate the terms of retirement benefits. This Court concluded in <em>Matter of City of Johnstown (Johnstown Police Benevolent Assn.) </em>(99 NY2d 273, 279 [2002]) that a dispute over the computation of certain retirement benefits in an existing CBA was not a <em>\u201cnegotiation </em>of a provision of a CBA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>. . . , but the <em>interpretation </em>of a CBA provision.\u201d The inclusion of the special noncontributory pension plans in article 15 of the CBA was negotiated in 2002, and there was no prohibition against negotiating over whether to provide those plans at the time <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7\u00a7 384-d, 384-e). The Union is simply asking for the Court to require the City to adhere to the terms of the CBA. Enforcing the agreement\u2019s arbitration clause would not return the parties to the negotiation table. Today\u2019s ruling circumvents the arbitration process and is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedent which \u201chas overwhelmingly rejected contentions by public employers that particular issues fall outside the scope of permissible grievance arbitration\u201d <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d 132, 138-139 [1999]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Accordingly, because I believe the City and the Union should proceed to arbitration, I dissent and would reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Judges Graffeo, Read and Smith concur with Judge Pigott; Chief Judge Lippman dissents and votes to reverse in an opinion in which Judge Rivera concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> The Union\u2019s argument that preventing arbitration would be unconstitutional impairment of contract need not be reached under this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
