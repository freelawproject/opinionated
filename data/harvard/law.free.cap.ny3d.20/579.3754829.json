At a bench trial, the People presented the testimony of an expert witness on the subject of child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (CSAAS). We agree with defendant that the expert\u2019s testimony was not adequately limited because certain hypothetical questions posed by the prosecutor improperly bolstered the People\u2019s proof that defendant was the perpetrator. However, because the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was otherwise overwhelming, we find the error harmless and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>2006 </em>and 2007, defendant lived with his girlfriend, NWJ and her 12-year-old twin daughters. NW\u2019s 12-year-old sister, PW, who lived nearby, often visited overnight, sharing the twins\u2019 bedroom. In May of 2007, PW reported to an assistant principal that defendant was sexually abusing her. Defendant was indicted for second-degree course of sexual conduct against a child as to AW, one of NW\u2019s daughters, and for rape and numerous additional counts as to PW</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">At a bench trial, the People presented, along with the testimony of both AW and PW, the testimony of a physician who examined PW. Her findings were consistent with a report of the type of sexual abuse to which PW testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The People also called an expert on CSAAS. He explained that he did not meet the complainants nor was rendering any opinion about any facts specific to the case. Rather, his testimony concerned CSAAS and its five stages. He began by describing actions of a perpetrator as opposed to the victim, i.e. the \u201cengagement\u201d phase, during which an adult who is an authority figure with respect to the child utilizes his or her position within the family to change from a caretaking relationship with the child to a sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">He then moved on to the second stage, \u201csexual interaction,\u201d which he also explained in terms of the abuser\u2019s actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u201cThat\u2019s where the adult, in some way, has a physical relationship with a child. The sexual acts that occur may be progressive, meaning, that over time they may become more intrusive. This may be more than one act, and the sexual interaction phase may last for a long period of time or it may be a brief period of time depending on the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The third stage, described as \u201csecrecy,\u201d was explained in terms of both what an abuser does and why the child keeps the matter secret\u2014because of embarrassment or shame, \u201csometimes enforced\u201d by the adult telling the child to keep it secret or suggesting negative consequences if it is revealed. Only then did the expert reach the stage of \u201cdisclosure,\u201d which, he opined, may be delayed because of the child\u2019s fear, shame, or emotional confusion. A final stage called \u201crepression,\u201d was said to involve the child\u2019s difficulty in thinking about or remembering the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The prosecutor then presented the expert witness with a series of hypothetical questions that mirrored the girls\u2019 testimony and asked if various facets of that testimony were consistent with the syndrome. He asked, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cNow, Doctor, is it consistent with the syndrome of a child living in her own home with a man who is her mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend, is it consistent with a syndrome that this man would have this child straddle him . . . that this child would not call out to another child similar in age who is sleeping in the very next room?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The Court overruled objections to this type of questioning. Defendant was ultimately found guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On appeal, the Appellate Division modified, on grounds not relevant here, but otherwise affirmed (91 AD3d 679 [2d Dept 2012]). The court held that the trial court had providently exercised its discretion in admitting the expert testimony. Citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Spicola </em>(16 NY3d 441, 465-466 [2011], <em>cert denied </em>565 US \u2014, 132 S Ct 400 [2011]), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201cWhile the hypothetical situation described by the prosecutor during the direct examination of the expert bore some similarities to the facts of this case, the expert did not offer an opinion with respect to the credibility of the complainants, and expressly disavowed any intention of rendering an opinion as to whether the complainants were victims of sexual abuse\u201d (91 AD3d at 681).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The admissibility of expert testimony is dependent on whether the expert testimony \u201cwould help to clarify an issue calling for professional or technical knowledge, possessed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>expert and beyond the ken of the typical juror\u201d <em>(De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296, 307 [1983]). Generally, that determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial court <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">This Court has held that \u201cexpert testimony regarding rape trauma syndrome, abused child syndrome or similar conditions may be admitted to explain behavior of a victim that might appear unusual or that jurors may not be expected to understand\u201d <em>(People v Carroll, </em>95 NY2d 375, 387 [2000]). Such testimony is allowed to explain, as originally offered here, why a child may not have immediately reported sexual abuse. It is not permitted, however, for the purpose of showing that the expert considers a particular complainant to be credible <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Recently, in <em>People v Spicola, </em>we upheld the admission of expert testimony regarding CSAAS to rehabilitate the complainant\u2019s credibility (16 NY3d 441). There, as in this case, the expert had not met the victim and explained that the testimony was not to be construed as giving an opinion as to whether the victim was indeed a victim of abuse. The expert\u2019s testimony explained unusual behavior of child abuse victims and, particularly, why a child may wait a long time before reporting the alleged abuse. This testimony, we held, was permissible in explaining CSAAS <em>(id. </em>at 466-467).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Defendant argues that the expert testimony here was inadmissible because it did not focus only on the victim\u2019s behavior but also discussed the behavior of sexual abusers. The typical behavior of a sexual abuser, defendant argues, is not beyond the ken of a typical juror. Here, the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony concerning abusers\u2019 behavior that was relevant to explain the accommodation syndrome was a proper exercise of discretion. That testimony assisted in explaining victims\u2019 subsequent behavior that the factfinder might not understand, such as why victims may accommodate abusers and why they wait before disclosing the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">We agree with defendant, however, that the expert\u2019s testimony exceeded permissible bounds when the prosecutor tailored the hypothetical questions to include facts concerning the abuse that occurred in this particular case. Such testimony went beyond explaining victim behavior that might be beyond the ken of a jury, and had the prejudicial effect of implying that the expert found the testimony of this particular complainant to be credible\u2014even though the witness began his testimony claiming no knowledge of the case before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>This error, however, was harmless because the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and there was no significant probability that, but for the introduction of the erroneous portion of his testimony, defendant would have been acquitted. Here, both victims testified in detail as to the sexual acts committed by defendant. In addition, PW\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the medical evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Finally, we conclude that defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Gkaffeo, Read, Smith and Rivera concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
