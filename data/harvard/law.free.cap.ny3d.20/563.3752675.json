Doyle, II with respect to property in Tonawanda, New York. These mortgages, given to secure Doyle\u2019s indebtedness on two promissory notes, were guaranteed by his company, defendant Jim Doyle Ford, Inc. On August 6, 2009, County Court granted judgment of foreclosure and sale to M&amp;T for the sum of $1,101,942.97; directed the mortgaged premises to be sold at public auction by the referee appointed for this purpose; and adjudged defendants liable for any shortfall, in accordance with RPAPL 1371. Subdivision (2) of this provision specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201c [s] imultaneously with the making of a motion for an order confirming the sale, provided such motion is made <em>within ninety days after the date of the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the proper deed of conveyance to the purchaser, </em>the party to whom such residue [of the debt remaining unsatisfied] shall be owing may make a motion in the action for leave to enter a deficiency judgment\u201d (RPAPL 1371 [2] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">At the auction held on September 24, 2009, the referee sold M&amp;T the property for $890,000, the highest sum bid. Soon afterwards, M&amp;T\u2019s attorney advised the referee that his client planned to assign its bid to an affiliate, MAT Properties, Inc. (MAT), prior to the closing, which would be delayed for several months while MAT conducted a sealed bid sale of the foreclosure bid. On May 10, 2010, though, the attorney sent the referee a proposed deed naming MAT as grantee, report of sale and other closing documents, and requested that the referee sign and return these papers. The referee executed the documents on May 11, 2010, and placed them in the mail the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>On May 13, 2010, M&amp;T\u2019s attorney\u2014who had not yet received the papers\u2014telephoned the referee to alert him that MAT was not then prepared to accept the deed because a potential purchaser had just stepped forward to express an interest in acquiring the bid. When he learned that the referee had already signed and mailed the deed, the attorney told the referee that he \u201cdid not intend to accept the referee\u2019s deed and other papers when they arrived,\u201d and would \u201creturn [the] cover letter and the enclosures . . . when he received them.\u201d Accordingly, by letter dated May 17, 2010, M&amp;T\u2019s attorney sent these documents back to the referee, to be held \u201cuntil further notice\u201d as agreed in their \u201crecent exchange of telephone messages.\u201d The attorney reiterated the reason why MAT was not yet ready to accept the deed, and promised to \u201cbe in touch with [the referee] shortly to let [him] know whether the bank [had] assigned its bid.\u201d The referee accepted and kept possession of the returned papers without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">By letter dated July 26, 2010, M&amp;T\u2019s attorney asked the referee to send along the deed and other closing documents as \u201cM&amp;T [had] instructed [him] to record the Referee\u2019s Deed conveying title to [MAT].\u201d The referee hand delivered these papers the next day; however, on August 6, 2010, the attorney emailed the referee a request to execute the deed so that it would be \u201cdated concurrently with its delivery.\u201d On August 9, 2010, the referee did so and M&amp;T\u2019s attorney accepted the deed on behalf of MAT that same day. The deed was recorded in the Erie County Clerk\u2019s Office on August 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On September 3, 2010, M&amp;T filed a motion seeking to confirm the referee\u2019s report of sale; determine the fair and reasonable market value of the mortgaged premises as of September 24, 2009, the date of the mortgage foreclosure sale; and enter a deficiency judgment. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that M&amp;T\u2019s request for a deficiency judgment was untimely under RPAPL 1371 (2) because made more than 90 days after consummation of the sale, which they claimed happened in May 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">By order entered June 29, 2011, County Court granted M&amp;T\u2019s motion, and directed its attorneys to submit a proposed order pursuant to RPAPL 1371. The judge determined that the motion was timely because \u201cbrought within ninety (90) days of the consummation of the sale of the Premises by the Referee pursuant to the Referee\u2019s Deed dated August 9, 2010 and recorded . . . on August 17, 2010.\u201d By order and judgment entered July 20, 2011, County Court directed entry of a deficiency judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>against defendants in the amount of $426,657.11.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Defendants appealed both orders, challenging the timeliness of M&amp;T\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">On March 23, 2012, the Appellate Division dismissed the appeal from the order entered June 29, 2011 <em>(see </em>CPLR 5501 [a] [1]); and reversed so much of the order and judgment entered July 20, 2011 as granted M&amp;T the deficiency judgment against defendants (93 AD3d 1331 [4th Dept 2012]). The Court agreed with defendants that M&amp;T\u2019s motion was untimely because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cthe foreclosure sale was consummated and the 90-day period commenced in May 2010 upon the delivery of the Referee\u2019s deed. Such delivery occurred within the meaning of [RPAPL 1371 (2)] at that time inasmuch as the Referee, acting as grantor on behalf of the court, executed and parted with control of the deed prepared by plaintiff\u2019s counsel with the intention to pass title [and] notwithstanding the refusal of plaintiffs counsel to accept and retain physical possession of the deed at that time\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1332 [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We granted M&amp;T leave to appeal (19 NY3d 808 [2012]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Real Property Law \u00a7 244 states that a \u201cgrant takes effect, so as to vest the estate or interest intended to be conveyed, only from its delivery; and all the rules of law, now in force, in respect to the delivery of deeds, apply to grants hereafter executed.\u201d The common law in 1909, when section 244 was enacted, contemplated that delivery encompassed both presentment and acceptance <em>(see e.g. Brackett v Barney, </em>28 NY 333, 340-341 [1863] [\u201cThe delivery of a deed without acceptance is nugatory . . . An intention to deliver on the one hand and to accept on the other, is necessary to give effect to the instrument\u201d]; <em>Ten Eyck v Whitbeck, </em>156 NY 341, 352 [1898] [\u201cThe delivery of a deed is essential to the transfer of title, and there can be no delivery without an acceptance by the grantee\u201d]; <em>see also </em>1 Rasch, New York Law and Practice of Real Property \u00a7 24:162 [2d ed] [\u201cAcceptance of a deed is as essential to the change of title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>as is delivery itself5]). And there is no statutory basis for treating a referee\u2019s deed in foreclosure differently from other deeds when pinpointing the moment title transfers; hence, \u201cconsummation of the sale by the delivery of the proper deed\u201d within the meaning of section 1371 (2) takes place when the intended grantee accepts the proffered instrument <em>(see Crossland Sav. v Patton, </em>182 AD2d 496, 496 [1st Dept 1992], <em>lv denied </em>80 NY2d 755 [1992] [title to the property vested and so the sale was consummated within the meaning of RPAPL 1371 (2) on the day that the plaintiffs counsel \u201caccepted and retained without objection\u201d the deed delivered to him by the defendant]).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As a general rule, a deed is presumed to have been \u201cdelivered and accepted at its date\u201d; however, this presumption \u201cmust yield to opposing evidence\u201d <em>(see Ten Eyck, </em>156 NY at 352). Here, M&amp;T\u2019s attorney twice declined to accept or retain physical possession of the referee\u2019s deed dated May 11, 2010. As a result, the referee took back the deed and other closing documents and ultimately executed a deed on August 9, 2010, when M&amp;T\u2019s attorney accepted it on behalf of MAT. This constitutes \u201copposing evidence\u201d sufficient to rebut any presumption of delivery in May 2010 <em>(see Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v Continental Ins. Cos., </em>33 NY2d 370, 372 [1974] [presumption overcome where there was no evidence that the grantor\u2019s attorney, who later recorded the deed, received it as agent of the grantee; consequently, there was no passage of title]). M&amp;T\u2019s motion was therefore timely because brought within 90 days \u201cafter the date of the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the proper deed of conveyance to the purchaser\u201d (RPAPL 1371 [2])\u2014i.e., August 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order and judgment of County Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Order reversed, with costs, and order and judgment of County Court, Erie County, reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> This amount represents the sum of $1,113,942.31 (the debt remaining unsatisfied according to the referee\u2019s report of sale) and $312,714.80 (the real estate taxes that were a lien on the premises as of September 24, 2009), minus $1,000,000 (the fair and reasonable market value of the property on September 24, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
