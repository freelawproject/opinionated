Specifically, he claims appellate counsel was at fault for failing to argue, on appeal, that the conduct of the prosecutor at trial subjected defendant\u2019s trial lawyers to ethical conflicts and thereby deprived defendant of the effective assistance of trial counsel. We hold that defendant has failed to demonstrate that his appellate counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Defendant was convicted in 1995 of murder, attempted murder, assault and weapons offenses after a trial in which witnesses testified that he shot two members of a rival drug gang, killing one and wounding the other. The theory of the defense at trial was that the \u201creal killer\u201d was not defendant, but the leader of defendant\u2019s gang, Simeon Nelson, known as \u201cSims,\u201d who, according to several witnesses\u2019 testimony, was present when the shootings took place. Nelson did not testify at trial. Defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness instruction was denied, but defense counsel made a missing witness argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in summation: \u201cSimeon Nelson, who you didn\u2019t hear from, sits in the catbird seat this afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The principal issues now before us arise from defense counsel\u2019s effort to interview Nelson before trial, and the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to use that effort to the People\u2019s advantage. On cross-examination of defendant, the prosecutor established that, after the shootings, defendant and Nelson were incarcerated in the same jail at the same time. The prosecutor asked defendant if he and his lawyers had met with Nelson on the morning of the first day of trial. Defendant acknowledged that he had seen his lawyers meeting with Nelson that day, but denied that he had attended the meeting. Commenting in summation on this line of questioning by the prosecutor, defense counsel told the jury sarcastically: \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry that the lawyers for [defendant] wanted the real killer to come forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the People\u2019s summation, the prosecutor made the following comments about the meeting between Nelson and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cI went and found out about their little secret meeting on April 25th. The Defendant didn\u2019t know that I knew, and he tried to backtrack and he tried to get flustered, and now the Defense lawyer told you it\u2019s his duty and obligation to try to talk to the real killer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cIs there any testimony by anyone in this trial that they spoke to Sims and confronted him? No. No lawyer for Legal Aid got on the stand and testified. You have no evidence . . . that they confronted Sims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201cNo, they had their little meeting with Sims to see if he would help them save their client, say it wasn\u2019t him, say it was somebody else, give us some information that could get our boy and your friend off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC_\">Defense counsel did not object either to the prosecutor\u2019s questions about the jailhouse meeting or the argument based on it. Nor did defendant\u2019s appellate counsel raise any issue relating to those questions or comments on the direct appeal from defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">The Appellate Division affirmed on direct appeal <em>(People v Townsley, </em>240 AD2d 955 [3d Dept 1997]). Some 12 years later, defendant moved under CPL 440.10 to set aside his conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>arguing among other things that the prosecutor had accused defense counsel of trying to fabricate a defense, with the result that defendant was deprived of his right to conflict-free counsel. County Court denied the CPL 440 motion, in part on the ground that the issue could have been raised on direct appeal. After the Appellate Division denied leave to appeal from the denial of the CPL 440 motion, defendant began the present coram nobis proceeding in the Appellate Division (see <em>People v Bachert, </em>69 NY2d 593 [1987]), arguing that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing, among other things, to raise the conflict issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Appellate Division denied coram nobis relief (2011 NY Slip Op 64401[U] [2011]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (17 NY3d 956 [2011]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument proceeds in several stages. He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s trial tactics created ethical problems for defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who, according to defendant\u2019s present argument, were put in a position where they should have called themselves as witnesses, and were also personally accused of wrongdoing. These problems, defendant argues, should have led the trial court to conduct an inquiry and, unless the conflicts were validly waived, to disqualify trial counsel. The court\u2019s error in failing to proceed in this way, the argument continues, was so clear that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to argue it on appeal amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The ultimate question raised by this argument is whether appellate counsel was ineffective. In addressing that question, we examine the merits of the underlying claim that trial counsel was conflicted, but in doing so we must remember that appellate counsel\u2019s omission of claims from his appellate brief \u201cshould not be second-guessed with the clarity of hindsight\u201d <em>(People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]). The constitutional requirement of effective assistance of counsel is met where \u201cthe attorney provided meaningful representation\u201d <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). Appellate lawyers \u201chave latitude in deciding which points to advance\u201d and need not \u201cbrief or argue every issue that may have merit\u201d <em>(People v Stultz, 2 </em>NY3d 277, 285 [2004]). In reviewing the performance of appellate counsel, \u201cthe minimum standard of performance required ... is a very tolerant one\u201d <em>(People v Turner, </em>5 NY3d 476, 480 [2005]). Viewing the case in that light, we conclude that appellate counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Defendant first contends that his lawyers were subject to a \u201cconflict\u201d because the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and argument about defense counsel\u2019s meeting with Nelson made the defense lawyers into necessary witnesses at trial. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The word \u201cconflict\u201d does not fully describe what is sometimes called the \u2018 \u2018advocate-witness\u201d problem. A lawyer who is both an advocate and witness does not necessarily have conflicting interests, though that possibility exists. But whether or not there is a conflict, such a mixture of roles may confuse the fact-finder and impair the fairness of the trial, and a lawyer is ethically required, subject to certain exceptions, to withdraw from a representation when he or she (in the words of the ethical rule as it existed when defendant was tried) \u201clearns or it is obvious that the lawyer ought to be called as a witness on behalf of the client\u201d (former Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102 [a] [22 NYCRR 1200.21 (a)]; <em>cf. </em>Rules of Professional Conduct [22 NYCRR 1200.0] rule 3.7 [a] [current, similar provision]). One of the exceptions\u2014where withdrawal \u201cwould work a substantial hardship on the client because of the distinctive value of the lawyer as counsel in the particular case\u201d (Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-101 [b] [4] [22 NYCRR 1200.20 (b) (4)]; <em>cf. </em>Rules of Professional Conduct [22 NYCRR 1200.0] rule 3.7 [a] [3])\u2014might be relevant here, but the point is moot because a reasonable appellate counsel could well have concluded that the trial lawyers did not need to be called as witnesses at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The mere fact that defendant\u2019s lawyers had met with Nelson, and that the jury knew of the meeting, did not make it either necessary or appropriate for the lawyers to testify. The prosecutor presumably brought out the meeting to show that Nelson, whom the defense portrayed as a missing witness, was not wholly in the People\u2019s control\u2014a legitimate, if peripheral, point that the testimony of defense counsel could hardly have refuted. Nothing in the record indicates that the defense lawyers could have said anything about the meeting that would have helped their client. It would no doubt be different if they could have testified that Nelson told them he committed the crimes, but there is no evidence that he told them anything of the kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendant\u2019s second argument deserves more attention. It is, in substance, that the prosecutor accused the defense lawyers of criminal wrongdoing\u2014of attempting to get Nelson to tell a false story that would exculpate the lawyers\u2019 client. Such an accusation, while it would not automatically require disqualification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>would, create at least a potential for conflict; when a lawyer\u2019s own conduct is in question, the lawyer may be impelled to protect himself at his client\u2019s expense <em>(see </em>Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-101 [a] [22 NYCRR 1200.20 (a)]: \u201c[A] lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of professional judgement on behalf of the client will be or reasonably may be affected by the lawyer\u2019s own . . . personal interests\u201d <em>[cf </em>Rules of Professional Conduct (22 NYCRR 1200.0) rule 1.7 (a) (2)]; <em>see also e.g. People v Konstantinides, </em>14 NY3d 1 [2009]; <em>United States v Fulton, </em>5 F3d 605 [2d Cir 1993]). In this case, however, defendant\u2019s appellate lawyer could reasonably have concluded that the record did not show that any such accusation was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant about his lawyers\u2019 meeting with Nelson contained no suggestion of wrongdoing by defense counsel. It showed only that they had met with a possible witness\u2014i.e., that they were doing their job. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks about the meeting in closing argument are more troublesome. It was entirely inappropriate for the prosecutor to refer to the defense lawyers\u2019 \u201clittle secret meeting\u201d with Nelson and to suggest that their purpose was \u201cto see if he would help them save their client, say it wasn\u2019t him, say it was somebody else . . . get our boy and your friend off.\u201d The argument suggested to the jury that there was something improper in a lawyer\u2019s interviewing a witness in the hope of getting favorable testimony. That is not in the least improper. It is what good lawyers do.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument warranted a rebuke from the trial judge. A reasonable appellate counsel could have concluded, however, that it warranted nothing more\u2014specifically, that it did not warrant interrupting the trial to inquire whether defense counsel could still exercise independent judgment, and if not whether defendant would waive any conflict. It would have been reasonable for appellate counsel to conclude that a reversal based on the trial court\u2019s failure to make such an inquiry was highly unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not say, and could reasonably be read not to imply, that the defense lawyers asked Nelson to give <em>false </em>testimony. Subornation of perjury is a serious crime, of course, but it hardly seems likely that the trial lawyers in this case should have believed, or did believe, that they were in danger of investigation or prosecution for committing it. In other cases in which the issue of defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>personal culpability has been raised, the lawyers seemed to have much more serious problems. In <em>Konstantinides, </em>a witness specifically claimed that a defense lawyer asked her to lie (14 NY3d at 6); in <em>Fulton, </em>a witness had told prosecutors \u201cthat he had once imported heroin for Fulton\u2019s trial counsel\u201d (5 F3d at 606).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comments about defense counsel were far less specific. Trial counsel, and a reasonable appellate counsel reviewing the record, could well have taken them as nothing more than an obnoxious, but essentially irrelevant, way of describing a defense lawyer\u2019s legitimate activity. Now, in this coram nobis proceeding, defendant makes a perhaps plausible argument that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were more than that, but we do not find the argument \u201cso compelling that a failure to make it amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d <em>(People v Carter, </em>7 NY3d 875, 877 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments do not require long discussion. While a few of the prosecutor\u2019s other remarks on summation may have been objectionable, they were of minor importance. Appellate counsel was not ineffective because he chose not to make an issue of them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b377-7\">Cipabick, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AZc\">I believe defendant is entitled to co-ram nobis relief as he has demonstrated that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to argue on direct appeal that defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">In June 1995, defendant was convicted of second degree murder, first degree assault, two counts of first degree criminal use of a firearm and two counts of second degree criminal possession of a weapon stemming from the fatal shooting of Lynell James and the wounding of Johmar Brangan.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The following facts were adduced at trial. In 1994, defendant worked as a courier in a low-level drug ring in South Fallsburg, New York led by Simeon Nelson, known as \u201cSims\u201d or \u201cSim\u201d (hereinafter Nelson or Sims). The ring conducted crack cocaine sales out of the apartment of Barbara Slater. On July 1, 1994, James was shot in the back of the head inside Slater\u2019s apartment and Brangan was shot in the mouth and arm in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>hallway outside of the apartment. Police arrested defendant, whom witnesses identified as the assailant, 12 days later. Several of the People\u2019s eyewitnesses, including Slater and Brangan, placed both defendant and Nelson at the scene of the shootings but named defendant as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that Nelson shot James and Brangan and that the People\u2019s witnesses accused defendant in fear of Nelson. Defendant testified that he fled after witnessing the shootings and hid after learning from his brother that witnesses named him as the perpetrator. During defendant\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to establish that defendant and his attorneys met with Nelson on the eve of trial to gain Nelson\u2019s acquiescence to the defense\u2019s strategy of shifting the blame to him. The prosecutor asked defendant, \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that because Sims is your friend, you wanted to clear it with him . . . , like when I go to trial I\u2019m going to say that you did it so that I can get off, but don\u2019t you be mad at me[?]\u201d Defendant denied the allegation, stating that his attorneys instructed him not to discuss the case with anyone. The prosecutor then asked defendant whether he and his lawyers had a \u201cget-together\u201d at the jail with Nelson, \u201cthe same [person] . . . who you say committed the murder, not you[?]\u201d Defendant responded that his lawyers met with Nelson, and that Nelson left within minutes of defendant\u2019s entry into the meeting. There is no indication from the record that either counsel or the court had any discussion with defendant regarding whether the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination created a conflict for defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">During summation, defense counsel attempted to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s insinuation, stating, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that the lawyers for Tayden wanted the real killer to come forward . . . I\u2019m sorry that Tayden\u2019s lawyers confronted Sim so that he would come clean.\u201d During the People\u2019s summation, the prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cIs there any testimony by anyone in this trial that they spoke to Sims and confronted him? No. No lawyer for Legal Aid got on the stand and testified. You have no evidence, evidence, that they confronted Sims . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cSo, don\u2019t get fooled by that kind of argument about . . . how their meeting with Sims was to confront the murderer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The prosecutor also made various statements about the veracity of defendant\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor told the jurors, \u201cFor [defendant] to tell you that he carried no grudge [against Nelson] is a blatant lie,\u201d and that it was \u201creason enough to disregard everything that he has to say . . . as a total fabrication.\u201d Additionally, the prosecutor repeatedly described defendant as a self-proclaimed \u201caltar boy\u201d and, sarcastically, as a \u201cfamily man\u201d and \u201cparagon of virtue.\u201d Moreover, in explaining that the People were not required to establish a motive for the crime, the prosecutor referred to the Oklahoma City bombings, which had taken place the week prior to closing arguments, stating: \u201cWhy did somebody blow up the building in Oklahoma? Does any motive make sense. Of course not. Can you give a logical reason for such a horrible illogical act? Of course not.\u201d With one exception, defense counsel did not object to these remarks. Finally, the prosecutor instructed the jury that it was not necessary to consider the charges, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThe charges here don\u2019t matter anymore because the Defendant says he didn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t say the crimes weren\u2019t committed . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cIf the gun is in the Defendant\u2019s hand, then he\u2019s guilty of every crime charged, every crime. You don\u2019t have to decide what was his state of mind, what did he intend to do, what did he really mean to do, because that\u2019s conceded . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cSo, the criminal charges now you don\u2019t really have to deliberate very much over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 37V2 years to life in prison. On direct appeal, defendant was represented by court-appointed appellate counsel who raised several grounds for reversal but did not challenge trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction <em>(People v Townsley, </em>240 AD2d 955 [3d Dept 1997], <em>lv denied </em>90 NY2d 943 [1997]). Thereafter, defendant\u2019s pro se habeas corpus petition was denied <em>(Townsley v Portuondo, </em>99 Civ 02476 [SD NY 2002]). In 2009, defendant moved to vacate his conviction under CPL 440.10, arguing that his trial counsel was conflicted and rendered ineffective assistance. County Court denied the motion on the ground that the claims should have been asserted on defendant\u2019s direct appeal. In 2011, defendant petitioned for a writ of error coram nobis. In support of the petition, defendant submitted an affirmation from his former appellate counsel, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>stated that \u201c[a]t the time of Townsley\u2019s appeal, [he] did not make any professional judgment not to raise the conflict issue\u201d and \u201cdid not perceive the conflict of interest issue.\u201d Counsel also stated that he \u201c[could] not recall [his] thought process in connection with the omission from Townsley\u2019s appellate brief of any ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.\u201d The Appellate Division denied defendant\u2019s petition without opinion (2011 NY Slip Op 64401[U] [2011]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (17 NY3d 956 [2011]) and the majority now affirms that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Criminal defendants \u201chave a federal and state constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel\u201d <em>(People v Stultz, </em>2 NY3d 277, 282 [2004]; <em>see People v Borrell, </em>12 NY3d 365, 368 [2009]). Appellate advocates are held to the same standard of \u201cmeaningful representation\u201d established in <em>People v Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]) to evaluate the efficacy of trial counsel <em>(see Stultz, </em>2 NY3d at 284 [explaining that it would be \u201cinapt to have one standard for trials and another for appeals\u201d]). A defendant claiming that he was not afforded meaningful representation \u201cmust demonstrate the absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient conduct\u201d <em>(People v Caban, 5 </em>NY3d 143, 152 [2005] [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cAbsent such a showing, it will be presumed that counsel acted in a competent manner and exercised professional judgment\u201d <em>(People v Rivera, </em>71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We have clarified the <em>Baldi </em>standard as applied to appellate counsel, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\u201cAppellate advocacy is meaningful if it reflects a competent grasp of the facts, the law and appellate procedure, supported by appropriate authority and argument. Effective appellate representation by no means requires counsel to brief or argue eveiy issue that may have merit. When it comes to the choice of issues, appellate lawyers have latitude in deciding which points to advance and how to order them\u201d <em>(Stultz, </em>2 NY3d at 285).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\u201cThe essential inquiry in assessing <em>the </em>constitutional adequacy of appellate representation is, then, not whether a better result might have been achieved, but whether, viewed objectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>counsel\u2019s actions are consistent with those of a reasonably competent appellate attorney\u201d <em>(Borrell, </em>12 NY3d at 368).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Applying these standards, we have \u201crecognize[d] that in making appellate arguments, attorneys must evaluate the performance of trial counsel and, when appropriate, raise claims of ineffective representation\u201d <em>(Stultz, </em>2 NY3d at 287). In <em>People v Turner </em>(5 NY3d 476 [2005]), for example, we declared an appellate attorney\u2019s representation deficient where, despite an otherwise competent performance, the attorney elected not to argue that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that the charge of manslaughter was time-barred (see <em>id. </em>at 480-481). We concluded that because the statute of limitations defense \u201cwas a winning argumentt,] trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense was not worth raising; [therefore,] appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought that she should not argue trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Here, defendant contends his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the issue that defendant\u2019s trial counsel labored under a conflict of interest and was otherwise ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s inflammatory statements. Consistent with <em>Turner, </em>the question of appellate counsel\u2019s effectiveness depends on the strength of defendant\u2019s underlying claims regarding his trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance <em>(see </em>5 NY3d at 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">It has long been established that constitutionally adequate criminal representation must be \u201cconflict-free and singlemindedly devoted to the client\u2019s best interests\u201d <em>(People v Ennis, </em>11 NY3d 403, 409-410 [2008], quoting <em>People v Harris, </em>99 NY2d 202, 209 [2002]; <em>see also People v Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d 652, 657 [1990]). \u201cInitially it is defense counsel\u2019s burden to recognize the existence of a potential conflict of interest, to alert both the client and the court to the potential risks involved, and to obtain the client\u2019s informed consent to counsel\u2019s continued representation despite those risks\u201d <em>(People v McDonald, </em>68 NY2d 1, 8 [1986]; <em>see People v Wandell, </em>75 NY2d 951, 952 [1990]; <em>People v Lloyd, </em>51 NY2d 107, 111 [1980]). When a defendant claims on appeal that his or her trial counsel\u2019s representation was compromised by a conflict of interest the court must conduct a two-part inquiry to determine first whether a conflict of interest exists, and second, whether the conflict operated on the representation <em>(see People v Konstantinides, </em>14 NY3d 1, 10 [2009]; <em>Ennis, </em>11 NY3d at 410; <em>Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d at 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Defendant argues that his trial counsel became conflicted under the \u201cadvocate-witness\u201d rule because the prosecutor insinuated during defendant\u2019s cross-examination that the lawyers colluded with Nelson and defendant to concoct a false defense, creating a need for the lawyers to testify regarding the true nature of their meeting with Nelson. In my view, that would have been a winning argument on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u201cRecognizing that the roles of an advocate and of a witness are inconsistent,\u201d the ethical rules governing the practice of law \u201c direct [ ] that a lawyer who <em>ought to be called </em>as a witness on behalf of his client shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial\u201d <em>(S &amp; S Hotel Ventures Ltd. Partnership v 777 S. H. Corp., </em>69 NY2d 437, 444 [1987], citing former Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102 [a]; DR 5-105 [a] [former 12 NYCRR 1200.21 (a); 1200.24 (a) (repealed eff Apr. 1, 2009)]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, a lawyer whose testimony is likely to be necessary will be disqualified, with necessity measured by \u201csuch factors as the significance of the matters, weight of the testimony, and availability of other evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 446).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The majority rejects defendant\u2019s claim, holding that \u201c[t]he mere fact that defendant\u2019s lawyers had met with Nelson, and that the jury knew of the meeting, did not make it either necessary or appropriate for the lawyers to testify\u201d (majority op at 299). However, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination did not merely elicit that a meeting took place. The prosecutor sought to bring out that \u201cbecause Sims is [defendant\u2019s] friend\u201d defendant wanted to \u201cclear . . . with him\u201d that he was going to blame Sims for the shootings so that he \u201cc[ould] get off.\u201d What immediately followed were questions to establish that defendant and his attorneys met with Nelson on the eve of trial: \u201c[D]id you not have a get-together with you and Simeon Nelson and your lawyers, on the morning of April 25th, for an hour and a half, at the Sullivan County Jail[?] . . . the same Simeon Nelson . . . who you say committed the murder, not you[?]\u201d In my view, the clear import of that line of questioning was to insinu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ate that the purpose of the meeting was to gain Nelson\u2019s cooperation in a fabricated theory of defense and that the lawyers played an active role in that scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Because the entire theory of defense was that Nelson, rather than defendant, was the perpetrator, the People\u2019s suggestion that the defense was manufactured with Nelson\u2019s participation was highly significant. The majority opines, however, that \u201c[njothing in the record indicates that the defense lawyers could have said anything about the meeting [in testimony] that would have helped their client\u201d (majority op at 299). I disagree. If that were truly the case, defense counsel would not have felt compelled to attempt to repair the damage by asserting in summation that the attorneys \u201cconfronted Sim so that he would come clean\u201d and to get \u201cthe real killer to come forward.\u201d That the attorneys\u2019 sworn testimony was necessary to address the People\u2019s accusation is made plain by the prosecutor\u2019s remark that \u201c[n]o lawyer for Legal Aid got on the stand and testified. You have no evidence, evidence, that they confronted Sims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Despite this indication that defense counsel became conflicted under the advocate-witness rule, nothing in the record shows that the attorneys alerted the court or defendant to the existence of the conflict, or that the court undertook any inquiry into whether defendant knew the risks of continuing with his current representation and had waived those risks <em>(see McDonald, </em>68 NY2d at 8). Given that the court failed to obtain defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary waiver of the conflict, appellate counsel would only have had to demonstrate that the conflict operated on the defense in order to obtain a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction <em>(see Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d at 657). That standard could have been met in light of defense counsel\u2019s attempt in summation to rebut the People\u2019s allegations in what can fairly be categorized as their unsworn testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The potency of this conflict as grounds for reversal \u201cshould have been apparent to any reasonable appellate counsel, and should have prompted that counsel to make an ineffective assistance argument\u201d <em>(Turner, </em>5 NY3d at 483). Indeed, appellate counsel\u2019s affirmation that he \u201cdid not make any professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>judgment not to raise the conflict issue\u201d and, in fact, \u201cdid not perceive the conflict of interest issue,\u201d demonstrates that his conduct lacked any strategic basis <em>(see Rivera, </em>71 NY2d at 709). To be sure, appellate counsel drafted a thorough brief, raising six grounds for reversal and challenging the severity of defendant\u2019s sentence. However, because conflict-free representation is nothing short of fundamental, I find appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness \u201cso egregious and prejudicial as to [have] deprive [d] . . . defendant of his constitutional right\u201d to meaningful appellate advocacy <em>(Turner, 5 </em>NY3d at 480 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The omission of that argument on defendant\u2019s direct appeal is all the more glaring when one considers trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to numerous questionable remarks during the People\u2019s summation. Specifically, defendant points to the prosecutor\u2019s many comments on witness credibility, including his characterization of defendant\u2019s testimony about his personal feelings toward Nelson\u2014evidence of which could only come from defendant\u2014as a \u201cblatant lie\u201d that should prompt the jury to \u201cdisregard everything that [defendant] has to say.\u201d Defendant also cites the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to assail defendant\u2019s character (including repeated sarcastic references to defendant as an \u201caltar boy\u201d), his attempt to draw a parallel to the recent terrorist attack in Oklahoma City, and, perhaps most egregious, his instruction to the jury to disregard the elements of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Under our relevant precedents, defendant\u2019s trial counsel had clear bases for objecting to these inflammatory statements <em>(see People v Bailey, 58 </em>NY2d 272, 277 [1983] [\u201c(A) prosecutor may not, either in the course of closing argument or even in a less argumentative trial context, express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence\u201d] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>People v Wright, </em>41 NY2d 172, 175 [1976] [condemning the prosecutor\u2019s remarks regarding the defendant\u2019s character as improper and \u201cnot fairly inferrable from the evidence\u201d]; <em>People v Flynn, </em>79 NY2d 879, 881-882 [1992] [declaring it \u201cwell settled that all the elements of an indicted crime which are not conceded by defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel must be charged\u201d to the jury]). The attorneys\u2019 reticence in the face of this prejudicial rhetoric is not as clear-cut a basis for a finding of ineffectiveness as their apparent conflict; nonetheless, it only enhances what a reasonable appellate attorney should have identified as defendant\u2019s winning ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division and grant the coram nobis relief defendant seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Judges Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge Smith; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">.

For this same reason, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertions\u2014 rejecting defendant\u2019s additional claim that his counsel became conflicted by the prosecutor\u2019s allegation of criminal wrongdoing\u2014that the cross-examination \u201ccontained no suggestion of wrongdoing by defense counsel\u201d and that \u201cdefendant\u2019s appellate lawyer could reasonably have concluded that the record did not show that any such accusation was made\u201d (majority op at 300).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
