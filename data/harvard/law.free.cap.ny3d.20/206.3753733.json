The appeal should be dismissed because respondent\u2019s constitutional claims are not preserved for review by this Court. <em>(Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336; <em>Elezaj v Carlin Constr.

Respondent\u2019s equal protection claim fails because individuals considered under Mental Hygiene Law articles 9 and 10 are not similarly situated and can rationally be treated differently in any event. <em>(Matter of Walton v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>13 NY3d 475; <em>Cleburne v Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 US 432; <em>Port Jefferson Health Care Facility v Wing, </em>94 NY2d 284; <em>Nordlinger v Hahn, </em>505 US 1; <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41; <em>Hernandez v Robles, </em>7 NY3d 338; <em>Affronti v Crosson, </em>95 NY2d 713; <em>Kimel v Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>528 US 62; <em>New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

We hold that he was not and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">On February 13, 2001, respondent was convicted of attempted rape in the first degree and sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment with 30 months of parole supervision. Prior to his release, in October 2006, he was transferred from prison to the Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP), at Central New York Psychiatric Center (CNYPC) pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 9. In November 2006, he requested a hearing to contest his admission. Thereafter, in December 2006, CNYPC made an application to Supreme Court, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 9, for an order authorizing CNYPC to retain respondent involuntarily for a period not to exceed six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In January 2008, while the article 9 proceeding was pending, the Attorney General, on the State\u2019s behalf, filed an article 10 petition seeking a determination that respondent is a detained sex offender requiring civil management and involuntary confinement. Thereafter, respondent applied for an order staying the commencement of the article 10 trial until the article 9 proceeding was completed, arguing that while he was a \u201cdetained sex offender\u201d under Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (g) (5), the court was nevertheless required to determine whether he met the standard for \u201cmental illness\u201d under article 9 before proceeding under article 10. Respondent maintained that if the \u201carticle 9 admission is held to be invalid or [respondent] does not meet the criteria for involuntary admission to a psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>hospital, then there is no jurisdiction to commence the article 10 proceeding\u201d and \u201c[the article 10] proceeding must be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Respondent\u2019s desire to proceed under article 9 was also rooted in his argument that, under Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 9.35 he would be entitled to a jury trial on \u201cthe question of mental illness and the need for retention,\u201d but under article 10, the question whether his condition \u201crequires inpatient confinement in a secure facility\u201d is decided solely by a judge. He maintained that \u201cit is a violation of [his] constitutional rights to be compelled to go forward to an article 10 jury trial until such time as the issues raised in my MHL article 9 demand for a hearing have been addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Relying on our decision in <em>State of N.Y. ex rel. Harkavy v Consilvio </em>(8 NY3d 645 [2007]), Supreme Court denied a stay, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201cthe issues pertaining to respondent\u2019s involuntary commitment to the SOTP at CNYPC under MHL Article 9 must be resolved in an appropriate commitment hearing held in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 10 of the MHL. As such, respondent\u2019s MHL Article 9 claims are rendered moot and/or academic as the basis for respondent\u2019s commitment is no longer MHL Article 9, but MHL Article 10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Thereafter, a trial was held pursuant to article 10 after which a jury found that respondent was a detained sex offender who suffered from a mental abnormality within the meaning of that statute. At a later hearing, Supreme Court, acting without a jury, concluded that clear and convincing evidence in the record established that respondent was a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement, and committed him to a secure facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Respondent appealed, arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict that he suffered from a mental abnormality was not supported by legally sufficient evidence; and that Mental Hygiene Law article 10 improperly deprived him of his right to a jury trial under the United States and New York State Constitutions on the issue of whether he should be involuntarily committed to a secure facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed (86 AD3d 26 [3d Dept 2011]), finding that legally sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict. It further held that respondent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>not deprived of his constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of confinement. It first concluded that because respondent \u201cwas provided [with] a jury trial on the initial question of mental abnormality, ... his constitutional right to a jury trial\u201d was satisfied <em>(id. </em>at 30). The court similarly held that respondent\u2019s equal protection rights were not violated, concluding that respondents under article 10 were not similarly situated to those under article 9 <em>(id.). </em>Respondent appealed as of right to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As an initial matter, we conclude that respondent adequately preserved his constitutional arguments in his motion to stay the article 10 proceeding. We nevertheless disagree with respondent on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Respondent first contends that the State violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal and State Constitutions because the State affords other similarly situated individuals the right to have a jury determine the issue of confinement, while article 10 does not. Specifically, he points to the fact that individuals subject to article 9 are provided the right to have a jury determine both whether the individual is mentally ill and whether the individual should be confined to receive involuntary care <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 9.35).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The Equal Protection Clause in the New York State Constitution states that \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state or any subdivision thereof\u2019 (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 11). The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \u201cNo State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d In essence, the constitutional guarantee of equal protection is \u201cthat all persons similarly situated must be treated alike\u201d <em>(Bower Assoc. v Town of Pleasant Val., </em>2 NY3d 617, 630 [2004]). Thus, a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201cviolation of equal protection arises where <em>first, </em>a person (compared with others similarly situated) is selectively treated and <em>second, </em>such treatment is based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 631).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">It is clear that article 10 respondents are not similarly situated to those subject to proceedings under article 9. Indeed, in <em>State of N.Y. ex rel. Harkavy v Consilvio </em>(7 NY3d 607 [2006]) we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>held that the State could not apply article 9 of the Mental Hygiene Law to sex offenders who were serving a sentence when that process began. After that decision the legislature enacted article 10, acknowledging that \u201csex offenders in need of civil commitment are a different population from traditional mental health patients, who have different treatment needs and particular vulnerabilities\u201d and that such civil commitment \u201cshould be implemented in ways that do not endanger, stigmatize, or divert needed treatment resources away from such traditional mental health patients\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.01 [g]).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Article 10 respondents cannot be classified as a subset of article 9 respondents because they are a different category of individuals in terms of the nature of their mental disabilities, their treatment needs and the public safety concerns they present. The individuals targeted under article 9 and article 10 proceedings are distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In any event, because article 9 and article 10 involve two different categories of persons, with different treatment needs, it was appropriate for the legislature to treat them differently. The State correctly notes that the confinement decision under article 9 is quite different than that of article 10. Article 10 has two dispositional choices\u2014either confinement or strict and intensive supervision and treatment <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.07 [f])\u2014while under article 9 confinement is the only available disposition. The determination as to the level of danger an individual poses to public safety is inextricably tied to the nature of the treatment and supervision options available. This difference supports the legislature\u2019s decision that the confinement determination under article 10 is better suited for the court rather than a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Nor was respondent denied his state constitutional right to a trial by jury. Article I, \u00a7 2 of the New York Constitution provides that \u201c[tjrial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever.\u201d \u201cThe express language of this provision exhorts us to consider as an historical matter the types of actions to which the right to a jury trial has traditionally attached\u201d <em>(Matter of DES Mkt. Share Litig., </em>79 NY2d 299, 304 [1992]). We have held that a jury trial is guaranteed: \u201c(1) in all those cases to which it would have traditionally been afforded under the common law before 1777, and (2) in all cases to which the Legislature by statute extended a right to a jury trial between 1777 and 1894\u201d <em>(id.). </em>\u201cIn addition, it has been held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the right to a jury trial is not strictly limited to those instances in which it was actually used in 1894, but also extends to new cases that are analogous to those traditionally tried by a jury\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 305).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Respondent asserts that historical civil commitment statutes on their face provided a right to a jury trial regarding questions of a person\u2019s mental illness and need for confinement. Thus, he argues that under the law as it existed at the time of the enactment of the New York State Constitution in 1894, a jury was required to decide both mental illness and the need for confinement, as both issues were considered as part of the same overarching inquiry. However in those historic civil commitment proceedings, once the jury made a finding of mental illness, the judge was statutorily mandated to confine the individual. This continued until 1972, when the legislature amended the civil commitment statute (article 9) to direct juries to consider both mental illness and the \u201cneed for retention\u201d in a mental facility <em>(see </em>L 1972, ch 251, \u00a7 31.25). This change was wholly for the benefit of the individual subject to civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The legislature chose not to assign to a jury the article 10 process which makes inquiry of whether the individual\u2019s dangerousness necessarily requires retention or the individual could safely be treated and/or supervised on an outpatient basis. When the legislature assigned that new, purely remedial determination to a judge rather than a jury, it did not violate respondent\u2019s state constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
