Confronted with the tragic events of that infamous day, the legislature recognized that \u201cterrorism is a serious and deadly problem that disrupts public order and threatens individual safety both at home and around the world\u201d (L 2001, ch 300, \u00a7 4). It decided that New York laws needed to be \u201cstrengthened\u201d with comprehensive legislation ensuring \u201cthat terrorists . . . are prosecuted and punished in state courts with appropriate severity\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The result was Penal Law article 490 and, among its provisions, was the new \u201ccrime of terrorism\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 490.25). It occurs when a person \u201ccommits a specified offense\u201d with the \u201cintent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 490.25 [1]). Specified offenses include many class A and violent felonies, as well as attempts to commit those crimes <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 490.05 [3] [a], [b]). Article 490 does not, however, contain a statutory definition of \u201cintent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 490.25 [1]). This appeal requires us to consider whether this phrase encompasses the acts perpetrated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Defendant Edgar Morales was a member of a street gang known as the \u201cSt. James Boys\u201d or \u201cSJB\u201d\u2014apparently named for the vicinity of the Bronx where the SJB operated (running from Webster Avenue to University Avenue and from 204th Street to 170th Street). The SJB was originally formed to protect its members from other gangs and its primary objective was to be the most feared Mexican gang in the Bronx. The SJB allegedly targeted and assaulted individuals who belonged to rival confederations, extorted monies from a prostitution business and committed a series of robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">On the evening of August 17, 2002, several SJB members, including defendant, went to a christening party in the Bronx. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>They saw a man named Miguel who they thought belonged to a gang that was responsible for a friend\u2019s death. When Miguel refused to comply with their demand to leave the party, they planned to assault him after the festivities ended. Defendant took possession of a revolver from another SJB member, agreeing to shoot Miguel if it appeared that his cohorts were losing the battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Around midnight, a fight broke out between the SJB members and Miguel and his companions. During the melee, an SJB member directed defendant to shoot and he fired five bullets from the handgun. Three shots hit one of the rivals and paralyzed him. A 10-year-old girl was shot in the head and died. After the SJB members fled the scene, defendant handed the gun to a female member who later passed the weapon to another SJB member. Another SJB member threw the five spent shell casings into a sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">After the incident, the police obtained a videotape of the christening party and using still photographs from the video, they distributed photos of suspects to the media. Subsequently, several SJB members identified defendant as one of the individuals involved in the shooting. When he was questioned by the police, defendant admitted that he attended the party but denied being the shooter, claiming that he was merely the person who carried the weapon away from the scene. Additional evidence was gathered during the investigation, including four shell casings retrieved from a sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The People subsequently secured a 70-count indictment against the SJB members. Defendant, along with certain accomplices, was charged with crimes of terrorism pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 490.25 predicated on: intentional murder in the second degree; manslaughter in the first degree; attempted murder in the second degree; gang assault in the first degree; and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. The underlying offenses were charged separately without the terrorism designations. Defendant and 19 others were also charged with conspiracy in the second degree based on a multitude of overt acts, including various assaults and homicides that occurred from mid-2001 to mid-2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">During the trial, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the terrorism charges. The defense argued that the activities of the SJB were \u201cdirected at rival gangs, almost exclusively\u201d and there was \u201cno real evidence, certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>not evidence sufficient to get to the jury on the element of acting with intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\u201d The People maintained that the targeting of other gangs was covered by Penal Law article 490 and, in any event, there was adequate proof that the SJB engaged in acts intended to intimidate or coerce all Mexican-Americans in the pertinent geographical area.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Supreme Court denied the motion, concluding that the People had established a prima facie case of terrorism based on the five designated underlying offenses. The jury convicted defendant of three crimes of terrorism under Penal Law \u00a7 490.25 premised on first-degree manslaughter, attempted second-degree murder and second-degree weapon possession, as well as second-degree conspiracy for agreeing to commit first-degree gang assault as a crime of terrorism. Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 40 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The Appellate Division, First Department, held that there was insufficient evidence to prove an intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population because the People established that defendant only engaged in gang-related street crimes, not terrorist acts (86 AD3d 147 [2011]). As a result, the Appellate Division modified by reducing the terrorism convictions to the three primary offenses and the conspiracy conviction was reduced from second degree to fourth degree. Defendant\u2019s other challenges\u2014including his claim that the People\u2019s theory of terrorism unduly prejudiced the entire trial\u2014were rejected as unpreserved or meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A Judge of this Court granted leave to defendant and the People (17 NY3d 904 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The People assert that the term \u201ccivilian population\u201d as used in Penal Law article 490 embraces all of the Mexican-Americans who resided within the SJB\u2019s designated area, as well as the subset of rival Mexican-American gangs in the same vicinity. The prosecution asks us to reinstate the terrorism convictions, contending that there was sufficient evidence that defendant\u2019s actions after the party furthered the SJB\u2019s objective to intimidate or coerce other Mexican-American gangs in the Bronx and, as a result of those activities, the SJB intended to intimidate and coerce the entire Mexican-American community during the time period charged in the indictment. Defendant argues that neither the population of Mexican-Americans in the St. James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Park neighborhood, nor the smaller category of rival gangs, can constitute a \u201ccivilian population\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We begin by examining the text of article 490, which does not define the phrase \u201cintent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\u201d We therefore give this language its \u201cmost natural and obvious meaning\u201d <em>(People v Hedgeman, </em>70 NY2d 533, 537 [1987]) based on common sense and reasonableness <em>(see e.g. People v Ballman, </em>15 NY3d 68, 73-74 [2010]; <em>People v Gallagher, </em>69 NY2d 525, 530 [1987]) in the context of the purpose and history of the terrorism statutes <em>(see e.g. People v Sanchez, </em>13 NY3d 554, 565 [2009]). \u201cCivilian population\u201d could be read broadly to encompass a variety of communities depending on how the relevant \u201carea\u201d is defined and who lives within that territory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conceivably, it could range from the residents of a single apartment building to a neighborhood, city, county, state or even a country.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Like the Appellate Division, we find it unnecessary to precisely define the contours of the phrase \u201ccivilian population\u201d for two reasons. First, even assuming that all of the Mexican-Americans in the St. James Park area may be considered a \u201ccivilian population,\u201d the evidence at trial failed to demonstrate that defendant and his fellow gang members committed the acts against Miguel and his companions with the conscious objective of intimidating every Mexican-American in the territory identified at trial. Rather, viewing the proof in the light most favorable to the People <em>(see People v Ramos, </em>19 NY3d 133, 136 [2012]), the prosecution demonstrated that defendant and his accomplices arranged the attack because of Miguel\u2019s assumed membership in a rival gang and his refusal to leave the party. We do not believe that this discrete criminal transaction against identified gang enemies was designed to intimidate or coerce the entire Mexican-American community in this Bronx neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Second, while there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which the jury could have concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>one of defendant\u2019s possible goals for attacking Miguel was to intimidate or coerce another gang, there is no indication that the legislature enacted article 490 of the Penal Law with the intention of elevating gang-on-gang street violence to the status of terrorism as that concept is commonly understood. Specifically, the statutory language cannot be interpreted so broadly so as to cover individuals or groups who are not normally viewed as \u201cterrorists\u201d <em>(see generally Hedgeman, </em>70 NY2d at 537) and the legislative findings in section 490.00 clearly demonstrate that the legislature was not extending the reach of the new statute to crimes of this nature. This is apparent in the examples of terrorism cited in the legislative findings: (1) the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon; (2) the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; (3) the destruction of the Oklahoma City federal office building in 1995; (4) the mid-air bombing of Pan Am Flight number 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988; (5) the 1997 shooting from atop the Empire State Building; (6) the 1994 murder of Ari Halberstam on the Brooklyn Bridge; and (7) the bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993 <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 490.00). The offenses committed by defendant and his associates after the christening party obviously are not comparable to these instances of terroristic acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We must also consider the sources that the legislature consulted in drafting the new statutes. The definitional provisions of Penal Law article 490 were \u201cdrawn from the federal definition of \u2018international terrorism\u2019 \u201d (William C. Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law \u00a7 490.10 at 299; <em>see also </em>Richard A. Greenberg et al., New York Criminal Law \u00a7 39:1 at 1738 [3d ed 6 West\u2019s NY Prac Series 2007] [explaining that the legislature was able to act six days after September 11th \u201cbecause of the model provided by existing federal antiterrorism legislation\u201d]). The federal antiterrorism statutes were designed to criminalize acts such as \u201cthe detonation of bombs in a metropolitan area\u201d or \u201cthe deliberate assassination of persons to strike fear into others to deter them from exercising their rights\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014 conduct that is not akin to the serious offenses charged in this case. Similarly, a statute extending federal jurisdiction to certain crimes committed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Americans abroad with the intent \u201cto coerce, intimidate, or retaliate against ... a civilian population\u201d (18 USC \u00a7 2332 [d]) was not meant to reach \u201cnormal street crime\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (see <em>e.g. Linde v Arab Bank, PLC, </em>384 F Supp 2d 571, 581 n 7 [ED NY 2005] [\u201cdrive-by shootings and other street crime,\u201d and \u201cordinary violent crimes . . . robberies or personal vendettas,\u201d do not satisfy the intent element of \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d under 18 USC \u00a7 2331 (1)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">If we were to apply a broad definition to \u201cintent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d the People could invoke the specter of \u201cterrorism\u201d every time a Blood assaults a Crip or an organized crime family orchestrates the murder of a rival syndicate\u2019s soldier. But the concept of terrorism has a unique meaning and its implications risk being trivialized if the terminology is applied loosely in situations that do not match our collective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act. History and experience have shown that it is impossible for us to anticipate every conceivable manner in which evil schemes can threaten our society. Because the legislature was aware of the difficulty in defining or categorizing specific acts of terrorism, it incorporated a general definition of the crime <em>(see generally People v Garson, </em>6 NY3d 604, 612 [2006]; <em>People v Lang, </em>36 NY2d 366, 371 [1975]) and referenced seven notorious acts of terrorism that serve as guideposts for determining whether a future incident qualifies for this nefarious designation <em>(see generally People v Assi, </em>14 NY3d 335, 341 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Considered in that context, and subject to possible exceptions that could arise if a criminal organization engages in terrorist activities, we conclude that the legislature did not intend for the crime of terrorism to cover the illegal acts of a gang member committed for the purpose of coercing or intimidating adversaries. Therefore, the evidence in this case was insufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under Penal Law \u00a7 490.25. Defendant\u2019s violent, criminal acts as a member of the SJB gang unquestionably resulted in tragic consequences\u2014 the needless death of a little girl and the paralysis of a young man\u2014but they were not acts of terrorism within the meaning of Penal Law article 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On his cross appeal, defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial on the underlying offenses specified in the terrorism counts because the theory of terrorism should not have been charged and the People were therefore permitted to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence that unduly prejudiced the jury\u2019s ability to fairly adjudicate his guilt or innocence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cWhether an error in the proceedings relating to one count requires reversal of convictions on other jointly tried counts is a question that can only be resolved on a case-by-case basis\u201d <em>(People v Baghai-Kermani, </em>84 NY2d 525, 532 [1994]). We must evaluate \u201cthe individual facts of the case, the nature of the error and its potential for prejudicial impact on the over-all outcome\u201d <em>(People v Concepcion, </em>17 NY3d 192, 196-197 [2011] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; <em>see also People v Doshi, </em>93 NY2d 499, 505 [1999]). Reversal is required if \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the jury\u2019s decision to convict on the tainted counts influenced its guilty verdict on the remaining counts in a meaningful way\u201d <em>(Doshi, </em>93 NY2d at 505 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; <em>see also People v Daly, </em>14 NY3d 848, 849 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">By proceeding on the terrorism theory, the People were able to introduce evidence about numerous alleged criminal acts committed by members of the SJB gang over the course of three years. Without the aura of terrorism looming over the case, the activities of defendant\u2019s associates in other contexts would have been largely, if not entirely, inadmissible. Based on the record, it is apparent that the volume of proof regarding unrelated assaults, murders and other offenses created a reasonable possibility that the jury\u2019s findings were prejudicially influenced. Hence, the spillover effect requires reversal and a new trial on the underlying offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Accordingly, on the People\u2019s appeal, the order should be affirmed. On defendant\u2019s appeal, the order should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>On the People\u2019s appeal, order affirmed.
