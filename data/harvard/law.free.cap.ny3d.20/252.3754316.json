V The courts below correctly made their findings of fact based upon admissible evidence. <em>(Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557; <em>Urban v City of Albany, </em>90 AD3d 1132.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b331-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b331-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">When an owner of real property moves, and does not give a new address to the collector of real property taxes, he or she may fail to receive notices of overdue taxes and related legal proceedings, and the property may consequently be lost in foreclosure. The United States Supreme Court and our Court have held that, in such situations, due process requires taxing authorities to take reasonable steps to track down the missing taxpayer before seizing and selling his or her property <em>(Jones v Flowers, </em>547 US 220 [2006]; <em>Kennedy v Mossafa, </em>100 NY2d 1 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">This case raises the question of how much a taxing authority is required to do. Plaintiffs argue that, when notice mailed to them at their last known address, in New Jersey, proved undeliverable, the tax collector was required to find some means of making personal service on them, or to address a notice to \u201coccupant\u201d at the former address, or to search New Jersey public records for a new address. We hold that these steps were not constitutionally required, and that plaintiffs have not been deprived of their property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In 1988, plaintiffs acquired a vacant lot in the Town of Chester, in Warren County, New York. Plaintiffs then lived in South Orange, New Jersey, and their South Orange address appeared on the deed. The Town sent them real property tax bills at that address, and plaintiffs paid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In 1993, plaintiffs moved from South Orange to Millburn, New Jersey. They arranged with the post office to forward their mail, but they did not then inform the Town of Chester taxing authorities of their new address. The 1994 tax bill was forwarded from South Orange to Millburn, and paid. Plaintiffs claim that, after receiving the forwarded bill, they gave their new address to the Town in a handwritten note and in a telephone call, but plaintiffs have no record of either communication, and neither is reflected in the Town\u2019s records. To accept undocumented claims of this kind would be to invite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>abuse, and we therefore conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cbare allegation\u201d is insufficient to defeat summary judgment on the issue of whether they gave notice of their change of address to the Town (see <em>Kennedy, </em>100 NY2d at 10); we take it as established that they gave no such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A year after plaintiffs moved, their forwarding arrangement with the post office expired. Tax bills for the next three years, mailed to them at the South Orange address, were returned to the Town. In <em>1998, </em>Warren County sent a warning letter to the South Orange address that was also returned, and then began a foreclosure proceeding. It served plaintiffs with the petition and notice of petition by certified mail addressed to the South Orange address. The mailing was returned with the notation: \u201cUndeliverable as Addressed-Forwarding Order Expired.\u201d Plaintiffs defaulted in the foreclosure proceeding and title to the property passed to the County, which sold it at auction in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Plaintiffs did not learn of these events until 2003. After unsuccessful federal litigation, they began the present action in 2005, asserting that the attempts to give them notice of the foreclosure were constitutionally inadequate, and seeking a declaration that they still owned the property. Supreme Court granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the Appellate Division affirmed <em>(MacNaughton v Warren County, </em>89 AD3d 1269 [2011]). Plaintiffs appeal to this Court as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">At the time the County began its foreclosure proceeding in 1998, the Real Property Tax Law required that notice of the proceeding be published in at least two newspapers (RPTL 1124 [1]) and that it be \u201cmailed, by ordinary first class mail\u201d to the owners of the property (former RPTL 1125 [1]). It is not disputed that the County complied with the statutes. The question is whether the State or Federal Constitution required it to do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">It has been clear since our 2003 decision in <em>Kennedy </em>that more is sometimes required when a mailed notice is returned as undeliverable. In that case we rejected \u201cthe view that the enforcing officer\u2019s obligation is always satisfied by sending the notice to the address listed in the tax roll\u201d and said: \u201cGenerally, when the notice is returned as undeliverable, the tax district should conduct a reasonable search of the public record\u201d (100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>NY2d at 9). We added, however, that \u201c[a] reasonable search of the public record . . . does not necessarily require searching the Internet, voting records, motor vehicle records, the telephone book or other similar resource\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In <em>Jones, </em>decided in 2006, the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution in a case in which two notices sent by a taxing authority were returned \u201cunclaimed.\u201d Applying the principle that the means used to give a constitutionally-required notice \u201cmust be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt\u201d <em>(Mullane v Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 US 306, 315 [1950], quoted in <em>Jones, </em>547 US at 229), the Court held that \u201cadditional reasonable steps to provide notice\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 223) were necessary, and specified several that could have been taken: \u201cto resend the notice by regular mail\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 234), \u201cto post notice on the front door\u201d of the taxed property (which in <em>Jones </em>was also the taxpayer\u2019s former home) or \u201cto address otherwise undeliverable mail to \u2018occupant\u2019 \u201d <em>{id. </em>at 235). But the Supreme Court in <em>Jones </em>declined, as we did in <em>Kennedy, </em>to impose more stringent requirements: It specifically rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument that the tax commissioner \u201cshould have searched for his new address in the . . . phonebook and other government records such as income tax rolls\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 235-236). The Court remarked: \u201cAn open-ended search for a new address . . . imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined above\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In this case it is not clear what, if any, steps the County took to locate plaintiffs after notice of the foreclosure proceeding was returned as undeliverable. Plaintiffs have not, however, shown that there were any steps required by the State or Federal Constitution, as interpreted in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Jones, </em>that would have yielded plaintiffs\u2019 new address.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Plaintiffs suggest that the County should have attempted \u201cpersonal service,\u201d as it does for taxpayers who five within the County; they have not explained, however, how the County could have served them personally without knowing their new address. Plaintiffs also suggest that the County should have followed one of the courses mentioned in <em>Jones: </em>mailing notice to the taxpayer\u2019s last known address addressed to \u201coccupant.\u201d But the suggestion ignores the difference between <em>Jones </em>and this case. In <em>Jones, </em>the taxpayer\u2019s last known address was the property the taxing authority was trying to tax; the taxpayer still owned it. In that situation, it was reasonable to believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>mailing from the taxing authorities addressed to the \u201coccupant\u201d of the property would be passed on by the occupant to the owner. But we see little point in requiring a taxing authority to mail a letter to \u201coccupant\u201d at an address that has no connection with the tax claim except that the taxpayer used to live there. There is no reason to think that the new occupant of plaintiffs\u2019 former home would be at all concerned with whether the taxes on a vacant parcel in Warren County, New York were paid or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Finally, plaintiffs suggest that the County should have searched the public records of the county of their last known address\u2014Essex County, New Jersey. This requirement, we think, would put too great a burden on the taxing authority. It is one thing to require a search of records in the taxing authority\u2019s own county\u2014the county where the property being taxed is located. It is something different to require taxing authorities to familiarize themselves with the procedures for searching records in any location where a taxpayer happens to have lived. <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Jones </em>declined to require a search of such sources as the Internet and the telephone book <em>(Kennedy, </em>100 NY2d at 10; <em>Jones, </em>547 US at 235-236). The search plaintiffs say the County should have conducted seems to us to be in the same category.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We therefore hold that due process did not require the County to take the steps that plaintiffs say it should have taken. In so holding, we acknowledge that the County might reasonably have been expected to do more than it did. Indeed, if the same case were to arise today, the County would be required by statute to do more: RPTL 1125 (1), which in 1998 required only an ordinary mail notice, was amended shortly after the <em>Jones </em>decision to require mailing \u201cboth by certified mail and ordinary first class mail,\u201d and also, in the event both mailings are returned, an attempt by the taxing authority \u201cto obtain an alternative mailing address from the United States postal service\u201d (RPTL 1125 [1] [b] [i]; see L 2006, ch 415, \u00a7 1). This last step does not seem a burdensome one, and this case might be different if the County\u2019s failure to take that step had caused plaintiffs to lose their property. But plaintiffs do not claim that that is true; they have made no attempt to show that an inquiry to the post office\u2014in 1998, five years after plaintiffs moved away from South Orange\u2014would have resulted in the County\u2019s learning plaintiffs\u2019 Millburn, New Jersey address.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
