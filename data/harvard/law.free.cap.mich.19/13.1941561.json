That as appears by the report of the Auditor General for 1868, a similar tax of one-twentieth of a mill was assessed in the year 1868 under said law of 1867 amounting to $15,398,30. That said tax was- charged with other State taxes over to the several counties of the State. That according to the regular course of business in the collection of State taxes previous to February 24,1869, a large proportion of said tax had been collected and was then in the hands of the Collectors of taxes for the several' cities and townships and of the several County Treasurers. That since said last mentioned date and prior to June 12, 1869, a large proportion of said taxes has been actually paid to the State Treasurer, but he could not state the precise amount. That said Auditor on proper demand had refused to pay over the amount of said tax: claiming that said board was not entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-9\">The following are the provisions alluded to in the laws of 1867 and 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-10\">\n<em>1867 No. 59.

By the act of 1867, page 85, the Legislature provided for the raising by tax 1-20 of a mill on each dollar of taxable property in the State, commencing in 1867. It was to be raised and collected and paid into the Treasury the same as other State taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-11\">'By the same law then in force the County Treasurers commenced paying in to the State Treasurer March 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>1868, and the taxes were not all paid in until December 15, 1868.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">The proviso to the act prevented the payment of the money until the Regents had established a certain school of medicine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">II. The act of 1869, page 19, is in effect an original act, although it is styled an amendment. It provides for a direct appropriation of $15,000 each year, commencing with 1869, and gives to the University the accrued sum collected under the act of 1867.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-8\">Now, if the University is entitled to the sum claimed by the relator, it follows that the University will receive for the year 1869 over $30,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-9\">It will be borne in mind that no sum was to be paid in 1867 by the act of 1867. The act only provides for the assessment in that year, and the amount assessed is to be paid when collected, and it was not and could not have been collected in that year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-10\">When the demand was made, and even now, under the view of the relator, the second tax under the act of 1867 has not been collected, and hence is not in the Treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-11\">This Court will Rot compel the respondent to draw his warrant on a fund not in existence. Nor will the Court compel the respondent to figure up, if he can, the amount which has been' paid into the, Treasury, and draw his warrant on a fraction of the entire sum.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-12\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b16-13\">We are all of the opinion that the Legislature intended by the act of 1869, to give to the University whatever should be collected under the act of 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-14\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
