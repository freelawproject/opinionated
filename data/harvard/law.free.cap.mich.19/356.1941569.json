Spaulding entered tbe premises in question, at tbe land office in Detroit, and that tbe certificate of such entry was numbered 12,714, and also, that a patent from tbe United States was issued to Shubael Conant, as assignee of Spaulding, of said premises, dated April first, A.

D., 1835; to the introduction of which evidence the defendant objected, upon the ground that at the date of said deed said Conant had no title to said premises. The Judge overruled the objection and admitted the evidence; to which decision the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">And the plaintiff further gave in evidence the record of several deeds, and also the depositions of witnesses showing a conveyance of said premises from Sylvanus Bussell to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">The defendant claimed title under a tax deed from the State of Michigan to Alpheus S. Williams, of the premises, under a sale thereof by the Auditor General on the second day of June, 1858, for the taxes of the year <em>1857, </em>and deeds proving the conveyance thereof from said Williams \u2022to the defendant; and offered testimony to prove that one George V. Clark was in the actual occupation of a small part of said premises, enclosed by a brush fence, and cultivated the same as a garden at the time of the commencement of this suit, and that he claimed to be in possession of the whole thereof, under a permission of the defendant that he might go on to said premises and work the same, and that he occasionally cut trees and wood upon other portions of said premises, he at that time residing upon a farm of his own adjoining these premises, and not on the premises in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">The plaintiff offered rebutting evidence to prove that the said deed from the- State of Michigan to Alpheus S. Williams, was invalid and conveyed no title to said premises, for the reason that the tax 'for which the. same was sold was excessive to a large amount, and beyond the amount authorized by law, and that it included a tax for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>building a bridge near tbe town of Ecorse, that was not only without authority of law, but contrary to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The defendant objected to the introduction of such evidence as incompetent, and also upon the ground that, under the provisions of the statutes, such evidence was not admissible and would not tend to invalidate the said tax deed, or defeat the title conveyed by such deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">The Judge admitted the testimony;

but if you shall find that he was in possession of the whole, then of course they cannot recover in this suit, if you shall find that he <em>actually occupied </em>the whole;\u201d to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">The Court further charged the jury that the question of possession is a question of fact for the jury to decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">The defendant requested the Court to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">\u201c That the deed from Spaulding to Conant conveyed to the latter no legal title, as at the date thereof the title was still in the Government;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">\u201cThat the deed from Conant to Russell conveyed on title for the same reason:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">\u201cThat the deed from Conant to Russell being a mere quit claim deed, the legal title subsequently acquired by Conant did not enure to the benefit of Russell;\u201d but the Judge refused so to charge said jury; to which refusal defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-11\">The defendant further requested the Court to charge the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">\u201c That if the jury find that the premises in question were actually occupied by George Y, Clark at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>this suit was brought, in July, 1865, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.\u201d \u201cThe Judge charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">\u201c I have already charged you that, gentlemen, if you find that at the time this suit was commenced, the witness, Clark <em>actually </em>occupied these premises, <em>all </em>of them, the plaintiff cannot recover;\u201d to which opiniop of the said Circuit Judge the counsel for the said defendant did then and there, on behalf of the said defendant, except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">The defendant further requested the court to charge the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">\u201cThat if George V. Clark was actually cultivating a portion of these premises in 1865, as a garden, and claimed to be in the occupation of the whole eighty, there being no adverse or other possession, and was occasionally cutting-wood and timber thereon during the summer of 1S65, that was an occupation within the provision of our Statute;\u201d but the Judge refused so to charge and said to the jury: \u201c That I cannot charge you, gentlemen, as it is stated there. The question for you is, whether he was in <em>actual possession, </em>not whether he claimed to be;\u201d to which refusals and charges the defendant in each case excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff; and the judgnient entered thereon is brought into this Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-9\"><em>G. I Walicer, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-10\">I. It is claimed by the plaintiff in error that no legal title to the premises had vested in Conant, at the time of his conveyance to Bussell, and there being no covenants of warranty in that conveyance, the legal title subsequently acquired by the patent did not enure to the benefit of Bussell or his grantees, and, therefore, that the plaintiff below had not made out a title to the premises in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-11\">The assignment of July 7, 1835, cannot be held to be a conveyance, for the reason that it is not acknowledged as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>required by the act of 1827, then in <em>force. </em>\u2014 Laws <em>of 1833, page 279. </em>Nor can such assignment be proved by an exemplified copy from the land office. It is not a paper required by any rule of law to be filed or recorded in such office, and, if there, its existence must be proved, and then its contents, by a sworn copy or other proper secondary <em>evidence.</em>\u20142 <em>Comp. Laws secs. 4,308, 4,311; 2 Edward\u2019s Phillips\u2019 Ev. 523, 568, notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-6\">But there lies back of these a still more serious objection, viz: That neither Spaulding or Conant, when they conveyed the premises, had any legal title thereto, and there being no covenants of warranty, no title passed to Bussell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-8\">It is well settled that the holder of a duplicate or a certificate of entry of land before the issue of the patent has only an equitable title, and he cannot recover thereon at law save by the aid of some local statute or usage.\u2014<em>Fenn v. Holme, 21 How., 488; Hooper v. Scheimer, 23 How., 236; Carman v. Johnson, 20 Mo., 110. </em>In some States without statute and in others by statute, the holder of the certificate of entry is held to have such an inchoate legal title that he may recover thereon in ejectment.\u2014<em>McConnell v. Wilcox, 1 Scam. 366; Waller v. Vanpuhl, 14 Mo. 87; 2 Comp. Laws, sec. 4,332.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-9\">But this cannot be where the patent has issued, which is the highest and best evidence of title, or in the language of our statute, is \u201ca better title.\u201d But it is claimed that where one who purchases land and receives a certificate therefor, conveys the land and subsequently receives a patent therefor, that by virtue of the artificial doctrine of relation, the patent relates back to the time of the entry, and passes a good legal title to the grantee. There is unquestionably quite an array of authority sustaining this <em>position.</em>\u20142 <em>Washb. on Real Prop. 226 and 229; Jackson v. McCall, 3 Cow. 75; Richardson v. Cleveland, 5 Porter, 251; Jones v. Sage, 5 Porter, 327; Hayward v. Ormsby, 11 Wis. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>3; Cavender v.

Eastes, 3 Porter, 373.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">Yet it would seem that if a patent relates to the time of entry, that if one make an entry and dies, and the patent be issued in his name after death, that it should be held a good conveyance, and yet the law is clearly otherwise.\u2014<em>Wood v. Ferguson, 7 Ohio St. 288; Phillips v. Sherman, 86 Ala. 189; Schedda v. Sawyer, 4 McLean, 182; Gadoway v. Finlay, 12 Pet. 297.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">But lyhatever may be the general doctrine upon the subject, in this case no patent was ever issued to and in the name of the original purchaser, and we submit that this doctrine of relation whatever may be its merits, should not be applied to this ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\">II. We claim upon the part of the plaintiff in error that the charge of the Court and the refusal to charge upon the subject of the occupation of Geo. <em>Y. </em>Clark were calculated to mislead the jury and were erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\">The testimony, on the part of the plaintiff tended to show that the actual occupation by cultivation of Geo. V. Clark was only about one-tenth of an acre.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-9\">The effect of these rulings and refusals must have been to have led the jury to the conviction that to make the actual occupation required by our statute, there must be an actual enclosure of the whole premises or the cultivation thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-10\">The evidence of the defendant tended to show that Geo. <em>Y. </em>Clark\u2019s possession, whatever it was, was under the title of the defendant, who had a deed of the whole eighty. He was in the actual occupation of a portion, and claimed to be in possession of the whole, and was exercising acts of control over the whole. We submit that in such a case that he is deemed to be in the actual occupation of the whole, (there being no adverse possession), that it is such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>an occupation as would be an adverse possession of tbe <em>whole</em>.\u2014Jackson <em>v. Vermillion, 6 Cow. 677; Ellicott v. Pearl, 1 McLean, 214; Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Peters, 413, 442; Hale v. Ritterhouse, 25 Penn. 496; Jackson v. Elston, 12 Johns. 452, 454.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-5\">III. The third question is as to the construction and validity of sec. 164 of the tax law of 1869.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-6\">That section provides that \u201cin all suits and controversies involving the title to land claimed and held by virtue of a deed executed by the Auditor General of this State for non-payment of taxes thereon, the person claiming adverse title to such deed shall b\u00e9 required to,prove, <em>in order to defeat the title conveyed by such deed, </em>either\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As\">1st. That the land taxed was not subject to taxation; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAB\">2d. That the taxes were paid; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-7\">3d. That they were not assessed; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">4th. That the land had been redeemed; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">5th. That a certificate had been given by the proper officer stating that no taxes were due, or the lands were not subject to <em>redemption.</em>\u2014Session <em>Laws of 1869, p. 878.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-10\">The counsel for the defendant put in evidence a deed from the Auditor General, showing a sale of the lands in question for the taxes of 1857, and a conveyance thereof from the grantee to the defendant, in 1859.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-11\">But the question raised is simply this: Whether any \u2014even the smallest amount \u2014 of an illegal, excessive tax, can, under the law of 1869, be shown, in order to defeat the title conveyed by the Auditor General.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">It may be admitted, under our tax system, as settled by this Court, that any excess of tax, however trifling, and whether resulting from mere mistake, miscalculation or otherwise, makes the tax of which it forms a part void and a tax title thereunder invalid, unless such effect is avoided by the force of the statute in <em>question.</em>\u2014Lacy <em>v. Davis, 4 Mich. 157; Case v. Dean, 16 Mich. 32 and 33.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-14\">In examining the question whether this statute has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>such effect, involves the examination of several distinct points, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>First. </em>Is this statute applicable to the case now before the court \u2014 a case not only where the defendant\u2019s title originated before the act, but a case actually pending in court at the time of its passage. It determines what. evidence is required to defeat a title claimed and held under the deed of the Auditor General in <em>all </em>suits and controversies involving the title to land so claimed. <em>This </em>is a suit involving the title to land so claimed and is brought within the clear and'express provisions of the act. It is not even retrospective in its character, but establishes a rule for future trials.\u2014 <em>Cooley on Const. Lim. 367 and 368.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">Thus, the famous act of Lord Tenterden, providing that a parol promise should not be sufficient evidence to take a case out of the operation of the statute of limitations was held applicable to suits pending at the time of its passage. <em>Ansell v. Ansell, 3 C. and P., 563; Hamner v. Cattell, 5 Bing., 208; Fowler v. Chatterton, 6 Bing. 258; </em>So a law similar to the present was held applicable to deeds previously <em>obtained.</em>\u2014Freeman <em>v.

Coats, 7 Watts, 300.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">We submit, therefore, that the law in question is applicable to cases like the present, viz: cases pending when the law was enacted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-8\"><em>F.

The exemplified copy of assignment from Spaulding to Conant, of July 7, 1835, was properly admitted in evidence, and the charge of the Court below in relation to the effect of the same was properly given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">The entry of the land by Spaulding was clearly proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>by evidence which was not objected to. . The instrument offered to show his transfer to Oonant was objected to upon the ground \u201cthat it was irrelevant, and conveyed no title to the lands therein described.\u201d The form of the evidence was unobjectionable.\u2014<em>Brightly's Digest, 267, 462, 463, 465; Lacy v. Davis, 4 Mich. 140; 2 Phillip's Ev. 301. a.</em>\u2014 By virtue of his entry, Spaulding acquired a legal title to the land, which he could assign, or convey, to the same extent, and in the same manner as any other land which he then owned. We concede that until the patent is issued, the fee of the public lands is in the Government, and that a patent is necessary to vest a complete title in the purchaser. But his entry gives him a legal title, and not a mere equity within the true meaning of these terms. Thus lands held by entry, descend to the heirs, or may be devised, and do not go to the <em>administrator.</em>\u20142 <em>Washburne on Real Prop., 527, 528; Adams v. Logan, 6 Monr., 175; Ostrom v, Hammond, 3 McLean, 106. b.</em>\u2014They are subject to sale on execution: <em>Goodlet v. Smitherson, 5 Porter, 243; Wright v. Swan, 6 Porter, 86; Landes v.

Rutgus, 14 Mo., 585. e.</em>\u2014The assignability of the interest in the land has not only been always recognized by the Government in its dealings with purchasers, but is expressly provided for by the laws of <em>Congress.</em>\u2014Brightly's <em>Digest 496, </em>\u00a7 <em>222; p. 503, </em>\u00a7 <em>257; p. 499, </em>\u00a7 <em>228.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\"><em>% </em>The instrument under consideration was properly executed, and was in form sufficient to operate both as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>assignment of the certificate and a conveyance of the land itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">3. But we insist that this question is one which cannot be properly raised, by the parties in this cause. The patent is shown to have been issued to Conant as assignee of Spaulding, and it is plenary proof, in all collateral proceedings, both of the entry of the land by Spaulding, and of his assignment and transfer to <em>Conant.</em>\u20142 <em>Washburns on Real Fstate, 526, 530; Morgan v.

This proposition is based upon the familiar doctrine of relation, which is, \u201cthat where there are divers acts concurrent to make a conveyance, estate or thing, the original act shall be preferred ; and to this the other acts shall have relation.\u201d\u2014<em>Vin.

The evidence offered in the Court below to show the invalidity of defendant\u2019s tax deed was properly admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">The evidence proved an \u201c illegal excess of taxation,\u201d which, \u25a0according to the decision of this and other courts, rendered the tax deed void. The objection to its introduction, was based upon the ground that section 164 of the tax law of 1869, rendered such evidence incompetent. To this we reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">1. The law of 1869 was intended to act prospectively and not retrospectively; and therefore does not apply to titles acquired previous to its enactment, <em>a. </em>\u2014 This appears from the title of the act, itself which is \u201c An act to provide for a uniform assessment of property, and for the collection and return of taxes thereon.\u201d These words preclude the idea that the law was intended to have any retroactive effect. A different construction would, as we submit, render the act void as contravening Sec. 20, Article 4, of the Constitution. The Court will not construe this law to act retrospectively, unless it appears that such was the legislative intent, either from the language used, or by necessary <em>implication.</em>\u2014Dooley\u2019s <em>Const.

The record does not show such an occupation on the part of Gr. Y.

We think it may be inferred from the record, what was conceded in the Court below, that the entire tract except this \u201c garden spot,\u201d was uninclosed woodland. Whether he in fact occupied this garden spot or not, was a question for the jury to decide, and such was the charge of the Court. The verdict shows that the jury did not believe the testimony offered by plaintiff in error, and that in their opinion G-. V. Clark was not in actual occupation of any part of the premises at the time suit was .commenced. As to what constitutes an actual occupation within the meaning of the statute, see <em>Chinique v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">This suit comes before us on writ of error sued out to reverse a judgment recovered by Hall in the Circuit Court for the County of Wayne m an action of ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It appears from the record that Erastus H. Spaulding purchased the lands in controversy of the Hnited States, on the fifth day of May, 1835, and received the usual certificate of entry therefor. On the seventh day of the following July, Spaulding, it is claimed, made a formal assignment of this certificate to Shubael Conant, and the Hnited States, on April 1, 1837, issued to Conant, as assignee of Spaulding, the usual patent for the lands. The patent was put in evidence, and no formal objection arises upon it; but the assignment by Spaulding to Conant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>only proved by an exemplified copy from the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington, and this is objected to as insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The particular objections to this evidence are two :</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">1. That the assignment was not acknowleged, and therefore was not sufficient to constitute a conveyance of an interest in lands under the statute in force when it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">2. That it is not a paper required by any rule of law to be filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and consequently is not a paper which can be proved by his certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The second objection we do not regard as tenable, whether there is or is not a statute of the United States which would require the filing. The propriety of the assignment remaining of record in the office of the Commissioner after the patent has been issued to the assignee is very obvious, and there can be no question, we should suppose, that his practice to retain and file a paper of this importance, which is to evidence the authority of the government to make a particular grant, constitutes it a part of the records of the office as much as if he were expressly required by law to make of it this disposition, and if it constitutes a part of the public records of the office, the Commissioner\u2019s certificate was sufficient to make it evidence.<em>\u2014Lacy v. Davis, 4 Mich. 140; Gilman v. Riopelle, 18 Mich. 145.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The first objection appears to us equally untenable. Spaulding, by virtue of his entry, acquired an equitable right to the land, which he might assign ; but the legal title still remained in the Government. He has made such an assignment as the Government has recognized by making a conveyance to his assignee, and we doubt the right of any person not claiming through or under Spaulding, to attack collaterally this assignment. A sovereignty, in making title to its own lands, has a right to determine for itself upon the sufficiency of whatever goes to entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the claimant to a conveyance; and when the conveyance has been issued, a third person, not in privity with the title, is not to be heard to allege that the conveyance has issued improvidently. The cases of <em>Stringer v. Young, 3 Pet., 320; Boardman v. Reed, 6 Pet., 328; Bagnell v. </em>Broderick, <em>13 Pet., 436, and Minter v. Crommelin, 18 How., 87, </em>are all authorities to the point that when a patent has been issued by the Government, all the necessary prerequisites are presumed to exist. This presumption, we think, is as applicable to an assignment, where the patent issues to an assignee, as to anything else which was essential to designate the person entitled to the conveyance, or the land to be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In saying this, however, we do not mean to be understood as expressing an opinion that there was ever a time in this State, or in Michigan Territory, when the terms of the statutes were such, that a deed would not be good as between the parties, because, though it had all other proper formalities, it was lacking in an acknowledgment. It does not become necessary to pass upon that question in this case, and we have not, therefore, given it special attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A further objection arises upon the conveyance made of the land by Conant. It appears that he conveyed to one Russell before he received a patent. The conveyance was by quit claim, and defendant claims that as Conant had no legal title at the time, his deed conveyed none, and the title he subsequently acquired by the patent, did not enure to the benefit of Russell, inasmuch as there were no covenants in his deed to transfer the title by way of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The general principle unquestionably is, that a Government patent, when issued, relates back to the original entry, and perfects and makes valid any attempted transfer by the patentee intermediate the entry and the patent. This principle is not disputed, but it is denied that it can apply to a case where the patent issues not to the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>purchaser, but to his assignee. The reasons which should preclude the application of the doctrine of relation to the case did not strike us with force on the argument, nor have we been able on reflection to satisfy ourselves that they rest on any substantial basis. <em>We </em>have never heard it suggested before that a sheriff\u2019s deed, or any other conveyance made to complete a judicial sale, would not if made to an assignee, relate back to the time of the sale, so far as necessary to protect intervening rights and equities. The same reasons, for the applicability of the doctrine, exist in this case as in any other, and no reason, either substantial or technical, appears to us to preclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Assuming that we are*correct in this, we understand by the record that Hall showed a complete chain of title from the Government to himself, and was <em>prima facie </em>entitled to recover unless the defendant established some affirmative defense. A tax deed was put in evidence in the case, but we have not been required to examine it, since it was conceeded not to be supportable, unless under section 164 of the tax law of 1869. The tax sale was made in 1859. The question was presented on the argument whether the section in question related back to, and made good, illegal sales previously made. It is sufficient for us to say on that point, that we do not discover in that section the least evidence that such was the intention of the Legislature. The tax law of 1869 was passed to regulate the assessment, collection and return of taxes for the future, and the title as well as the body of the act aptly indicates that purpose. The further questions presented in this connection on the argument will not, therefore, require attention in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The only other question which the record presents, regards an alleged possession of the premises by one George Y. Clark who was not made a party defendant. The premises do not appear to have been occupied, unless by this George <em>V. </em>Clark, and James <em>W. </em>Clark was sued under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the statute as claiming title only. The Statute provides, <em>Comp. Laws </em>\u00a7 <em>4,557:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 4. If the premises for which the action is brought, are actually occupied by any person, such actual occupant shall be named a defendant in the declaration; if they are not so occupied, the action must be brought against some person exercising acts of ownership on the premises claimed, or claiming title thereto, or some interest therein at the commencement of the suit; and all persons claiming any title to the premises adverse to that claimed by the plaintiff, may in all cases be made defendants in such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The defendant on the trial gave evidence tending to prove that George Y. Clark was in the actual occupation of a small part of the premises, enclosed by a brush fence, and cultivated the same as a garden at the time of the commencement of the suit, and that he claimed to be in possession of the whole thereof under a permission of the defendant that he might go on and work the same, and that he occasionally cut wood and trees on other portions of the premises, he at the same time residing on a farm adjoining.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Upon this evidence the Circuit Judge instructed the jury that if -they should find that any portion of the premises, which might be distinctly defined, was in the actual possession of any other person than the defendant at the time the suit was commenced, the plaintiff might neverthelessj recover all the premises except such portion. He further charged in the following language : \u201c I do charge you, gentlemen, that if you find in this case that some other party than the one made defendant was in possession of the garden spot, and that garden spot can be defined and described, as it has been described by witnesses in this case, and he was not in like possession of the other part, then you can find for the other part, and for the defendant as far as the garden spot is concerned; but if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>shall find he was in possession of the whole, then of course they cannot recover in this suit, if you shall find that he actually occupied the whole.\u201d This charge was objected to by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The defendant requested the Court to charge the jury that if the premises in question were actually occupied by George Y. Clark at the time the suit was brought, the plaintiff could not recover. This charge was given, with such modification only as the addition of the word \u201call\u201d before \u201cthe premises\u201d would make; and a further request to charge that if George Y. Clark was actually cultivating a portion of the premises, and claimed to be in possession of the whole, then there being no adverse or other possession, and he occasionally cutting wood thereon, that that was an occupation within the provisions of the statute\u2014 was refused; the Court telling the jury that the question was whether he was in actual possession and not whether he claimed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The jury appear to have found that George Y. Clark was not, in fact,- in the actual possession of any portion of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant (below) finds fault with the charge respecting possession, that it was calculated to mislead the jury, and to bring them to the conviction that to make the actual occupation required by our statute there must be an actual enclosure of the whole premises, or the cultivation thereof \u2014 -in other words, the <em>like </em>occupation which Clark claimed to have of the garden spot. We do not discover this tendency in the charge, and we think to draw any such inference from it requires a more narrow and critical construction than any jury were likely to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Besides, there was no evidence in the case which, independent of the small spot said to be cultivated as a garden, and which was only a very small fraction of the whole, tended in the least to show an actual occupation of the premises by George Y. Clark. That person might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>perhaps have been made a party defendant under the liberal provisions of our <em>statute; </em>but the mere fact that he claimed to be in possession of the whole, and occasionally cut trees and wood thereon, while living upon other lands\u2014 which, except as to the garden spot was the whole extent of what he claimed, his evidence tended to show, \u2014 did not establish actual occupancy, or authorize the jury to find it. However significant those facts might have been in connection with an actual possession of a part of the land under a claim of title to the whole, if the jury had found such actual possession' to exist, they are, when standing alone, mere isolated acts of trespass, and nothing more. As the case is presented by this record, the charge of the Circuit Judge, even if not strictly accurate, could not possibly have prejudiced the defendant. But we are not by any means certain that he gave the jury a rule regarding actual occupancy which was any different from that which the statute warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We think there is no error in the record, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
