A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AT1\">Defendants, Ealph Carbone and Loretta Eranze, appeal from a judgment of conviction in the Essex County Court, Law Division, of the crime of conspiracy to violate the bookmaking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">In substance, the indictment charged that Mrs. Eranze agreed to rent her apartment located at 106 North Grove Street, East Orange, New Jersey, through Ealph Carbone, for the use of one John J. Kammerer, in furtherance of a scheme for the purpose of making book on horse races.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">In the interest of a thorough understanding of the facts of the case, a chronology of events is presented, in which particular attention must be paid to the characters whose names change with the scenes in this drama of life in the underworld. One day, in the later part of June, 1950, in New York City, John J. Kammerer was introduced to a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>known only as \u201cMurray\u201d by one Moe Kalik, a man known to have been associated in the bookmaking business in New York. Kalik advised Kammerer to \u201cGo with Murray to Jersey and he will get a phone for you.\u201d It was understood between the parties to the conversation that their purpose was to go to New Jersey to record bets on horse racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Kammerer accompanied \u201cMurray\u201d to a drug store in the vicinity of the trolley car barns on Main Street at or about the boundary between Newark and East Orange. While Kammerer waited outside, \u201cMurray\u201d entered the drug store and soon returned with a man introduced as \u201cRalph,\u201d alleged to have been Ralph Carbone, a defendant herein. After an exchange of pleasantries, \u201cRalph\u201d asked Kammerer if he wanted to start that same day and received an affirmative reply with the explanation that he needed \u201conly a scratch sheet, a- pencil and some scratch paper.\u201d \u201cRalph\u201d informed Kammerer that payments for the use of the phone were to be made to \u201cMurray\u201d and that the amount would be $150 for the first week and thereafter $300 on the first and fifteenth' day of each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u201cMurray\u201d departed and \u201cRalph\u201d drove Kammerer to an automobile service station where he made a telephone call. He returned and handed him a slip of paper and advised Kammerer that his number was written thereon. That number was the telephone number of Loretta Eranze\u2019s apartment, at 106 North Grove Street, East Orange, New Jersey. Kammerer called Kalik\u2019s residence in New York and left this \u201cbusiness number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u201cRalph\u201d supplied Kammerer with the requisite tools of his trade, \u201ca scratch sheet, pencil and some scrap paper,\u201d and drove him to Mrs. Eranze\u2019s apartment. Kammerer was instructed to remain in the car a few minutes and then follow him into the building. In the vestibule, \u201cRalph\u201d supplied him with two keys, one to the main entrance and the other for the entrance to the Eranze apartment on the sixth floor of the building. They proceeded to Mrs. Eranze\u2019s apartment where Kammerer was introduced as \u201cJack\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Mrs. Eranze as \u201cLaura.\u201d \u201cBalph\u201d explained the apartment layout to Kammerer and designated the table, telephone and radio to bo used. Mrs. Franze was advised to give her telephone bill to \u201cJack\u201d and he would pay it. \u201cBalph\u201d left the apartment and was not seen again until he was identified at the trial by Kammerer to be the defendant, Balph Carbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Thereafter, Kammerer occupied the apartment daily, except Sunday, between the hours of 11:30 A. M. and 5 :30 p. m. He testified that he operated by receiving bets over the telephone from Kalik\u2019s customers; that a customer list was furnished him by Kalik before he left New York in the morning and that each evening on his return to New York he returned the list with bets recorded thereon to a man known as \u201cCharlie,\u201d and that \u201cCharlie\u201d supplied him with the money to pay Mrs. Franze\u2019s telephone bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The State\u2019s case was in a large measure based on the testimony of John J. Kammerer. The persons who allegedly engaged in the conspiracy to use Mrs. Franze\u2019s apartment for bookmaking purposes were John Doe, representing \u201cMurray,\u201d who allegedly introduced Kammerer to \u201cBalph,\u201d Murray\u2019s true identity being unknown; Balph Carbone who allegedly portrayed \u201cBalph\u201d and introduced Kammerer to Mrs. Franze and who arranged for the payments for the use of tlie apartment, furnished Kammerer with the keys to the apartment and who received payment from Kammerer for the apartment, and Mrs. Loretta Franze, who permitted her apartment to be used for bookmaking purposes, and John Kammerer. Kammerer identified defendant, Balph Carbone, as the man to whom \u201cMurray\u201d had introduced him and who made the arrangements for his use of the apartment and paid Mrs. Franze the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Kammerer testified that on a number of occasions Mrs. Franze was present in the rather small apartment while he was operating his business; that he had on several occasions explained to her the kinds of bets and interesting betting incidents; that it was his practice to repeat the bet for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>verification by the bettor after it was received; that he paid Mrs. Eranze twice for the telephone bill and paid \u201cMurray\u201d the rentals agreed upon on their first meeting and on July 1 and 15; and that he was forced to discontinue operations from the apartment in the latter part of July, 1950, because Kalik\u2019s establishment in Hew York had been raided by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Mrs. Eranze testified that early in June, 1950, she met a man known to her as \u201cMurray Walsh\u201d while she was in a tavern near her apartment. She stated that they met on several occasions and as' not infrequently happens, they engaged in conversation, in the course of which he told her that he was in the photograph business, that he wished to put a man named Schulberg in her apartment in the afternoons for the purpose of soliciting appointments for photographs over the telephone. She told \u201cWalsh\u201d that if the man was satisfactory she would rent the apartment to him. The rent was to be $25 per week. \u201cWalsh\u201d allegedly brought the man, who later turned out to be John Kammerer, and introduced him as Jack Schulberg. \u201cWalsh\u201d paid her $100 rent in advance and left.- Mrs. Eranze admitted that she heard Kammerer use the terms \u201cwin,\u201d \u201cplace\u201d and \u201cshow,\u201d but assumed that he was placing a personal bet. Mrs. Eranze testified that Ralph Carbone was not the man who introduced Kammerer to her and that she had never seen him before the trial. Defendant, Ralph Carbone, did not testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Mrs. Eranze was interviewed by a county detective in July, 1950, and advised that he was investigating a complaint that her telephone had been used for bookmaking. She failed to tell the police the true nature of the business carried on in her apartment and, at the trial of this matter, explained her attitude by stating she saw no need to tell the police her personal affairs. She vacated her apartment about Hovember 1, 1950, and went to Elorida, where she remained for some time, returning to Keansburg, New Jersey, on December 1, 1950, to reside in Gallagher\u2019s Hotel, under an assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>name. On the night of her arrest, Mrs. Eranze was seen by police as she emerged from her hotel to enter a waiting car. As police approached, the car darted off with considerable speed and altor a chase, punctuated by gunfire, the police succeeded in taking Mrs. Eranze into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> The first ground of appeal urged by the defendants is that the court erred in refusing to grant their several motions for a verdict of acquittal, arguing that the proofs indicate, at best, a conspiracy to set up Kalik, Kammerer and others in the bookmaking business or to aid and abet them in the same and that the defendants were merely tools of the actual conspirators in executing their illicit scheme, whereas the indictment charges a conspiracy to violate the criminal laws of New Jersey, \u201cpertaining to the making and taking of what is commonly known as a hook upon the running, pacing or trotting of horses, mares, or geldings.\u201d The test generally recognized vvhen a motion for directed acquittal is made, is whether there is any evidence from winch an inference of guilt may be drawn. <em>State v. Fox, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). A judgment of acquittal should be denied where there is evidence of guilt which, if believed by the jury, would justify a guilty verdict. <em>State v. Sgro, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>528 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932); <em>State v. Cammarata, 1</em>2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>115 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>State v. De Falco, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>295 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case and entire case we find that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury might properly infer, as it evidently did, that the defendants engaged in an unlawful combination to violate the bookmaking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> The defendants contend further that the trial court erred in permitting the witness, Kammerer, to testify, over objection, as to conversations and his operations in fulfillment of tho conspiracy which occurred in the absence of the defendants, since he was not named as a co-conspirator with the, defendants in the indictment and, therefore, these acts were not binding upon them and his testimony concerning same was prejudicial error. Our consideration of this ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tion leads us to an opposite conclusion. Although Hammerer was a party to the overt acts involved in the conspiracy, and it was so stated in the indictment, the mere fact that he was not named as a party-defendant does not render his testimony concerning the operations in furtherance and consummation of the conspiracy inadmissible against the co-conspirators named as defendants. As stated in 15 <em>C. J. S., Conspiracy, sec. </em>82, <em>p. </em>1115:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201cIt is not necessary to join all alleged co-conspirators in an indictment for conspiracy, nor to explain why those omitted were not indicted; and it need not be alleged that all conspirators joined in the confederation at the same time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">See also <em>State v. Garrison, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>350 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>State v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 136 <em>N. J. L. </em>118, 123 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); <em>Iponmatsu v. U. S., 281 Fed. 525 </em>(1922), <em>cert. </em>denied, 260 <em>U. S. 729 </em>(1922). The portion of Hammerer\u2019s testimony objected to by the defendants concerned his own acts in furthering the conspiracy to violate the bookmaking statute at the home of the defendant, Loretta Pranze. We think this testimony was clearly admissible. It has been held by our courts that where it appears that two or more persons conspired to commit an offense, everything done, said or written by one of them during the existence of the conspiracy and in the execution or furtherance of that common purpose, is admissible in evidence against the others. <em>State v. Seidman, </em>107 <em>N. J. L. </em>204 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931), affirmed 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>550 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1931); <em>State v. </em>Guida, 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>289 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>464 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938); and, as stated by Chief Justice Gummere, speaking for the Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Lieberman, </em>80 <em>N. J. L. </em>506, 509 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1911), affirmed 82 <em>N. J. L. </em>748 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1912): \u201cThe jury have the right to convict on testimony of an accomplice if, in their judgment, the testimony is entirely credible and worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. </em>Fearce, 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>155, 159 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934); <em>State v. Gaddis, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>44 <em>(Slip. Ct. </em>1943); <em>State v. </em>Hogan, 13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>117 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935). As stated in <em>State v. Gregory, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>205, 210 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1919), citing <em>Stewart v. Johnson, </em>18 <em>N. J. L. </em>87 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1840) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cOne who participates in the corrupt agreement with knowledge that it is corrupt, and that what he is doing is in furtherance of that agreement, would be as guilty as if he had, originally conspired,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Cf. State v. Klausner, </em>4 <em>N. J. Super. </em>427, 429 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), certification denied 3 <em>N. J. </em>378 (1949). And in <em>State v. Garrison, supra, </em>it was held that: \u201cA conspiracy-may be proved by overt acts done in pursuance thereof.\u201d \u201cIt is not requisite that the conspirators know each other, or that they should all join in the common purpose at the same time. <em>People v. Strauch, </em>240 <em>Ill. </em>60, 88 <em>N. E. </em>155 (1909); <em>Burdicks Law of Crime, See. </em>999.\u201d <em>State v. Lennon, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>337, 343 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The defendants further contend that the trial court\u2019s answer by means of a hypothetical example to a question propounded by the jury during its deliberations concerning the required proof of conspiracy constituted error and prejudicial to the defendant, Loretta Pranze. The following is the specific colloquy between the court and the jury, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201cIs a person a conspirator if he or she rents his or her apartment to his or her knowledge for a legitimate business and then later finds out by chance that the business is illegal and then does nothing about 'it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In answer thereto, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201cOn the basis of those exact words, the answer is no. On the other hand, in order to clarify the thing in your mind, if in addition to that doing nothing about it, under those circumstances, she paid rent 1o one of the parties, and said to them for instance at the time, \u2018I understand now what you are doing. Go ahead, I am with you,\u2019 in other words, indicating that she became a party to the enterprise with them, or words to that effect, then <em>vice versa.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">It is the agreement, the understanding, by the individual that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>was or she was not a part of the enterprise, which would make her guilty or not of the conspiracy, under the circumstances alluded to by you, as I have endeavored to amplify them. Does that make it clear, Mr. Foreman?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">.Incidentally, it cannot be seriously challenged that when the court stated \u201cshe'paid rent to one of the parties,\u201d it intended to say \u201cshe received rent from one of the parties.\u201d Ho reversible error can be charged to what appears to be merely a slip of the tongue. Defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question was tantamount to acts of advocacy in favor of the prosecution to the prejudice of the defendants and contained a factual statement not supported by the evidence. The settled rule in New Jersey permits the trial judge to comment upon the evidence and, in cases where he thinks it is required for the promotion of justice, to express his views upon the weight of it, provided he leaves to the jury the sole determination of the factual issues. <em>State v. </em>Hauptmann, 115 <em>N. J. L. </em>412 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935); <em>State v. </em>Pinsky, 6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>90 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). An examination of the trial judge\u2019s charge reveals that he had already stated to the jury that in order to convict it would have to determine: (a) that a conspiracy did exist; (b) that the defendants were parties to it, and (c) what overt act or acts were committed pursuant to the conspiracy for which any of the defendants were responsible by reason of their own acts or the acts of another conspirator to effect the common purpose. In addition, the court, in clear and decisive language instructed the jury that \u201cthe facts are solely and entirely yours. Hobody else in the world but you has the right to say specifically what the facts in this case are and that is rather important, isn\u2019t it, because certain parts of the evidence are contradictory. Therefore, the importance of your function is obvious and crucial,\u201d and then proceeded to elaborate somewhat in detail as to the function of the jury in its consideration and determination of the factual issues. While the trial court may have indicated in some instances his individual view, we fail to find in any instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that his view was so placed before the jury as to require them to consider themselves controlled by it. On the contrary, the court was careful to reserve to them the ultimate decision on matters of fact. As stated by Mr. Justice Wachenfeld, in <em>State v. Tansimore, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>516 (1950), at <em>p. </em>525:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cin determining whether or not error was committed, a single sentence may not be extracted and construed without regard to the context of the entire charge. <em>State v. Banusik, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>640 (E. &amp; <em>A. </em>1906). The court cannot state the. law of the case in a single sentence and the charge must be read as a whole in the light of a sensible construction to determine its legal worth. <em>State v. Tachin, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>269 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1919) ; <em>affirmed, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>485 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1919).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendants contend further that the trial court erred in that portion of the charge wherein it commented upon the failure of Carbone to testify in his own behalf. The defendant points out that prior to the criticised portion of the charge, the jury was instructed: \u201cAnd here I don\u2019t think the State contends that we have any direct evidence of entry into a formal agreement by the parties,\u201d and asserts that the court proceeded to charge as to circumstantial evidence, arguing that this clearly showed that the court did not feel there was any direct proof of the crime charged in the indictment. In commenting upon the effect of the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the court charged that if \u201c* * * I make a charge against you and you fail to deny it, as I say, not only a general charge but that you did fact <em>\u2018A\u2019 </em>personally, you did fact \u2018B\u2019 personally, you did fact \u2018C\u2019 personally, and then, given the opportunity, you say not a word, but just take it, you know by common sense, and common law, that there is a presumption that you cannot truthfully deny the charges.\u201d The defendants rely upon the case of <em>State v. Friedman, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>527 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948), in support of this contention. The <em>Friedman </em>case, however, is not applicable. In that case, it was held that: <em>\u201c* </em>* * there is a distinction between that situation, and one when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>evidence is merely circumstantial from which the jury may draw an inference of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the charge. The defendant could only meet such a possible inference by a general denial of the charge. This he does not have to do and therefore he cannot be criticised for such refusal.\u201d In the case <em>sub </em>judice, there was testimony of specific acts charged to the defendant Carbone, inculpatory in character, which the defendant could have denied if he had so desired. However, he chose not to take the stand as was his privilege; therefore, the court properly commented upon his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We have examined the other grounds of appeal and find no merit therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The judgment of the Essex County Court, Law Division, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
