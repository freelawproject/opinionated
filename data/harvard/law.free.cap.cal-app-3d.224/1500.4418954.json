Clemmons appeals from judgment after a jury convicted him of multiple crimes. He raises numerous issues, including whether the court erred in limiting the exercise of cross-examination of each witness to only one of the defendant\u2019s two attorneys. The published portion of our opinion contains discussion of this issue. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>find this claim of defendant, as well as his remaining contentions discussed in the unpublished portion of our opinion, to be unavailing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">On November 19, 1987, a five-count information was filed against defendant in superior court case No. 35000. He was charged with burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459; count I), rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (2); count II) and attempted oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/28 8a; count III) arising out of an incident at the home of Vickie B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, defendant allegedly used a deadly weapon, a knife, in the perpetration of counts II and III (\u00a7 12022.3). A second burglary (\u00a7 459; count IV) and an assault with intent to commit rape (\u00a7 220; count V) arose out of an incident at the home of Tammi T. Private counsel, William McPhillips, was retained to represent defendant in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">On January 29, 1988, a seven-count information was filed against defendant in superior court case No. 35439 involving five separate alleged victims: Denise W., Kathy S., Diane J., Betty L., and Patricia P. This information contained five counts of attempted burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 664/459) and two counts of burglary (\u00a7 459). The public defender was appointed to represent defendant. Prior to trial, court-appointed counsel, George Quick, replaced the public defender in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The informations were consolidated for trial. Defendant continued to be represented by separate counsel for each information. Defendant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to prison for a total aggregate term of 23 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">A detailed statement of facts is not necessary to our discussion contained in the published portion of our opinion. In brief, each of the convictions involved the same modus operand!: defendant gained entry or attempted to gain entry into the victim\u2019s residence by claiming that his Frisbee or beach-ball had gone into the victim\u2019s yard or that he was trying to locate a person in the neighborhood. The unpublished portion of our opinion contains the particular factual details relative to the issues discussed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">I.-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>IV. <em>Did the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination deprive defendant of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">As previously set forth, defendant was represented by two attorneys in this consolidated action. William McPhillips was retained to represent him in action No. 35000. George Quick was appointed to represent him in action No. 35439. After several witnesses had testified and been cross-examined by the defense attorney associated with the count to which the witness was testifying, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-7\">\u201cThe Court: We are back in session in People versus Clemmons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-8\">\u201cMr. Clemmons and all of the attorneys are present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-9\">\u201cWe are in session outside the presence of the jury at the request of Mr. McPhillips [defense counsel, No. 35000].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-10\">\u201cI understand that there is some indication that Mr. McPhillips or Mr. Quick [defense counsel, No. 35439] may be involved in the cross-examination or presentation of witnesses in the other\u2019s case; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-11\">\u201cMr. McPhillips: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-12\">\u201cThe Court: Before we do that, I want it clearly understood the ground rules under which we are operating, and I need to have Mr. Clemmons be aware of that and also to expressly associate each of the defense counsel in the other\u2019s\u2014in the case in which he is principally represented by the other defense counsel so that there is not any misunderstanding in that respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-13\">\u201cGround rules, first of all, is that only one of the defense attorneys will be permitted to cross-examine a particular prosecution witness. Likewise, only one of the defense attorneys will be permitted to put on for direct and redirect examination a defense witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-14\">\u201cIn that respect, in the event, for example, Mr. McPhillips wishes to cross-examine a witness involved in Case No. 35439 in which Mr. Quick is the attorney of record for Mr. Clemmons, he will have\u2014first have to be associated as counsel of record in that case and, likewise, to the contrary in the other case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-15\">\u201cDo you understand that, Mr. Clemmons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Are you willing to associate Mr. Quick in Case No. 35000 in which you are represented by Mr. McPhillips and to associate Mr. McPhillips in Case No. 35439 in which you are represented by Mr. Quick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-4\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-6\">\u201c[T]hen do we still understand each other, gentlemen, counsel, as far as what the rules are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-7\">\u201cMr. Quick: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-8\">\u201cMr. McPhillips: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-9\">\u201cMr. Wilson [District Attorney]: Does this mean now that this is being done for the purpose of questioning one particular witness and if so, which witness? Or is now\u2014are there now going to be questions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-10\">\u201cMr. McPhillips: As I understand it, that\u2019s up to our discretion now, however, there is to be no double teaming. One attorney per witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-11\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-12\">\u201cAs far as objections during the course of testimony are concerned, that either side\u2014or either attorney may interpose objections since there is a certain amount of interrelationship between the two cases, and they are, of course, consolidated for trial. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-13\">\u201cWith that understanding, are we ready to bring in our jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-14\">\u201cAnything else you want to put on the record before the jury arrives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-15\">\u201cMr. McPhillips: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-16\">\u201cThe Court: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-17\">Defendant contends that the above ruling denied him his right to the effective assistance of counsel and representation by retained counsel of his choice. Defendant argues that effective cross-examination by each lawyer was a \u201ccore function\u201d within each particular case and he was deprived of that. He asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling unreasonably interfered with his right to representation, both retained and appointed. He avers that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>acquiescence did not serve as an effective waiver of his constitutional right to counsel of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">What occurred here was not an interference with the right to counsel, retained or appointed, but was a restriction on defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the witnesses. This was not a situation where defendant\u2019s fundamental right to representation was abrogated. Nor was the court required to advise defendant of the pitfalls of his choice such as where a defendant chooses to proceed in propria persona, with joint counsel representing more than one defendant, or with counsel who has a conflict of interest. Although he was not afforded dual cross-examination of witnesses, defendant was otherwise afforded the benefit of two skilled attorneys dedicated solely to his cause throughout his trial, a benefit normally reserved for defendants facing a possible death penalty.  \u201c[T]he right [to counsel] is not infringed when \u2018the opportunity [of the defense] to participate fully and fairly in the adversary factfinding process\u2019 [citation] is not significantly limited.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 659, 695 [250 Cal.Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217], third set of brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The right of cross-examination as a primary interest secured by the constitutional right to confrontation is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a criminal defendant has a fundamental right to confront the witnesses against him. (U.S. Const., 6th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; Pen. Code, \u00a7 686.) It is equally well settled that the right of cross-examination is the primary interest secured by the confrontation guarantee and an essential safeguard of a fair trial. [Citations.] Of course, an adequate opportunity for cross-examination in an earlier proceeding may satisfy the confrontation clause even in the absence of physical confrontation at the time of trial.... [T]he United States Supreme Court recognized that \u2018there has traditionally been an exception to the confrontation requirement where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at previous judicial proceedings against the same defendant which was subject to cross-examination by that defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brock </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 180, 188-189 [211 Cal.Rptr. 122, 695 P.2d 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">Here, neither defendant nor his attorneys objected to the procedure set forth by the trial court, and defendant gave his verbal acquiescence. Both of defendant\u2019s counsel were asked if they understood the procedure and whether they had anything additional to place on the record. There was absolutely no indication that either defense counsel disagreed or that defendant disagreed with the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">\u201c \u2018[The] trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on . . . cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>. . . based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive <em>or only marginally </em>relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dyer </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 48 [246 Cal.Rptr. 209, 753 P.2d 1], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Defendant reaped the benefit of having two attorneys present at trial representing his interests. The defense asserted by each counsel on defendant\u2019s behalf was identical. Nothing in the record suggests that either counsel had any conflict of interest in representing defendant in both cases. Each prosecution witness was cross-examined by one of the attorneys. There was no objection to the restrictions imposed by the trial court. Even if it can be said that error occurred, on appeal defendant has not shown how he might have been prejudiced by the procedure. Error in this area does not require reversal per se, but requires a determination if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dyer, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 26, 48.) The error, if any, in restricting cross-examination of the witnesses to only one attorney was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">V.-XIL<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">The judgment is affirmed. The trial court is ordered to correct the abstract of judgment in case No. 35439 to reflect that the five counts of attempted burglary are nonviolent offenses and it shall forward corrected copies to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">Stone (W.
