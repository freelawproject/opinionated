Buck, 340 U.S. 15, 18, 71 S.Ct. 93, 95 L.Ed. 15; that the appellants\u2019 successors in office became parties defendant to the action within six months after their terms of office began (Rule 25(d), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A.); that the action for damages against the appellants was adjudicated in their favor and that consequently there is no adverse judgment against them by which they are aggrieved or which gives them any interest in the order from which they attempt to appeal.
