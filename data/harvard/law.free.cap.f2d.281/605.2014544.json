One month later, on May 18, 1959, the case came on for trial, appellant being represented by retained counsel. After the completion of the voir dire examination, appellant\u2019s attorney approached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>bench and informed the presiding judge that the defense desired to waive jury-trial. There being no objection by the prosecution, the presiding judge informed the jury, in open court and in the presence of appellant, of the decision of the defense to have trial by the court, and thereupon dismissed the panel. The case was heard forthwith without a jury. At the conclusion of the trial, appellant was found guilty and judgment was entered. On May 27, 1959, appellant\u2019s trial counsel withdrew his appearance in the case, and present counsel entered his appearance and immediately moved for a new trial and for arrest of judgment. The motion was denied on the same date, and appeal was thereafter taken to the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction for simple assault but remanded the case for re-sentencing, on the ground that the trial judge imposed sentence without first giving appellant \u201can opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment,\u201d as required by Criminal Rule 20 (a) of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">At the argument of the appeal to this court, appellant stressed two grounds for reversal, namely, (1) that he was improperly deprived of a fair trial by jury, without legal and intelligent waiver of the same, and (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial as guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">I. Was Accused Improperly Deprived of a Fair Trial by Jury without Legal and Intelligent Waiver of Same?</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In essence, the basis for this contention is that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of trial by jury at the bench conference violated both appellant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury and his rights under \u00a7 11-616, D.C.Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No decision in this jurisdiction has required that the accused <em>personally </em>announce such waiver. In general, the relation of attorney and client is one of agency and the general rules of law applicable to agencies apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, the accused ordinarily speaks and acts through his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">A case directly in point is that of Commonwealth v. Dailey &amp; another, 12 Cush. Mass. 80. That too was an assault case and, after the trial commenced and evidence was given to the jury, one of the jurors sworn was withdrawn at his request, by consent of defendants\u2019 counsel, of the District Attorney and of the court, on account of the dangerous sickness of his father. A verdict was returned by the remaining eleven jurors. The defendants were present in court at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>time but said nothing. Nor did their counsel consult with them but, after verdict, he filed a motion in arrest of judgment, which the presiding judge overruled. On appeal, the verdict was affirmed in an opinion by Chief Justice Shaw. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cA prisoner who defends by counsel, and silently acquiesces in what they agree to, is bound in the same manner as any other principal by the act of his agent.\u201d 12 Cushing at page 83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">It is obvious that the word \u201caccused,\u201d or its synonym \u201cdefendant,\u201d is often used to apply to a defendant <em>or </em>his counsel. Thus, while throughout the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the word \u201cdefendant\u201d is generally used, it is quite apparent that in most instances, when the accused has counsel, the latter rather than the former is the proper person to take the action required thereunder. So it is with certain provisions of the District of Columbia Code, Title 23, Criminal Procedure, e.g. \u00a7 107, number of challenges available to defendant, \u00a7 111, defendant may apply in writing for depositions, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In the instant case, the facts warrant a finding that, if appellant did not initiate the waiver of trial by jury, he did, by his conduct at least, ratify the waiver immediately upon its being made, and thus made the waiver his personal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Immediately upon being informed of the decision to waive trial by jury, the trial judge, in open court, informed the jury of this fact. Appellant raised no objection. Defense counsel then stated to appellant, according to appellant\u2019s own affidavit: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a jury. You have nothing to worry about, this case will be over in a few minutes.\u201d Again appellant raised no objection to the waiver. At this juncture, after public announcement of the waiver in open court and the statements by defense counsel, sufficient time had elapsed to negate any surprise on the part of appellant. Thus he was duty bound at that time to make known to the court his repudiation of the waiver, if that was his intention. Significantly, his affidavit in arrest of judgment nowhere indicates that he protested his attorney\u2019s action, either to his attorney or to the court. He was apparently content to take his chances, and he cannot now be heard to complain after receiving an unfavorable finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">In the case of United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, 3 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 407, defendant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus alleged among other things that he was not permitted by his counsel to testify in his own defense, that his counsel did not produce any witnesses as to his background, personal history, mental condition, prior good behavior, character or reputation, although such evidence was available and would have assisted him, that his counsel failed to have him examined by a psychiatrist, whose testimony, if such an examination had been made, would also have been helpful to him, and that the failure of his counsel in these respects denied him a fair and impartial trial, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In its opinion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">\u201c[T]he acts of counsel [become] those of his client and as such [are] so recognized and accepted by the court unless the defendant repudiates them by making known to the court at the time his objection to or lack of concurrence in them.\u201d 203 F.2d at page 426.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">Finally, an examination of the record as a whole, coupled with the fact that appellant was not unfamiliar with criminal procedure and had had the experience of two prior jury trials,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> leads one to the necessary conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>waiver here in question was intelligently <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and intentionally made by appellant. Cf. Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 362, 77 S.Ct. 481, 1 L.Ed.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Summarizing, it seems to us that the dismissal of the jury in the presence of appellant fully complied with the rule as to waiver of jury trial. Since counsel was acting for him and he was present when the judge dismissed the jury, and since appellant made no objection, we construe his lack of action at that time to be an express waiver in accordance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">II. Was Appellant Denied Effective Assistance of Counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The principal basis for this contention is the premise that counsel failed to consult with appellant regarding the waiver and, as well, failed to call appellant\u2019s wife as a witness. In this connection, the Municipal Court of Appeals aptly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cWe have studied the record in the light of these allegations and contentions. In the management and conduct of the defense counsel was confronted with situations requiring judgment, thought and tactical decisions. Even with the wisdom of hindsight it cannot be said with assurance whether the decisions and strategy of counsel were wise or unwise. But they were not such as to justify a ruling by us that defendant did not have effective assistance of counsel and is entitled to have a second trial of his case [Citing cases.]\u201d 155 A.2d at page 79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, supra, when faced with a similar contention, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">\u201cA defendant cannot seemingly acquiesce in his counsel\u2019s defense of him or his lack of it and, after the trial has resulted adversely, have the judgment set aside because of the alleged incompetence, negligence or lack of skill of that counsel.\u201d 203 F.2d at page 426.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Appropos also is United States ex rel. Weber v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 579, where the following language appears :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">\u201cAs to the requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment, the services of counsel meet the requirements of the due process clause when he is a member in good standing at the bar, gives his client his complete loyalty, serves him in good faith to the best of his ability, and his service is of such character as to preserve the essential integrity of the proceedings as a trial in a court of justice. He is not required to be infallible. We know that some good lawyer gets beat in every law suit. He made some mistakes. The printed opinions that line the walls in our offices bear mute testimony to that fact. His client is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d 176 F.2d at page 586.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">The judgment of the Municipal Court of Appeals will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-22\">. Hensley v. United States, D.C.Mun.App. 1959, 155 A.2d 77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\">. This rule is identical to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a), 18 U.S.C. The ruling of the Municipal Court of Appeals is in accordance with the rulings of this court in Couch v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 235 F.2d 519, 521, and in Gadsden v. United States, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 223 F.2d 627. In Couch we held that under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a) it was established as essential that a sentencing judge give a convicted defendant an opportunity to make a personal statement in his own behalf even if counsel had spoken for him. We pointed out that there is always \u201cthe possibility that the accused may be able to supply information on his own account.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-13\">.

Zerbst, 1938, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-16\">EDGERTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ARzQ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">The statute quoted in the court\u2019s third footnote provides that in prosecutions in which the Constitution entitles the accused to a jury trial, \u201cthe trial shall be by jury, unless the accused shall in open court expressly waive such trial by jury and request to be tried by the judge * * The opinion of the court says: \u201cSince counsel was acting for him and he was present when the judge dismissed the jury, and since appellant made no objection, we construe his lack of action at that time to be an express waiver in accordance with the statute.\u201d This seems to me erroneous in fact and in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">I think it an error of fact to infer from appellant\u2019s lack of action that he was willing to be tried by a judge. I see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>sufficient reason to think he knew he was at liberty to repudiate what his counsel had done; or that he knew he was at liberty to speak up in open court without being invited to speak. For all we know, he may even have thought he would be punished for contempt if he spoke up. And the question whether he was at liberty to repudiate his counsel\u2019s action, or to volunteer a statement of his own wishes, may not even have occurred to him. Accordingly I see no evidence that he consciously and intelligently intended to waive trial by jury. Waiver involves \u201cvoluntary knowing relinquishment of a right.\u201d Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 191, 78 S.Ct. 221, 226, 2 L.E.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">I think it an error of law to hold that if he so intended, he showed it in the way the statute requires. I think \u201cthe accused\u201d did not, as the statute requires, \u201cin open court expressly waive such trial by jury and request to be tried by the judge.\u201d Within constitutional and statutory limits, the accused is bound by his counsel\u2019s acts. But it does not follow that the statutory term \u201cexpressly\u201d includes \u201cimpliedly\u201d, and it does not follow that the statutory term \u201cthe accused\u201d includes someone else. Nor do I think a statement not heard, and not meant to be heard, throughout the room is made \u201cin open court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201cBefore imposing sentence the court shall afford the' defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d In Gadsden v. United States, we held that \u201cthis provision imposes upon the sentencing court the affirmative duty to ask the accused whether he desires to make a statement.\u201d 96 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 167, 223 F.2d 627, 632. The context makes it clear that we interpreted the statutory term \u201cthe defendant\u201d to mean the defendant himself, not the defendant or his counsel. I see no good reason for giving a broader interpretation to the statutory term \u201cthe accused\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We are dealing in the present case with the fundamental constitutional right of trial by jury. \u201cIt has been pointed out that \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights and that we \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 \u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
