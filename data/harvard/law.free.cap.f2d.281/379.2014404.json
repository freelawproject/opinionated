Admittedly the Central has not obtained a certificate for the service under \u00a7 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(18); it says none is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The island location of large parts of the New York metropolitan district and the mainland termination of the rail lines of many of the carriers serving it have long posed special problems to freight service in this area. Constructive and Off-Track Railroad Freight Stations, 156 I.C.C. 205 (1929), gives the history not only for Manhattan but for the entire New York terminal district. See also United States v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R., 1913, 231 U.S. 274, 34 S.Ct. 75, 58 L.Ed. 218, dealing, interestingly enough, with Jay Street. For decades the Central, whose rail lines terminate in the Bronx, Manhattan, and New Jersey, has conducted freight service to and from Brooklyn by a variety of land and water-borne vehicles. It has done this by serving a station (Wallabout Station) which was its own until 1934 and then a union station until 1941, by joint rates and routes with plaintiff Long Island, and by arrangements with the plaintiff Brooklyn terminal lines, as well as with Jay Street Connecting Railroad now abandoned, Jay Street Connecting Railroad, Abandonment of Entire Line, 307 I.C.C. 137, affirmed D.C.E.D.N.Y.1959, 174 F.Supp. 609. See also Meyers v. Jay St. Connecting R. R., 2 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The service here proposed by the Central was designed at least in part, to enable it to reach the same part of Brooklyn formerly served in cooperation with the Jay St. Connecting Railroad. The service is between a warehouse, known as the Phoenix Warehouse, at the corner of John and Jay Streets, and the Central's rail-heads in Manhattan and New Jersey. Freight received from or delivered to consignors\u2019 or consignees\u2019 truckmen at the freight depot will be handled by truck between the depot and the railheads; tractor-trailers will be similarly accepted and delivered. The Central will pay for the haul between the depot and its team tracks; consignees or shippers will pay for transportation between the depot and their premises, plus a charge for loading or unloading at the team tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">The tariffs, originally filed to become effective June 21, 1959, were suspended by the Interstate Commerce Commission, I. &amp; S. Docket No. 7193, upon plaintiffs\u2019\" protest. In the proceedings before the Commission, plaintiffs attacked the Central\u2019s proposal on various grounds not here material, and plaintiff Long Island R. R. Co. raised the point here urged, namely, \u201cthat establishment of the proposed station would constitute an extension of a line of railroad within the meaning of section 1(18) of the act, and, consequently, is unlawful without prior ap-lieation and the issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity.\u201d On April 20, 1960, Division 2 filed a report finding \u201cthat the proposed schedules are not shown to be unlawful\u201d and entered an order discontinuing the investigation and suspension proceeding. The Division found the Long Island\u2019s claim with respect to the need of a certificate under \u00a7 1 (18) without merit, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201cIt is well settled that the establishment or maintenance of motor-truck service by a common-carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>railroad does not constitute an extension of a line of railroad within the meaning of section 1(18) for which a certificate of convenience and necessity is required. Drayage and Unloading at Jefferson City, Mo., 206 I.C.C. 436, 439.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Thereupon plaintiffs brought this action under \u00a7 1(20) in the Eastern District of New York to enjoin what they claimed to be an unlawful operation by the Central. Judge Bartels issued a temporary restraining order pending his determination of plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction. The Central cross-moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure of the complaint to state a claim on which relief may be granted. On June 28, 1960, in a well-reasoned opinion, the judge overruled the Central\u2019s contention that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325 plaintiffs were required to sue before a three-judge court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284, but denied a preliminary injunction on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to establish sufficient probability of success. He also denied the Central\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action; this is not before us. He continued the temporary restraining order for a brief period to permit plaintiffs to apply to this Court for an extension of it. Thereupon plaintiffs appealed from the denial of the preliminary injunction and sought an extension of the restraining order. Recognizing that the latter request raised substantially the same issues as the appeal itself and that the case was of public as well as private importance, the Court set the appeal for early argument and continued the temporary restraining order pending determination of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We deal first with the Central\u2019s contention that plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was before a court of three judges rather than a single judge. Section 1(20) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides in effect that any construction or operation in violation of the certificate requirements of paragraphs (18), (19) or (20) \u201cmay be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of * * * any party in interest.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325 requires a three-judge court when a plaintiff seeks \u201cAn interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution, in whole or in part, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission * * * \u201d Here plaintiffs seek to enjoin not an order of the Commission but action proposed to be taken by the Central without the order from the Commission which plaintiffs say is necessary for legality. A suit before a single district judge has long been the remedy in such a case, see e. g., Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. v. Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Ry., 1926, 270 U.S. 266, 46 S.Ct. 263, 70 L.Ed. 578; Piedmont &amp; Northern Ry. v. I. C. C., 1932, 286 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 541, 76 L.Ed. 1115. Although these cases did not discuss the point, Powell v. United States, 1937, 300 U.S. 276, 287-289, 57 S.Ct. 470, 477, 81 L.Ed. 643, does and is decisive. The Court there dismissed a counterclaim by the Central of Georgia seeking to enjoin a service by the receivers of the Seaboard Air Line for which no certificate had been obtained, in part, because the counterclaim was in a suit by the Seaboard triable before a court of three Judges; \u201cSuits under that paragraph [\u00a7 1(20)] may not be tried before three judges. Those under the Urgent Deficiencies Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 47) [now 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325] to set aside orders of the Commission cannot be tried in any other court.\u201d <em>Per contra,, </em>when the Commission has granted a certificate which an objecting party claims invalid, the exclusive remedy is before a three-judge court. Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, 1932, 285 U.S. 382, 52 S.Ct. 440, 76 L.Ed. 808. That the alleged need of a certificate was one of the arguments unsuccessfully advanced in the investigation of the Central\u2019s tariffs does not bring the case within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325. Assuming that plaintiffs might have brought suit to enjoin the Commission\u2019s order discontinuing the investigation and suspension proceeding, as apparently occurred in I. C. C. v. Inland Waterways Corp., 1943, 319 U.S. 671. 686-687, 63 S.Ct. 1296, 87 L.Ed. 1655, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>they have not done this, and Powell v. United States, supra, 300 U.S. at pages 288-289, 57 S.Ct. 470, 476, says they could not have raised the Central\u2019s need for a certificate under \u00a7 1(18) in such a suit if they had. We are not persuaded by the Central\u2019s attempt to distinguish Powell v. United States on the basis that there the Commission had found the Seaboard's tariff unlawful under \u00a7 6 as covering a station not on the Seaboard\u2019s line because of lack of valid contractual arrangements for use of the station rather than because of violation of \u00a7 1(18). 206 I.C.C. at 366-68 (1935). For the Supreme Court put the portion of its decision annulling the Commission\u2019s order on the basis that \u201cThe order, as construed and supported by appellees, is the practical equivalent\u201d of \u201ca decree of court in a suit under \u00a7 1(20) enjoining the Seaboard from extending its service because contrary to \u00a7 1(18)\u201d and \u201cThe governing statutory provisions do not permit substitution of the Commission\u2019s order for a decree of court,\u201d and the Court must have regarded the counterclaim in the same light.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Decision on the merits turns on interpretation of the mandate of \u00a7 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act that \u201cNo carrier by railroad subject to this chapter shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, or shall acquire or operate any line of railroad, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transportation under this chapter over or by means of such additional or extended line of railroad, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate\u201d of public convenience and necessity. One would not suppose, as a matter of ordinary speech, that the Central\u2019s hauling freight by truck or tractor-trailer between its railhead and a warehouse within the New York terminal district was \u201cthe extension of its line of railroad.\u201d However, plaintiffs rightly say the matter is not that simple; \u201crailroad\u201d is a defined term in the Act and Congress can make a word mean what it chooses if only it tells us with sufficient clarity. Section 1(3) says \u201cThe term \u2018railroad\u2019 as used in this chapter shall include all bridges, car floats, lighters, and ferries used by or operated in connection with any railroad, * * * and also all switches, spurs, tracks, terminals, and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of the persons or property designated herein, including all freight depots, yards, and grounds, used or necessary in the transportation or delivery of any such property.\u201d Hence, say plaintiffs, a freight depot is a railroad; <em>ergo </em>operation to or from a new freight depot is an extension of a line of railroad. Defendant challenges the conclusion, claiming this ignores the vital words \u201cline of\u201d in \u00a7 1 (18); the definition of \u201crailroad\u201d in \u00a7 1 (3), defendant says forcefully, makes it clear that service to and from the freight depot, even though conducted by motor truck, is \u201cThe transportation of * * * property * * * by railroad\u201d within the jurisdictional grant of \u00a7 1(1) but does not transmute truck or trailer haulage through the city streets into a \u201cline of railroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Indeed, defendant claims that precisely this was ruled in New York Dock Ry. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 3 Cir., 62 F.2d 1010, 1011, certiorari denied 1933, 289 U.S. 750, 53 S.Ct. 694, 77 L.Ed. 1495, where the Court refused to enjoin, under \u00a7 1 (20), a proposal of the Pennsylvania \u201cwithout leave of the Interstate Commerce Commission, to deliver freight by motor trucks from its terminals directly to consignees and receive freight from consignors for delivery by trucks to its terminals and thus establish what it calls an \u2018accessorial terminal service,\u2019 popularly described as \u2018store door delivery and receipt of freight,\u2019 charging therefor tariffs to be filed with and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\u201d Such a truck movement, says the Central, is a \u201cterminal facility\u201d within the general language of \u00a7 1(3), even though not specifically mentioned as a \u201cfreight depot\u201d is, see Tariffs Embracing Motor Truck or Wagon Transfer Service, 91 I.C.C. 539, 546-47 (19&amp;4), Absorption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Drayage and Trucking Charges, 197 I.C.C. 675, 682-83 (1933), and thus is a \u201crailroad\u201d; hence, it claims, the New York Dock Ry. case necessarily determined that addition of a new terminal facility, although part of a \u201crailroad,\u201d is not an extension of a \u201cline of railroad\u201d within \u00a7 1(18). Plaintiffs deny this. Stressing the absence of a fixed physical facility of the Pennsylvania in the New York Dock Ry. case, they point to passages in the opinion characterizing the Pennsylvania\u2019s proposal as a \u201cservice\u201d within the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d in \u00a7 1(3), which the Court contrasted with \u201crailroad,\u201d 62 F.2d at page 1013, and to the Court\u2019s conclusion, page 1014, \u201cthat the proposed accessorial terminal service by trucks is not a railroad,\u201d which \u00a7 1(3) says that Jay St. freight depot is. We agree with plaintiffs that the New York Dock case is not controlling, at least on the basis whereon the Court placed it; however, the Court\u2019s distinction between \u201crailroad\u201d and \u201cline of railroad\u201d does point in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">With language and authority thus favoring defendant but not conclusive, we turn to administrative construction and to considerations of purpose and policy. These bring the scales down sharply on defendant\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We do not have to indulge in research as to what the administrative construction is, since the Commission has expressed itself as to this very case; however, it is relevant to inquire whether this construction was recent or of long standing. Appellants say the decision which the Commission cited in its report, Drayage and Unloading at Jefferson City, Mo., 206 I.C.C. 436, 439 (1935), is not apposite since the tariff there in question, like that in New York Dock Ry. v. Pennsylvania R. R., provided trucking service directly to or from the customer\u2019s premises, although, unlike that in New York Dock, it did not provide for an extra charge. See also Coordination of Motor Transportation, 182 I.C.C. 263, 367 (1932); Absorption of Drayage and Trucking Charges, 197 I.C.C. 675, 682-83 (1933). However, other Commission decisions have said or implied that action under \u00a7 1(18) likewise is not required when the trucking service ends or begins at an off-track station. Transfer of Freight within St. Louis and East St. Louis by Dray and Truck, 155 I.C.C. 129, 149 (1929), said this as to the abandonment of an inland station, over an argument as to the reference to freight depots in the definition of \u201crailroad\u201d in \u00a7 1(3) almost identical with plaintiffs\u2019. In the same year, in Constructive and Off Track Railroad Stations, 156 I.C.C. 205, 208, 209, 212 (1929), the Commission described the establishment of off-track stations in Manhattan after 1920, none of which had been certificated under \u00a7 1(18), without any intimation that it thought certificates had been needed. Two years thereafter the Commission approved tariffs of the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Valley terminating such inland stations without suggesting that proceedings under \u00a7 1(18) need be had, Discontinuance of Inland or Off-Track Stations in New York City, 173 I.C.C. 727 (1931), and a year later it followed the same course as to a tariff of the Nickel Plate establishing an off-track station in St. Louis, Off-Track Stations in St. Louis, 186 I.C.C. 578 (1932). The administrative construction is thus of long standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Appellants argue this administrative construction should not receive its customary weight because of the holdings, cited above in our discussion of the jurisdiction of the District Judge, that under \u00a7 1(20) the enjoining of extensions or abandonments which the Act prohibits without a certificate is for the courts rather than the Commission. However, it hardly follows from this that Congress would not wish the courts to give appropriate heed to a long-standing and consistent interpretation by the Commission in the discharge of duties confided to it. Section 1(18) cannot be deemed wholly forbidden ground to the Commission. Often the Commission must construe and apply \u00a7 1(18) directly, as it would have had to do here if the Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>had petitioned for a certificate and then moved to dimiss the petition for want of jurisdiction, see Lehigh Valley R. R. Conditional Sale Contract, 233 I.C.C. 359 (1939); Davidson Transfer and Storage Co. First Mortgage, 282 I.C.C. 521 (1952). And, despite some of Mr. Justice Butler\u2019s language in Powell v. United States, supra, we cannot believe the Commission is under a mandate to remain mute in an investigation and suspension proceeding as to whether the tariff contemplates action which the Commission believes it will be bound to seek to enjoin under \u00a7 1(20). So far as concerns the relative roles of court and Commission, we see little distinction between \u00a7 1(18) and \u00a7 20a, relating to the issuance of securities. There also decision whether Commission authorization is needed is ultimately for the courts in civil or criminal proceedings, but weight has been given not only to positive administrative construction, United States v. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R., 2 Cir., 1959, 276 F.2d 525, 530-31, certiorari denied, Tri-Continental Financial Corp. v. U. S., 1960, 362 U.S. 961, 80 S.Ct. 877, 4 L.Ed.2d 876 but also to long-standing administrative inaction, United States v. Chicago North Shore &amp; Milwaukee R. R., 1933, 288 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 245, 77 L.Ed. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellants also challenge the administrative construction on the basis of certain decisions requiring certificates for the initiation or abandonment by railroads of operations conducted with vessels. Pennsylvania R. R. Abandonment, F.D. No. 18418 (1954) (unreported), relied on by plaintiffs, is readily distinguished as dealing with car floats; such operations may well be thought to be a physical extension of the \u201cline of railroad.\u201d Acquisition by Alameda Belt Line, 105 I.C.C. 349 (1926), included car float service; to be sure, it also included lighters, barges and ferries, but there was no discussion whether certification was needed for these or, indeed, for the car floats themselves. On the other hand, Chesapeake Beach Ry. Co., Ferry, 166 I.C.C. 293 (1930), which gave rise to Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, supra, was an application for ferry service only. It is distinguishable here as dealing with an operation into territory not theretofore served by carrier. How Commission decisions declining jurisdiction under \u00a7 1(18) over line haul operations of rail carriers by bus or truck, Jaloff v. Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Ry., 152 I.C.C. 758 (1929); Arlington &amp; Fairfax, Auto R. Co., Extension of Operation, 228 I.C.C. 479 (1938), are to be reconciled with it we need not inquire; the latter point is now largely academic since certification for line haul operation by motor vehicle is required by the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 303(a) (14), 306. See American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, D.C.D.C.1936, 17 F.Supp. 655. We thus find no sufficient contrary indication in the ferry and ear-float eases to cause us to disregard the Commission\u2019s long-standing administrative construction on the very issue with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Interpretation of \u00a7 1(18) as not applying to initiation or abandonment of trucking service to a freight depot within a terminal district already served by a rail carrier likewise accords with the purpose of the statute and with considerations of practical administration. As explained in Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., 1924, 264 U.S. 331, 343-347, 44 S.Ct. 376, 68 L.Ed. 713, and in Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. v. Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe R. Co., supra, 270 U.S. at page 277, 46 S.Ct. 263, the purpose of requiring a certificate for new construction was to prevent wastes of carrier resources, of two sorts \u2014 waste of the resources of the constructing carrier by unwise expenditures and waste of the resources of other carriers by extension of a new carrier into an area adequately served by existing lines. Neither consideration is applicable to the situation at bar. No substantial capital expenditure by the Central is involved. Of course, there is a question whether furnishing the haulage without added charge will be an undue financial burden on the Central as against the advantages it expects to receive, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>that is the same sort of question which the Commission regularly considers in rate cases \u2014 and, indeed, could have been considered in the investigation and suspension proceeding here \u2014 and does not differ because the trucks operate to or from a depot rather than the shipper\u2019s premises, as to which appellants do not seriously urge a certificate to be required even if the carrier absorbs the expense, Absorption of Drayage and Trucking Charges, supra. Neither is there new competition in the sense of a new carrier entering a market. The Central was competing in Brooklyn long before \u00a7 1 (18) was enacted; as with the Pennsylvania in the New York Dock Ry. case, what it here proposes is an improvement in service to an area already served. Indeed, the competitive effect is less than if it offered free transport to and from the customer\u2019s door, as the Cotton Belt did in Absorption of Drayage and Trucking Charges, supra. Moreover, were \u00a7 1 (18) applicable, it would cover abandonment as well as initiation; thus, under plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, if the Central found the Phoenix Warehouse unsuitable or the terms of the warehouseman unsatisfactory, it would have to secure a certificate to abandon and a new certificate for a new location. It is scarcely credible that Congress meant the carrier or the Commission to be burdened with the panoply of a \u00a7 1(18) hearing, with notice to the governor and three weeks\u2019 newspaper publication, \u00a7 1(19), for every such change of service. The Commission seems to have had some such consideration in mind when it first said that \u00a7 1 (18) did not apply to abandonment of an inland station, Transfer of Freight within St. Louis and East St. Louis by Dray and Truck, supra. The Los Angeles passenger terminal case, Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., supra, involving large scale relocation of main track, differs <em>toto caelo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The denial of a temporary injunction is affirmed.
