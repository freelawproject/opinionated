(Polak\u2019s), a New York corporation, appeals from a judgment dismissing its complaint in an action to recover income and excess profits taxes paid for the year 1944. The claim is based upon the dis-allowance by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of amounts ($159,653.86) deducted from 1944 income as ordinary and business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Most of the facts relating to the background and stock ownership of the various members of the Polak family are irrelevant to a determination of the narrow issue here presented. The few salient facts may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">In 1914 Polak\u2019s Frutal Works, N. V. (N. V.) was incorporated in Holland. There it manufactured and sold throughout the world essential oils, flavoring extracts, perfume compounds and various synthetic materials. In 1921 Polak\u2019s was organized in New York to handle the sale of N. V.\u2019s products in the United States and Canada. All the common stock of Polak\u2019s was owned by N. V. and the products were supplied to Polak\u2019s by N. V. at cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">Anticipating the events occasioned by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, members of the Polak family in 1939 and 1940 came to the United States bringing with them their knowledge of formulas and manufacturing processes. In May 1940 Holland was invaded, N. V.\u2019s plant was seized by the Germans and for all practical purposes N. V. became extinct. However, using Polak's for manufacturing purposes, the Polaks in this country during the years 1940-1944 prospered from the business formerly carried on in Holland and Polak\u2019s profits increased substantially. Taxes also increased substantially, largely because of the enormous expenditures for our military forces which, in turn, were so ably protecting our freedoms including the freedom of Polak\u2019s to continue its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-16\">In November 1944 Polak\u2019s at a Board of Directors meeting adopted the following resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-17\">\u201cThat, Polak\u2019s Frutal Works, Inc. pay to the N. V. a commission of 10 per cent of the export sales volume transacted by the New York corporation in each year since January 1, 1940, as full compensation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>use of the processes and formulae and for the customers turned over by the N. V. to the Incorporated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In March 1945 Polak\u2019s fixed this voted 10% for the previous five years at $159,-653.86 and credited this amount on its books to N. V. No payment was ever actually made and as of December 31, 1948 the Secretary of Polak\u2019s in charge of bookkeeping and tax matters, amongst other duties, \u201cwas told or instructed as per December 31,1948 to credit the $159,-000 to surplus of the plaintiff [Polak\u2019s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">No useful purpose will be served by any endeavor to analyze motive or even to discuss whether the deduction in question would fall within the category of tax avoidance or evasion. The problem need not be thus complicated. The statute (Section 23, Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23) provides for the deduction of \u201cAll the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d No part of $159,653.86 or any other amount was \u201cpaid or incurred\u201d during any one of the years in question. There is no proof of any commitment, written or oral, to pay any commission whatsoever for the purposes stated in the directors\u2019 resolution. The book entry cannot be characterized even as a voluntary assumption of a liability because there was no liability. Quite apart from the fact that Polak\u2019s had been enjoying for almost 20 years these benefits without a 10% commission, it is scarcely conceivable that during the five years of merged operations some financial notice would not have been taken of any such liability if it had in fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\"> To be deductible as a business expense the payment must be both \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d \u201cOrdinary\u201d does not require that \u201cthe payments must be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will have to make them often\u201d (Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 114, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212). Nevertheless, the payments must be tested by normal business standards and practices. If in 1940 N. V. had agreed to furnish to Polak\u2019s its formulas and its manufacturing technical knowledge on an annual basis or a term of years in consideration of a payment of 10% of gross or net sales, such an annual payment might well have fallen into the category of \u201cdeductible expense.\u201d However, no such agreement was made. When in November 1944 Polak\u2019s agreed to pay commissions for the preceding five years the payment was not in satisfaction of a legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">As the Supreme Court said in Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 116, 54 S.Ct. 8, 10, 78 L.Ed. 212, \u201cMany cases in the federal courts deal with phases of the problem presented in the case at bar. To attempt to harmonize them would be a futile task. They involve the appreciation of particular situations, at times with border-line conclusions.\u201d Quite analogous in principle, however, is Thomas Flexible Coupling Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 1946, 158 F.2d 828, 829, in which royalties were paid under a 1939 contract for patent improvements which had already been legally assigned pursuant to a 1920 contract. The Tax Court in disallowing the payments as \u201cordinary and necessary business expenses\u201d had \u201cconcluded that the petitioner was under no legal obligation to pay the royalties and that there was no showing of any exceptional business necessity for making such payments\u201d (at page 830). The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Mertens well states the principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">\u201cAn expenditure may not be deductible even though expedient or highly commendable from an ethical standpoint, or even required under a contractual obligation. Normally, an expenditure is not \u2018ordinary\u2019 if no liability exists and there is neither demand nor acceptance of any consideration in return for such expenditure.\u201d (4 Mertens on Federal Taxation, \u00a7 25.09 at pages 23-24.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-14\"> The district court found [176 F.Supp. 523,] \u201cas a fact that the alleged expense was most extraordinary and completely unnecessary. It was a completely voluntary and wholly unsolicited assump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ti on of a liability that was never demanded or incurred.\u201d Since \u201cthe burden is on the taxpayer to establish that they [the payments] were both ordinary and necessary,\u201d the court correctly dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s complaint and granted judgment to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
