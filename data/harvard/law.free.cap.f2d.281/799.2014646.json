The appellants also undertake to raise questions asserted to be of a federal nature with respect to the validity of the Puerto Rican statute cited above authorizing resort to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in certain situations not by appeal but only by petition for review or certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">On July 7, 1960, we granted a motion by the appellee under our Rule 39(b), 28 U.S.C., to dismiss the appeal. It seemed clear to us then, and it seems equally clear to us now, that the order of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, which we were asked to review was not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of that Court and so was not within the jurisdiction conferred upon this court by Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 for the simple reason that the order did not terminate the litigation but was only a step in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">The appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
