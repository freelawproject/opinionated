Appellant also asserts that the trebled damages called for by Section 4 would result in a windfall to plaintiff. Congress, in line with its effort to eliminate the sort of monopolistic practice here revealed imposed this rigorous penalty. The assumed situation before the district court is scarcely to be called sui generis but if by any chance it should be so categoried \"then any modification of Section 4 to fit the particular circumstances would be for the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">\u25a0The order of the district court will be affirmed on the opinion of that court, D.C. M.D.Pa.1960, 185 F.Supp. 826.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
