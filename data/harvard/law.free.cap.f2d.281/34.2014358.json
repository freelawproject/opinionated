The District Court\u2019s judgment left the ruling of the Commission intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">The rates challenged in the reparations proceeding and here were the final result of a ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission in proposed general increases of tariffs which became effective February 25, 1956.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An additional six percent rate increase over several former percentage increases was there allowed because of actual increases in the cost of performing transportation services. All increases were directed to be made on the \u201cbasic freight rates and charges of the railroads.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The quoted words have been the standard direction for applying raises in the Increased Freight Rate Cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">The heart of the controversy is the method that is to be applied in calculating the increases in the existing tariffs \u25a0 for the cotton shipments. Freight charges on cotton have always been calculated upon the hundred pounds. Since cotton weighs lightly but bulks large, the shippers and carriers found it mutually profitable to compress cotton for transportation. The development of the powered compress in the nineteenth century made a contribution in simplifying the handling of cotton comparable to that made by Whitney\u2019s invention of the gin to remove the seed from the lint in the eighteenth century, or the development of the mechanical picker in the twentieth century. To encourage compression the railroads many years ago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>introduced into their tariffs as an item an allowance for compression frequently limited to \u201cnot to exceed twenty-five cents per hundred pounds.\u201d Compression ordinarily costs the shipper more than this allowance. The cost varies according to the charge at the particular compress. Tariffs were developed called compression-in-transit tariffs, abridged to \u201cc.i.t.\u201d Whatever their precise form, there was a freight rate or charge to the shipper of so much per hundred pounds for the carriage of the cotton, and an allowance to the shipper of not to exceed so many cents per cwt for compression, whether the cotton was compressed prior to or in the course of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">As stated above, when subsequent increases of rates were approved, the Commission always directed that the increases were to be applied to \u201cthe basic freight rates and charges of the railroads.\u201d The railroads carried out the order by adding the allowed percentage increase each time to their freight charge, continuing to deduct on their freight bills the unincreased compression allowance. The shippers urged that the allowance for compression should be deducted before the allowed percentage increase is calculated. Following is an example of the difference in result. This is drawn from an exhibit and brief for appellants J. G. Boswell and Company, et al., shippers of cotton. It is:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u201ca shipment of 100 bales of cotton from Bakersfield to the port of Long Beach, California. In making out this freight bill the railroad agent made the following entries:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">(Freight Bill No. 005, as rendered)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Weight Rate Prepaid</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">53575 40 214.30</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">IC 15% 32.14</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">246.44</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Less O85! CWT comp Allowance 42.86</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">203.58 Tax 6.11</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">209.69</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">The rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds is the gross c.i.t. rate from Bakersfield to Long Beach. The c.i.t. rate minus the stated compression allowance of 8 cents per 100 pounds was applicable to a shipment of cotton which \u201coriginated\u201d at the Bakersfield compress. Since it was \u201ccompressed in transit at point of origin,\u201d the railroad did not advance the compression charges to the compress company. It will be observed that the railroad agent added the 15-percent <em>Ex Parte 175 </em>surcharge <em>before </em>he deducted the 8 cents per 100 pounds compression allowance, but that the 3-percent transportation excise tax was computed <em>after </em>the deduction of the compression allowance. The shippers contend that the freight bill entries, in accordance with the above quoted governing rules in the general increase tariffs, should have been as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">(Freight Bill No. 005, as revised by shippers)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">Weight Rate Prepaid</p>\n<p id=\"b85-19\">(c.i.t) 40</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">Less comp, allowance 08 /</p>\n<p id=\"b85-21\">53575 (net) 32 171.44</p>\n<p id=\"b85-22\">Ex Parte 175 surcharge 15%' 25.72</p>\n<p id=\"b85-23\">197.16</p>\n<p id=\"b85-24\">Tax 3% 5.91</p>\n<p id=\"b85-25\">203.07</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>On this shipment the Southern Pacific Company collected and retained for <em>transportation </em>services $203.58. The shippers contend the amount paid should have been $197.16 and that they were overcharged in this instance $6.42.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">The validity of the claim for reparations turns on the meaning of the terms \u201cbasic freight rates and charges.\u201d The shippers assert that the basic rate is the net amount paid by the shipper to the carrier after deduction of the carrier\u2019s allowance to the shipper for compression. That is the c.i.t. rate, less the compression allowance times the weight. The railroads say the basic rate is the c.i.t. rate and the compression allowance is a charge against that basic rate. The method urged by the shippers has been called by the litigants the net rate method ; that urged by the railroads the gross rate method for calculating the allowed rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In the reparation cases, the Commission, which granted the increase, construed its language as the railroads interpret it. \u201cWe believe .that the defendants\u2019 [the railroads] method of applying the general increases was proper and produced the legal rates.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe c.i.t. rate is a specifically published freight rate to which the findings in the ex parte proceedings contemplated that the authorized increases would be applied.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Following each one of the Increased Freight Rate series of decisions, after the cost rises subsequent to World War II, the railroads have of necessity amended their tariffs to show the addi-</p>\n<p id=\"ACt\">tional percentage allowed them by the then current increase.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15(7), the Commission had the duty in supervising the tariffs to satisfy itself of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of such rate. The method of calculation here under attack was accepted by the Commission. In the Allenberg case, the Commission said, \u201cThe assailed rates * * * called c.i.t. rates, are the basic rates in effect on June 30, 1946, subject to subsequent general increases.\u201d Revenue adjustments are normally superimposed on existing rate structures.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The Commission was conscious, at the time the rate increases were being considered, of this very problem of applying the general increases to cotton tariffs subject to a compression allowance. Their opinion in the rate increase proceeding involved here considers the question and decides on a method other than that pressed by appellants to alleviate any inequities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The method selected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the Commission was a rate increase hold-down setting an upper limit on the amount of increase possible by application of the percentage increase. Appellants do not attack the reasonableness of the overall rate and there is no indication, therefore, that the hold-down method of preventing inequality has proven inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">This consideration and approval by the Commission lends impressive weight to the railroads\u2019 contention that they followed the purpose and direction of the Commission in filing their tariffs. The Commission had power, legislative in character, to choose any reasonable method to calculate the proposed increase.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In dealing with the interpretation by the Commission, courts accept its factual findings with reasonable support in the record. Even if not a fine question of fact, the meaning of \u201cbasic freight rates and charges\u201d is one that depends upon the Commission\u2019s intention in employing the term, seemingly devised by it for use in this very situation. Therefore courts will be slow to adopt any other meaning than the gloss put upon the phrase by the Commission, its author.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the proper means of applying the rate increase was confirmed by it after the in-, crease was granted at the time the carriers submitted their revised tariffs to the Commission for approval. The purpose of the increases was to compensate the railroads for rising operating expenses. The new tariffs, after application of the increases showed the rate in terms of the charge per cwt subject to deduction for the unincreased carrier\u2019s allowance for compression under the following note covering transit compression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">\u201cNote 1. \u2014 When the shipper has paid the compression charges direct to the compress plant on a shipment of compressed cotton tendered at a compress, such compression charges not to exceed 25 cents per 100 lbs. may be deducted from the total freight charges computed on' the total weight at the CIT rate upon evidence of payment of such compression charges to the compress plant where the shipment was loaded.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">A tariff defined \u201cCIT rate\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">\u201cThe term \u2018CIT rate\u2019 refers to a commodity rate on cotton, in bales, which rate includes the cost of compression or any proportion thereof or which includes an allowance for the cost of compression.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">The increased tariffs took the \u201cexisting rates in cents per 100 lbs\u201d and added to that figure the percentage of increase allowed. In Item No. 10 of such a tariff in Ex Parte 175, 284 I.C.C. 589, these directions appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">\u201cItem No. 10. \u2014 Application of Increased Rates and Charges \u2014 Section 1. All charges for line-haul transportation services, also charges for out-of-line, indirect or back-haul services, special freight train serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ice, rental charges for use of special equipment or other line-haul services, as provided in tariffs making reference to this tariff, * * * are increased <em>15 </em>percent, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\">\u201cIn determining the applicable charge, first ascertain without reference to this tariff the amount of the line-haul transportation charges, also charges for out-of-line, indirect or back-haul services, special freight train service, rental charges for use of special equipment or other line-haul services, and then increase the amount so ascertained 15 percent, * * * <em>&gt;&gt; </em><footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It will be noted that Item 10 does not refer in any way to the compression charge. Thus they applied the percentage increases to the rate which had been used for the gross cost to the shipper for transportation. These tariffs were approved by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The Commission deemed the compression charge a part of the line-haul rate but a non-carrier service.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The line-haul rate is the charge for furnishing the line-haul transportation services, that is, those services or allowances that are considered a normal incident to the uninterrupted carriage of the goods from the origin to the destination. This is the transportation rate for carriage-and is to be distinguished from \u201caccessorial\u201d or \u201cterminal\u201d services, for which additional charges are made.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission is clearly empowered to determine what is embraced within the line-haul rate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">It is true, as pointed out by Commissioner Murphy, the single dissenter in the Allenberg case, 289 I.C.C. at 587, that when the shipper himself pays for compression before loading or ships c.i.t., he deducts the allowable compress charges from the gross rate, but that does not make the net result the basic freight rate or charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">The Commission\u2019s \u2022 interpretation of the words \u201cbasic rates and charges\u201d is consonant with the Commission's purpose in granting the increase. Additional revenue was sought for the carriers. Only the tariff items that brought profit were increased, not the disbursement items.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">\u201cAs a basis for their contention that only the net rate was increased by the general-increase tariffs, the complainants refer to the following statement in J. G. Boswell Co. v. Alabama G. S. R. Co., 276 I.C.C. 761, concerning such tariffs: \u2018It is obvious that the tariffs contemplated only increases in rates and charges from which the carriers were to derive revenue.\u2019 There is nothing in the later finding which requires application of the general increases to the net rate. This is true because the word \u2018revenue\u2019 as used in that finding is not synonymous with profit or net income. In other words, the defendants derive revenue from the gross rate as published in their rate tariff, and the disbursement of such revenue, through allowances or otherwise, can have no retroactive effect on the applicability of the general increases. The complainants also refer to decisions wherein a rate is defined as the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cost to the shipper of the transportation of his property. Such decisions were made concerning violations of the Elkins Act. Thus, while the net cost to the shipper is of primary importance in determining if a rebate has been given, it is of no moment in determining an applicable rate under section 6 of the act.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">It is suggested by the appellants that, as is shown in the freight bills set out above, at page 37 of 281 F.2d, the fact that the transportation tax is paid in these bills on the \u201cnet\u201d sum is significant in showing that the \u201cbasic rate\u201d is the \u201cnet\u201d rate. Section 4271 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4271, puts the tax \u201cupon the amount paid * * * for the transportation of property * * * by rail.\u201d Federal Tax Regulations 1955, Part 143, \u00a7 13, applies the tax \u201cto any payment, not specifically exempted, for the transportation of property.\u201d But the basic freight rate is not determined by what the Government uses to calculate taxes. Nor is there any indication that the method used in the freight bills is a proper interpretation by the railroads making out the bills of the pertinent tax regulations. In any event, the definition of terms for purposes of taxation is irrelevant to the problem of defining the basic freight rate for purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In view of our agreement with the District Judge\u2019s determination as to the correctness of the railroads\u2019 application of the rate increases, we do not reach the additional question presented below as to whether the Commission was correct in its view that \u00a7 16(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act barred the award of reparations on claims of the Commodities Credit Corporation relating to shipments delivered or tendered for delivery more than two years prior to the date of filing of the petition to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">After the argument the court requested counsel to comment on the significance of a change in the method of stating tariff rates on cotton made by the carriers, effective in 1957. The effect is to state a rate for cotton by using the net rate. This eliminates the compression allowance as a factor in the basic freight rate. We think the change shows a simpler method for calculating the payments due the carriers, but we do not see that it affects the problem of what the Commission meant by the basic freight rate or charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">The basic freight, we conclude, was, as the Commission ruled, the gross amount that was placed in the tariff for the line-haul transportation. The allowance was a charge against that rate. The Commission ruling upon that question is not only within its power to determine rate increases but seems to us to be a reasonable method of separating basic rates or line-haul rates from charges assumed by railroads that are, like compression, incidental to their services but beyond the carrier\u2019s power to control as to cost or method of operation. Where the assailed rate is the result of the application of internally consistent definitions and general criteria and the overall result reached is not unreasonable, there is no basis for disturbing the Commission\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> No. 15,360, J.
