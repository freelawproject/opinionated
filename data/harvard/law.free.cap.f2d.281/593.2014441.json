The Board adopted the findings of the Trial Examiner, and based its conclusion that the picketing of construction sites was for such unlawful objective upon the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\u201c(1) The primary employer, Macatee, had a permanent place of business where all its employees, including those not directly involved in the labor dispute with the Respondent Union, regularly reported, and where the Respondent Union could and did publicize its dispute to, and solicit the support of, Macatee\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the Respondent Union\u2019s object was only to seek the support of the primary employer\u2019s employees, there was no need for picketing the premises of neutral employers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201c(2) The Respondent Union\u2019s letter to employers in the construction industry in Dallas requesting them to cease doing business with Maca-tee until the labor dispute was settled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">\u201c(3) In many instances, employees of neutral employers quit work when Respondent Union\u2019s pickets appeared.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">\u201c(4) On February 26 and 27, 1959, Respondent Union\u2019s pickets picketed the entire length of the John Deere property facing on Harry Hines Boulevard rather than limiting themselves to the area adjacent to the place where Macatee\u2019s employees were working on the project.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 25, 1959, Respondent Union\u2019s pickets continued picketing the Richardson project for 2 hours after the Macatee\u2019s and other employer\u2019s employees had ceased working and had left the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">\u201cIn view of the foregoing, we find, as did the Trial Examiner, that Respondent Union violated Section 8(b) (4) (A) by its picketing at the construction sites of neutral employers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The recommendations of the Trial Examiner included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201c * * * As this is not the first such violation in which the Respondent has engaged,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it may reasonably be expected that the Respondent will continue to commit similar violations in the future. Therefore the recommended order will not be limited only to the individual employers named herein, but instead will apply to any other employers as well.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The Board\u2019s Order broadly required the respondent union to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201c1. Cease and desist from engaging in, or inducing or encouraging employees of <em>employers other than Macatee, Inc. </em>to engage in a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is to force or require <em>any employer or other person </em>to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of Macatee, Inc., or to cease doing business with that company <em>or any other company.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">and to post specified notices and make certain reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">The respondent union makes no attack upon the findings of fact by the Trial Examiner, but earnestly insists that the record taken as a whole does not present a substantial basis of believable evidence pointing toward the unlawful motive. See N.L.R.B. v. General Drivers, etc., 5 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 205, 211; compare N.L.R.B. v. Dan River Mills, 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 381, 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">After carefully studying the record and considering the briefs and arguments, we find that the Board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence for the reasons already adequately stated in the Board\u2019s decision. See also Superior Derrick Corporation v. N.L.R.B., 5 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">As to the breadth of the Board\u2019s order, the Board\u2019s brief is silent. The Board failed to rule upon Exception No. 14 of the respondent union raising the point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon the authorities cited by the respondent union in its exception (footnote 2, supra) and upon the recent Supreme Court decision in Communication Workers, etc. v. N.L.R.B., 362 U.S. 479, 80 S.Ct. 838, 4 L.Ed.2d 896, and our decision in N.L.R.B. v. Local 926, etc., 5 Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 418, 421, we hold that that part of the order of the Board heretofore quoted is too broad and should be modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-17\">\u201c1. Cease and desist from engaging in, or inducing or encourag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ing employees of J. W. Bateson Company, Inc. or Gower &amp; Folsom Construction Company to engage in a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is to force or require J. W. Bateson Company, Inc. or Gower &amp; Folsom Construction Company to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of Macatee, Inc., or to cease doing business with that Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">As so modified the order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\">. Section 8(b) (4) (A) of the Act, as it was in effect during the events in this case, provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">\u201c * * * to engage in or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted 1-ocusal in the course of their employment * * * or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring * * * any employer or other person * * * to cease doing business with any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-30\">Section 8(b) (4) was amended in the Fall of 1959, and the provision applicable here was renumbered as Section 8(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>(4) (B).

In affirming the conclusion of the Trial Examiner, we have not adopted his reasoning based on the supposed analogy to the Otis Massey case (109 N. L.R.B. 275, enforcement denied 225 F.2d 205, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">In Otis Massey, the circuit court refused to enforce the Board\u2019s decision because it felt that the Board had ignored evidence which it regarded as establishing that the respondent union was not picketing for an unlawful objective. The court later pointed out that in its Otis Massey decision the other employees of the primary employer at the common construction situs picketed \u2018almost never came to the primary employer\u2019s principal situs, the warehouse,\u2019 and the criteria evolved by the Board in Moore Drydock (92 N.L.R.B. 547) \u2018were scrupulously observed.\u2019 N. L. R. B. v. Truck Drivers and Helpers (National Trucking Co.) 5 Cir., 228 F.2d 791, 796. See also N. L. R. B. v. Associated Musicians, 2 Cir., 226 F.2d 900, 906. In the present ease, we rely for our finding of illegal objective not only on the fact that the primary employer had a permanent place of business where the Respondent Union could adequately publicize its dispute to all employees of the primary employer, including these not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>involved in the dispute, but also on the other evidence set forth above.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\u201c29.

Said order is too broad and beyond the Board powers for the reasons set forth in the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in N. L. R. B. v. Ford Motor, 119 F.2d 326 (C.A.5, 1941) and N. L. R. B. v. Local 926 Operating Engineers, 267 F.2d 418, 44 L.R.R.M. 2201 (C.A.5, May 26, 1959), and Truck Drivers, etc. No. 728 v. N. L. R.
