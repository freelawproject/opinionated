Omitting the twenty-three overt acts appended to the count, Count 14 is set forth in its entirety in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>After trial before Judge Weinfeld and a jury appellants on January 14, 1957 were found guilty. On February 5, 1957 Galgano was sentenced to a term of ten years imprisonment as a second offender under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carminati\u2019s sentencing was adjourned for nine days and on February 14 a similar ten year sentence was imposed upon him. The convictions were affirmed by this court, <em>sub nom. </em>United States v. Carminati, 2 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 640, and certiorari was denied 355 U.S. 883, 78 S.Ct. 150, 2 L.Ed.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Thereafter appellants each moved under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for corrections of sentence. Galgano\u2019s motion was denied on September 2, 1959, reported <em>sub nom. </em>United States v. McKenney, D.C., 181 F.Supp. 143; Carminati\u2019s on February 18, 1960. Each contends that he should not have been sentenced under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, but instead was required to be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the general conspiracy statute, which provides for a five year maximum sentence. In addition, as an independent ground, Carminati contends that he should be sentenced anew because the sentencing judge failed to afford him the \u201cright of allocution\u201d provided for in Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Appellants\u2019 contention relative to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 rests upon the parenthetical citation of that section at the end of Count 14. (See footnote 1, supra.) We reject appellants\u2019 argument that this citation precluded conviction under any other section. It is clear that when an indictment charges conduct which is violative of a particular statute the individual charged may be convicted under that statute even though the statute is not specified in the indictment. Rule 7(c) Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; United States v. Kolodny, 2 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 210, 211. Count 14 charges a conspiracy to violate 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174. Such a conspiracy, if proven, constitutes in itself a violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. Similarly, Count 14 charges a conspiracy to violate 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4701, 4703, 4724(c), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>4771 (a); and such a conspiracy, if proven, constitutes a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a). Accordingly, while the citation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 may have been either mistaken or duplicitous, it did not prevent conviction for conspiracy under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, or, for that matter, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">It is the rule in this circuit that an erroneous citation in an indictment will not be cause for reversing a conviction unless the defendant shows that he was prejudiced by the miscitation, United States v. McKnight, 2 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 817, 820. Appellants seek to show that in the preparation of their defense they were prejudiced, and were further prejudiced by the judge\u2019s charge to the jury that Count 14 was \u201cbottomed\u201d upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. As to the first point we see no way in which a defense to an accusation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 would differ from a defense to a combined accusation of conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a). In each case the matters the Government would be required to prove, and the statutory presumptions the defendant might be required to rebut, would be the same. As to the judge\u2019s charge, apparently appellants would have us believe that the jury could have been led to convict on a lesser quantum of evidence because appellants would receive lesser penalties under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. We certainly cannot attribute to the jury any such improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\"> On the question of duplicity, Rule 12(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that defects in an indictment, other than those relating to lack of jurisdiction in the court or to a failure to charge an offense, may be raised only by motion before trial. The cases have consistently held that an objection to the indictment on grounds of duplicity is waived unless this objection is presented to the court prior to trial, United States v. Private Brands, Inc., 2 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 554, 557, certiorari denied 355 U.S. 957, 78 S.Ct. 542, 2 L.Ed. 2d 532; Beauchamp v. United States, 6 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 413, 415, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 723, 67 S.Ct. 66, 91 L.Ed. 626, rehearing denied 329 U.S. 826, 67 S.Ct. 183, 91 L.Ed. 702; Lemon v. United States, 8 Cir., 1908, 164 F. 953, 958; cf. United States v. Games, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1957, 156 F.Supp. 467, 470-471, affirmed 2 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 530, certiorari denied 359 U.S. 937, 79 S.Ct. 651, 3 L.Ed. 2d 637, or, at the very least, unless the objection is raised prior to the verdict, Durland v. United States, 1896, 161 U.S. 306, 315, 16 S.Ct. 508, 40 L.Ed. 709; Witt v. United States, 9 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 285, 286, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 827, 73 S.Ct. 28, 97 L.Ed. 1644; United States v. Poppa, 7 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 112, 114-115. Judicial unwillingness to hear objections to a duplicitous indictment raised for the first time after verdict would appear to apply, <em>a fortiori, </em>to such objections raised for the first time on a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See Dunn v. United States, 6 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 219, 221, certiorari denied 352 U.S. 899, 77 S.Ct. 140,1 L.Ed. 2d 90; Masi v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 132, certiorari denied 35 U.S. 919, 76 S.Ct. 208, 100 L.Ed. 805; United States v. Richie, 3 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 436, 437. True it is that in a case involving the identical count of the indictment presently before us it was held that an objection to a duplicitous count may be raised for the first time by a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 if the two offenses charged in the count are not subject to punishment of the same severity. United States v. Shackelford, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1957, 180 F.Supp. 857. The prior cases offer no support for this distinction, and we think it peculiarly inapposite where no defense has been offered that would rationally permit a verdict of guilty under the statute which imposes the lesser penalty (here either 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371), but not under the statute which imposes the greater penalty (21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174). We hold that appellants have waived any objection to any duplicity in the indictment. Therefore, we do not reach the question of whether Count 14 was in fact duplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Carminati\u2019s contention that he should be given an opportunity for re-sentence because he was denied the right of allocution provided for in Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is in this case so plainly without merit that we are not required to consider the question of whether this contention may be raised by a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See concurring opinion in Couch v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 235 F.2d 519, 521. As we have indicated above, no defense was presented that would have afforded a rational basis for concluding that Carminati was guilty only of a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and not 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. Accordingly, the district judge had no alternative but to sentence Carminati under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. Under that section the minimum sentence for a second offender, as Carminati is conceded to be, is ten years, Carminati\u2019s present sentence. As the district judge aptly observed, to require resentence under these circumstances would be to exalt form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-12\">. \u201cFourteenth Count</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">\u201c1.

It was part of the said conspiracy that the said defendants unlawfully, wil-fully and knowingly would sell, dispense and distribute a quantity of narcotic drugs, the exact amount and nature thereof being to the grand jury unknown, in that the said narcotic drugs would not be in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package, that is to say, that there would not be affixed to the container in and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>which the said defendants would sell, dispense and distribute the narcotic drugs as aforesaid any United States Internal Revenue Stamps as required by Section 4703, of Title 26, United States Code in violation of Sections 4701, 4703, 4704 (a) and 4771(a) of Title 26, United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\u201c3. It was further a part of said conspiracy that the said defendants, being persons who had not registered and who had not paid the special tax provided for by Sections 4702(a), 4721 and 4722 of Title 26, United States Code, unlawfully, wilfully, and knowingly would have in their possession and under their control a quantity of narcotic drugs, the exact amount and nature thereof being to the Grand Jury unknown, in violation of Section 4724(c) of Title 26, United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">\u201c4. It was further a part of said conspiracy that the said defendants unlawfully, wilfully and knowingly would receive, 'conceal, sell and facilitate the transportation, concealment and sale of the aforesaid narcotic drugs, after the said narcotic drugs had been imported and brought into the United States contrary to law knowing that the said narcotic drugs had been imported and brought into the United States contrary to law in violation of Sections 173 and 174 of Title 21, United States Code [annotated] .</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">\u201c(Title 18, United States Code, Section 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">\u201cs/ John G.

The trial record makes clear that at the time of sentence Galgano\u2019s attorney, an attorney other than his present counsel, argued at length that the trial judge could impose sentence only under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The argument was rejected, the judge stating: \u201cIf I am wrong of course on the sentence the Court of Appeals will decide it. It is a very simple question.\u201d However, this question, though so discussed below, was not then raised by any of the three appellants whose appeals were decided by the opinion at 247 F.2d 640.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
