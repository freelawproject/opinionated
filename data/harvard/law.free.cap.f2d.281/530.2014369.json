Govero, citizens of Missouri, in an action brought by Chicago Copper and Chemical Company, an Illinois corporation, on May 29, 1958, to recover damages for breach of contract. The claim stated in the complaint is that, on or about December 8,1956, the defendants entered into a written contract with the plaintiff, in which it agreed to buy from the defendants, and defendants agreed to sell and deliver to the plaintiff a minimum of 13,-000 tons and a maximum of 17,000 tons of crude barytes ore during the period December 10, 1956, to December 9, 1957, the ore to contain no more than 3% of ferric oxide and no less than 91% of barium sulfate, and the price per ton of such ore containing 94% of barium sulfate to be $15.50, with a premium of 7^ for each Uo of 1% above 94% of barium sulfate content, and a corresponding penalty if the content was below 94%; that the plaintiff was at all times ready, willing and able to accept and pay for the barytes ore it had contracted to purchase from the defendants; that the defendants wholly failed and refused to sell or deliver any ore of the quality contracted for; that as a result of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>fendants\u2019 breach of the contract the plaintiff was compelled to purchase from other sources less desirable substitute ore at a higher cost, and was put to other special expenses, all to its damage in the sum of $111,231.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The Apex Mining Company in its answer denied the material allegations of the complaint, but stated that if the plaintiff by written agreement had acquired a right to require Apex to deliver ore to it, the plaintiff forfeited its right by failing to pay for barytes ore delivered to it by Apex, and that the ores agreed to be sold by Apex to the plaintiff were sold in accordance with a previously furnished sample, and that all ores delivered by Apex to the plaintiff conformed to such sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">For a counterclaim, Apex stated that between November 1 and December 25, 1956, it delivered to the plaintiff, at its request, 573,600 pounds of barytes ore at the agreed price, and of the reasonable value, of $15.50 per ton, but that the plaintiff had failed to pay for the ore. Apex asked for judgment against the plaintiff for $4,445.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The defendant Govero in his answer denied virtually everything in the complaint, and stated: \u201cThat if plaintiff is entitled unto any contract with this defendant for the purchase of any ores of any kind or quality, that plaintiff breached its contract and forfeited the rights thereunder by failing to pay for ores delivered to plaintiff after payment therefor had become due and demand had been made therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In its reply to the counterclaim of Apex, the plaintiff admitted that the defendants shipped 573,600 pounds of barytes ore, but denied that it was shipped at plaintiff\u2019s request, denied that it was of the grade specified in the contract, denied that it was worth $15.50 per ton, denied that it was suitable for plaintiff\u2019s use, and denied that plaintiff was obligated to pay for the ore. The plaintiff, in its reply to the counterclaim asserted that the ore referred to therein was unloaded at plaintiff\u2019s plant as a service to the defendants and was held in storage pending an agreement as to its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The issues made by the pleadings, at the time of trial, appear to have been: 1. Was there any such written contract between the parties as was alleged in the complaint ? 2. If there was such a contract, had the defendants, by failing to sell and deliver to plaintiff the ore contracted for, breached the contract? 3. Had the plaintiff been ready, able and willing to pay for such ore if and when delivered? 4. Had the plaintiff, by failing to pay for seven carloads of ore shipped to it by the defendants, forfeited its right to recover damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The issues were tried to the court without a jury. The trial resulted in a judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and allowing the counterclaim of Apex in the sum of $3,522.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">The facts were largely undisputed, and need not be stated in complete detail. It was conclusively proved at the trial that the parties entered into the written agreement alleged in the complaint; it was conclusively proved that the defendants did not perform, and that they shipped no ore of the quality they had agreed to sell and deliver. Concededly, they did ship seven carloads of ore, apparently at the plaintiff\u2019s request but not pursuant to the contract in suit and not of the quality called for by the contract, such ore being low in barium sulfate and high in ferric oxide. Most of this ore was shipped before the formal written contract was signed, and none of it was accepted by the plaintiff as in compliance with the contract. The ore was later used by it in the manufacture of barium carbonate \u2014 apparently as an accommodation to the defendants. The undisputed evidence of the plaintiff showed the sources and the prices of all the crude barytes ore which the plaintiff purchased during the year 1957 to supply its needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">As to the virtually undisputed evi-dentiary facts out of which this litigation arose, the record shows: That on November 16, 1956, J. B. McKoane, the plaintiff\u2019s sales manager, called on Raymond Govero, of the Apex Mining Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>pany, about buying ore from the mine it was then operating in Washington County, Missouri, ore fields; that Mc-Koane took a sample of ore from the \u201cdrag chain\u201d while in operation, and took the ore sample to Chicago for analysis; that the sample was evidently deemed typical of the crude ore the defendants were producing; that an analysis of the sample by the plaintiff showed 94.59% of barium sulfate and 1.82% of ferric oxide; that on November '23, 1956, in the morning, the plaintiff sent the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">\u201cApex Mining Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cMineral Point, Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cAttention: Mr. Raymond Govero</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab_\">\u201cWe offer for your entire productive output washed and jigged barytes minimum 13000 tons maximum 17000 tons December 10, 1956 to December 9, 1957, $15.50 per ton F.

Also, should you suspect that the weights are incorrect you can telephone us and we will be happy to request a re-weigh by the CRI&amp;P at this end. We have no way of verifying weights ourselves and must rely solely on railroad weights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cWe also wish again to state that both by analysis and visual observation the three cars which have arrived from you so far have not been of the same quality as the sample which our Mr. McKoane brought back, and which he quoted you as having said \u2014 you believed contained as high an iron content as you have been turning out.

We request that you follow this procedure, until we are satisfied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>you are able to estimate the quality yourself or have some means of analyzing before shipment in order to be sure that no further shipment not within specifications will be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amo-dedup-1\">There was evidence by Govero that if he had complied with the request that he stockpile several carloads of ore and then take a sample, send it to the plaintiff for analysis, and wait for permission to ship, the ore would have cost three to four dollars a ton more.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">It seems clear to us that the plaintiff, instead of intending or attempting by the letter of December 14, 1956, to repudiate the contract, was trying to secure performance of it according to its terms, and to have Govero bring the quality of his ore up to the standard required by the contract. The record shows that the plaintiff in 1957 had use for all the bary-tes ore of a grade suitable for its operations which it could locate, and during that period wanted the ore for which it had contracted with the defendants, and that it was ready, willing and able to carry out its part of the bargain with them. It seems scarcely conceivable that the plaintiff, who was in the market for ore of suitable quality, would on December 8 contract for a supply of such ore at an advantageous price and then on December 14 repudiate its agreement. The letter of December 14 was, in our opinion, too weak a peg upon which to hang a repudiation of the contract. Nor do we think that the Missouri cases cited by the defendants and the trial court support a conclusion that the contract was repudiated. The cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The case of Lonsdale Grain Co. v. Canton Milling Co., 195 Mo.App. 452, 193 S.W. 853, had to do with a contract to buy and sell wheat to be delivered in August of 1914. On August 3, 1914, the buyer wired the seller asking that shipments be stopped, saying that, if shipments were made, drafts covering such shipments would not be paid. Speaking of this telegram, the Kansas City Court of Appeals said (at page 854 of 193 S.W.): \u201cIt is a flat direction to stop further shipments of the wheat, and is an announcement that, if any more shipments are made, drafts for payment will be refused.\u201d The court held that this was a repudiation of the contract on the buyer\u2019s part and that the only other question was, \u201cDid defendant [the seller] accept and treat it as a renunciation or cancellation?\u201d Under the evidence in that case, this was held to be a question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The question involved in Rexite Casting Co. v. Midwest Mower Corp., Mo.App., 267 S.W.2d 327, was whether a seller, who had agreed to manufacture and deliver aluminum castings and, in addition, permanent molds for making such castings, could recover a balance due for molds after having breached its agreement by refusing to deliver castings at the contract price. It was held that refusal to further perform the partly executed contract unless the buyer agreed to pay a substantial increase in price for castings was a total breach of the entire contract, and that the seller could not recover the balance due for molds.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Spitcaufsky v. Guignon, Mo., 321 S.W.2d 481, 487-488. Stated briefly, this case dealt with a broker\u2019s contract for a commission. The landowner, who had agreed to pay the commission if the broker accomplished certain things, added other Requirements after the broker had performed his commitments, thus allegedly depriving him of his earned commission. It was held that the landowner was liable for the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">In each of the cases relied on by the trial court, the intention of the repudiating party was clear and unequivocal. See, also, Crown Products Co. v. California Food Products Corp., 77 Cal.App.2d 543, 175 P.2d 861, 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">There was, we think, no adequate evi-dentiary basis for a ruling that the statement of the President of the plaintiff in the letter of December 14, 1956, as to his understanding of what was to be done to avoid the shipment of carloads of ore below contract grade which the plaintiff did not want and could not use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>constituted a positive refusal to accept or to pay for ore which did measure up to the contract requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Moreover, it seems obvious to us that neither the plaintiff nor the defendants treated the contract as having been repudiated by the letter of December 14. On January 3, 1957, the President of the plaintiff wrote Govero as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cApex Mining Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cBox 318,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">\u201cMineral Point, Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cAttention: Mr. Raymond Govero,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASb-\">\u201cPresident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201cDear Mr. Govero:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201cAs it has now been about three weeks since we have heard from you in connection with ore shipments under our contract, we ask that you advise us at your early convenience as to what progress you are making toward shipping us material in accordance with the specifications called for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">\u201cPresident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">\u201cW.

The judgment on the counterclaim has not been challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-23\">The plaintiff asks this Court to reverse the judgment dismissing its complaint'. It also asks for the entry of a judgment in its favor against the defendants for $101,529.97. The question of the amount of damages is an undetermined issue of fact for the trial court. That is also true of the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Govero is properly a defendant who can be held liable. See Rosen v. Westinghouse Electric Supply Co., 8 Cir., 261 F.2d 514, 515. See, also: Cleo Syrup Corp. v. Coca-Cola Co., 8 Cir., 139 F.2d 416, 417, 150 A.L.R. 1056; Pendergrass v. New York Life Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 181 F.2d 136,137-138; United States v. First Sec. Bank of Utah, N.A., 10 Cir., 208 F.2d 424, 429, 42 A.L.R.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">It is our conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to a reversal of the judgment dismissing its complaint and to a remand of the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
