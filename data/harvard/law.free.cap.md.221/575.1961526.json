All of the questions raised were properly decided by the court below, and all were amply considered except the one that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">He claims that the \u201cPolice of Baltimore Police Department\u201d told him that they \u201cwould see that petitioner would be given leniency if he plead guilty * * * at the time of trial.\u201d In <em>Hamilton v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 633, Judge Henderson, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the Court, said that whether such a question could be raised on <em>habeas corpus </em>was not free from doubt, but the circumstances of that case, where the Police Officer was named, and his alleged promise to recommend a suspended sentence specifically set out with an allegation that the Officer failed to carry out his promise, justified an inquiry into the truth or falsity of the allegation. In the instant case, we have nothing except a bald allegation that the police officers of Baltimore City would see that he was \u201cgiven leniency.\u201d He fails to name any officer or officers or to state what they said to him. Just what the terms \u201cgiven leniency\u201d would mean in any particular case would be difficult to determine, as it would probably be largely a matter of opinion. In any event, it is certain that Edwards\u2019 allegation is not sufficiently specific to raise a substantial question of unfair ness, which should be inquired into. <em>Dobson v. </em>Warden, 220 Md. 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">For the above reasons and those set out in the opinion of the trial judge the application will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
