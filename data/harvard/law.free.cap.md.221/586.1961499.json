As to (1) and (2) we have repeatedly held that the sufficiency or weight of evidence cannot be raised in such a proceeding as this. As to (3), the applicant was represented by counsel, and it is clear that failure to advise as to a right of appeal is not equivalent to a denial of the right. See <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>217 Md. 662; <em>Cooper v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 629, 632; <em>Finley v. Warden, </em>211 Md. 650, 652. As to (4), the bald allegation of perjury does not call for relief under the Act. <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
