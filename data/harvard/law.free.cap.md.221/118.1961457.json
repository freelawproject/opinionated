The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>defendant appeared in court without counsel, and was tried on the same day that <em>Hill v. State, infra, </em>was decided by this Court. The record fails affirmatively to show a compliance with Rule 723 b and c; consequently, under the authority of <em>Hill v. State, </em>218 Md. 120, <em>Bryant v. State, </em>218 Md. 151, and <em>Williams v. State, </em>220 Md. 180, the judgments and sentences must be reversed. With this ruling in his favor, we deem it unnecessary to consider the other points raised in the appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed, and cases remanded for a new trial, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
