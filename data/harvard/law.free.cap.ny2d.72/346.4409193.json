III. The Sheriffs are immediately affected by the failure of the Division of Parole to promptly process alleged parole violators, and therefore have legal standing to challenge the timeliness of parole revocation procedures. <em>(Marcus v Village of Mamaroneck, </em>283 NY 325; <em>Board of Educ. v Gootnick, </em>49 NY2d 683; <em>Matter of Vergari v Ward, </em>88 Misc 2d 911; <em>Police Conference v Municipal Police Training Council, </em>62 AD2d 416.)

The order of the court below should be affirmed because, consistent with respondent Coughlin\u2019s duty to accept custody \"forthwith\u201d, the structure of New York\u2019s correctional custody system, and a proper weighing of the circumstances in and responsive actions by the State and local correctional systems, respondent Coughlin cannot be compelled to accept custody of \"State-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ready\u201d inmates and \"return parole violators\u201d on a State-wide basis within 10 days of notification that they are ready for transfer. <em>(Crespo v Hall, </em>56 NY2d 856; <em>County of Onondaga v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>97 AD2d 957, 62 NY2d 826; <em>Benjamin v Malcolm, </em>629 F Supp 713, 803 F2d 46; <em>Matter of Adams v Meloni, </em>63 NY2d 868; <em>Howell v McGinity, </em>129 AD2d 60, 70 NY2d 607; <em>Eaton v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>56 NY2d 340; <em>Oneida Sav.

The order of the court below reversing the injunction barring the Commission from enforcing its minimum standards regulations should be affirmed as that injunction was based on a nonjusticiable claim and would have increased the likelihood of the very harm meant to be prevented by those regulations. <em>(Town of Brookhaven v Chun Enters., </em>71 NY2d 953; <em>McNulty v Chinlund, </em>62 AD2d 682; <em>Matter of New York State Inspection, Sec. &amp; Law Enforcement Employees v Cuomo, </em>64 NY2d 233; <em>Klostermann v Cuomo, </em>61 NY2d 525; <em>Howell v McGinity, </em>129 AD2d 60; <em>Powlowski v Wullich, 102 </em>AD2d 575.) IV. The courts below correctly determined that the Sheriffs lack standing to challenge the timeliness of parole revocation hearings conducted by the division. <em>(County of Nassau v Cuomo, </em>69 NY2d 737; <em>Matter of Dairylea Coop. v Walkley, </em>38 NY2d 6; <em>Matter of Oil Heat Inst. v Public Serv.

This appeal focuses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>point when the State must accept State prisoners from county jails. In a situation where State and county correction officials each claim dangerous overcrowding at their facilities, the point when inmates must be accepted into State custody\u2014 already the subject of extensive litigation \u2014 obviously has great practical importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The legal issue centers on CPL 430.20 (1), which directs \u2014with apparent simplicity \u2014 that \"[w]hen a sentence of imprisonment is pronounced * * * the defendant must forthwith be committed to the custody of the appropriate public servant and detained until the sentence is complied with.\u201d What is the meaning of the statutory term \"forthwith?\u201d We conclude that the State\u2019s responsibility under the statute is to accept <em>without delay </em>inmates in local facilities who have been committed to the custody of the State Department of Correctional Services <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.20). While there may be some limited flexibility in CPL 430.20 (1), the statute does not vest discretion in the State to delay accepting State-ready inmates on the basis of relative overcrowding at State and local facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This article 78 proceeding is brought by 49 of the State\u2019s 58 county Sheriffs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who are responsible for the custody of prisoners committed to the county jails, seeking essentially to compel respondent Commissioner of the State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) to accept within 48 hours all State-ready prisoners and to timely process all alleged parole violators; petitioners also ask that, until these steps are taken, the State Commission of Correction (separately named as respondents) should be restrained from enforcing \"minimum standards\u201d regulations for the operation of the county jails.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Petitioners contend that, owing to State prison overcrowding, DOCS as a matter of policy has delayed accepting inmates from county jails, sometimes for six months or more, unless otherwise judicially ordered <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Dooley v Coughlin, </em>72 NY2d 984 [decided today]; <em>County of Nassau v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Cuomo, </em>69 NY2d 737; <em>Matter of County of Monroe v Cuomo, </em>132 AD2d 1003, <em>lv denied 70 </em>NY2d 608; <em>Jackson v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>NYLJ, Sept. 28, 1988, at 24, col 2; <em>Matter of Higgins v New York Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>Sup Ct, Erie County, [Kane, J.]; <em>Matter of County of Monroe v Cuomo, </em>123 AD2d 141, <em>lv denied </em>69 NY2d 612; <em>Benjamin v Malcolm, </em>803 F2d 46, <em>cert denied sub nom. Cuomo v Koehler, </em>480 US 910). The Sheriffs urge that failure to accept defendants and parole violators promptly, as directed by statute, has resulted in overcrowding of county jails, threatening the health, welfare and safety of petitioners, their staffs, the inmates and the community. Petitioners additionally contend that another State official, respondent Chief Executive Officer of the State Division of Parole, routinely and unreasonably delays parole revocation proceedings beyond the statutory periods <em>(see, </em>Executive Law \u00a7 259-i), with the result that alleged parole violators languish in county jails for months before their status is adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">While denying petitioners\u2019 statistics and other allegations of the petition, respondent DOCS Commissioner does not dispute the underlying proposition that relative conditions at detention facilities are considered in determining when to accept inmates into State custody. Indeed, he contends that it is entirely appropriate under CPL 430.20 (1), as well as Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 70 (2), 137 and 504 (1) relating to safe, healthy and humane confinement, to weigh crowding in the respective facilities as well as the options available to the county officials to increase the capacity of local jails; he maintains that these are necessary components of the statutory term \"forthwith.\u201d Respondents additionally advance several defenses in their response to the petition, including the Sheriffs\u2019 lack of standing to challenge the timeliness of parole revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Supreme Court ordered that DOCS must accept inmates, including adjudicated parole violators, within 10 days after notification of State-readiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Exigent circumstances \u2014 not including delay occasioned by overcrowded conditions in State facilities \u2014 might justify a further limited delay in the transfer of custody. The court went on to determine that it was fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and appropriate to restrain the Commission of Correction from enforcing its \"minimum standards\u201d regulations where a county facility\u2019s overpopulation was due to the presence of State-ready inmates and return parole violators after the 10-day transfer period had elapsed; it dismissed petitioners\u2019 cause of action against the Division of Parole, on account of lack of standing, and it dismissed their claim for damages as well as respondents\u2019 counterclaim. A divided Appellate Division modified Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in two respects. First, the court concluded that Supreme Court lacked authority to order that DOCS must accept prisoners within 10 days after notification of State-readiness, holding instead that the judiciary may define the term \"forthwith\u201d as a specific time period only where such relief is necessary on a case-by-case basis. Second, the Appellate Division concluded that it was inappropriate to restrain enforcement of the \"minimum standards\u201d regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We now modify the Appellate Division order, reinstating the judgment of Supreme Court as to the meaning of \"forthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The modern-day prison overcrowding crisis has suddenly focused attention on the statutory term \"forthwith,\u201d a word which has been in the English language for centuries and in CPL 430.20 (1) and its predecessor since at least 1881, without significant controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Three times recently we have considered the term. In <em>Crespo v Hall </em>(56 NY2d 856), we concluded that the relevant statutes permitted no discretion as to when juvenile offenders had to be accepted for transfer by the State Division for Youth (DFY), and that \"forthwith\u201d means without delay and cannot be read to permit transfer of juveniles whenever DFY deems it prudent. We left undisturbed a 10-day limit for transfer, there having been no showing that this period was inadequate for routine processing or otherwise unreasonable, and we further noted that the limit should yield in particular cases of demonstrated need. Similarly, in <em>County of Nassau v Cuomo </em>(69 NY2d 737, <em>supra), </em>this court affirmed the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusions that \"forthwith\u201d in CPL 430.20 (1) means without delay and cannot be read to permit transfer to the custody of State officials only when they deem it prudent or appropriate. Again the court concluded that a 14-day period did not appear to be either inadequate for routine processing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>or otherwise unreasonable, leaving open the possibility for flexibility in particular cases of demonstrated need <em>(cf., Matter of County of Onondaga v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>62 NY2d 826). Those same principles guide our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">We reiterate that the statutory mandate to commit individuals to the officials responsible for their custody \u201cforthwith\u201d means that it is to be done <em>without delay, at once, promptly. </em>\"Forthwith\u201d signals immediacy. It was in fact the very word used in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1881 sections antedating CPL 430.20 (1). Those sections provided that when a judgment is pronounced a certified copy of entry must \u201cforthwith\u201d be furnished to the officer whose duty it is to execute the judgment; if a judgment of imprisonment, the defendant must \"forthwith\u201d be committed to the custody of the proper officer, and detained by him until compliance with the judgment (Code Grim Pro \u00a7\u00a7 486, 487). The use of \u201cforthwith\u201d in those provisions, as in CPL 430.20 (1) \u2014 every one of them directory, none of them discretionary \u2014 leaves no doubt that their mandates were to be accomplished with dispatch. Thus, we conclude that State-ready inmates (including adjudicated parole violators) committed to State custody must be accepted by respondent Commissioner without delay, it being the statutory responsibility of the State to provide for their detention until their sentence is carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">While the Legislature made clear its intention that commitment to the custody of the appropriate public servant should take place without delay, its choice of \u201cforthwith\u201d rather than the specification of a hard-and-fast number of days left certain limited flexibility in implementing its mandate. But any such flexibility in \"forthwith\u201d simply cannot accommodate the Commissioner\u2019s view that the statute vests discretion in DOCS to accept defendants from county jails when it deems it prudent or appropriate to do so <em>(see, County of Nassau v Cuomo, </em>69 NY2d 737, <em>supra; Crespo v Hall, </em>56 NY2d 856, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Respondent Commissioner urges that the issue can be resolved only after a court analyzes the circumstances in each locality, determines which facilities are overcrowded and what steps are being taken to alleviate overcrowding, and \"prioritizes\u201d the allocation of space in State correctional facilities, dependent in part on a locality\u2019s effort to alleviate overcrowding. Such a construction, however, ignores the fact that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the State\u2019s statutory responsibility to house these inmates and it ignores the plain direction of CPL 430.20 (1) that they are to be committed to appropriate custody without delay. The Legislature did not provide for transfer to State custody in the Commissioner\u2019s discretion, upon his conclusion that State facilities were safe, healthy and humane, and inmates classified according to their needs; it said \"forthwith.\u201d Any limited flexibility in \"forthwith\u201d obviously must be reserved for exigent circumstances in particular cases, not for evaluation of relative capacity of State and local detention facilities that would in effect reallocate a portion of the State\u2019s responsibility to the localities. The Commissioner\u2019s construction robs the legislative direction \"forthwith\u201d of any force.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The Legislature specified no hard-and-fast number of days in enacting CPL 430.20 (1); nor do we in construing it. We conclude that Supreme Court\u2019s order that transfer be accomplished within the 10 days of State-readiness comports with the mandate of CPL 430.20 (1). While \"forthwith\u201d has been held to mean as little as 48 hours <em>(Benjamin v Malcolm, </em>629 F Supp 713, <em>affd </em>803 F2d 46, <em>cert denied sub nom. Cuomo v Koehler, </em>480 US 910, <em>supra), </em>here Supreme Court\u2014 exercising discretion appropriate to the judiciary in applying this statute \u2014 concluded that the term could also accommodate respondent Commissioner\u2019s representation to the court that DOCS\u2019 \"logistic needs require that the Department plan for the receipt of new inmates ten days in advance.\u201d There was no abuse of discretion in Supreme Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Commissioner\u2019s argument, in the end, is a plea to the courts to redistribute responsibility for housing the State\u2019s vastly expanded prison population, placing a greater burden on the localities, who (he alleges) have \u2014 relative to the State\u2014 failed to meet increased needs by enlarging their facilities. Such a plea for change in the law is appropriately directed to the legislative and executive branches of government, not to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Both the trial court and the Appellate Division correctly determined that petitioner Sheriffs lack standing to challenge the alleged failure on the part of the Division of Parole to schedule timely parole revocation procedures under Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Law \u00a7 259-i (3). Those statutory procedures were plainly designed for the protection of the parolees, and are enforceable by them; they give the Sheriffs no role in the scheduling or conduct of the hearings <em>(see, Matter of Sun-Brite Car Wash v Board of Zoning &amp; Appeals, </em>69 NY2d 406, 414). And while petitioner Sheriffs urge that they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy of an injunction to halt enforcement of \"minimum standards\u201d regulations promulgated by respondent Commission of Correction <em>(see, </em>9 NYCRR part 7040) to the extent that overcrowding of their facilities is caused by DOCS\u2019 failure to act timely in accepting prisoners, they acknowledge that such an injunction would \"never apply\u201d if DOCS accepted prisoners committed to its custody within 10 days of State-readiness. In that this relief is ordered today, we conclude there is no need to consider whether an injunction would otherwise be appropriate or necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs, by reinstating the judgment of Supreme Court, Albany County, with respect to the meaning of \"forthwith\u201d in CPL 430.20 (1), and otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Order modified, with costs to appellants, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. Petitioners\u2019 request for class action certification was denied and is not before us. Respondents\u2019 request for dismissal for failure to join all other officials responsible for operations of local facilities as \"necessary parties\u201d (CPLR 1001 [b] [2], [5]) was correctly denied on the ground that adequate relief can be granted without their joinder. Respondents\u2019 contention that in order for a court to determine the meaning of \"forthwith\u201d it must \"do a comparative analysis of particular circumstances in each locality and determine which localities are overcrowded and what efforts those localities have taken to alleviate overcrowding\u201d is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">. Petitioners sought to compel timely acceptance of \"State-ready\u201d prisoners and adjudicated parole violators, which is the relief that was ordered by Supreme Court. There was no dispute between the parties as to the requirement of State-readiness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
