It is the common practice in city government that when city departments or members of a city body need a judicial resolution of their disputes on controlling law, the Corporation Counsel takes one side and the view of the other side is advanced by private counsel at city expense. <em>(Michael v Bellamy, </em>80 AD2d 147, 57 NY2d 603; <em>Golden v Koch, </em>49 NY2d 690; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 535; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. v Goldin, </em>94 Misc 2d 574, 72 AD2d 603, 49 NY2d 705; <em>Chance v Board of Examiners &amp; Board of Educ., </em>534 F2d 993, <em>cert denied sub nom.

Individual trustees of New York City Public Employee Pension Funds may not be reimbursed for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by them for suits instituted by them without pension board approval and against the advice of the Corporation Counsel. New York City Charter \u00a7 394 invests the Corporation Counsel with \"charge and conduct\u201d of all the law business of the City and section 395 prohibits the retention of outside counsel, with statutory and judicially created exceptions not applicable here. Since the individual union trustees, in contravention of the advice of the Corporation Counsel and without seeking Board approval, instituted this action, they were acting on their own, regardless of their capacity as union trustees or union officials. Therefore, the Funds\u2019 motion to dismiss the instant action for attorneys\u2019 fees was properly granted. <em>(Doyle v Allstate Ins.

The unique structure of the Police Pension Fund and statutory restrictions on the powers of its trustees limit the applicability of analogies to private trusts. While the Board and its component members are bound to act in a fiduciary manner, the means for fulfilling their fiduciary duties are prescribed in and proscribed by the \"terms of the trust\u201d. Disputes concerning interpretation of pension statutes and their application to specific facts have traditionally been resolved in the courts in challenges brought by individual applicants or unions. <em>(Matter of McCambridge v McGuire, </em>62 NY2d 563; <em>Matter of Lichtenstein v Board of Trustees, </em>57 NY2d 1010; <em>Matter of Tobin v Steisel, </em>64 NY2d 254; <em>Matter of Canfora v Board of Trustees, </em>90 AD2d 751, 60 NY2d 347; <em>Goldman v McGuire, </em>101 AD2d 768, 64 NY2d 1041; <em>Matter of Mahoney v McGuire, </em>107 AD2d 363, 66 NY2d 622; <em>Matter of Mondello v Beekman, </em>78 AD2d 824, 56 NY2d 513; <em>Matter of Lowcher v New York City Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>54 NY2d 373; <em>Matter of Rapp v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>42 NY2d 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-5\"><em>William Josephson, Sheldon Raab </em>and <em>Beverly Ross Campbell </em>for Stanley Hill, <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF2\">I. Plaintiffs-appellants, as trustees of an express trust, have standing and the right to retain and compensate counsel. <em>(Velez v Feinstein, </em>87 AD2d 309; <em>Central States Pension Fund v Central Transp., </em>472 US 559; <em>NLRB v Amax Coal Co., </em>453 US 322; <em>Savings Bank v New York Trust Co., </em>27 NY2d 963; <em>Withers v Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>447 F Supp 1248, 595 F2d 1210; <em>Matter of City of New York v Retirement Bd. of Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>116 Misc 2d 496; <em>Blankenship v Boyle, </em>329 F Supp 1089; <em>Sgaglione v Levitt, </em>37 NY2d 507; <em>New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys. v Eliot, </em>267 NY 193; <em>Parker v Rogerson, </em>49 AD2d 689; <em>Matter of Garland, </em>159 Misc 333.) II. Plaintiffs-appellants were entitled to retain and compensate independent counsel notwithstanding New York City Charter \u00a7\u00a7 394 and 395 because the Code of Professional Responsibility precluded the New York City Corporation Counsel from representing the Police Pension Fund trustees in this dispute. <em>(Rosen v Hotel &amp; Rest.

II. The effect of the decision of the court below is to prevent the union trustees from effectively performing their duties as trustees. <em>(Michael v Bellamy, </em>80 AD2d 147, 57 NY2d 603.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b628-7\">Hancock, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In this action to recover legal expenses, the question presented is whether individual trustees of the New York City Police Department Pension Funds (the Fund) may, at cost to the Fund, employ outside counsel to institute a lawsuit against other such trustees to resolve a disagreement over the proper construction of a statute governing eligibility for accident disability pension benefits. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Appellate Division that, under the circumstances of this case, the individual trustees had no such authority and are, therefore, not entitled to reimbursement for the expenses they incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The Board of Trustees of the Fund has 12 members. Eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>are police union officials with weighted votes totaling six; four are City of New York officials having the same collective voting strength (Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 13-216 [a]). The Board reviews applications for disability pension benefits, a majority vote of seven being required for a resolution of approval (\u00a7 13-216 [b]). When an application claiming accident disability is reviewed, a 6-6 tie vote of the Board results in a denial and the applicant is granted only ordinary disability benefits (\u00a7 13-216 [b]; <em>see, Matter of Canfora v Board of Trustees, </em>60 NY2d 347, 352). The lawsuits underlying this appeal arose from a deadlock within the Board over claims of accident disability from heart disease. On one side were the union officials; on the other were those of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The disagreement between the two sides centered on the proper interpretation of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k, commonly known as the \"Heart Bill\u201d. The statute makes special provision for policemen who, having no history of heart disease prior to employment with the City, subsequently develop \"any condition of impairment of health caused by diseases of the heart, resulting in total or partial disability or death\u201d. Under the terms of the \"Heart Bill\u201d, such policemen shall be presumed to have incurred their heart disease \"in the performance and discharge of duty, unless the contrary be proved by competent evidence\u201d. In 1979, the Corporation Counsel issued an opinion that the rebuttable presumption thus created by the statute applied only to the question whether a cardiac disability was job-related, not to whether the disability was the result of an \"accident\u201d \u2014 i.e., the result of a particular, sudden, and unexpected event <em>(see, Matter of Knight v McGuire, </em>62 NY2d 563; <em>Matter of Lichtenstein v Board of Trustees, </em>57 NY2d 1010). According to his opinion, the burden of proof on that latter question remained with the applicant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Not surprisingly, the City officials on the Board adopted that interpretation of the \"Heart Bill\u201d while the union officials strongly disagreed. The latter took the position that an applicant disabled by heart disease is entitled to accident benefits without having affirmatively to establish a sudden and unexpected event. The disagreement between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sides resulted in repeated tie votes on cardiac disability claims and the consequent denial of accident disability benefits. Within a short time, the eight union officials retained private counsel to represent them in various proceedings in which they challenged the City officials\u2019 interpretation of the \"Heart Bill\u201d and negative voting on accident disability applications. Ultimately, when the action for declaratory judgment reached this court, we sustained the union officials\u2019 interpretation of the statute <em>(see, Matter of De Milia v McGuire, </em>52 NY2d 463).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Following our decision in <em>De Milia, </em>the union officials sought reimbursement from the Fund for expenses incurred in that litigation, as well as in the several related proceedings. When the Fund refused, the union officials commenced the instant action. Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss reasoning that, because the union officials could not be represented by the Corporation Counsel whose opinion they were contesting, they had no choice but to retain private counsel (122 Misc 2d 576). Subsequently, Supreme Court granted the union officials\u2019 motion for summary judgment and awarded them the full amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees requested. On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed the orders of Supreme Court and dismissed the complaint. In a thorough opinion, that court concluded that the union officials had neither express authority to retain private counsel nor authority inherent in their duties as trustees (136 AD2d 266). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Disagreement among members of the Board of Trustees does not justify the retention of private counsel by those who take issue with the others\u2019 votes and with the legal advice of the Corporation Counsel upon which those others rely. While each member of the Board of Trustees acts in a fiduciary capacity in the administration of the Fund, the authority of the Board and its individual members is determined by the statutory structure establishing that Fund and defining the Board\u2019s function <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 13-216 [a], [b]). The statutory provisions creating the Fund <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code \u00a7\u00a7 13-201 \u2014 13-287) are, in effect, the \"terms of the trust\u201d which confer and limit the powers of the Board and of each member trustee <em>(see, </em>3 Scott, Trusts \u00a7 186 [3d ed]). Those terms require that the Fund be \"administered by [the] <em>board </em>of trustees\u201d and that such administration be \"subject to the provisions of law\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 13-216 [a] [emphasis added]). They also mandate that <em>'fejvery act </em>of the board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>trustees shall be <em>by resolution\u201d </em>(\u00a7 13-216 [b] [emphasis added]),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and they prohibit trustees from using Fund moneys <em>\"in any manner </em>* * * except to make such current and necessary payments as are <em>authorized by [the BJoard\u201d </em>(\u00a7 13-238 [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the New York City Charter, which governs every board and officer of the City, states that the Corporation Counsel shall have exclusive responsibility for \"the law business of the city and its agencies\u201d and it unequivocally prohibits City officers and agencies from \"employing] any attorney or counsel\u201d except at their own expense in a matter which \"may affect him or them individually\u201d (NY City Charter \u00a7 394 [a]; \u00a7 395).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plain language of these governing statutes provides individual members of the Board of Trustees with no authority to retain their own counsel \u2014 and, thereafter, to obtain recompense from the Fund \u2014 where neither the Corporation Counsel nor the Board, by majority resolution, has given approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">To be sure, as the union officials point out, the Corporation Counsel could not represent both them and the City officials in the underlying litigation; nor could he have reasonably represented the union officials alone inasmuch as they were challenging his ruling. Nevertheless, they cannot rely on these circumstances to claim necessity \u2014 and, therefore, implied authority \u2014 to retain private counsel to fulfill their lawful duties. The statutes which created and govern the Fund and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Board are simply devoid of any provision imposing a duty upon individual trustees to challenge either the votes of other trustees or the legal opinion of the Corporation Counsel, their attorney under the City Charter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A fortiori, there is no provision granting individual trustees authority to hire outside counsel to assist them in doing so. Hence, where, as here, there is a disagreement among the trustees in the ordinary and proper course of the Board\u2019s activities \u2014 i.e., over the construction of a statute governing the review of accident disability claims \u2014 retention of private counsel by individual trustees is ultra vires under their statutorily defined role on the Board and, therefore, not compensable by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Strong policy reasons support this conclusion. Administration of the police pension funds is highly regulated; the detailed statutory scheme under which the Board of Trustees operates insures a balance between the interests of the City, represented by its officials, and the interests of employees, represented by members of the union. Each side has the same total number of weighted votes and each resolution before the Board must obtain a majority for approval. Thus, because the Board can only act by such resolution, the affirmative vote of at least one trustee from each side is necessary for the Board to do anything. To permit the trustees on one side to prosecute claims against the others, on routine matters of differing opinion and subject to voting, would disturb that balance and subvert the purpose for requiring majority resolutions. Further, it would encourage such litigation by dissenting trustees over decisions rendered by the Board as a whole \u2014 whether denying or granting pension benefits \u2014 with the consequent depletion of the Fund to pay for those trustees\u2019 private attorneys\u2019 fees <em>(cf., Corning v Village of Laurel Hollow, </em>48 NY2d 348, 351-352).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Finally, the cases relied upon by the union <em>officials </em>\u2014 Cahn <em>v Town of Huntington </em>(29 NY2d 451), <em>Matter of Commco, Inc. v Amelkin </em>(62 NY2d 260) and <em>Matter of Slominski v Rutkowski </em>(62 NY2d 781) \u2014 are inapposite. Whether, under the decisions in those cases, there might be exceptional circumstances where individual trustees, like those here, could ever retain private counsel, we need not decide. No such circumstances are presented here. This is not a case like <em>Cahn, </em>where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>town planning board, acting in its statutorily defined capacity as a board, made an official decision to retain private counsel. Here, the decision to retain counsel was not by resolution of the Board acting in its official capacity, but by individual members acting on their own without any official sanction. Moreover, in <em>Cahn, </em>the planning board was defending itself in a proceeding instituted against it by the town; because the Town Attorney was representing the town, it was essential for the board to obtain the services of a private attorney. As we said in that case, the retention of outside counsel was necessary \"to enable the board to effect the purposes of its creation and to allow it to properly function\u201d <em>(Cahn v Town of Huntington, supra, </em>at 455). Here, by sharp contrast, the Board was receiving advice from its lawful attorney, the Corporation Counsel, and was fully able to serve its statutory purpose. Though the Board\u2019s decisions on certain cardiac disability applications were ultimately held to be erroneous, it cannot be said that the Board was not \"properly functioning]\u201d \u2014 i.e., applications for accident disability were being reviewed, votes were being taken, and decisions were being rendered in the manner prescribed by the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Neither is the situation here comparable to that in <em>Commco, </em>where we upheld the retention of private counsel by a zoning board, even though the municipal attorney was, by statute, the exclusive legal representative of all municipal agencies. There, a conflict of interests arose between the board and the municipality itself and, as a result, the municipal attorney was precluded from representing the board in a proceeding brought by a dissatisfied applicant. In order to fulfill its statutory responsibilities, the board, we held, had implied authority under <em>Cahn </em>to retain its own counsel in order to defend itself. In the present case, however, the Corporation Counsel could and did represent the Board of Trustees in the underlying litigation, and the Board\u2019s decisions were challenged, not externally by a dissatisfied applicant as in <em>Commco, </em>but internally by individual Board members who had neither statutory responsibility nor authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Lastly, this case is not analogous to <em>Slominski. </em>There, the underlying dispute was between two high level municipal officers over competing claims of official authority. Because the municipal attorney represented the county executive, the comptroller retained private counsel. This court agreed with the Appellate Division that, under the circumstances of that case, the comptroller should be reimbursed for attorneys\u2019 fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The litigation there did not simply involve an \"internal dispute between lower echelon officials\u201d and, moreover, the comptroller had unquestioned authority to bring the proceeding in her official capacity <em>(Matter of Slominski v Rutkowski, </em>91 AD2d 202, 212, <em>affd as mod in other respects </em>62 NY2d 781, <em>supra). </em>Here, however, the underlying litigation for which the union officials seek to recover legal expenses did merely entail, as they themselves have described it, an internal dispute between individual trustees, over decisions rendered collectively as members of a single governmental entity, the Board of Trustees. Also, in contrast to the comptroller in <em>Slominski, </em>the union officials here were not seeking to resolve a dispute about their own legitimate authority; they did not, therefore, have any such compelling official need to bring the underlying lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. The opinions of Corporation Counsel have varied on this point. In August 1973, the \"Heart Bill\u201d presumption was interpreted, as in 1979, as applying only to whether the disability was line of duty and not to whether it was an accident. In November of that same year, however, Corporation Counsel reversed itself and interpreted the presumption as applying to both questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">. Section 13-216 (b) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York provides: \"Every act of the board of trustees shall be by resolution which shall be adopted only by a vote of at least seven-twelfths of the whole number of votes authorized to be cast by all of the members of such board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. Section 13-238 of the Code provides, in pertinent part: \"The trustees and such employees, directly or indirectly, for themselves or as agents or partners of others, shall not borrow any of its funds or deposits or in any manner use the same except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by such board\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">. Section 394 (a) of the Charter provides: \"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or other law, the corporation counsel shall be attorney and counsel for the city and every agency thereof and shall have charge and conduct of all the law business of the city and its agencies and in which the city is interested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Section 395 of the Charter provides, in pertinent part: \"No officer or agency, except as provided in this chapter or otherwise especially provided, shall have or employ any attorney or counsel, except where a judgment or order in an action or proceeding may affect him or them individually or may be followed by a motion to commit for contempt of court, in which case he or they may employ and be represented by attorney or counsel at his own or their own expense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. This is not to say, of course, that these same trustees were without standing to initiate litigation to challenge Board actions in -their capacities as union representatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
