Irrelevant but Immaterial Testimony.\u2014The plaintiff in a suit for damages for personal injuries suffered through the negligence of a railway company for which he was working was permitted to testify that his superior at time of the injury was subsequently killed on the railroad of defendant; another witness who was called for -defendant testified to the same fact. <em>Held, </em>that the testimony of the plaintiff complained of was not to the effect that <em>the boss </em>had been negligently killed, for which reason and that the manner of the death was proved by a witness for defendant the testimony was immaterial and no cause for reversal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b343-13\">2.

And unless the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>are satisfied from a preponderance of evidence that there are other and more suitable- and safe implements in use by railroads as fenders between engines or cars being moved about their yards or workshops than that of the character of the fender used in this case the plaintiff can not recover.\u201d The court had already charged that \u201cit was the duty of defendant to use due care in the protection of its employes, and that they on the other hand assumed the ordinary risks incident to their employment.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the instruction asked was misleading and it ignored the duty of the employer to warn the inexperienced of danger in the work, wherefore the court below properly refused it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b344-5\">6.

When a verdict is rendered in a case in which each party has established his case by evidence, and the verdict if the case were properly tried could not under established rules be disturbed, no matter for which party it is rendered, the necessity for guarding against illegal testimony is manifest. Then the slightest illegal testimony which'might possibly have influenced the verdict will be fatal, and afford cause for a reversal of the judgment. Ross v. Kornrumpf, 64 Texas, 390; G. C. &amp; S.

The court erred in refusing the special charge asked by the defendant instructing the jury that they must be satisfied from a preponderance of evidence that the implement or appliance furnished to the plaintiff as a fender to work with, and through which his injury occurred, was not a suitable and proper implement, and that plaintiff did not know the same was unsafe and unsuitable, and by reasonable care, observation, and inspection said plaintiff could not have known that it was unsafe and unsuitable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">\u201cTo entitle the plaintiff to recover he must have used ordinary care to have prevented the injury, that is that degree of watchfulness and precaution which persons of ordinary care and prudence would naturally and reasonably use under similar circumstances of danger.\" H. <em>&amp; </em>T.

The court correctly refused the charge made the subject of the sixth assignment, the question being not so much as to the suitableness of the implement to the use to which it was put, but as to whether it was prudent to prevent the engines from colliding by the use of the implement in question, and whether the implement was used in this instance in a proper manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The charge was correctly refused because it had been substantially embodied in the general charge of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">The charge includes propositions which are not law when applied to the facts of this case, and would have misled the jury as to the important question at issue.

As to the amount of damages, this court has always been chary of disturbing the judgment of a jury upon this matter.

He was under the direction and control of the master mechanic of the appellant, Sutcliffe. On the 1st day of December, 1881, he was ordered by Sutcliffe to assist in getting locomotive Ho. 24 into the round house, which was to he accomplished by engine Ho. 2 drawing it by means of a chain attached to 24 for that purpose. After placing Ho. 24 on false tracks Ho. 2 was hacked up to within a few feet of 24 and connected with the latter by the chain. Sutcliffe then directed appellee to get a block and get on Ho. 2 and \u201cblock her.\u201d Ajspellee got on the rear of Ho. 2, and a fellow workman, one Carlin, handed him a piece of a railroad tie for that purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>about four feet long and three or four inches in width. This appellee placed, one end of, on the chain in front of the draw head of Mo. <em>2 </em>and between the two engines, and asked Sutcliffe \u201cIf that would do?\u201d Sutcliffe looked at it and replied, \u201cTes, that will do,\u201d and got on the end of the tender on the other side from appellee and signaled with his hand to the engineer of Mo. <em>2 </em>to \u201cgo ahead\u201d (appellee holding the piece of timber in the vertical position described with his right hand and holding on to the top of the tender with his left hand). Mo. <em>2 </em>went ahead, drawing-in the manner mentioned Mo. 24. Some one called out \u201cStop her,\u201d arid Sutcliffe also signaled to \u201cStop her,\u201d and at the same time directed appellee to \u201c block her,\u201d which order he obeyed. Mo. 2 stopped, but Mo. '24 not having recovered from the momentum received continued to advance, and its \u201c deck plate being several inches higher than the draw .head of Mo. 2 struck the piece of timber held by appellee above the draw head, forcing the timber against his thigh and crushing it by forcing him ;against the tender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The difference between the height of the deck plate of Mo. 24 and the \u25a0draw head of Mo. 2 was not visible to appellee from the point where he was standing. Appellee \u201cdid not know the danger,\u201d he testified, \u201cand was inexperienced in that class of work.\u201d The timber used by him was dangerous, because placed between engines at a place where one was higher than the other. He did not refuse to obey the order because he did not know the danger, and he was ordered by the master mechanic to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The errors assigned relate to the admission of evidence, the charges given, and those refused, and to an excessive verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">It appears that the appellee in testifying had stated that Wm. Carlin, the shop foreman, had pointed out Sutcliffe to him as the new master mechanic, and that Carlin was also assisting in and about the particular work out of which the injuries to appellee grew; that he had handed the latter the piece of timber to block the engine with, and had also stated that Carlin was dead. He was then asked: \u201c When, where, and how he died?\u201d . To which the appellant\u2019s counsel objected because it was improper and irrelevant. The witness was permitted to answer that \u201cCarlin was killed about four months after my injury on the railroad of the defendant company.\u201d This is assigned as error, and it is argued that \u201c it was intended to show other accidents or negligence on the part of the defendant,\u201d and that the legitimate scope of inquiry was attained when his death was proven without objection. The objection then would seem to be that the <em>manner </em>of Carlin\u2019s death was shown by this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">But an examination of the answer of the witness does not support this \u25a0objection. The answer does not preclude the conclusion that Carlin\u2019s \u25a0death may have resulted from many causes having no connection with or relation to the acts of the appellant, nor does it necessarily imply that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the negligence of the company was in the remotest degree instrumental in causing his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">It is disclosed by the testimony of a witness for the appellant, one Windisch, who testified by deposition, that \u201c Carlin was killed by the overturning of an engine of the company this side of Banquette Station some time about the beginning of the month of April, 1883.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Without this evidence of the defendant\u2019s witness it is not absolutely certain from the answer objected to whether Carlin\u2019s death or the plaintiff\u2019s injury is referred to as occurring \u201con the railroad of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The answer is not obnoxious to the objection made to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The evidence as to the effect of the injury upon appellee\u2019s mind resulting from the physical injuries inflicted upon him is objected to upon the ground that it is \u201ctoo remote and speculative as an element of damage.\u201d It is the well settled law in this class of cases in this State that mental pain or distress, which results from physical injuries unlawfully inflicted, in violation of a right based upon contract or secured by the-general law, enters into the estimate as a factor calling for compensation. And the right is not restricted to eases authorizing ordinarily the-assessment of exemplary damages. Stuart v. W. U. T. Co., 66 Texas, 580. It was expressly held in this case, upon a former appeal, that- \u201c mental suffering naturally resulting from the injury, whether such suffering be apprehension and anxiety, resulting from its depressing effects, or alarming character, was an element of damage.\u201d 69 Texas, 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">There was no error, we think, in the admission of the evidence to the-effect that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s habits were those of a man of sobriety and industry.\u201d The question and answer with reference to this point objected to-was as follows: \u201c What before your injury were your habits as to sobriety and industry?\u201d \u201cI was a man that could take a glass or leave it. alone. I was a sober man. I was not lazy, and I could always get work, and was industrious and anxious to get work. I never spent much timeout of employment. Was rated a first-class plumber, and was repeatedly foreman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In cases where the death of the injured party is the basis of the suit-for damages it is held that the health, habits of industry, sobriety and economy, his skill and capacity for business, are all legitimate matters of inquiry (H. &amp; T. C. R. R. Co. v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 304; Thomp. on Neg., 1390; Pierce on Railroads, 396), and we can see no reason why they would not be, in a case like the present, to enable the jury to determine the pecuniary loss, if any, sustained by injuries not resulting in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">It is claimed that the second paragraph of the charge of the court assumed as a fact (thereby misleading the jury and to the prejudice of the-defendant) that \u201cplaintiff was inexperienced in the work in which he. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>was engaged and by reason thereof was ignorant of the danger to which, he was being exposed by the said agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The charge complained of without the context is as follows: <em>\u201c2. </em>From the foregoing the jury will see that to authorize a verdict for plaintiff the evidence must show, first, that plaintiff was injured while in the employment of defendant; second, that the injury was the immediate result of the negligence of Sutcliffe in permitting plaintiff to use an improper implement in executing his order, the plaintiff being ignorant that said implement was an improper one, or that the injury was the immediate result of the negligence of said agent in directing plaintiff to use said implement in an unskillful and dangerous manner, the plaintiff himself being inexperienced in the work in which he was engaged, and by reason thereof was ignorant of the danger to which he was being exposed by said agent; and third, that Sutcliffe was, on December 1, 1881, directing and controlling plaintiff and other employes by appointment and authority of defendant, etc. The issues whether defendant was guilty of negligence, and whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and whether Sutcliffe was or was not the authorized agent of defendant in its workshop on December 1, 1881, and whether defendant through its said agent was or was not guilty of negligence, are each questions of fact to be determined by the jury from the evidence before them and the law given in the charge. Every issue of fact must be decided by the jury in accordance with the preponderance or weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We do not think the foregoing extract from the charge, disconnected from the preceding sections of it, are fairly susceptible of the construction contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">A careful analysis of the paragraph containing the sentence objected to we do not think supports the assignment, but certainly when read with the preceding instruction with which it is coupled and made by its own terms a part of it is not subject to the criticism upon it. The preceding section, among other things declared to be necessary to support a recovery, instructs the jury that \u201cif they believe from the evidence that the piece of timber furnished plaintiff was not under existing circumstances a proper instrument for blocking the colliding locomotive, and that plaintiff from his inexperience in such work was ignorant of the fact that the piece of timber handed him was not a suitable implement with which to execute the order given him, but that defendant\u2019s agent knew or ought to have known it and he permitted plaintiff to use it without advising him of the danger in using such an implement, such conduct on the part of the defendant\u2019s agent would be negligence for which the defendant would be responsible to the plaintiff for any injury resulting to him from such negligence; and so if the jury believe from the evidence that the timber used by the plaintiff in executing the order given him was a suit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>able implement, but that the plaintiff under the instruction and guidance of the defendant's agent and representative was led to use the implement in an unskillful manner, and by reason of which plaintiff received the injury of which he complains, the defendant would be responsible to plaintiff for such injuries unless the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff realized the danger in following the instructions of said agent \u2022and without protest took the risk, and if they so believe the jury are instructed that the plaintiff would be guilty of what the law denominates \u25a0contributory negligence, and he can not recover damages from the de \u25a0 .fendant company.''</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">This instruction submitted it as a question of fact to the jury whether the plaintiff from his inexperience in the work engaged in realized the -danger to which he was exposed, and presented fairly all of the essential issues involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The sixth assignment is that the court erred in refusing the following special charge requested by the defendant: \u201c The degree of care required \u25a0of defendant in furnishing safe implements and.appliances for its workmen is that of ordinary care. The company is required to use only those in ordinary use in and about its workshop and yards. And unless the jury are satisfied from a preponderance of the evidence that there are other \u25a0and more suitable and safe implements in use by railways as fenders between engines or cars being moved about their yards or workshop than of the character of the fender used in this case the plaintiff can not recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The court had already charged that \u201cit was the duty of defendant to use due care in the protection of its employes, and that they on the other hand assumed the ordinary risks incident to their employment.\u201d However correct may be a part of the requested instructions it certainly does .not apply the correct rule fixing the defendant's liability. Under this instruction if the only ground of plaintiff's recovery was based upon the single issue of the safety of the implement used or furnished the charge was correctly refused. It was calculated to lead the jury to infer that a railroad tie casually employed to block colliding engines or cars was to be treated as an implement or appliance adopted and in general use upon railroads. Under the charge this would enable the company to successfully defend in any case where injuries were the result of implements being wholly unfit for the purpose used upon the ground that it used none better for that purpose. Again plaintiff was entitled to recover for injuries occasioned by the negligehce of appellant's agent in not informing him of a danger which it was his duty to know, and which from the inexperience of plaintiff and the position he occupied he did not know. The requested charge ignores that feature of the case. There was no \u25a0error for both of the reasons mentioned in refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">With respect to the seventh assignment, which relates to the refusal of the court to give the special charge asked by the defendant, to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201cthat the jury must be satisfied from a preponderance of the evidence that the implement or appliance furnished plaintiff as a fender to work with and through which the injury occurred was not a suitable and proper implement, and that plaintiff did not know the same was unsafe and unsuitable and could not have known it by reasonable care, observation, and inspection,\u201d it is sufficient to say that it is in plain language-embraced in the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The jnry were told that to authorize a recovery and a verdict for plaintiff the evidence must show, first, \u201cthat plaintiff was injured in the employment of the defendant; second, that the injury was the immediate result of the negligence of Sutcliffe in permitting plaintiff to use an improper implement in executing his order, the plaintiff being <em>ignorant </em>that said implement was an improper one,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The jury were also instructed in effect in another part of the charge that \u201cif they believed from the evidence that plaintiff realized the danger in following the instructions of said agent, and without protest took the risk, he could not recover.\u201d These instructions fairly submitted the issues made by the evidence. There was no testimony controverting the fact of plaintiff\u2019s inexperience, and none having any tendency to show that at the time of the injury the plaintiff had any knowledge of the difference in the height of the engines, the unsuitableness of the implements, or that by the exercise of any reasonable care or observation he could have had such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">What we have said with reference to the foregoing assignments we think disposes of the tenth assignment, which seems to be a grouping together of those preceding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The eleventh error assigned is that the verdict is excessive and exorbitant, and it is argued that it was influenced by the evidence admitted as to the condition of plaintiff\u2019s mind. That the mental pain or distress which resulted naturally from the injury is an element of damage is well settled. If the verdict in this case was influenced by any improper motive or by anything else than a consideration of the evidence it is not shown. The testimony of the surgeon who attended the plaintiff is in substance that the left thigh bone was badly fractured, the knee joint stiffened so as to be immovable and precludes his following his trade as plumber or any kind of manual labor requiring active use of his limbs; that he suffered great pain resulting from the fracture which could only be remedied by a surgical operation at a great risk of his life. The cause of the pain he testified is \u201cthe presence of the broken parts of the thigh bone on the surrounding tissues,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no prospect of banishing the pain he endures,\u201d except at the risk stated. The plaintiff is compelled to walk with the aid of crutches, and he describes his mental and physical pain as great. The latter is described as similar to \u201cthat of a red hot iron running into the marrow.\u201d The injury has made him a cripple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>for life, etc. The verdict upon the former appeal about a year since was for $11,231.25. Upon this appeal it is for the sum of $12,000. There is nothing in the record which will enable us to say that under the evidence the verdict is so disproportionate to the injuries received by plaintiff as to authorize the conclusion that it was prompted by an improper motive.
