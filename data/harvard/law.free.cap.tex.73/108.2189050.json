Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Moore, \u2022special district judge.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">In addition to the facts stated in the opinion the following is con- ' tained in the record:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">The defendant, J. P. O\u2019Shaughnessy, testified that about the first of April, 1886, he and his wife, who were then living on lots 8, 9, 10, 11, \u2022and 12 in outlet 138 in Galveston as their homestead, disagreed about something, and agreed to sell their homestead and cease living together. O\u2019Shaughnessy told an attorney, W. B. Denson, of their disagreement, and according to his testimony Denson told him that if he was willing to pay twelve per cent interest he could borrow two thousand dollars on the place, and pay his wife for her share, and that the papers could be made up so that it would appear as a sale. To this O\u2019Shaughnessey replied that he only needed eighteen hundred dollars. Denson replied that he could get the money from Mr. Moore (the appellee). After some further conversation the appellants made their power of attorney to Denson to enable him to convey the property. According to Denson he was acting as the attorney of O\u2019Shaughnessy and his wife to effect a sale fot the division of the property. With Moore, the appellee, Denson looked at the place, and he executed his power by selling the property to Moore for four thousand dollars. \u00a1Neither Denson nor Moore seemed \u2022able to recollect whether Moore paid Denson the four thousand dollars purchase money or not. Moore on cross-examination testified that the result of the whole transaction was \u201cthat I found an investment of \u25a0eighteen hundred dollars at twelve per cent interest.\u201d That was the amount of money which O\u2019Shaughnessy told Denson he needed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-9\">Denson testified that Moore told Mrs. O\u2019Shaughnessy that he would not buy the place unless she was perfectly willing to sell it. Denson testified \"that he did not know whether Mrs. O\u2019Shaughnessy comprehended the transaction or not, but that she seemed to understand it and approved the sale. O\u2019Shaughnessy testified that the consideration of four thousand dollars was never paid to him. He also testified that it was understood 'between himself, Denson, and Moore that the latter would lend O\u2019Shaughnessy eighteen hundred dollars on the place. He had had feelings .against his wife on account of their disagreement. He testified that it was understood that he was to get eighteen hundred dollars with which to pay his wife and the expenses of the transaction, and that \u201c the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>should come hack to me and that we should keep it from my wife.\u201d After the deed was made Denson and Moore (according to O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s evidence) went on the premises and informed the wife of O\u2019S. that it was sold to Moore, who had rented it out. The husband testified that he then ordered his wife to leave the place, hard feelings between them still existing, and that she obeyed him and left it. She testified that when she found out the character of the transaction she moved back to the house and had since lived there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">The deed from Denson to Moore was dated April 9,1886, and on April 10, 1886, Moore reconveyed the property to J.' P. O\u2019Shaughnessy for the same recited consideration, $2200 of which it declared was paid and $1800 unpaid and secured by notes, the collection of which was the object of this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">Denson testified that the transaction was fair and in good faith. He received $50 for drawing up the deeds and $250 for making the sale. This, it would appear, was taken from the $1800 with which the husband expected to compensate his wife for her interest in the homestead. She testified that Ool. Denson gave her a bank book, presented on the trial, in which was- found the following entry:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co.,</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-8\"><em>In account with Mrs. Mary O\u2019 Shaughnessy. </em>'</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">Dr. 1886.

Denson\u2019s office, when Ool. Denson gave her the bank book. \u201cI went to Ool. Denson\u2019s office and he made me take the book. He never gave me any money. I never deposited any money with Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co. When Col. Denson gave me the book I told him that I did not want to leave my home; if anything was done I wanted a right sale. He told me there was $1500 in bank of Ball, Hutchings &amp; Oo. for my part. Of that I gave $790 to Mr. O\u2019Shaughnessy and $530 to Mr. Moore. The reason I gave the $530 to Mr. Moore was because he told me that I would lose my home if I did not pay him the money. I can not sign my name. They gave me some papers and Mr. Moore went to the bank and got out the money. I went to the bank myself when I got the $790 which I loaned to Mr. O\u2019Shaughnessy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-16\">The payment to Moore was on her husband\u2019s note. She never executed the notes, and testified that she made the payment to Moore because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>.and Denson had told her that she would lose her home unless she paid the notes her husband had made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-3\">The daughter of O\u2019Shaughnessy testified that Moore told her mother that she must leave the place, for he had rented it to another party; that she did not wish to leave it, and that she wanted time to find a place for her cattle and chickens, but the father (her husband) told her that unless she left right away there would be bloodshed, and that she left, remaining' away about a week, when she returned and had occupied the place as her home ever since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-4\">Among other things O\u2019Shaughnessy testified that it was \u201c made up between Col. Denson and myself that my wife should know nothing about the matter at all; that I should borrow the money ($1800), and my wife should know nothing about the matter at all.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">This was denied by Denson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">Moore testified that the place was worth over $4000, and though asserting the good faith of both deeds and the entire transaction, he testified that the result of the entire negotiation was the investment of $1800 of his money at 12 per cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">\u00a1No witness testified that the purchase money of $4000 was ever paid to Moore, and it would seem from the entire evidence that J. P. O\u2019Shaughnessy never received for himself any money from Moore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-8\">The record is voluminous and the evidence conflicting in many particulars.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-9\"><em>John Lovejoy </em>and <em>W.

Jordan v. Brophy, 41 Texas, 284; Amended Rule 27, Sup. Court, Jan. 21, 1882; Rev. Stats., art. 1333; Ins. Co. v. Milliken, 64 Texas, 48.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-5\">Stayton, Chief Justice.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AYg\">This action was brought by appellee to enforce the payment of notes executed to him by J. P. O\u2019Shaughnessy, which he claims were executed for certain property sold by him to the maker of the notes on which he seeks to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien evidenced by a trust deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The defendants alleged that on April 9, 1886, and for a long time prior thereto, the property on which the lien is claimed was their homestead, and that while so occupied by them a fictitious sale was made through a power of attorney executed by both husband and wife, whereby the title was apparently vested in appellee. They claim, however, that this was but a part of a transaction through which the appellee intended only to secure a lien by way of mortgage to secure the payment of a loan of $1800 made by appellee to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The deed made to appellee bears date April 9, 1886, and was acknowledged on the next day. Appellee made a deed reconveying the same property to J. P. O\u2019Shaughnessy, which bears date April 10, 1886, and was acknowledged the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The deed to appellee purports to have been made in consideration of 84000 in hand paid, while that from him purports to be on same consideration, of which it recites $2200 paid and the balance ($1800) secured by four promissory notes executed by James P. O\u2019Shaughnessy to appellee, bearing 12 per cent interest per annum. Of these are the notes sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The testimony offered for the defendants shows clearly that the whole transaction, while assuming the form of an absolute sale of the home-, stead, was intended and understood by appellee, James P. O\u2019Shaughnessy, and the attorney who negotiated the transaction, as but a means whereby a loan of $1800 by appellee to O\u2019Shaughnessy should be secured, of all of which Mrs. O\u2019Shaughnessy was kept ignorant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The testimony for appellee tends to show that the sale of the homestead was real, but it develops such facts as are inconsistent with such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The Constitution of this State provides that \u201cno mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid except for the purchase money therefor, or improvements made thereon, as hereinbefore provided, whether such mortgage or trust deed or other lien shall have been created by the husband alone or together with his wife, and all pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tended sales of the homestead involving any condition of defeasance shall be void.\u201d This is the law of the land, and must be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We have given all the evidence in this cause a careful consideration,, and while in view of the fact that the judgment will be reversed we feel that it would be improper to discuss in detail the evidence, we feel compelled to hold that the direct and circumstantial evidence offered is such as to forbid the affirmance of the judgment of the court below, and foi\" this reason its judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Delivered February 26, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
