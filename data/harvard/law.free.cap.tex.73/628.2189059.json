One of the deeds through which plaintiff deraigned title described the land conveyed \u201cas one-third of a league of land purchased by me of Pumaseno Nanes, being his headright.\u201d There was no other evidence to show the identity of the land conveyed by the deed with that described in the patent. <em>Held, </em>that the deed did not identify or convey the land in controversy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-13\">Error from Erio.

The variance between the description of the land as set out in the petition and the deed to Higginbotham under which defendant in error claimed is immaterial and not of such character as would mislead or surprise the plaintiff in 'error. McClelland v. Smith, 3 Texas, 11; Smith v. Shinn, 58 Texas, 1; Wiebush v. Patterson, 64Texas, 53; Taylor v. Merrill, 64 Texas, 494; Barrendo Stock Co. v.

The land in controversy is 5,313,989 square varas, patented to Jose de la Garza as assignee of Nepumaceno Nanez, and is correctly described by metes and bounds in plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Plaintiff undertook to deraign title from the grantee, one link in the chain being a deed from the patentee Garza to R. T. Higginbotham, in which the only description of the land conveyed is in these words, to-wit: \u201c One-third of a league of land purchased by me of Pumaseno</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Nanes, being his headright.\u201d The record contains no other evidence helping to identify the land conveyed by this deed as the same land described in the patent and in plaintiff\u2019s petition. This deed fails to show</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">\u25a0 that Garza conveyed to Higginbotham the land in controversy, and in the absence of such conveyance plaintiff failed to show title in himself to the land for which he sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">There being no evidence to sustain the judgment it is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">Delivered May 3, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
