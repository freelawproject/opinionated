Pleadings\u2014Petition in Suit for Personal Injuries.\u2014Upon general demurrer a petition is good asking damages for personal injury suffered by the plaintiff alleged to have been received upon the railroad track of the defendant <em>necessarily </em>used by the public in passing along the street, without fault or negligence on his part, by the cars detached and loose, running swiftly on a down grade upon the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b522-12\">2.

The plaintiff being on the track would have been negligence <em>per se </em>if he had not been at a place commonly and necessarily used by the public. But even if he had no right there and was a trespasser, this would not relieve the appellee from the responsibility of using ordinary care and diligence. If, therefore, the appellee was guilty of gross negligence as alleged in appellant\u2019s petition, or \u2022even a want of ordinary care and diligence, this would render it liable for -damages, provided that such want of ordinary care and diligence or such .gross negligence directly caused the injuries sustained by the appellant. I. &amp; G. R. R. R. Co. v. Graves, 59 Texas, 181; Wood\u2019s Ry. Law, p. 1045; Nighley v. Gilmer, 3 Mont., 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-4\">2. It is no excuse in itself that the act occasioning the injuries was lawful or that it was done in the exercise of a lawful right if the injuries arose from the negligent manner in which it was done, if danger to the person or property of others at any point maybe reasonably apprehended or is likely to result from the running of trains without notice, although -there is no provision of the statute requiring such notice.

Though the appellant may have been guilty of negligence, and although such negligence might have contributed to the accident, if the defendant by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence could have avoided the mischief which happened the plaintiff\u2019s negligence will not excuse the defendant. 2 Thomp. on Neg., pp. 1119, 1154-57; 1 Thomp. on Neg., pp. 423, 453.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Waelder &amp; Upson, </em>for appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfZ\">1. Appellee\u2019s demurrer to appellant\u2019s petition was properly sustained for the reasons that said petition shows upon its face that appellant was walking upon appellee\u2019s railroad track at the time of the alleged accident; that he was a trespasser; that his own hegligence contributed materially to the injury of which he complains, and his petition fails to show that the employes of appellee were aware of his presence upon the track, and thereafter omitted the exercise of such care and caution as would have avoided the accident.

We must construe-the allegation that the railroad track was \"necessarily used\" by the public-in passing along the street to mean that the street was so narrow or otherwise so obstructed that there was not room to walk along it without going-upon the track. However improbable this may seem it is not a matter of judicial knowledge, and we can not say that it is not a fact admitted by the demurrer. The right of a railway company to construct and operate its line along a street of a city does not deprive the public of their right to use it as a public highway. Prudence may demand that a passenger should not go upon the track if it can be conveniently avoided, but if the use of the track as a footway should be necessary to the use of' the street, one so using it could not be deemed a trespasser. Railway Co. v. Walker, 70 Texas, 126. A person using a railway track under such, circumstances is bound to use care commensurate to the danger thereby incurred, and in a like manner a railroad company is required to exercise-care proportionate to the risks incident to such use of its track. Admitting that the facts alleged are such as to require that the plaintiff should show that he is not guilty of contributory negligence, we think that the-allegation that he was \" without fault or negligence \u201d is all that can be-required upon general demurrer. It is clearly negligent for a railroad company to permit detached cars without signals or warning to run down grade through the streets of a city when the public had the right to use. the track in passing along the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It may be that if special exceptions had been interposed to the petition on account of the generality of the averments as to the necessity of the use of the track by passengers along the street and as to the absence of negligence on part of the plaintiff, they should have been sustained and he should have-been required to show by his petition the circumstances which rendered such use necessary, and also the acts of diligence used by him in order to avoid the injury. There being no special exceptions we do not pass upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">For the error of the court in sustaining the general demurrer to the petition the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Delivered April 16, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
