When within a few months of his majority, accustomed to do business for himself as a man, he urged the execution of the power, in pursuance of which a sale was made and the minor approved the sale. Two years after the sale was made he sued to recover the land without offering to refund the purchase money. <em>Held: </em>Whether the power of attorney be held void or voidable the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.

Ferguson instituted, on the fifth day of June, 1884, an action of trespass to try title to the tract of land described in their petition against appellee, and to cancel, as a cloud upon their title, a certain instrument designated a power of attorney, a copy of which was made a part of their petition, under which appellee claimed the land, alleging that at the time of the execution of the power of attorney they were infants, and that neither of them had ever received any consideration for their interest in the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">Appellee pleaded not guilty, and specially that appellant and his co-plaintiff had both received the consideration paid by appellee's vendor, Paul Bremond, and had ratified the said sale made to him. The cause was tried at the April Term, 1887, by the District Court of Hardin County without the intervention of a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, A. H. Ferguson, for the relief prayed for, and against appellant. From this judgment appellant, L. T. Ferguson, appealed, and assigned the following as errors committed by the District Court on the trial of said caufce:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-10\">\u201cThe court erred in holding the power of attorney made an exhibit to plaintiff's second amended original petition and introduced in evidence voidable instead of void, the power of attorney having been executed by plaintiff while an infant.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-11\">The power of attorney was executed by L. T. Ferguson and A. H. Ferguson to their older brothers, E. A. Ferguson and Wm. F. Ferguson, and granted the following power: \u201cTo take possession of any and all</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-12\">business that we may have in the counties of Tyler and Hardin, to make transfer to any and all lands that we have in said counties and to sue all parties not legally claiming lands, to make any compromise that they may think necessary for our benefit, to sign any and all papers thereto,\" etc. The power of attorney was dated September 4, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-13\">The second assignment of error was as follows: \u201cThe court erred in holding under the evidence that plaintiff, L. T. Ferguson, had ratified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the acts of the persons named in said power of attorney as his agents in making the sale of the land to Paul Bremond, and that said plaintiff had received the consideration paid W.

T. Ferguson, under all the facts in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">3STo conclusions of law or fact were filed. It was proved that L. T. Ferguson and A. H. Ferguson each owned an undivided one-sixth interest in the 1714 acres of land described in their petition at the time they \u2022executed the power of attorney to their brothers; that W. F. and E. A. Ferguson conveyed the land by warranty deed to appellee\u2019s vendor in \u25a0September, 1881; that L. T. Ferguson was born June 4, 1861, and that A. H. Ferguson was born in December, 1862.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">Appellant testified that he had never received anything of value for his interest in the land; that he had never recognized the conveyance of the land by his brother as binding on him; that he had never in any manner ratified the sale and conveyance of the land; that he never had or claimed any interest in the boat testified about by W. F. Ferguson; that he went on a steamboat at the request of W. F. Ferguson, as clerk or manager for him; that he had no special understanding with his brother when he went on the boat as to what he was to get for his services; that he stayed on the boat about eight or nine months and drew \u2022out of its earnings $510; that when he quit the boat he wanted $250 more for his services, but W. F. Ferguson refused to pay him but $140; that the money was received as compensation for his services, but not for \u2022his interest in the land; that he never encouraged his brother to sell the land; that he knew nothing of the sale until long after it was made; that when he attained his majority in 1882 he spoke to Mr. Seale, an attorney, to bring this suit, and he promised to do so, but neglected it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">W. F. Ferguson testified that he received in drafts and notes about \u2022$3800 for the land when he and his brother sold it under the power of .attorney; that plaintiffs in this suit were entitled to about $525 each .after expenses for selling and disposing of the notes were deducted; that .appellant received his share in full, but A. II. Ferguson never received \u2022any part of his share; that he left L. T. Ferguson in charge of a steamboat they were running, and when he bought L. T. Ferguson\u2019s interest in the boat the books showed that L. T. had appropriated between $750 and $800 to his individual use. That L. T. Ferguson was apparently a grown man and managed his own affairs, and encouraged and approved \u25a0of the sale of the land; that L. T. never showed any disposition to disapprove of the sale until about two years after he became of age; that he thinks appellant was of legal age when he was appropriating the money. That $2000 of the proceeds of the land he invested in the steam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>boat in the fall of 1881.

In September, 1881, the attorneys in fact, acting under the power, sold and conveyed the land to appellee\u2019s immediate vendor. Appellant attained majority June 4, 1882. This suit was brought on the 5th day of June, 1884, to recover appellant\u2019s interest in the land and to cancel the power of attorney and deed executed thereunder as a cloud upon his title. Appellant averred that he was an infant at the time he executed the power of attorney, and that he had never received any consideration for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellee pleaded not guilty, and specially that appellant had received the consideration paid by appellee\u2019s vendor, and that appellant had ratified the sale. The trial was by the court, and resulted in judgment against appellant, that he take nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The first assignment of error is: \u201cThe court erred in holding the power of attorney made an exhibit to plaintiff\u2019s second amended original petition and introduced in evidence voidable instead of void, the said power of attorney having been executed by plaintiff while an infant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The transcript contains no conclusions of fact and law, and we are therefore not informed of the grounds upon which the court below based its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Whether the power of attorney of an infant to sell land is void or merely \u2022voidable has not been decided in this State. There are many authorities both English and American which hold that such a power is void, while it is well settled that a deed executed by an infant is merely voidable. We confess our inability to appreciate the reason given for the distinction maintained by the authorities. The rule generally recognized by the courts of this country as the test in determining whether an act of an infant is void or merely voidable is stated to be, \u201cthat whenever the act done may be for the benefit of the infant it shall npt be considered void, but that he shall have his election when he comes of age to affirm or avoid it.\u201d * * * \u201cIt is regarded equally to the security of the infant and more to his advantage that by considering his acts voidable we shall give him the privilege of avoiding, which also implies that of confirming them, than that by considering them void we shall lay him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>under the disability of acting at all and place him on a level with idiots and lunatics. It certainly could not be considered a great privilege to the infant for the court to have power to declare his contracts absolutely void although he might choose to ratify them.\u201d Tyler on Inf. and Cov., 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\">\u201cThe tendency of modern decisions is in favor of the reasonableness and policy of a very liberal extension of the rule that the acts and contracts of infants should be deemed voidable only.\u201d Kent\u2019s Com.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The reason for the rule that holds the deed of an infant voidable is to protect the infant against his own imbecility and lack of discretion and against the craft of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We are unable to discover any substantial reason why the same rule should not apply to a power of attorney, as the infant would thereby be afforded ample protection against the injurious consequences of indiscrete and improvident contracts and acts done during his minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The question is not presented, however, so as to require its decision in \u25a0this case, as we think there is another ground upon which the court may have based, and probably did base, its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">It appears that appellant was in his twentieth year when the power of attorney was executed and lacked only a few months of majority when the deed was executed under the power. He was transacting his own business, acting for himself as an adult, and the attorney who sold the land under the power, and who was appellant\u2019s brother, testified that \u2022appellant approved of the sale and urged him to make it, and that appellant received his full share of the proceeds of the sale. There was no \u25a0evidence tending to show that appellee\u2019s vendor, who purchased under the power, knew that appellant Avas a minor or had any reason to suspect \u25a0that he Avas. By executing the power of attorney he represented himself to be a major. He retained the purchase money, and did nothing indicating his purpose to repudiate the sale until this suit was brought, two years after he attained majority, and he does not offer to refund the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Hnder this state of facts Ave think it immaterial whether the court held the power of attorney void or voidable. If voidable, to entitle appellant to recover he should have exercised his right of election and taken steps to avoid it Avithin a reasonable time after attaining majority, and should \u2022also have tendered the purchase money received by him for the land. If void, it could not of course be the subject of ratification; but appellant being an infant of years of discretion at the time of performing the act he uoav seeks to repudiate, we think the court might well have held, under the facts of this case, that he was estopped from recovering the land.
