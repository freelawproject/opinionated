Shuffman, <em>In re Hartford Textile Corp., </em>659 F.2d 299 (2d Cir. 1981), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1714, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-26\">Shuffman alleges that the district court erred in describing her appeal from an order of the bankruptcy court, Babitt, J., as one from a denial of a motion to reconsider her application for the appointment of a receiver, rather than as an appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s <em>\u201coriginal\u201d </em>order denying the application for the appointment of a receiver. Shuffman contends that the district court\u2019s alleged error was carried forward by this Court in <em>In re Hartford Textile Corp., </em>659 F.2d at 301, and that, accordingly, the $5,000 in damages awarded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>appellees should be vacated. Shuffman also contends that appellees committed fraud upon the court in her prior suits and, therefore, all other orders and opinions which this Court has entered on this matter should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We dismiss Shuffman\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. First, we note that Shuffman has mischaracterized the issue on appeal. Shuffman alleges that the district court erred in denying her application for the court to \u201csua <em>sponte </em>vacate\u201d its memorandum and order of January 20, 1981. However, Shuffman\u2019s letter to Judge Sofaer made no such request. The letter merely requested the district court to advise this Court of an alleged error in the district court\u2019s opinion and to ask this Court to vacate its award of damages. Unlike a denial of a request under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to relieve a party from a final judgment, see <em>Cinerama, Inc. v. Sweet Music, S.A., </em>482 F.2d 66 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>Welden v. Grace Line, Inc., </em>404 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1968), the denial of Shuffman\u2019s request to advise is not a \u201cfinal decision[ ] of the district court[],\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. It is a matter committed solely to the unreviewable discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Because we have decided against Shuffman on the issue of appealability, we need not decide the merits of her claim that the error in describing her appeal from the bankruptcy court rendered her appeal to this Court nonfrivolous. We note, however, that this issue was addressed in this Court\u2019s May 5, 1982 order. Further, Shuffman has already asserted her fraud claim in a previous proceeding. <em>In re Hartford Textile Corp., </em>613 F.2d 388 (2d Cir. 1979). Accordingly, Shuffman is precluded from relitigating these issues. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 414, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
