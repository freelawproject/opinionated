The district court sentenced Lott to concurrent life terms for the kidnapping counts and to a ten-year term for the firearm count. The court ordered that the concurrent life sentences would run consecutively to the ten-year firearm sentence. Lott then filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his ten-year sentence for the firearm violation <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>on the theory that the sentence violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment because his convictions arose from a \u201csingle course of conduct.\u201d The district court denied the motion and Lott appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-26\">Lott\u2019s claim raises two issues. The first revolves around the final paragraph of <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). <em>Simpson </em>involved consecutive sentences imposed for convictions for aggravated bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) and a firearms charge under \u00a7 924(c). After reviewing the text and legislative history of \u00a7 924(c), the Supreme Court concluded that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>did not intend 'for the enhancement provisions of \u00a7 924(c) to apply when an enhanced penalty for using dangerous weapons already was contained in the prohibitive statute. <em>Id. </em>at 13-15, 98 S.Ct. at 913-914. Since \u00a7 2113(d) already imposed an enhanced sentence for bank robbery accomplished with \u201ca dangerous weapon or device,\u201d the Court concluded that imposition of an additional sentence under \u00a7 924(c) was erroneous. In the final paragraph of its opinion the Court summarized its decision: \u201cAccordingly, we hold that .in a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced under both \u00a7 2113(d) and \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 98 S.Ct. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">Appellant\u2019s \u201csingle transaction\u201d argument, therefore, raises the question whether the <em>Simpson </em>rule applies in this case. We conclude that it does not. The Supreme Court in <em>Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made clear that <em>\u201cSimpson\u2019s </em>language and reasoning support one conclusion alone\u2014 that prosecution and enhanced sentencing under \u00a7 924(c) is simply not permissible where the predicate felony statute contains its own enhancement provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 100 S.Ct. at 1752. The reason for this \u201cone conclusion\u201d was the court\u2019s perception that \u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 924(c) is already served whenever the substantive federal offense provides enhanced punishment for use of a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Simpson, supra, </em>435 U.S. at 13, 98 S.Ct. at 913. In the case at bar, however, the kidnapping statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, contains no enhancement provision for using weapons. Accordingly, the rationale behind the <em>Simpson </em>rule does not apply in this case, and we perceive no statutory bar to the consecutive sentences imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">Appellant\u2019s \u201csingle transaction\u201d argument, however, also raises an issue under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment. The Supreme Court in <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1141, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) recently reaffirmed that the proper test for determining whether multiple punishment for a single act or transaction is permissible is the test from <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 305, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1444-9\">\u201cThe applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA8K\"><em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1005-1006 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). In the case before us, the \u00a7 924(c) charge requires proof of the use or carrying of a firearm during the commission of a felony, which is not an element of the kidnapping offense. The consecutive sentences, therefore, do not violate the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AoEn\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ARW8\">. Lott previously filed two other \u00a7 2255 motions attacking his convictions on other grounds. These prior motions were denied and neither was appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">. <em>Busic </em>involved convictions for assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 and a firearms charge under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
