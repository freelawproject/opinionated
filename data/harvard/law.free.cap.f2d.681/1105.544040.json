The Board found that Hudson Farms violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the General Drivers and Helpers Union, Local 823, which had been certified as the bargaining representative for the company\u2019s truck drivers and yard workers. It ordered Hudson Farms to cease and desist from refusing to bargain with the Union, or otherwise violating the employees\u2019 Section 7 rights, and directed the company to bargain with the Union upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">Hudson Farms, an integrated poultry producer, employs truck drivers and yard workers to transport its poultry between independent contract growers, which raise the chickens to market weight, and the company\u2019s processing plant. Hudson Farms contends that these employees are \u201cagricultural laborers\u201d who are exempt from the Act\u2019s coverage under the meaning of Section 2(3). Accordingly, the company argues that the Board\u2019s bargaining order should be denied enforcement because the Union includes these truck drivers and yard workers who are exempt from the Act\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">The sole question presented here is whether Hudson Farms\u2019 truck drivers and yard workers are \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201cagricultural laborer[s]\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Act. This issue is controlled by <em>Valmac Industries </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>599 F.2d 246, 248-249 (8th Cir. 1979). In <em>Valmac Industries v. NLRB, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 249, this Court, relying on <em>Bayside Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>429 U.S. 298, 97 S.Ct. 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 494 (1977), held that employees who transported live poultry from an independent grower\u2019s farm to their employers\u2019 processing plant were \u201cemployees\u201d not \u201cagricultural laborer[s]\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">Accordingly, on the basis of <em>Bayside Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>and <em>Valmac Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>and the evidence as a whole, we hold that the Board\u2019s determination that Hudson Farms\u2019 truck drivers and yard workers are \u201cemployees,\u201d rather than \u201cagricultural labor-eas],\u201d under Section 2(3) of the Act is warranted by the record and has a reasonable basis in law. The Board, therefore, properly determined that Hudson Farms violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, and its order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
