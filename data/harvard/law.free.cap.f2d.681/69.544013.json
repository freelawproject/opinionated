CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-21\">Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. (\u201cAstra\u201d) appeals from a decision of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). The Commission found Astra in violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>failure to see that one of its employees, Paul Sund, was using certain items of protective equipment when a chemical vat at which he was working overflowed, seriously injuring him.</p>\n<p id=\"Azd\">A one-day hearing was conducted on the matter by an administrative law judge (ALJ). At that hearing the Secretary of Labor presented two witnesses: an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Inspector, Mr. Goyda, who inspected the Astra plant in Worcester, Massachusetts on the day following the accident, and a Mr. Ratner, an expert industrial hygienist with OSHA who had never visited the Astra facility. Astra offered no evidence of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"A1p\">The Secretary\u2019s witnesses, particularly Mr. Goyda, established that an accident had occurred at the Worcester plant on November 7, 1978, when a vat used in the production of chloroacetyl xylidine (an intermediate chemical in the production of the anesthetic Xylocaine \u2014 an Astra product) overflowed, spraying toxic chemicals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the immediate area. Paul Sund, an Astra employee of 20 years\u2019 experience who was tending the vat, was in the area at the time and was subsequently hospitalized as result of the overflow.</p>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">Mr. Goyda arrived at the Astra plant the following day to make his inspection. In the course of his investigation he spoke with several employees who had helped to wash Sund with water after the accident. Goyda testified particularly to a conversation with a Mr. Carlson \u2014 one of Sund\u2019s fellow employees. Goyda\u2019s testimony on direct examination \u2014 which was characterized as hearsay by the ALJ \u2014 -was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7K\">Q. Did he [Mr. Carlson] relate to you his observation of Mr. Sund on November 7, 1978, immediately after this so-called accident occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">Q. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">A. That Mr. Sund was covered with chemical from head to toe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">Q. Where did he see Mr. Sund, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-14\">A. They had come back \u2014 I think he saw him coming down the steps from the room containing the reactor vessel involved in the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">Q. So the reactor is on the second floor of this building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-17\">Q. And what happened then? What did Mr. Carlson say happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-18\">A. They started administering Mr. Sund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-19\">Q. In what way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-20\">A. Cleaning him off with water, showering him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-21\">Q. Did he tell you where this chemical material was on Mr. Sund\u2019s body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-22\">A. Completely covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-23\">Q. Did this include his head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-25\">Q. Did this include his mouth area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-27\">Mr. Goyda also spoke with a Mr. Mandel-la, Paul Sund\u2019s supervisor, regarding the type of protective equipment normally used by Paul Sund. Goyda\u2019s testimony regarding what Mr. Mandella told him was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-28\">Q. Did you discuss the wearing of a [sic] personal protective equipment with Mr. Mandella?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-29\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Q. What did he tell you with respect to the Company\u2019s policy, if any, with respect to the wearing of personal protective equipment by Mr. Sund while he\u2019s engaged in producing this product which you have described?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">A. He explained the personal protective equipment that was worn in that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Q. What was that personal protective equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">MR. LeDOUX. Objection. Is the question what was it or what did Mr. Mandella tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Q. What did Mr. Mandella tell you about personal protective equipment being worn in the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">A. He explained that during certain phases of the operation, a respirator, chemical goggles, and gloves were worn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">Q. Were these provided by the Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">A. Yes, I would assume so.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The Secretary also demonstrated through its two witnesses and various exhibits that Astra was aware that the chemicals involved in the accident were hazardous and that \u201cfull body protection\u201d \u2014 including, according to both Mr. Goyda and Mr. Ratner, boots, jacket, pants and a full face shield all impervious to the chemicals \u2014 would have been the appropriate protection required under industry standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As previously noted, Astra chose to put on no evidence to rebut the Secretary\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">After all the evidence was in, the ALJ issued a decision in which he vacated the Secretary\u2019s 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a) citation and proposed $800 penalty on the grounds that no evidence had been submitted of what Sund was actually wearing at the time of the accident. The ALJ pointed out that neither supervisor Mandella nor employee Carlson were called as witnesses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was of the view that, without their testimony, \u201cthe allegation that Astra did not require employees to use protective clothing when needed [is] unsupported.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s decision was then appealed to the Review Commission by the Secretary. The Commission reversed, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJu\">Mandella\u2019s statement [to Goyda] regarding Astra\u2019s personal protective equipment policy, having been specifically limited to a respirator, goggles, and gloves, is probative evidence from which we find that the injured employee (Sund) used no greater protection while making chloroa-cetyl xylidine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">This appeal followed with Astra\u2019s argument pitched essentially on the same grounds as was the ALJ\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">Our review of the Commission\u2019s decision is a narrow one especially where, as here, the chief dispute on appeal is factual. We will affirm the Commission\u2019s decision so long as it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). <em>See General Dynamics v. OSHRC, </em>599 F.2d 453, 464 (1st Cir. 1979). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 459, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), <em>quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938), taking into account \u201cwhatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Id., </em>340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464. Where the Commission draws factual inferences from the evidence presented, courts will generally affirm so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>long as the inferences are reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See American Iron &amp; Steel Institute v. OSHA, </em>577 F.2d 825, 831 (3d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. dismissed sub nom. Republic Steel Corp. v. OSHA, </em>448 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 38, 65 L.Ed.2d 1180 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Astra argues vigorously that supervisor Mandella\u2019s statement regarding the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the plant to require \u201ca respirator, chemical goggles, and gloves,\u201d upon which the Commission relied in reaching its decision, in no way suggests, as the Commission found, that employees were <em>limited </em>to these pieces of equipment or that Sund was wearing no more than this at the time of the accident. Rather, Astra claims that the statement is simply silent on these points and should not alone be sufficient to support the inference the Commission drew. Mandella\u2019s statement, however, which is susceptible to several interpretations, is not the only evidence in the record which supports the inference drawn by the Commission. Employee Carlson reported that Sund\u2019s body was \u201ccompletely covered\u201d with chemicals from \u201chead to toe,\u201d including his head and mouth area. Such testimony indicates that Sund\u2019s person was extensively exposed to the toxic chemicals at the time of the overflow. Such exposure, when combined with the fact that Sund was seriously injured and hospitalized after the accident,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in turn strongly suggests a lack of adequate protective clothing. We note additionally that had Sund been wearing either the required \u201cfull face shield,\u201d <em>see </em>note 4, <em>supra, </em>or even the respirator mentioned by Man-della,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is unlikely that Carlson would have observed chemicals around Sund\u2019s \u201cmouth area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">We recognize that neither Carlson\u2019s nor Mandella\u2019s observations are free from ambiguity. Astra argues with some force, for example, that Carlson\u2019s statement \u201cis not probative of what [Sund] was <em>wearing </em>at the time of the accident. One could be completely covered [with chemicals] while wearing a suit of armor or while completely naked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">However, Carlson\u2019s and Mandella\u2019s statements<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> must be read in combination, and also in light of all other evidence in the record. Taken as a whole, we believe the record supports the Commission\u2019s inference that Sund was inadequately protected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted above, had Sund been wearing the required full face mask or even the respirator, he would likely have avoided getting chemicals around his mouth, and it is unlikely that Carlson would have described Sund in the manner he did. Moreover, the suggestion that Sund\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d was \u201ccompletely covered,\u201d while an obvious exaggeration if taken literally (we would assume that Sund wore at least some clothing while at work), nevertheless reasonably suggests, when combined with Sund\u2019s subsequent hospitalization, some type of dangerous \u201cbody\u201d exposure \u2014 exposure which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>would have been avoided by \u201cfull protective clothing\u201d impervious to the chemicals. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra. </em>Finally, with Carlson\u2019s statements as background, Mandella\u2019s statement that Sund was provided with a \u201crespirator, goggles and gloves\u201d as a matter of Company policy reasonably supports an inference that Sund used no more (and perhaps less) than this limited equipment on the day he was injured.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Put another way, had Sund used all of the protective gear established as necessary by the Secretary, it seems reasonable to assume that both Carlson\u2019s description of Sund after the accident and Mandella\u2019s statement of equipment \u201cpolicy\u201d would have been substantially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Astra, of course, was well positioned to set the record straight on what Sund was wearing if these inferences were incorrect. Knowledge as to how Sund was usually attired and witnesses who could prove what Sund wore on the day in question were fully available to it. Astra could have called supervisor Mandella and employee Carlson to testify, if they could, that more and different equipment was sometimes used and that Sund, in particular, had been using more protection when the accident occurred. While the Secretary had the burden of proving its case by substantial evidence, what constitutes substantial evidence varies with the circumstances. The \u201cevidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d is surely less in a case like this where it stands entirely unrebutted in the record by a party having full possession of all the facts, than in a case where there is contrary evidence to detract from its weight. <em>See, e.g., Noranda Aluminum, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>593 F.2d 811, 814 &amp; n.5 (8th Cir. 1979) (decision to leave Secretary\u2019s case unrebutted \u201ca legitimate but always dangerous defense tactic in litigation\u201d); <em>Stephenson Enterprises, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>578 F.2d 1021, 1026 (5th Cir. 1978). Thus, thin as the underlying evidence was, we find it sufficient in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Astra is not aided by the fact that the ALJ would have vacated the citation. The Commission\u2019s decision in no way turned on credibility or other factors peculiarly the province of a trial examiner. <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 468. The Commission simply disagreed with the ALJ regarding the inference to be drawn from the available record evidence. Where, as we believe was true here, the agency\u2019s choice was reasonable \u2014 whether or not another inference might also have been reasonable \u2014 \u201cit is the agency\u2019s choice that governs.\u201d <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 853 (D.C.Cir.1970), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). <em>See also Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Astra additionally has requested that we remand this case for a more particularized finding by the Commission to support its imposition of the $800 penalty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the Secretary has no objection to such a remand, we grant Astra\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a) provides in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">Protective equipment, including personal protective equipment for eyes, face, head, and extremities, protective clothing, respiratory devices, and protective shields and barriers, shall be provided, used, and maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition wherever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>it is necessary by reason of hazards of processes or environment, chemical hazards, radiological hazards, or mechanical irritants encountered in a manner capable of causing injury or impairment in the function of any part of the body through absorption, inhalation or physical contact.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-30\">. The chemicals used in the process included benzene, chloroacetyl chloride, xylidine, and sodium carbonate monohydrate. /Mr. Ratner\u2019s testimony established that all of these chemicals except perhaps sodium carbonate monohy-drate were hazardous to health if brought into contact with skin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-13\">. Goyda was also asked if he had questioned anyone at the plant regarding what Sund was actually wearing immediately after the accident. Goyda replied that he had not inquired about this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b148-14\">. The Secretary introduced various pages from the \u201cFire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials\u201d dealing with the protective equipment necessary for handling the chemicals involved in the accident. Mr. Goyda testified that As-tra\u2019s safety director referred to the publication during Goyda\u2019s inspection. For \u201cBenzene\u201d the Guide recommended a \u201cself-contained breathing apparatus\u201d which, Ratner testified, has a \u201cfull face shield.\u201d For \u201cChloroacetyl Chloride\u201d and \u201cXylidine\u201d the Guide recommended \u201cfull protective clothing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b148-20\">. Paul Sund was unavailable as a witness, apparently because of the accident. <em>See </em>note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b149-5\">. The record is incomplete regarding the extent of Sund\u2019s injuries. It was suggested in hearsay testimony by Mr. Goyda, objected to and apparently excluded by the ALJ, that Sund was \u201ccomatose.\u201d Counsel for the Secretary, meanwhile, represented to the ALJ that \u201c[Mr. Sund] is simply not available. We made those attempts and were not successful. Indeed, I doubt if anyone ever will be successful in reaching Mr. Sund again.\u201d In any event, it was uncontested that Sund was hospitalized as a result of the accident, and Astra considered the event serious enough to warrant contacting OSHA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. Inspector Goyda stated that he had seen a respirator while at the Astra plant, that this respirator was not a \u201cself-contained mask,\u201d <em>see </em>note 4, <em>supra, </em>but that it did cover the \u201cnose and mouth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b149-13\">. Both of these statements, as testified to by Mr. Goyda, were admissions made by Astra\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d and \u201cservant\u201d concerning \u201ca matter within the scope of [their] agency or employment\u201d and hence were not hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D). <em>See Pillsbury Co. v. Cleaver-Brooks Div. of Aqua-Chem, Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1216, 1217-18 (8th Cir. 1981); Saltzburg &amp; Redden, <em>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual </em>460-61 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b149-14\">. In so saying we do not mean to condone the Secretary\u2019s exceptionally careless investigation and incomplete presentation. While we now uphold the Commission, the evidence in support of its decision is obviously at the outer limits of sufficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">. Astra contends that Mandella\u2019s statement supports only inferences regarding protective \u201cequipment\u201d and not \u201cclothing\u201d since he was asked specifically only about \u201cequipment.\u201d However, Mandella himself listed \u201cgloves\u201d in answer to the question regarding \u201cequipment.\u201d In view of this, and all the other facts and circumstances in the record, we cannot say the Commission acted unreasonably in interpreting Mandella\u2019s answer as generally covering both the equipment and clothing categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"Aq3\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(i) requires that the Commission take into account such factors as the size of the company, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of prior violations in assessing a penalty. Astra alleges and the Secretary does not dispute that the Commission\u2019s inquiry into these matters was inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
