At issue is the requirement of acquiring an eligibility certificate indicating that an ancestor was enrolled by the Dawes Commission. Additionally, we are confronted with the propriety of dismissing a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s case for failure to comply with a local rule requirement for filing an answering legal memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-22\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-23\">Moss Witt and Jackie Jarman filed claims with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on behalf of minor children in their care for Indian land allotments under Section Four of the Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334. Witt claimed to be of Choctaw descent, and Jarman claimed Cherokee descent. The BLM rejected the applications for failure to submit a certificate of eligibility from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Jarman\u2019s applications were also rejected because the tracts requested had previously been withdrawn from allotment and classified for federal retention, and Jarman had failed to file petitions for reclassification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>terior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) upheld the rejection of the applications. <em>See Geneiva Nell Maston Smith, </em>48 IBLA 199, 201 (1980) (Witt); <em>Robert Dale Marston, </em>51 IBLA 115 (1980) (Jarman). Both brought actions in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345 to establish rights to allotments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">In Witt\u2019s district court action, it was undisputed that he could not qualify for an eligibility certificate. He argued that the eligibility requirements unconstitutionally deprived him of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and deprived him of his full rights as a United States citizen conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. Jarman challenged both the requirement of an eligibility certificate and the existence and exercise of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s power to classify land before it becomes available for Indian allotments. He contended that the Secretary had acted illegally by classifying large tracts of public lands, making them unavailable for public disposal, including for Indian land allotments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">The district court granted summary judgment against Witt on the grounds that he had not filed for and was ineligible for a certificate. In Jarman\u2019s case, the district court dismissed the action pursuant to Nevada District Court Local Rule 16(e) upon failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the Government\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion. The two cases were consolidated for appeal. We hold that the eligibility standards are constitutional, and therefore, summary judgment was properly granted against Witt. The dismissal of Jarman\u2019s action for failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities was an abuse of discretion, and we remand and instruct that an opportunity to cure the defect be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">Under Section Four of the Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334, any Indian not residing on a reservation may apply for and is entitled to allotment of a parcel of public land \u201cnot otherwise appropriated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Heads of families may select allotment lands for their minor children. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">The original purpose behind the 1887 General Allotment Act was to alter tribal existence and lifestyle by allotting lands in severalty to individuals and family groups. <em>See generally Hopkins v. United States, </em>414 F.2d at 467; U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, <em>Federal Indian Law </em>773-77 (1958) [hereinafter <em>Federal Indian Law]. </em>Section One of the Act authorized allotment of reservation lands to Indians residing thereon. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 331. Section Four created a similar allotment system in unappropriated public lands for off-reservation Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>As enacted, the Allotment Act did not extend to the Five Civilized Tribes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 339. Allotment of the lands of these tribes was accomplished by agreements between the United States and the tribes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To facilitate negotiation and implementation of those agreements, Congress created the Dawes Commission and directed it to compile rolls of tribal membership.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Eligibility for allotment of tribal lands was limited to persons enrolled by the Commission. Although not clearly elucidated by the parties, an issue in this appeal is whether the Dawes Commission enrollments also limit eligibility for the allotments of public land sought by Witt and Jarman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">The Act does not define who is an \u201cIndian.\u201d Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior require that an applicant for allotment \u201cshow that he is a recognized member of an Indian tribe or is entitled to be so recognized,\u201d and that he do so by \u201cobtain[ing] from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a certificate showing that he or she is an Indian and eligible for such allotment.\u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2531.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A person seeking allotment on behalf' of a minor child must also be eligible for allotment. 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2531.1(d). The Commissioner will issue an eligibility certificate to a Cherokee or Choctaw for a public land allotment only if the name of one of the person\u2019s ancestors is listed on the Dawes Commission rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Requirement of a Certificate</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">Witt and Jarman challenge both the requirement of filing an eligibility certificate and the standards used. They contend that the requirement of filing a certificate deprives them of vested property rights and of the rights of national citizenship guaranteed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. That section, however, is inapplicable to the right, if any, to an Indian land allotment. The statute assures citizenship to Indians born in the United States. Its purpose was to change the earlier rule that an Indian was a citizen only if naturalized. <em>See Elk v. Wilkins, </em>112 U.S. 94, 103, 5 S.Ct. 41, 46, 28 L.Ed. 643 (1884). <em>See generally Totus v. United States, </em>39 F.Supp. 7, 11 (E.D.Wash.1941). The statute extends to Indians the rights of national citizenship, but expressly does not affect rights to tribal or other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">Witt and Jarman\u2019s claim to a vested right to receive an allotment without first qualifying for an eligibility certificate is also incorrect. Congress may require proof of eligibility before allotting land. It has broad power over allotment procedures before a patent is issued. <em>Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Hollowbreast, </em>425 U.S. 649, 655-56, 96 S.Ct. 1793, 1796-1797, 48 L.Ed.2d 274 (1976). Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Choate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941 (1912), is misplaced. In that case, the Supreme Court recognized that individual Indians had vested property rights in previously allotted land. Unlike the Indians in <em>Choate, </em>Witt and Jarman have not yet received land patents. The requirement of filing an eligibility certificate does not deprive them of any vested right.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Sizemore v. Brady, </em>235 U.S. 441, 449-50, 35 S.Ct. 135, 136, 59 L.Ed. 308 (1914) (Congress may change conditions of entitlement to allotment because no vested rights created prior to selection).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">The Eligibility Standards</p>\n<p id=\"aek-dedup-1\">An eligibility certificate will be issued to a person claiming Cherokee or Choctaw descent only if the applicant can trace an ancestor to the Dawes Commission rolls. This standard is derived from the legislation governing the creation of the rolls. The numerous statutes governing the Dawes Commission set up an elaborate system of application, hearing, and judicial review to determine who was to be enrolled as a member of the Five Civilized Tribes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Agreements with the tribes and other legislation made the rolls final and conclusive on eligibility for allotment of tribal lands.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">Both Witt and Jarman sought allotments in public, not tribal lands. The effect of the eligibility standards is to extend the restrictions on tribal land allotments to applicants for public land. We have interpreted other restrictions on allotment of tribal lands to apply also to allotment of public lands. <em>Pallin v. United States, </em>496 F.2d 27, 35 (9th Cir. 1974). The creation of the Dawes Commission rolls was prompted by the need for a conclusive determination of eligibility for allotment of tribal land. The similar need for a conclusive eligibility standard in public land allotments is persuasive evidence that Congress intended the rolls to determine eligibility for both types of land. Therefore, we believe that the Secretary of the Interior acted within his implied powers under the General Allotment Act in promulgating regulations requiring an eligibility certificate which was available only to persons who could trace an ancestor to the Dawes Commission rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">We conclude that this use of the rolls does not violate the United States Constitution. Congress, directly or by delegation, has the power to define who is an Indian for purposes of determining property rights. <em>Simmons v. Seelatsee, </em>244 F.Supp. 808, 813-15 (E.D.Wash.1965), <em>aff\u2019d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number><em>per curiam, </em>384 U.S. 209, 86 S.Ct. 1459, 16 L.Ed.2d 480 (1966). The Supreme Court has held that the acts creating the Dawes Commission and requiring preparation of conclusive rolls limiting eligibility for distribution of tribal lands did not deprive excluded Indians of vested rights. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Cherokee Nation, </em>174 U.S. 445, 488, 19 S.Ct. 722, 738, 43 L.Ed. 1041 (1899) (interpreting and upholding the Curtis Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">In <em>Delaware Tribal Business Commission v. Weeks, </em>430 U.S. 73, 97 S.Ct. 911, 51 L.Ed.2d 173 (1977), the Court held that Congress\u2019 determination of who was an Indian for purposes of sharing in an appropriation provided equal protection because the eligibility classification was \u201ctied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress\u2019 unique obligation toward the Indians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 97 S.Ct. at 919. In connection with the Dawes Commission, Congress set up an elaborate procedural system in order to compile final rolls of tribal membership and thereby ensure that benefits were not extended to non-Indians. This purpose is \u201crationally tied\u201d to the fulfillment of Congress\u2019 \u201cunique obligation.\u201d Thus, the eligibility requirements do not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Witt has no right to seek an allotment for his niece because he did not qualify under the valid requirements for an eligibility certificate. The summary judgment against him was proper. The question of Jarman\u2019s eligibility for a certificate was not decided by the district court because Jarman\u2019s action was dismissed at an early stage for procedural reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Jarman\u2019s Failure to File Memorandum of Points and Authorities</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jar-man\u2019s action for failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities is reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>See Tolbert v. Leighton, </em>623 F.2d 585, 586 (9th Cir. 1980). In <em>Tolbert, </em>a dismissal for failure to attend a pretrial conference was an abuse of discretion where the case was only seven months old, no warning had been given, there was no other evidence of dilatoriness, and the court failed to consider less drastic, alternative sanctions. In <em>Raiford v. Pounds, </em>640 F.2d 944, 945 (9th Cir. 1981) (per curiam), we held that dismissal should be imposed only in extreme circumstances, and only after consideration of less drastic alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">The Government filed its motion to dismiss on February 23,1981, and the judge granted it by minute order in chambers March 20, 1981. The case had been filed only three months before. There is no indication in the record that the district judge considered the efficacy of alternative sanctions before dismissal, nor that Jarman, a <em>pro se </em>litigant, was given an express warning that he might suffer dismissal. Jar-man\u2019s complaint reads like a brief and fully sets out his legal position and authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">Under these circumstances, we hold that the dismissal against Jarman for failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities opposing the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss was an abuse of discretion. On appeal, the Government does not attempt to defend the dismissal as a sanction but instead seeks affirmance on the grounds argued below: the constitutionality and propriety of the land classification system. Because the record below does not show whether Jarman had met or could have met the preconditions for an allotment, we decline to reach the issues of the constitutionality and propriety of the land classification. These issues will be decided by the district court, if necessary,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> after the development of the facts.' The issues open on remand will include whether Jar-man has acquired an eligibility certificate and whether he has filed a petition for reclassification of the tracts applied for if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>they are not already classified for public disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Congress had the power to define who was an \u201cIndian\u201d for the purpose of receiving allotments. Under the statutes relating to the Dawes Commission, it defined members of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes for eligibility for allotment of tribal land to include only persons who could trace ancestry to the Dawes Commission rolls. The numerous statutes show an intent that eligibility for allotment of public lands also be limited by the rolls. This eligibility standard is rationally related to Congress\u2019 unique obligation to the Indians, and thus, is constitutional. Since Witt could not qualify under the standard, the summary judgment on his action to enforce allotment rights is affirmed. We reverse the dismissal of Jarman\u2019s action for failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities because there is no indication in the record that any warning of the possibility of dismissal was given or that the district court could not have applied a less drastic sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">The summary judgment against Witt is AFFIRMED. The dismissal as to Jarman is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1217-13\">. The requirement for a petition for reclassification is found in 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2531.2, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-14\">\u00a7 2531.2 Petition and applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbI\">(a) Any person desiring to receive an Indian allotment ... must file with the authorized officer, an application, together with a petition on forms approved by the Director, properly executed, together with a certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>from the authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that the person is [an] Indian and eligible for allotment, as specified in \u00a7 2531.1(b). However, if the lands described in the application have been already classified and opened for disposition under the provisions of this part, no petition is required. The documents must be filed in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 1821.2 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">. Jarman\u2019s action concerns, in part, allegations that the Secretary of the Interior abused his discretion to classify public lands. Without deciding the scope of judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s land classification authority, we note that the discretionary nature of the issues does not deprive the district court of all jurisdiction over Jarman\u2019s action under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345. <em>Pence v. Kleppe, </em>529 F.2d 135, 138-40 (9th Cir. 1976) (Pence I); see <em>Hopkins v. United States, </em>414 F.2d 464 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334.
