Specifically at issue in this case is the forfeitability of insurance proceeds obtained through the conduct of an arson ring. The district court resolved this question of statutory construction in the government\u2019s favor. On appeal a panel of this court reversed the monetary forfeiture orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now affirm the decision reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The facts surrounding the indictment, prosecution, and conviction of the various defendants are set out in detail in the panel opinion, 648 <em>F.2d </em>at 378-80, 409-11 app. Briefly, the evidence showed that a group of individuals associated for the purpose of committing arson with the intent to defraud insurance companies. This association in fact enterprise,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> composed of an insurance adjuster, homeowners, promoters, investors, and arsonists, operated to destroy at least eighteen residential and commercial properties in Tampa and Miami, Florida between July 1973 and April 1976. The panel summarized the ring\u2019s operations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-7\">At first the arsonists only burned buildings already owned by those associated with the ring. Following a burning, the building owner filed an inflated proof of loss statement and collected the insurance proceeds from which his co-conspirators were paid. Later, ring members bought buildings suitable for burning, secured insurance in excess of value and, after a burning, made claims for the loss and divided the proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 380. These activities formed the basis for an indictment charging twenty-three defendants with mail fraud,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conspiring to violate RICO,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and substantive RICO violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a jury trial sixteen defendants were found guilty and sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the forfeiture question was then submitted to the jury for its special verdict on the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture. The jury ordered four defendants to forfeit monies received as insurance payments upon the successful burning of their properties: Paul Guarino\u2014 $4,000.00; Sam C. Martino \u2014 $2,500.00;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rolando G. Rodriguez \u2014 $4,266.83; and Joseph C. Russello \u2014 $340,043.69. Concluding that \u00a7 1963(a)(1) was intended to reach only interests in an enterprise and not the profits or income from racketeering activity, the panel reversed these monetary forfeitures. 648 F.2d at 409.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Resolution of this issue of statutory construction must begin with an analysis of the language of the statute itself. <em>Bread Political Action Committee </em>v. <em>Federal Election Commission, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 1235, 1237, 71 L.Ed.2d 432 (1982) (quoting <em>Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>448 U.S. 176, 187, 100 S.Ct. 2601, 2608, 65 L.Ed.2d 696 (1980)). In the absence of \u201ca clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\u201d the plain language of the statute controls its construction. - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. at 1238 (quoting <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a), a defendant who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApBa\">violates any provision of section 1962 . .. shall forfeit to the United States (1) any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962, and (2) any interests in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over, any enterprise which he has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 1962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">On its face, \u00a7 1963(a)(1) does not limit for-feitable interests to those in an enterprise. Rather, the statute speaks broadly of <em>\u201cany </em>interest\u201d which is the product of violating RICO\u2019s prohibitory provision, section 1962. Significantly, \u00a7 1963(a)(2) expressly limits forfeitable interests to those in an enterprise. Guiding our efforts at statutory construction in the past has been the presumption that \u201cwhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, ... Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wong Kim Bo, </em>472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence the limitation in \u00a7 1963(a)(2), and the absence of limitation in \u00a7 1963(a)(1), confirm what the straightforward language of the latter already tells us: that \u00a7 1963(a)(1) reaches <em>any </em>interest derived from a violation of \u00a7 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">No definition of the term \u201cinterest\u201d appears in RICO. We must assume \u201cthat the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 9, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). The common or dictionary definition of the term includes \u201cright, title, or legal share in something; participation in advantage, profit, and responsibility.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1178 (1971). It has also been defined as \u201c[t]he most general term that can be employed to denote a right, claim, title, or legal share in something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 729 (5th ed. 1979). The concept is therefore broad enough to include profits or income. Indeed, this understanding comports with the House Report\u2019s definition of \u201cinterest\u201d as inclusive of \u201call property and interests, as broadly described, which are related to the violations.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 57, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">Not only is the concept of profits or proceeds within the plain meaning of \u201cinterest,\u201d but the proceeds in question in this case were \u201cacquired ... in violation of section 1962,\u201d as \u00a7 1963(a)(1) requires. The insurance proceeds were the product of the defendants\u2019 violation of \u00a7 1962(e). That section makes it unlawful for \u201cany person .. . associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity .... \u201d In this case, members of the arson ring conducted the affairs of that enterprise through the racketeering offenses of arson and mail fraud. Thus the unambiguous language of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) supports the view that profits derived from a pattern of racketeering activities are subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Defendants and amicus<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> maintain that their position \u2014 that forfeitable interests under \u00a7 1963(a)(1) are limited to interests in an enterprise \u2014 also is supported by the language of the statute. Their analysis of the statute cannot withstand scrutiny. The only express limitation on forfeitable interests imposed by the language of the statute itself is that the interest must be \u201cacquired or maintained in violation of section 1962.\u201d Defendants and amicus, however, read a further limitation into this language. Specifically they argue that \u201cone acquires or maintains an interest in violation of Section 1962 <em>only </em>when he acquires or maintains an interest <em>in contravention of Sections 1962(a) or (b).\u201d </em>Brief for Amicus Curiae at 7 (emphasis added). Briefly, \u00a7 1962(a) proscribes the use or investment of illegally derived income to acquire, establish, or operate an enterprise, while \u00a7 1962(b) prohibits the use of racketeering methods to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendants and amicus argue, the link between the prohibitory provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) and (b), which refer to acquiring or maintaining violations, and the penal provision in \u00a7 1963(a)(1), which refers to interests \u201cacquired or maintained\u201d in violation of RICO, is clear. This reasoning, however, is flawed in several respects. First, it completely ignores \u00a7 1962(c). The language of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) ties forfeiture to violation of <em>any </em>of the prohibitory provisions in \u00a7 1962, not just \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) and (b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Second, the argument of defendants and amicus misconstrues the function of the reference in \u00a7 1963(a)(1) to \u00a7 1962. To be sure, the reference serves a kind of limiting function, but that function is not to define the type of forfeitable interests, as defendants and amicus assume. Rather, the reference merely identifies the illegal activities which trigger the forfeiture penalty, supplying the nexus between the RICO violation and the forfeitable property which the government must establish at trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Third, reading an enterprise limitation into \u00a7 1963(a)(1) renders that section sur-plusage. Section 1963(a)(2) on its face requires forfeiture of \u201cany interest in ... any enterprise which [the defendant] has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 1962.\u201d The establishment, operation, and control language clearly refers to violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) and (b). Section 1963(a)(1) would merely be duplica-tive of this provision if, as defendants contend, it reaches only interests in an enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>prise acquired or maintained in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The cure for these defects in reasoning lies in an examination of the effect of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) on a \u00a7 1962(c) violation. Section 1962(c) makes conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering unlawful. The forfeiture resulting therefrom, under \u00a7 1963(a)(1), is the interest (or interests) acquired through or as a result of that unlawful conduct. Forfeiture of defendant\u2019s interest <em>in </em>the enterprise is governed by the impact of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) and (2) upon \u00a7 1962(a) and (b). If \u00a7 1962(c) results in any forfeiture at all \u2014 and \u00a7 1963(a) provides for forfeiture if one violates <em>any </em>\u00a7 1962 section \u2014 it must provide for forfeiture of something more than \u00a7 1962(a) or (b) or be mere surplusage. This interpretation restores \u00a7 1963(a)(1) to a role in the penalty scheme different from that played by \u00a7 1963(a)(2) and accords with the unambiguous language of the former section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Turning now from the language of the statute itself to expressions of legislative intent, we find confirmation for our view that \u00a7 1963(a)(1) reaches profits derived from racketeering activity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In its Statement of Findings and Purpose prefatory to the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Congress spoke of the problem it sought to resolve in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-7\">(1) organized crime in the United States is a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains billions of dollars from America\u2019s economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption; (2) organized crime <em>derives a major portion of its power through money obtained from such illegal endeavors </em>as syndicated gambling, loan sharking, the theft and fencing of property, the importation and distribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs, and other forms of social exploitation; (3) this money and power are increasingly used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate business and labor unions and to subvert and corrupt our democratic processes; (4) organized crime activities in the United States weaken the stability of the Nation\u2019s economic system, harm innocent investors and competing organizations, interfere with free competition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine the general welfare of the Nation and its citizens ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L.No.91-452, 84 Stat. 922-23 (1970) (emphasis added). Having identified the problem, Congress also determined the cause for the criminal justice system\u2019s failure to make inroads on organized crime and its economic power base and proposed the cure it envisioned the new Act to embody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-12\">[Sjanctions and remedies available to the Government are unnecessarily limited in scope and impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-13\">It is the purpose of this Act to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States by strengthening the legal tools in the evidence-gathering process, by establishing <em>new penal prohibitions, </em>and by providing <em>enhanced sanctions and new remedies </em>to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Id. at 923 (emphasis added). The Senate Committee Report on the bill reiterated this philosophy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-4\">What is needed here, the committee believes, are new approaches that will deal not only with individuals, but also with the economic base through which those individuals constitute such a serious threat to the economic well being of the Nation. In short, an attack must be made on <em>their source of economic power itself, </em>and the attack must take place on all available fronts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">S.Rep.No.617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 79 (1969) (emphasis added). Simply put, Congress\u2019 express objective in RICO is to take the profit out of organized crime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The criminal forfeiture provisions of \u00a7 1963(a) are central to this remedial objective. Section 1963(a) launches a two-pronged attack on the sources of economic power which feed the coffers and activities of organized crime. It demands both divestiture of power over the enterprise itself<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and seizure of the income derived from racketeering activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">From the debates on the Organized Crime Control Act, it is clear that the target of Congress\u2019 attack included racketeering operations in which the chief type of property interest obtained by organized crime would be something other than an ownership or proprietary interest.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For example, the legislative history refers to instances in which organized crime members infiltrate legitimate businesses, \u201cbleed\u201d these companies through fraud or theft, and thus force them into bankruptcy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Organized crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>was also linked to credit card and bad check frauds, 116 Cong.Rec. 970 (1970) (remarks of Sen. Bible), and to theft from welfare and pension funds, 115 Cong.Rec. 5874 (1969) (remarks of Sen. McClellan). The Senate Report cited examples of arson schemes, particularly in the context of liquidating defaulted loan shark debts by burning the debtor\u2019s property and collecting the insurance proceeds. S.Rep.No.617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (1969). <em>See also </em>115 Cong.Rec. 5873 (1969) (remarks of Sen. McClellan). Narcotics trafficking, loan sharking, insurance fraud, extortion, gambling, and prostitution \u2014 all crimes in which the proceeds primarily consist of money\u2014 were all objects of congressional concern.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In addition, when as here the RICO enterprise is an association in fact, rather than a legal entity, and the alleged RICO violation is conducting the affairs of this enterprise through racketeering methods, there often may be no forfeitable property other than the ill-gotten proceeds. Such may be the case not only with arson-for-profit rings but also with narcotics trafficking or pornography operations. It would certainly be contrary to Congress\u2019 stated intention to attack organized crime\u2019s source of economic power \u201con all available fronts,\u201d S.Rep.No.617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 79 (1969), to insulate from forfeiture the sole product of many racketeering activities. Excluding proceeds from the reach of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) would provide an incentive, not a deterrent, to bankruptcy schemes and to other forms of racketeering which yield primarily cash revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Still further support for a broad interpretation of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) is found in the legislative history.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> An early draft of RICO, S. 1861, which was introduced on April 18, 1969, contained only one basic forfeiture provision and did expressly limit forfeitable property to interests in an enterprise. It read in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both, and shall forfeit to the United States all interest <em>in the enterprise </em>engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">S. 1861, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). In mid-October, however, the Senate Judiciary Committee began a revision of RICO. Out of the revision developed a section 1963(a) containing two subparts. Section 1963(a)(2) retained the concept of limiting forfeiture to a defendant\u2019s interest in an enterprise. On the other hand, section 1963(a)(1) dropped the enterprise limitation altogether. We find it persuasive that Congress considered limiting all forfeitures under RICO to enterprise interests but, after extensive legislative work, ultimately opted to delete this across-the-board restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Finally, in examining the legislative history we must address one of the chief reasons cited by the panel for its conclusion that \u00a7 1963(a)(1) does not reach the insurance proceeds at issue here. In August 1969 Congress received a letter from then Deputy Attorney General Richard P. Klein-dienst commenting upon RICO\u2019s forfeiture provision. It expressed the views of the Justice Department as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">It is felt that this revival of the concept of forfeiture as a criminal penalty, <em>limited. as it is in Section 1963(a) to one\u2019s interest in the enterprise </em>which is the subject of the specific offense involved here, and not extending to any other property of the convicted offender, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>matter of Congressional wisdom rather than of constitutional power ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_2\"><em>Measures Relating to Organized Crime, Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>91st Cong., 1st Sess. 407 (1969) (emphasis added). The panel viewed the letter as indicative of congressional intent strictly to limit forfeitures. This interpretation of the letter\u2019s significance, however, ignores its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">First, Congress was aware that it was entering new territory with the enactment of RICO; there was concern particularly over the constitutionality of the sanction of in personam criminal forfeiture.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Kleindienst letter addresses that concern, explaining that constitutional problems are avoided by the requirement of a nexus between a \u00a7 1962 violation and the interest to be forfeited. Furthermore, the letter was submitted as a commentary on S. 1861, the original draft of RICO, which, as we have noted above, contained a unitary forfeiture provision with an express enterprise limitation. While the Senate Report on S. 30, the bill ultimately enacted, does cite Klein-dienst\u2019s letter,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> nothing in the report suggests that the letter provides a technical commentary on the scope of each section of the expanded bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Our more limited interpretation of the meaning of the Kleindienst letter finds support in the Justice Department\u2019s comments in subsequent House hearings on S. 30 as it passed the Senate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-12\">[Title IX] contains a provision for the forfeiture of any interest which has been attained in violation of the criminal provisions of the statute. The Department of Justice commented at length <em>upon the constitutionality of this sanction </em>in a report on S. 1861, from which Title IX has been derived, in [the Kleindienst letter]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\"><em>Hearings on S. 30 Before Subcomm. No. 5 of the House Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>91st Cong., 2d Sess. 171 (1970) (emphasis added). Notably, the Justice Department\u2019s comments on S. 30 do not describe \u00a7 1963(a) forfeitures as limited to interests in an enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Our holding today squarely conflicts with that of the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Marubeni America Corp., </em>611 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>But see United States </em>v. <em>Godoy, </em>678 F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that commercial real estate purchased with profits derived from racketeering activity is subject to forfeiture). For several reasons, some of which we have already discussed,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>we find the <em>Marubeni </em>rationale unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In <em>Marubeni </em>the Ninth Circuit focused much of its attention on the \u201c1% investment exception\u201d in \u00a7 1962(a). <em>Id. </em>at 766-67. To the general prohibition in \u00a7 1962(a) on investment of income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity Congress added an exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-5\">A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors of the issuer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a) (1976). From this the Ninth Circuit reasoned: \u201cCongress would not have established rules for the investment of racketeering income, enforced by the penalty of criminal forfeiture, if it intended the government to seize that income regardless of how it was used.\u201d 611 F.2d at 767. Our interpretation of \u00a7 1963(a)(1) does not, as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s comment would imply, render \u00a7 1962(a)\u2019s 1% investment exception meaningless. We believe that the court in <em>Marubeni </em>obscured the separate functions of the prohibitory and penalty provisions of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">The 1% investment exception evidences Congress\u2019 choice <em>not to criminalize </em>the investment of illegally derived income when the total investment is <em>de minimis </em>and thus would not grant the racketeer control over the business entity. So understood the exception functions as a practical limit, exempting from prosecution what otherwise would constitute illegal activity under \u00a7 1962(a). If the investment of illegally derived income constitutes less than 1% of the issuer\u2019s outstanding shares, that investment alone violates no criminal proscription and hence triggers no forfeiture at all. The exception thus limits the definition of what is illegal. It does not immunize from forfeiture the fruits of activities that are made illegal under other provisions of \u00a7. 1962; it \u201cdoes not create a class of investment of illicit income exempt from forfeiture.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">The court in <em>Marubeni </em>also points to the use of the term \u201cprofits\u201d in the forfeiture provision of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a)(2)(A),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> as evidence that Congress would have expressed itself more clearly in \u00a7 1963(a)(1) if it had intended forfeiture of racketeering income. 611 F.2d at 766 n.7. As we observed above, the concept of \u201cinterest\u201d is broad and encompasses the notion of profits. Moreover, Congress\u2019 use of differing language for the two forfeiture provisions, with the more comprehensive term employed in RICO, is a logical byproduct of the different evils addressed by the two acts. Under attack in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 is the narcotics trafficking industry in which organized crime is engaged. The continued dealing in illegal drugs which is proscribed by that Act typically involves cash transactions. By contrast, the interests acquired by violating RICO may take a variety of forms since many types of activity, primarily economic crimes, come within the scope of its prohibitions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (Supp. IV. 1980) (definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d). Hence Congress\u2019 use of \u201cprofits\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a)(2)(A) cannot support the negative inference the court in <em>Marubeni </em>perceived it to have as to the meaning of \u201cinterest\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">At oral argument a question was raised as to whether the government has an obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>gation to trace and identify the current form of monetary proceeds before it may collect on a forfeiture order. Clearly this issue goes to collectibility and related procedures and not to the type of interests for-feitable under \u00a7 1963(a)(1). The parties did not brief this issue, and we do not resolve it today. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(c)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(b)(2),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the district court must determine the terms and conditions under which the defendants must comply with the monetary forfeitures declared in the special jury verdict and affirmed by our holding today. Because on remand the district judge must undertake this task, we make a few observations on the nature of the questions with which he must grapple. Focusing on the <em>in personam </em>character of RICO criminal forfeiture, the government contends in a supplemental letter to this court that it has no obligation whatever at this point<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to trace the insurance proceeds into their current form. According to the government, the monetary forfeiture order is like any other money judgment, permitting it to satisfy the judgment from any of the defendants\u2019 current assets.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Commentators, on the other hand, have suggested that normal principles of restitution, particularly the theories of constructive trust and equitable lien, should be applied to trace forfeitable property that has changed form.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We intimate no views on the question, leaving it for the district court to determine in the first instance if the issue be raised there.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">RICO is a powerful and flexible weapon designed to break the economic power of organized crime and hence to undermine its ability to disrupt and drain the national economy. We acknowledge that its breadth supplies a potential for great abuse. The harshness of the statute's impact, however, cannot dictate the proper construction of its provisions. Congress was aware of the far-reaching measures it was enacting to deal with the unprecedented problem of organized crime. The plain language of the statute, its remedial and deterrent purposes, and the legislative history all compel the conclusion that \u00a7 1963(a)(1) encompasses forfeiture of the income or proceeds of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">The judgment of the district court on the forfeiture issue is</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">.

The government directs our attention to RICO\u2019s liberal construction clause, arguing that it provides a definitive guide to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1963(a)(1). In that clause Congress has mandated that \u201c[t]he provisions of [RICO] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L.No.91-A52, \u00a7 904(a), 84 Stat. 947 (1970). In response the defendants and amicus contend that following this congressional directive would violate the rule of lenity, which calls for strict construction of penal provisions. We need not resolve the suggested conflict because we find no ambiguity in the statute which would occasion the invocation of either of these interpretive aids. The rule of lenity \u201conly serves as an aid for resolving an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Callanan v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961); <em>see McElroy v.

McClellan). Senator McClellan further commented: \u201cTitle IX attacks the problem by providing a means of wholesale removal of organized crime from our organizations, prevention of their return, and, where possible, <em>forfeiture of their ill-gotten gains.\" </em>116 Cong.Rec. 591 (1970) (remarks of Sen. McClellan) (emphasis added). Representative Poff, a manager of the bill in the House, viewed the criminal forfeiture provision as more than a penalty. \u201cAfter conviction, the ill-gotten gains must be forfeited to the Government. This sanction is not only poetic justice but a strong deterrent as well.\u201d 115 Cong.Rec. 9951 (1969). Senator Byrd, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also spoke of the deterrence effected by the broad forfeiture sanctions: \u201cBy removing its leaders from positions of ownership, by preventing them and their associates from regaining control, <em>and by visiting heavy economic sanctions on their predatory business practices </em>this legislation should prove to be a mighty deterrent to any further expansion of organized crime\u2019s economic power.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 607 (1970) (remarks of Sen.

As Judge Hill notes in footnote 23, the framers of the Constitution demonstrated their repudiation of the harsh English tradition of criminal forfeiture, and our very first Congress forbade the forfeiture of an estate because of a criminal conviction. Further, a forfeiture with an <em>in personam </em>application, as we have before us, is to be most charily assessed.

In enacting RICO, Congress ordained a criminal statute of vast scope and stern consequences, aimed at punishing and deterring those who would wreak havoc in the social and economic fabric of our society.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">The penalties to which Congress subjected a violator of RICO, as set forth in \u00a7 1963, include a fine of up to $25,000, imprisonment of up to 20 years, and the forfeiture to the United States of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-12\">(1) any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962, and (2) any interest in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over, any enterprise which he has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 1962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a)(1) &amp; (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">The court today concludes that the word \u201cinterest,\u201d as here used, includes income or profits derived from a pattern of racketeering activity. I do not share that conclusion, adhering to the view expressed in the panel opinion that the term \u201cinterest,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1963(a)(1), applies only to an interest in the enterprises envisioned in \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a), (b) and (c) and not to income derived from illegal activity. Whether this distinction is wise, prudent or appropriate is, as I perceive it, a matter best left to the legislative branch, for it represents a significant policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">The interests to be forfeited under \u00a7 1963(a)(1) are those acquired or main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>tamed in violation of \u00a7 1962. Section 1962(a) prohibits acquiring, establishing or operating \u201can enterprise\u201d with income derived \u201cfrom a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d The exception contained in this section sharply focuses the pith of the entire section \u2014 money oozing from a pattern of racketeering activity, or resulting from collection of an unlawful debt, may not be used to infiltrate legitimate businesses unless the investment is made under certain limiting circumstances and constitutes less than 1% of the business\u2019s outstanding securities. This section prohibits the investment of tainted funds in a legitimate enterprise. Congress determined to place the protective mantle of the federal criminal law around legitimate businesses, guarding them from the corruption inherent in soiled funds. Section 1962(b) proscribes the acquiring or maintaining of an interest in or control of an enterprise through racketeering activity or by collection of an unlawful debt. Subsection (c) proscribes the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise through racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection. Recently, the Supreme Court made clear that subsections (b) and (c) apply to both legitimate and illegitimate associations. <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">I am persuaded that the forfeiture sanction intended by \u00a7 1963(a)(1) relates to interests in a business acquired with tainted money (\u00a7 1962(a)), and interests in any enterprise acquired or maintained by racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection, (\u00a7 1962(b)). I am further persuaded that \u00a7 1963(a)(2) relates primarily to an interest in an enterprise which is involved in conduct violative of \u00a7 1962(c). To me, the text of these sections clearly reflects that Congress made interests in enterprises the grist of forfeiture. The sections seek to prevent the use of ill-gotten gains to corrupt businesses, to prevent the acquiring and maintaining of an interest in an enterprise through illegal activities, and to prevent the involvement of enterprises in illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">There are other reasons to believe that Congress did not intend \u201cincome\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cinterest\u201d for the purposes of forfeiture under \u00a7 1963. Although the definitional section, \u00a7 1961, does not include the specific meaning to be ascribed to \u201cinterest\u201d or \u201cincome,\u201d the term \u201cany interest\u201d and the word \u201cinterest\u201d appear in several places throughout the statute. Section 1961(3) refers to a \u201clegal or beneficial interest in property.\u201d Section 1962(a) refers to \u201cany interest in .. . any enterprise.\u201d Section 1962(b) repeats the words \u201cany interest in ... any enterprise.\u201d Further, \u00a7 1964(a), the civil remedies section, prescribes that the court may order a person \u201cto divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise.\u201d In each instance the meaning is clear \u2014 an \u201cinterest\u201d is an interest <em>in an enterprise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">The panel found persuasive the analysis of our colleagues of the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Marubeni America Corp., </em>611 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1980), who concluded that the forfeiture in RICO extends only to interests in an enterprise and does not include income or proceeds from a pattern of racketeering activity. I continue to be of that view and also find persuasive the discussion in <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>474 F.Supp. 134 (N.D.Ga.1979) and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>432 F.Supp. 456 (S.D.Pa.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The majority concludes that \u201creading an enterprise limitation into \u00a7 1963(a)(1) renders that section surplusage.\u201d I disagree. One example underscores the error in this suggestion. Hypothesize that an individual uses income from racketeering activity to purchase 2% of the stock of a corporation listed on the stock exchange. The investment is totally passive; no element of control or influence envisioned by \u00a7 1963(a)(2) is involved. This interest would not be forfeitable under \u00a7 1963(a)(2), but it would be forfeitable under \u00a7 1963(a)(1) since the acquisition violates \u00a7 1962(a). The recognition of an enterprise limitation in \u00a7 1963(a)(1) does not, therefore, render that section surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The court today is not impressed with a portion of the legislative history cited by the panel, specifically the August 1969 letter from Deputy Attorney General Richard P. Kleindienst, in part because the letter specifically addressed another pending RICO proposal, S. 1861. Although acknowledging that the Kleindienst letter is cited in the Senate Report on S. 30, the enacted bill, the opinion maintains that the letter provides little meaningful guidance on the scope of the legislation as finally adopted. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Although the Kleindienst letter refers to S. 1861, the Senate Report on S. 30 cites the letter as an accurate interpretation of the forfeiture clause. S.Rep.No.91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 78-80 (1969). That report, in explaining the forfeiture provision, notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">Section 1963 provides criminal penalties for the violation of section 1962, above. Subsection (a) provides the remedy of criminal forfeiture .... The language is designed to accomplish a forfeiture of any \u201cinterest\u201d of any type <em>in the enterprise </em>acquired by the defendant or in which the defendant has participated in violation of section 1962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 160. Accord, <em>id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">We find similar language in the House Report which speaks to forfeiture of interest \u201cin an enterprise.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.91-1549, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 35 and 57 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 4007, 4010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">The essence of the forfeiture grounds a further reason for my disagreement with the en banc court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1963 allows for forfeiture of monies received as insurance proceeds. Although general forfeitures are historically disfavored, Congress has frequently used the onus of specific forfeitures in combating illegal activities. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 11 (forfeiture of property acquired in violation of anti-trust laws); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1177 (forfeiture of property used in connection with illegal gambling); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 65, 117(d), 128, 171, 256c, 4081 (forfeiture of guns and other equipment used unlawfully in national parks); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 (forfeiture of firearms used illegally); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082 (forfeiture of property used in connection with illegal gambling); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612 (forfeiture of bribe monies illegally received by public officials); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3615 (forfeiture of property used in connection with liquor violations); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617(d) (forfeiture of vehicles and aircraft seized for a violation of liquor laws); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3618 &amp; 3619 (forfeiture of conveyances used to introduce intoxicants into Indian territories); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306 (forfeiture of unwholesome imported meat); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1453 &amp; 1492 (forfeiture of property seized in violation of customs laws); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334 (forfeiture of adulterated food); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 490 (forfeiture of funds illegally withheld by public official); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781 &amp; 782 (forfeiture of vessels, vehicles and aircraft used to transport contraband). In each of these instances, the forfeiture statutes provided for <em>in rem </em>actions against things put to illegal use. Although RICO prescribed an <em>in personam </em>forfeiture, it does not provide an unlimited sanction but is, I believe, restricted to the forfeiture of a specific interest in an enterprise which was acquired, or over which the defendant exercised control, contrary to \u00a7 1962. If Congress had intended otherwise, I am convinced it would have said so clearly and unequivocally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">No strangers to forfeitures generally, Congress is also no stranger to forfeitures of fruits and profits. If Congress meant to impose a forfeiture of income and proceeds in RICO, I suggest Congress could and would have done so in unmistakeable language. Congress knows how to decisively direct the forfeiture of profits. The same Congress which adopted RICO, in a matter of days adopted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a)(2) states: \u201cAny person who is convicted under paragraph (1) of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise shall forfeit to the United States \u2014 (A) <em>the profits </em>obtained by him in such enterprise .... \u201d (emphasis added). That is the kind of specification one would expect Congress to use when creating our first <em>in personam </em>forfeiture statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">The court today would distinguish this variance in Congressional approach by observing that narcotics trafficking typically involves cash transactions while RICO violations result in interests which take a variety of forms. I disagree with so light a rejection of what I see as a meaningful, instructive variant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">Based on the foregoing, I am of the view that Congress did not intend to include in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>the \u00a7 1963(a)(1) forfeiture provision, fire insurance proceeds or other fruits and profits obtained from RICO proscribed activities, other than those which are manifested as interests in one of the enterprises described in \u00a7 1962. I am cognizant that this conclusion occasions problems with respect to associations in which one cannot own a legal interest, as in the case <em>sub judice. </em>This limitation was recognized by the Justice Department in its comments on the legislation, when it observed that \u201cthere is often nothing to forfeit ... in the case of individuals associated in fact.\u201d <em>Forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 </em>\u2014 RICO\u2019s <em>Most Powerful Weapon, </em>17 <em>Am.Crim.L.Rev. </em>379, 391 (1980) <em>(quoting </em>U.S. Department of Justice, Explanation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Statute 2 (4th ed.)). Under my analysis, the kind of enterprise necessarily would be critical in the determination of forfeitable interests. That this poses an enforcement burden or hurdle is, again, a legislative consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Finally, accepting the proposition that insurance proceeds are forfeitable, I question whether the forfeiture sanction is applicable to Russello and Rodriguez. These two defendants owned and insured buildings before the advent of the RICO arson ring. They later participated and feloniously burned their properties. The insurance proceeds may be taken as a different manifestation of a pre-RICO violation asset. If so, are the insurance payments truly income, fruits, revenue or profits of racketeering activities?</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Regardless, these proceeds, based on arson and the payments of which were induced by fraud, are very likely to be defea-sible. One would expect that under the insurance contract, and controlling state law, the insurer would be entitled to recapture the payments. In that event, what happens to the forfeiture decrees which are non-asset oriented money judgments, collectible from the defendants and their estates? Assuming recapture by the insurer, or diversion of all or a portion to an innocent third party such as a mortgage holder, will the United States still have an enforceable money judgment against the defendant and his estate? Presumably so, and if that presumption is correct, what about the concept of divestiture of ill-gotten gains and the separation of the convict\u00e9d defendant from the fruits of his illegal labors? Will this matter not in fact resolve into the forfeiture becoming an additional fine? Did Congress really intend to establish a latent fine with a potential for exceeding the maximum statutorily stated fine tenfold, twenty-fold or one hundred-fold?</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">I suggest that this type of difficulty is inherent in today\u2019s decision and is a direct concomitant of our holding that the forfei-table interest under \u00a7 1963(a)(1) extends beyond a present, discernible interest in an existing enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
