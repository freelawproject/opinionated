Pub.L.No. 97-34 \u00a7 101(a) (Aug. 13, 1981). Here we encounter complications engendered by the application of a similar distinction for purposes of determination of qualification before retirement, and entitlement after retirement, for social security retirement insurance benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">Thomas E. Bunch was a soybean farmer and the proprietor of a mobile home park in the years before his retirement. By treating the earnings from his mobile home park as the product of self-employment rather than as investment income, Bunch was able to qualify for social security benefits by the time of his retirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Presumably Bunch was satisfied to subject the income to self-employment taxes in light of the anticipated social security retirement benefits which he would ultimately realize.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">However, Bunch came close to being hoist with his own petard. In 1977 he retired from soybean farming, but continued to operate the trailer park. He reached age 62 on January 27, 1978, and elected to take early retirement under the social security laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">If, following retirement, someone otherwise qualified has self-employment income, it may diminish or eliminate the entitle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ment to social security retirement benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For 1978 the mobile home park income, if treated as self-employment income, was sufficient to eliminate altogether Bunch\u2019s entitlement to benefits. Attempting to escape that consequence, Bunch incorporated the business shortly after his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We first observe that, since Bunch\u2019s activities before and after incorporation were substantially the same, the incorporation of his business had no effect on the treatment of his income. The secretary is not required to give effect to form rather than substance. <em>See Gordon v. Finch, </em>437 F.2d 253, 257 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Ludeking v. Finch, </em>421 F.2d 499, 502 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the income from the mobile home park was not self-employment income. The applicable regulation appears at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1082 (d)(2). It generally defines the circumstances in which the rental of living quarters (including tourist camps or tourist homes) also involves provision of services which are sufficient to require inclusion of the income for purposes of ascertaining net earnings from self-employment. The pertinent language reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">We consider the supplying of maid service to be a service provided to the occupant. However, we do not consider the furnishing of heat and light, the cleaning of public entrances, exists, stairways and lobbies <em>and the collection of trash, </em>as services provided to the occupant. (Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">Under the established practice, Bunch devoted approximately eighty hours <em>per an-num </em>to the mobile home park\u2019s affairs. His wife collected the rents. Each tenant had the responsibility himself or herself to hook up to the plumbing and electric facilities provided by the landlord, and each paid utility bills directly to the company providing them. No maintenance was afforded by Bunch insofar as the street serving the park was concerned. Bunch did arrange for collections of trash, including garbage, to be made from the premises of each tenant. However, cleanliness of the space and grass mowing were the responsibilities of the tenant. Bunch did not make available to lessees laundry facilities or other amenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">The sole service provided by Bunch\u2014 trash collection \u2014 is, by regulation, expressly excluded from consideration. The rental income, accordingly, is not self-employment income, and may not be included in ascertaining maximum allowable earnings. <em>Cf. Maloney v. Celebrezze, </em>337 F.2d 231, 233 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Of course, Bunch will welcome the consequent reversal. However, he may merely be leaving the rigors of the frying pan for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the immolation of the fire. Without expressing any opinion one way or the other as to the extent of the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the present stage of the proceedings, we direct the district judge to remand the matter to the Secretary to permit inquiry into whether the question may now be pursued and, if so, whether the rental income from the mobile home park prior to Bunch\u2019s sixty-second birthday was the same in character, and hence not the result of self-employment. The purpose of the inquiry would be to determine whether there may be, and, if so, whether there should be, a redetermination of Bunch\u2019s qualification for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\">. See <em>Delno v. Celebrezze, </em>347 F.2d 159, 163 n.10 (9th Cir. 1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cCongress realized that the income of self-employed persons is in most instances a combination of income from both labor and invested capital, and deliberately chose not to attempt the difficult, if not impossible, task of separating one from the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-20\">.

If the owner performs additional services of such substantial nature that compensation for them can be said to constitute a material part of the payment made by the tenant, the \u2018rent\u2019 received then consists in part of income attributable to the performance of labor which is not incidental to the realization of return from investment. In such circumstances, the entire payment is to be included in computing the recipient\u2019s net earnings from self-employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0nJ\">The collection of trash, including garbage, is a service required to maintain the space in condition for occupancy, a performance of labor incidental to the realization of return from investment. As the regulation explicitly recognizes, collection of trash is not so substantial in nature as to render compensation for that service a material part of the tenant\u2019s rental payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
