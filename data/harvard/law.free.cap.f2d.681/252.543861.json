(\u201cValley\u201d), filed an application with the respondent, the Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), for authority to provide passenger and package express bus service to specified points over regular routes in southeastern Texas. Valley also requested, in its application, authority to conduct special party and charter operations between points in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and New Mexico. The petitioners, all members of the Trailways Bus System (\u201cTrailways\u201d), opposed Valley\u2019s application. Despite Trailways\u2019 protest, the Commission granted Valley the requested authority. By this petition, Trailways seeks judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">Trailways contends that the Commission acted arbitrarily, capriciously, contrary to law, in excess of its statutory authority, and without the support of substantial evidence: (1) by denying Trailways an oral hearing on this matter, as Trailways had requested; (2) by failing to make necessary subsidiary factual findings; (3) by concluding that \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d justified issuance of a permit for the proposed regular route service; and (4) by concluding that Valley was entitled to a permit authorizing the proposed special party and charter service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">None of Trailways\u2019 arguments require extensive discussion. As to the refusal to grant an oral hearing in regard to Valley\u2019s application, Trailways concedes, as it must, that the decision whether to grant an oral hearing is a matter for the Commission\u2019s discretion. Trailways contends that it was entitled to an oral hearing because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>material facts were in dispute. However, the Commission\u2019s policy is <em>not </em>to grant an oral hearing in every case where there are disputed issues of material fact. Rather, the Commission handles application proceedings without oral argument \u201cif at all possible,\u201d with oral hearings limited to \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1100.-251(c) &amp; .252(f)(1). Under its rules, the Commission may, in its discretion, hear a case under the so-called \u201cmodified procedure,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>without an oral hearing, \u201cif it appears that <em>substantially all </em>important issues of material fact may be resolved by means of written materials and that the efficient disposition of the proceeding can be made without oral hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1100.43 (emphasis added). Although there clearly were disputed issues in this case, Trailways does not point to any issue of material fact as to which oral hearing was necessary for its efficient disposition, even though (as Trailways suggests) the testimony of isolated witnesses might have been weakened by cross-examination as to details. We cannot say that the Commission abused its discretion by failing to grant Trailways\u2019 request for an oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">We also find meritless Trailways\u2019 contention that the Commission\u2019s decision granting the requested authority to Valley does not include sufficient subsidiary factual findings. The Commission\u2019s decision need not be \u201ccrystalline;\u201d it is sufficient if the opinion \u201cenable[s] the parties and this Court to understand the decision granting the applications.\u201d <em>Central Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>669 F.2d 1063, 1074 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Alamo Express, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>673 F.2d 852, at 858, 860 (5th Cir. 1982) (5th Cir. 1982). The Commission\u2019s opinion in the present case, though rather brief, adequately sets forth the Commission\u2019s rationale. It is clear that the Commission found persuasive Valley\u2019s evidence that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d would be served by the granting of the application, and found unpersuasive Trailways\u2019 evidence that it would be substantially harmed by a grant of the requested authority. In summary, \u201cwe can discern in the Commission\u2019s opinion a rational basis for its treatment of the evidence, and the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 test does not require more.\u201d <em>Central Freight Lines, supra, </em>669 F.2d at 1074, <em>quoting Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 290, 95 S.Ct. 438, 444, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In support of its application, Valley presented the verified statements of Valley\u2019s president, three expert witnesses, and over 100 prospective users of Valley\u2019s proposed service. All of these witnesses supported Valley\u2019s contention that \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d justified the granting of the requested permit for the proposed service. Trailways nevertheless argues that the Commission\u2019s decision to grant the permit is not supported by substantial evidence, because the statements of Valley\u2019s witnesses are \u201cvague, general and indefinite.\u201d However, after carefully reviewing all of the evidence, we conclude that there was more than ample evidence from which the Commission could have concluded, as it did, that the granting of the requested authority was warranted under the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard. Trailways simply asks this court to reweigh the evidence, which it is not our function to do. <em>See Alamo Express, supra, </em>673 F.2d at 861; <em>East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. United States, </em>593 F.2d 691, 697 n.11 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The only contention raised by Trailways that is even arguably meritorious is the assertion that the Commission did not properly handle Valley\u2019s request for authority to conduct special party and charter service between points in Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy Counties, Texas, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, points in Lafayette and Bossier Parishes, Louisiana, Hot Springs County, Arkansas, and Lincoln County, New Mexico. The named counties in Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico have horse racing tracks, and apparently the primary reason why Valley requested this authority was to provide residents of the named Texas counties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>charter and special party service to and from the racetracks. In addition, Valley hopes that tourist groups in the named counties and parishes of Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico will utilize this charter service to come to south Texas for vacations. Trailways contends that there was \u201cabsolutely <em>no evidence </em>of support or need for charter authority to or from any point in this proceeding.\u201d Moreover, Trailways contends that, by stating in its opinion that the charter and special party portion of the Valley application was \u201cessentially unopposed\u201d by Trailways, the Commission misrepresented Trailways\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Trailways errs in its assertion that no evidence whatsoever supported Valley\u2019s application for the charter and special party service. While it is true that Valley did not present the testimony of any potential user of this proposed service, this portion of Valley\u2019s application was supported by the verified statements of Valley\u2019s president and two of Valley\u2019s expert witnesses. <em>See </em>Far-ris statement at 34-36; Stafford statement, at 11-12, 47 \u2014 48; Davis statement, at 9. The testimony of these witnesses is sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe evidence of record establishes a public need for applicant\u2019s [special party and charter] operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Commission did perhaps go a bit too far by characterizing Valley\u2019s application for charter and special party authority as \u201cessentially unopposed.\u201d However, Trailways\u2019 opposition to this portion of Valley\u2019s application was far from wholehearted. Trailways\u2019 vice president did mention in his verified statement that Trailways had the ability to serve those in need of interstate charter service. In an appendix to this verified statement, the witness presented a table purporting to show that the granting of Valley\u2019s application would cause Trailways to lose 50 percent of its interstate charter revenue. <em>See </em>Myers statement at 12, 19, appendix T \u2014 4. However, the table that allegedly proved that Trailways would lose charter business did not include any indicia that Trailways had ever earned any charter revenue by way of service to or from points that would be served by Valley pursuant to its application. Trailways\u2019 charter traffic evidenced by its table could not possibly be subject to diversion by Valley, because Valley has not sought authority to conduct charter operations to or from any of the arrival or destination points mentioned on Trailways\u2019 table. Thus, because Trailways in fact presented no evidence that it would lose any revenues as a result of the granting of the proposed charter and special party authority, the Commission was not entirely inaccurate in characterizing this portion of Valley\u2019s application as \u201cessentially unopposed.\u201d Accordingly, we cannot characterize the Commission\u2019s decision to grant the requested charter and special party authority as arbitrary, capricious, or in any way improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">All of Trailways\u2019 arguments are without merit. The order of the Commission granting Valley\u2019s application is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ACm\">. Trailways originally contended that the Commission acted improperly by granting Valley regular route authority in excess of that which was applied for by Valley. However, after the Commission agreed that the only authority granted to Valley was that published in the Federal Register, Trailways declined to pursue this issue further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
