They allege that they sold a parcel of land to Torre de Caparra Corp. (TCC), receiving cash and a first mortgage in the amount of $111,500 at six percent interest. TCC also mortgaged the property to Continental Mortgage Investors and one of the defendant-appellees, Chicago Title Insurance Co. (CTI). Under its mortgage, CTI guaranteed completion of construction of an apartment building on the land and issued a performance bond with a third party beneficiary clause in favor of plaintiffs guaranteeing that plaintiffs would collect their mortgage credits. Plaintiffs allege that on the basis of CTI\u2019s representations about these guaranties, they subordinated their mortgage to that of CTI. TCC then entered into a refinancing agreement with the other defendant-appellee, First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Puerto Rico (First Federal). Plaintiffs subordinated their mortgage to First Federal\u2019s new mortgage on the condition that the performance bond and guaranties of completion by CTI would remain in effect. Defendants, according to plaintiffs, then cancelled the bond and guaranties. First Federal foreclosed on its mortgage; plaintiffs received nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">Plaintiffs brought suit in federal court, asserting that jurisdiction lay under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (federal statutes regulating commerce). They later amended the complaint to add an additional jurisdictional ground, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632. The district court denied jurisdiction under section 1332 because of lack of complete diversity and under section 1337 because plaintiffs asserted no claim under a federal statute. As to section 632, the district court determined that it did not apply because Puerto Rico is not \u201ca dependency or insular possession of the United States\u201d for purposes of acts relating to national banks. <em>Conjugal Soc\u2019y v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>497 F.Supp. 41 (D.P.R.1979). We reversed on the section 632 ruling. <em>Conjugal Soc\u2019y v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>646 F.2d 688 (1st Cir. 1981) (per curiam); <em>see First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Ruiz de Jesus, </em>644 F.2d 910 (1st Cir. 1981). On remand, the district court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>jurisdiction still did not lie under section 632 because plaintiffs had alleged fraud, which sounded in tort and which did not come within \u201ctraditional banking activities,\u201d the only transactions encompassed by section 632, <em>Diaz v. Pan American Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>635 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1980). <em>Conjugal Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>525 F.Supp. 268 (D.P.R.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The procedural mechanism for dismissal below was a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion by defendants. The district court based its order on a reading of the complaint, and, accordingly, \u201cwe consider only those facts and allegations set forth in the complaint and must view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Cserr, </em>544 F.2d 1121, 1122 (1st Cir. 1976) (reviewing 12(b)(6) order). We have no occasion to address a subsidiary point raised briefly by plaintiffs, whether they were improperly precluded from introducing evidence on the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We recently considered the scope of section 632 in <em>Diaz v. Pan American Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>635 F.2d 30. We held that a district court could not entertain, under section 632, a suit that charged the malicious or negligent filing of a criminal complaint as a result of plaintiffs alleged passing of bad checks. <em>Id. </em>at 32. Section 632 reaches only traditional banking activities, not all cases in which a bank organized under federal law is a party. <em>Id. </em>Banking activities covered by section 632 include mortgage agreements, <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(c) (federal savings and loan associations), and foreclosures on mortgages, <em>Chase Manhattan Bk. (N.A.) v. Corporacion Hotelera, </em>516 F.2d 1047, 1048 n.1 (1st Cir. 1975) (per curiam); <em>First Nat\u2019l City Bk. v. Gonzalez &amp; Co. Suer. Corp., </em>308 F.Supp. 596, 599 (D.P.R.1970); <em>see First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Zequeira, </em>305 F.Supp. 37, 39 (D.P.R.1969). <em>But cf. Gonzalez-Roman v. Federal Land Bk., </em>303 F.Supp. 482, 483 (D.P.R.1969) (action challenging prior foreclosure proceeding was attack on earlier federal judgment and did not arise from transaction involving banking). Section 632 is not limited to the original two parties to a banking transaction. In <em>Corporacion Venezolana de Fomento v. Vintero Sales Corp., </em>629 F.2d 786 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 863, 66 L.Ed.2d 804 (1981), the guarantor of notes sold by the maker to obtain letters of credit from a bank was allowed to sue the bank under section 632 for allowing alleged wrongful drawdowns against the letters, <em>id. </em>at 792. Section 632 jurisdiction also exists over a claim by one cosignor of a letter of guaranty against another cosignor contesting the validity of the letter, when the letter was relied upon by a bank in granting a loan. <em>National City Bk. v. Puig, </em>106 F.Supp. 1, 2-3 (D.P.R.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">According to the complaint in the instant case, plaintiffs agreed to a subordinate mortgage position in exchange for protection \u2014 a performance bond and a guaranty of completion \u2014 offered by defendants. The seniority of defendants\u2019 mortgages was an important factor in the mortgage transactions that defendants entered into;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indeed, First Federal is effectively required to take only first mortgages, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.6(a), (b)(1). Plaintiffs have no unconditional rights or obligations directly under the mortgage agreements between TCC and CTI and between TCC and First Federal, but they are third parties whose subordinate position was central to CTI\u2019s and First Federal\u2019s decisions to enter into the mortgage agreements. <em>Cf. Corporacion Venezolana de Fomento v. Vintero Sales Corp., </em>629 F.2d 786; <em>National City Bk. v. Puig, </em>106 F.Supp. 1. Defendants\u2019 assurances to plaintiffs thus constituted part of defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>banking transactions, and the alleged wrongful termination of those assurances was part of the mortgage foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">CTI suggests that section 632 jurisdiction is absent because the gist of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is negligence and conspiracy which by themselves bear no relationship to banking. Plaintiffs allege essentially, however, that they were denied rights provided by the guaranty and the performance bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether' defendants\u2019 acts are viewed as ones in tort or contract, plaintiffs\u2019 rights are alleged to have arisen out of defendants\u2019 mortgage agreements and thus out of a transaction involving banking within the meaning of section 632. Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to invoke section 632 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-12\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which any corporation organized under the laws of the United States shall be a party, arising out of transactions involving ... banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States, ... shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States, and the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of all such suitsf.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">.
