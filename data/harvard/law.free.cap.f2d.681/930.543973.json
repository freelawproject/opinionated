Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Federal Credit Union (Credit Union) for $242,080.75 on a bond which covered, among other things, loss to the Credit Union through the failure of one of its employees \u201cto well and faithfully perform his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The Credit Union was created under the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1751 et <em>seq. </em>It is governed by a Board of Directors; however, approval of loan applications was vested in a three member Credit Committee, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1761c.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Prior to June 1973, John Stowe approached Jack Montgomery, general manager of the Credit Union, about a real estate loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montgomery apparently recommended to the Board that the loan be made. On June 13,1973, the Board met and recommended to the Credit Committee the approval of a $200,000 loan to Stowe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 19, 1973, a local appraiser valued the property for which the loan was sought at $285,000. On June 27, Stowe formally filed an application for a loan. On June 29, he and Montgomery met in the latter\u2019s office; Montgomery told one of the disbursing officers to process the loan, which she did, returning the documents and a check to Montgomery, who signed the check and disbursed it. Also on June 29, the Board, in a telephone meeting, recommended to the Credit Committee the approval of a loan of $225,000 to Stowe. On this same date Stowe purchased the mortgaged property for $72,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">The Credit Committee did not review the loan until four days after it was made. One member approved the loan application and initialed it, but forged the initials of another member. Approval by at least two members is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Stowe ultimately defaulted on the loan; the Credit Union foreclosed on the mortgage, bought the property and sold it for $64,000. After a deficiency judgment against Stowe was discharged in bankruptcy, the Credit Union brought this action against Cumis on its surety bond. The jury found Cumis liable on the bond due to the negligence of Jack Montgomery, but specifically exonerated the other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">[I] The linchpin of Cumis\u2019 arguments on appeal is that the trial court applied an incorrect standard in allowing the Credit Union to recover under the bond for a loss caused by the negligent acts of ah employee. It contends instead that to prove an employee\u2019s failure \u201cto well and faithfully perform his duties,\u201d it is necessary to show intentional or willful misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Insuring Clause A of the bond provided, among other things, coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-4\">For direct loss of, or damage to, any property, as defined herein, caused by the fraud or dishonesty of any of the Insured\u2019s employees, as herein defined, .. . or through the failure on the part of such employee ... to well and faithfully perform his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The trial court, in interpreting the clause to insure against negligence, relied in part on <em>Minor v. The Mechanics Bank of Alexandria, </em>26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 46, <em>7 </em>L.Ed. 47 (1828). In <em>Minor, </em>the Supreme Court considered the argument that the language \u201cwell and truly execute the duties of cashier\u201d was merely a stipulation for honesty, and not for skill, capacity, or diligence, but held to the contrary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">\u2018Well and truly to execute the duties of the office,\u2019 includes not only honesty, but reasonable skill and diligence. If the duties are performed negligently and unskillfully \u2014 if they are violated, from want of capacity or want of care, they can never be said to be \u2018well and truly executed.\u2019 The operations of a bank require diligence, with fitness and capacity, as well as honesty, in its cashier; and the security for the faithful discharge of his duties would be utterly illusory if we were to narrow down its import to a guarantee against personal fraud only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqBG\"><em>Id. </em>at 69. It is true, as Cumis suggests, that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Minor </em>was <em>dicta, </em>but it is on point and this interpretation has been adopted in later cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that the quoted coverage insures against negligence. As it reasoned, Insuring Clause A covers two types of conduct \u2014 \u201cfraud or dishonesty\u201d and that an employee \u201cwell and faithfully perform\u201d \u2014 if the latter clause is to have any independent significance it must mean something other than fraud or dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Cumis next contends there was not sufficient evidence of negligence by Montgomery. We disagree. He recommended the loan to the Board without any evidence of the value of the real estate, he failed to check out the collateral, there was some evidence that he knew what Stowe actually paid for the property, and he directed another employee to process the loan as required, knowing that it had not been approved by, or even submitted to, the Credit Committee and he disbursed it to Stowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">Stowe did not appear at trial, but the Credit Union offered his deposition in an attempt to prove that Montgomery had actual knowledge that the property was purchased for only $72,000 \u2014 thus conclusively showing Montgomery\u2019s negligence. Cumis contends that Stowe\u2019s deposition testimony was inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 602 because Stowe had no personal knowledge of whether Montgomery knew of the purchase price. The point is not well taken. It is true that Stowe did not state definitively that he personally discussed the purchase price with Montgomery \u2014 only that it was possible \u2014 and that much of his testimony in this respect was to the effect that he thought his attorney had told Montgomery. Rule 602, however, does not require that the witness\u2019 knowledge be positive or rise to the level of absolute certainty. Evidence is inadmissible under this rule only if in the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion it finds that the witness could not have actually perceived or observed that which he testifies to. 2 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 658 (J. Chadbourn Rev. 1979); 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, </em>\u00b6 602[02] (1981). Although the question of admissibility was certainly close, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that appellant\u2019s objection went to credibility, not to admissibility, and in admitting the evidence for the jury to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>mine the weight to be given to Stowe\u2019s admittedly equivocal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">We have examined the other assignments of error and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court, 507 F.Supp. 794, is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">. Stowe and Jack Montgomery had known each other for some time prior to the making of this loan. They had coffee and lunch together, were golfing partners, and Montgomery was a guest on Stowe\u2019s fishing boat. In 1971, Montgomery had purchased a year-old Lincoln Continental automobile from Stowe, assuming a loan of approximately $3,800. After Montgomery left the Credit Union, he shared office space with Stowe and acquired a real estate license under his sponsorship. Fifteen months prior to the loan in question, Montgomery turned over for collection four delinquent accounts of Stowe; he subsequently cured the defaults.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">. The Credit Committee apparently never received this recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">. The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\">Now, the words to well and faithfully perform his or her duties as applies to each of the employee Defendants in this case means that each of these employees must perform his or her duties with reasonable skill and diligence, that is, they must not be negligent or fail to use due care in performing their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqp-dedup-1\">Now, negligence means the failure to act as an ordinary and reasonable person would act under similar circumstances. Negligence, really you determine whether they well and faithfully performed their duties by determining whether they exhibited reasonable skill and diligence; and that really means were they negligent or were they not negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFo\">Now, the issues before you basically are were any of the three named employees ... negligent, because that\u2019s what failure to well and faithfully perform their duties really means. The bond says well and faithfully perform his or her duties and I have told you that that means negligence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">. <em>King Edward Employees Federal Credit Union v.

Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the testimony of the witness himself. This rule is subject to the provisions of rule 703, relating to opinion testimony by expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-27\">The most important part of Stowe\u2019s testimony is not based on personal knowledge. Stowe testified on direct examination that Montgomery had <em>knowledge of the purchase price of Stowe\u2019s lots.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, on cross examination, Stowe stated that the basis for his statement that Montgomery had prior knowledge was his assumption that his attorney, McCrackin, had told Montgomery of the purchase price.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the trial it was developed through Stowe\u2019s attorney McCrackin\u2019s testimony that he had not communicated the purchase price to Montgomery or anyone at the Credit Union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Stowe testified to a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>about which he had no personal knowledge but instead was based on an erroneous assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In the case of <em>United States v. Borelli, </em>336 F.2d 376, 392 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied sub. nom. <em>Mogavero v. United States, </em>379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 647, 13 L.Ed.2d 555 (1965), it was held that testimony should have been excluded in the absence of a showing that the witness was giving an impression derived from the service of his own senses, not from the reports of others or from speculation. In the present case, Stowe was not giving testimony about which he had personal knowledge. His conclusive statement that Montgomery knew the purchase price was speculative and based upon an erroneous assumption. It was highly prejudicial testimony because it described a specific act of negligence on the part of Montgomery. Without the inclusion of this specific act, the evidence of negligence on the part of Montgomery was rather nebulous. This prejudicial testimony went to admissibility and not to credibility. It was the most damaging evidence presented against the defendant because it indicated that Montgomery was approving a $200,-000.00 loan secured by real estate purchased on the date of said loan for only $72,000.00. There is no other testimony in the record to establish Montgomery\u2019s knowledge of this most important and damaging fact. This speculation on such a critical issue should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">For the above reasons, I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">.
