This is such a case. While other issues have been raised,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the pivotal issue on this appeal is whether a defendant who is permitted to conduct his own defense may still be denied his constitutional right of self-representation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by unwanted interference in his behalf by court-appointed, standby counsel. We conclude that such a violation can occur, as it did in the instant case, and reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the Great Writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">The circumstances surrounding the crime are easy to relate. In the early evening of January 17, 1972, a man wielding a rusty pistol robbed a Piggly Wiggly store in San Antonio. After having the cashier stuff the day\u2019s proceeds into a brown paper bag, the robber fled the store and drove away in his car. Before driving away, however, a second store employee managed to see the thief\u2019s license plate number and wrote it down in the palm of his hand. That number was later traced to the appellant, Carl Wiggins.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">After a few false starts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wiggins was indicted and subsequently brought to trial. Before trial commenced, however, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>requested that he be permitted to conduct his own defense. The court granted that request, but at the same time appointed two attorneys as standby counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The conduct of these attorneys during the course of the trial is the core of appellant\u2019s argument that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right of self-representation. While the court made it clear that counsel were present for advisory purposes only,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it was not long before one of the attorneys began to take on a more active role. Soon Wiggins began to protest against standby counsel\u2019s unsolicited participation, claiming that it prohibited him from conducting his own defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s response was that defendant was going to receive counsel\u2019s aid whether he wanted it or not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When defendant later requested that the court at least instruct standby counsel not to take the initiative, the court refused.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, counsel continuously partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>pated in the proceedings, both in and outside the presence of the jury. In addition to making objections too numerous to cite, counsel on several occasions cursed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> argued with defendant,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and moved for mistrial against the defendant\u2019s wishes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By the time the smoke cleared, Wiggins had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment as a recidivist.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Little time was lost before Wiggins began running the gauntlet of direct appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> petitions for state writ of habeas corpus,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and a petition to the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. When these routes proved unfruitful, Wiggins undauntedly applied for federal habeas corpus relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court disposed of the petition by adopting the recommendations of the federal magistrate to whom it had been referred. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-28\">\n<em>Fool for a Client!</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>15</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABh\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b342-29\">The leading case on the right to self-representation is <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>(1975). In that case, the accused clearly and unequivocally let it be known prior to trial that he wished to represent himself and did not want the aid of counsel. Yet despite a knowing and intelligent waiver, the state court compelled the accused to accept the services of a court-appointed public defender. The Supreme Court held, in a six to three decision, that under these circumstances, the defendant had been denied his constitutional right to conduct his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">In the case before us the defendant also chose, for whatever reason,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Unlike the <em>Faretta </em>case, however, the right was granted. Nevertheless, court-appointed standby counsel were appointed over Wiggins\u2019 objections.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As already shown, one of these attorneys did far more than merely \u201cstandby.\u201d The narrow issue presented on this appeal, then, is whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to self-representation may be violated by the unsolicited participation of overzealous, court-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>appointed standby counsel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is an issue not presented in <em>Faretta, </em>but one clearly raised by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Since <em>Faretta, </em>the Supreme Court has shed little light on how many of the procedural difficulties resulting from that decision <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> should be resolved.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nor has there been a case, Supreme Court or otherwise, in which a court has been squarely presented with the question of defining the role of standby counsel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ing the paucity of authority on the subject, <em>Faretta </em>itself offers some guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The essence of <em>Faretta </em>was succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">The Sixth Amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense. . . . The right to defend is given directly to the accused; for it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense fails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">The counsel provision supplements this design. It speaks of the \u201cassistance\u201d of counsel, and an assistant, however expert, is still an assistant. The language and spirit of the Sixth Amendment contemplate that counsel, like the other defense tools guaranteed by the Amendment, shall be an aid to a willing defendant. ... To thrust counsel upon the accused, against his considered wish, thus violates the logic of the Amendment. In such a case, counsel is not an assistant, but a master; and the right to make a defense is stripped of the personal character upon which the Amendment insists. ... An unwanted counsel \u201crepresents\u201d the defendant only through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not <em>his </em>defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 820-21, 95 S.Ct. 2533-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Court-appointed counsel was never meant to be an albatross tied around a defendant\u2019s neck. Instead, he was intended to be a means through which a defendant, ignorant of the intricate mechanics of the law, could effectively present his defense. <em>See Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158, 170 (1932). But like any other tool, he may be used or not used. Here, Wiggins chose to conduct his own defense; this much was constitutionally guaranteed under <em>Faretta. </em>He also wished to dispose of the court-appointed standby counsel, but the trial court refused. Under <em>Faretta, </em>this matter was within the court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But while the presence of standby counsel may be forced on a defendant, his aid may not. His function is \u201cto aid the accused <em>if and when the accused requests </em>help....\u201d <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. at 835 n.46, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. Anything more would prevent the <em>pro se </em>defendant from conducting <em>his </em>defense. Therefore, the rule that we establish today is that court-appointed standby counsel is \u201cto be seen, but not heard.\u201d By this we mean that he is not to compete with the defendant or supersede his defense. Rather, his presence is there for advisory purposes only,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to be used or not used as the defendant sees fit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">The more difficult question on this appeal was posed by Justice Blackmun in his dissent to <em>Faretta: </em>\u201cMay a violation of the right to self-representation ever be harmless error?\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Perhaps the best authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>for the proposition that a denial of the right to conduct one\u2019s own defense will always be reversible error is <em>Faretta </em>itself. Nowhere in the case is there any indication that the defendant was prejudiced by the rejection of his <em>pro se </em>request, that his state-appointed attorney did not conduct an able defense, or that there were any statutory or constitutional grounds for reversal other than the trial court\u2019s denial of Faretta\u2019s right of self-representation. The case is clearly one in which an otherwise \u201charmless\u201d denial of a constitutional right is itself sufficient grounds for reversal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Not every violation of a constitutional right, however, requires an automatic reversal of a conviction regardless of the facts and circumstances. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969): \u201calthough \u2018there are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error\u2019, not all \u2018trial errors which violate the Constitution automatically call for reversal.\u2019 \u201d 395 U.S. at 251, 89 S.Ct. at 1727 (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710 (1967)). <em>Faretta </em>is distinguishable. There the defendant\u2019s right to proceed <em>pro se </em>had been completely denied. Wiggins, on the other hand, had been granted that right. It had, however, been interfered with. Under these limited circumstances, there is a need for a harmless error rule. Were there none, a reversal would be mandated every time overzealous counsel, acting in the best interests of his client, volunteered his aid without prior permission. This would be true even though the interjections were few and innocuous. Moreover, an automatic reversal rule would give unscrupulous counsel <em>carte blanche </em>to sandbag the prosecution. All that would be necessary to secure a new trial for a defendant whose conviction is a foregone conclusion would be for counsel to throw himself into the fray. Such results were not meant to be. Some flexibility is necessary, and the harmless error rule is the vehicle that takes us there.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Notwithstanding our adoption of such a rule for cases like the present one, the result below must still be reversed. \u201c[B]efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967). The burden is a heavy one, and it rests on the government. In order to make such a determination, an examination of the record as a whole is necessary; passages are to be examined in context, and evaluated in light of their affect on the total mix.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">A review of the record in the case at hand reveals that the government has failed its task of demonstrating that counsel\u2019s participation was harmless. As indicated earlier, counsel continuously objected, and on several occasions moved for mistrial, despite defendant\u2019s repeated requests that he play a more passive role. They were in constant disagreement over basic trial strategy, and at one point counsel cursed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>front of the jury. We fail to perceive how such conduct could have anything but a negative impact on the jury. It also destroyed Wiggins own perception that he was conducting <em>his </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">C</p>\n<p id=\"AKp\">One final point to address is the question of Wiggins\u2019 acquiescence. The government argues that more often than not, defendant approved standby counsel\u2019s participation or failed to register any protest when counsel acted in his behalf. Acquiescence, however, is not the only possible explanation for defendant\u2019s conduct. Early in the proceedings, the trial court let it be known that it was not going to order standby counsel not to participate.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> More likely than not, Wiggins interpreted this statement to mean that continuous objections would be unproductive. Also to be considered is the fact that confrontation, in the presence of the jury, would only help to destroy the image defendant wished to convey to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"aou-dedup-0\">All of the above, however, is speculation. Moreover, it is unnecessary in light of this opinion\u2019s definition of the role of standby counsel. Once the right of self-representation has been asserted there will be no question of acquiescence unless counsel\u2019s participation has been overtly encouraged by the defendant. Such action has not taken place here.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abx-dedup-0\">REVERSED and REMANDED for the granting of the writ of habeas corpus and the entry of an appropriate judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-11\">. On this appeal, appellant has reurged all of the theories for federal habeas corpus relief presented below. Wiggins claims: (1) that he was denied due process because of pre-indictment delay; (2) that he was denied his right to a speedy trial; (3) that he was placed in double jeopardy when he was reprosecuted after his first conviction was set aside; (4) that he was denied his constitutional right to represent himself; (5) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; (6) that he was denied the right to obtain defense witnesses; (7) that he was denied an adequate record for appeal; and (8) that he was denied the right to represent himself on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">If meritorious, the first three theories would demand that appellant forever be set free. The balance are less final. While the second three theories would require that Wiggins be given a new trial, the latter two would only permit him to re-appeal. A review of the record and applicable law reveals the first set to be spurious. The bulk of the remainder need not be discussed in light of our reversal of the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\">. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-18\">. Wiggins was originally arrested on February 20, 1972, and an indictment was returned approximately two months later. On May 17, 1972, defendant successfully had that indictment quashed for being fatally defective. Accordingly, he was released. On June 7, 1972, Wiggins was reindicted for the same offense and again taken into custody on June 29, 1972. He was tried in January 1973, found guilty, and, because of a charge of enhancement, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Approximately three weeks after sentencing, a hearing was held at defendant\u2019s request regarding two motions: a motion to withdraw notice of appeal and a motion for new trial. At that hearing, it was discovered that the second indictment was also fatally defective, and the court granted Wiggins\u2019 request for a new trial. Five days later, on March 28, 1973, two new indictments were returned by the grand jury, both alleging the same offense. On June 4, 1973, the State elected one of the indictments to try Wiggins under, \u2018and the trial in question commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-5\">.

California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 852, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2549, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 592 (1975) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b343-4\">. Numerous theories have been advanced for why a defendant might choose to represent himself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Defendant\u2019s refusal of the right to the assistance of counsel may be grounded on the defendant\u2019s belief that, with counsel, the defendant will be denied any opportunity to speak for himself or herself and that only through personal presentation of the case can the merits of the case really be made known. Further, a defendant may believe that no lawyer will faithfully represent the defendant at a fair fee, or that the judicial system is so inherently unjust that the only chance for a fair trial is for the defendant to represent himself or herself. Other motives may include the hope that the absence of counsel may afford a basis for reversal of a conviction regarded as inevitable, or the desire to ventilate hostility through the dramatic vehicle of a disorderly trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">ABA Standards of Criminal Justice, The Trial Judge\u2019s Function, Standard 6-3.6(a) (2nd ed. 1980). <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>The Right to Defend Pro Se in Criminal Proceedings, </em>1973 Wash.U.L.Q. 679, 679-80 n.3 (1973); and Laub, <em>The Problem of the Unrepresented, Misrepresented and Rebellious Defendant in Criminal Court, 2 </em>Duq.L.Rev. 245 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">By far, the most frequently cited theory for why a defendant will elect to proceed <em>pro se </em>is that of trial strategy. He may view self-representation as a means of invoking the jury\u2019s sympathy by projecting the image of the lone defendant against the mammoth State. Participation by court-appointed counsel would sour that image in the minds of the jurors. A defendant may also want the opportunity to have the jury judge him as a person, and hopefully decide all matters of credibility in his favor. As part of that plan, he may choose to take a very low key approach to trial, thereby conveying the impression that he has nothing to hide. In this situation, counsel\u2019s intrusion may force disagreements and confusion which would undermine the picture the accused wishes to present.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">it is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts. But where the defendant will not voluntarily accept representation by counsel, the potential advantage of a lawyer\u2019s training and experience can be realized, if at all, only imperfectly. To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him. Moreover, it is not inconceivable that in some rare instances, the defendant might in fact present his case more effectively by conducting his own defense. Personal liberties are not rooted in the law of averages. The right to defend is personal. The defendant, and not his lawyer or the State, will bear the personal consequences of a conviction. It is the defendant, therefore, who must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage. And although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of \u201cthat respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEB\"><em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2540, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 581 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\">. <em>See </em>notes 4 and 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">That a trial court may appoint standby counsel even over the objections of an unwilling defendant is without question. This was expressly recognized in <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834 n.46, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541 n.46, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 581 n.46 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The presence of standby counsel allows a trial judge to retain an impartial role since the defendant may instead turn to his court-appointed attorney for assistance when troubled by legal matters. Should the <em>pro se </em>defendant lose his self-representation right \u2014 for example, by obstructionist misconduct \u2014 standby counsel can step in and the trial can continue uninterrupted, thereby conserving judicial resources. The same may be said for the situation where defendant chooses to abandon the right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">. This decision pertains only to those situations in which a defendant has elected to proceed <em>pro se, </em>but the court, in its discretion, has appointed standby counsel. What is not currently before us is the situation where, under State law, a defendant may elect to go to trial and conduct his own defense <em>together </em>with counsel. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 813 n.10, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2530 n.10, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 569 n.10 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">. In the conclusion to his dissent, Justice Blackmun ominously warned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Although the Court indicates that a pro se defendant necessarily waives any claim he might otherwise make of ineffective assistance of counsel, ante, at 835 n.46, 45 L.Ed.2d 581, the opinion leaves open a host of other procedural questions. Must every defendant be advised of his right to proceed pro se? If so, when must that notice be given? Since the right to assistance of counsel and the right to self-representation are mutually exclusive, how is the waiver of each right to be measured? If a defendant has elected to exercise his right to proceed pro se, does he still have a constitutional right to assistance of standby counsel? How soon in the criminal proceeding must a defendant decide between proceeding by counsel or pro se? Must he be allowed to switch in midtrial? May a violation of the right to self-representation ever be harmless error? Must the trial court treat the pro se defendant differently than it would professional counsel? I assume that many of these questions will be answered with finality in due course. Many of them, however, such as the standards of waiver and the treatment of the pro se defendant, will haunt the trial of every defendant who elects to exercise his right to self-representation. The procedural problems spawned by an absolute right to self-representation will far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\"><em>Faretta v.

While interjections made in the presence of the jury are inherently prejudicial, and are therefore subject to strict scrutiny, statements made outside their presence are not to be discounted.

Colloquies such as that set forth in note 10 <em>supra </em>would warrant further consideration. In addition, it is also important to note that trial strategy and the image defendant wishes to project to the jury are not the only reasons why a defendant may wish to proceed <em>pro se.

Wiggins authored a brief statement which he requested his court-appointed attorney on appeal to read to this Court. In light of the fact that this opinion focuses on a defendant\u2019s right to proceed <em>pro se, </em>it is appropriate that it be included here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aed-dedup-0\">The Supreme Court, and this Court before the Supreme Court, determined that the defendant has a constitutional right to defend himself without counsel if and when he elects to do so. This is solidly established. And the trial court may, even over the defendant\u2019s objection, appoint a standby counsel for consultation or advisement. This much is held by <em>Faretta. </em>Or in the event that the defendant\u2019s conduct becomes disruptive, to be available to take over the defense if that becomes necessary. But when standby counsel abandons his designated assignment, and proceeds to participate in the trial against the defendant\u2019s wishes, and over his objection, just how much participation by unwanted counsel is to be allowed? Where does there exist any markers to limit active participation of an aggressive lawyer that a defendant on trial wants no part of at all? If such active, unwanted, and unsolicited participation of standby counsel as this case presents is approved by the Court, would not this then open the doors for future cases that would provide for trial judges to make subjective and possibly inequitable determinations from case to case allowing or not allowing designated standby counsel to participate in varying degrees even over the objections of <em>pro se </em>defendants? If this becomes practice, where would the counsel participation line be drawn? If this becomes practice, it could be not said [sic] that such a defendant would have standing to complain of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of counsel actively participating in trial against his [the defendant\u2019s] will.. If this became practice, eventually the constitutional right we\u2019re talking about would surely become meaningless.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
