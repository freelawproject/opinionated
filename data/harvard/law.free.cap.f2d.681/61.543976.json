He was sentenced under the \u201cDangerous Special Drug Offender\u201d statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849, to two concurrent fifteen-year terms. He attacks his conviction and sentence on several grounds. In our view, both must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">1. Defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in allowing the Government to tell the jury that he had previously been convicted in state court for possession of marijuana. The relevant federal rule of evidence is 404(b), which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">This rule codifies the common law doctrine forbidding the prosecution from asking the jury to infer from the fact that the defendant has committed a bad act in the past, that he has a bad character and therefore is more likely to have committed the bad act now charged. Although this \u201cpropensity evidence\" is relevant, the risk that a jury will convict for crimes other than those charged \u2014 or that, uncertain of guilt, it will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment \u2014 creates a prejudicial effect that outweighs ordinary relevance. 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 404[04] at 404-26 (1980); Note, <em>Procedural Protections of the Criminal Defendant </em>\u2014 A <em>Reevaluation of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination and the Rule Excluding Evidence of Propensity to Commit Crimes, </em>78 Harv.L.Rev. 426, 436 (1964). Where the evidence has some \u201cspecial\u201d probative value, however, \u2014 where, for example, it is relevant to something other than mere \u201ccharacter\u201d or \u201cpropensity,\u201d \u2014 it <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>be admitted. The trial judge then must weigh the special relevance against the prejudicial risk, taking into account the likely hostile jury reaction that underlies the common law rule. <em>United States v. Halper, </em>590 F.2d 422, 432 (2d Cir. 1978); 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 404[08], 404[18]. <em>See also United States v. Byrd, </em>352 F.2d 570, 574-75 (2d Cir. 1965) (Friendly, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In this case there was a \u201cspecial\u201d factor making the past conviction more than an effort to produce a \u201cbad character/propensity\u201d chain of inference. Evidence was introduced showing that federal agents had found marijuana and diethylpropion buried under some dog food in the freezer room of the farmhouse where defendant lived with his wife (the owner). Bags of marijuana were also found in the barn under a chicken coop. While defendant offered to stipulate that he knew marijuana and diethylpropion were \u201ccontrolled\u201d substances, and that whatever he did, he did \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cintentionally,\u201d <em>cf. United States v. Mohel, </em>604 F.2d 748 (2d Cir. 1979), he would not stipulate that he knew the drugs were in the freezer room or under the chicken coop. By introducing the past conviction, the Government thus, in part, sought to have the jury infer that one who lives on a farm with marijuana in the freezer room and under the chicken coop and has a prior possession conviction is more likely to <em>know </em>about the presence of marijuana than one who lives on such a farm and does not have a past possession conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Such an inference would not have been difficult to draw. The jury might have thought a past possessor is more likely to associate with those who use and keep and talk freely about nearby marijuana; it might have thought a past possessor is more likely to spot marijuana under a chicken coop; it might have thought a past possessor is less likely to throw away marijuana if he comes across it. None of these inferences \u2014 all supporting a conclusion of \u201cknowledge\u201d \u2014 depends entirely upon the \u201cbad character/propensity\u201d chain of reasoning. <em>See United States v. Sinn, </em>622 F.2d 415, 416 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 843, 101 S.Ct. 124, 66 L.Ed.2d 51 (1980). <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Merryman, </em>630 F.2d 780, 786 (10th Cir. 1980). <em>But see United States v. Hernandez-Miranda, </em>601 F.2d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, they escape the absolute bar of the Rule\u2019s first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The question of balancing relevance and risk is more difficult, but we believe that the trial court acted within its discretion. <em>United States v. Eatherton, </em>519 F.2d 603, 611 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 987, 96 S.Ct. 396, 46 L.Ed.2d 304 (1975); 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 404[18] at 404-110 &amp; n.16. On the one hand, the court refused to allow the Government to do more than simply read the prior charge. It instructed the jury to consider the conviction only for its tendency to show knowledge or intent and to ignore whatever light it shed on character or propensity. And the prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(for possession of \u201cmore than one pound\u201d of marijuana) was not for a shocking or heinous crime likely to inflame the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On the other hand, there was so much other evidence of guilt in the case that it is difficult to believe the prior conviction was needed. Drug-related equipment was found in public rooms on the farm. Large amounts of cash were found in the defendant\u2019s room. The defendant and his wife sold the farm and fled from New Hampshire one month before they were initially to be tried (four years ago). And, the defendant had made two highly incriminating admissions: the day of the search he told one of the agents that they should have waited a few days to raid the farm as the Mexican crop had not yet been harvested. The next day he told two deputy marshals (in their words) that the Government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">really blew it. I was going to get two tons of marijuana. In fact, I was talking to the guy on the phone when you raided the place.... I really needed the two tons to get out of the hole, . .. but after this, ... I\u2019ll never hear from the guy again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In the face of this evidence, the defense presented no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">While all this evidence lessened the need for introducing the prior conviction, it also lessened the likelihood of any prejudicial effect \u2014 to the point where, even were we to find the evidence inadmissible (which we do not), the error would have been harmless. <em>See United States v. Bosch, </em>584 F.2d 1113, 1117-18 (1st Cir. 1978); 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 404[18] at 404-111 &amp; n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">2. Defendant complains of the trial judge\u2019s instruction that the jury not consider any lesser included offenses \u201cuntil or unless you have arrived at a reasonable doubt on the offenses charged.\u201d Defendant does not complain about the well-established rule that a jury is to consider lesser included offenses only after a determination of \u201cnot guilty\u201d is reached on the primary charge. <em>See </em>2 Devitt &amp; Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 58.15. Rather, he states that this charge somehow implied that the defendant had the burden of coming forward with evidence that would lead the jury to find a reasonable doubt. He claims the charge implied to the jury that \u201creasonable doubt\u201d had to be created instead of existing from the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">We disagree. At the end of the trial, the judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">Consider ... whether the government has sustained its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each offense of possession with intent to distribute with which [Moccia] is charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">If you find that such burden has been sustained, that is the end of the case as to him. You will have established his guilt as to such offense or offenses. If, however, you find that a reasonable doubt exists as to either or both of such offenses, you must then turn to the issue of whether he is guilty of the lesser included offenses of possession of controlled substances, and here again must consider whether the government has sustained its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of the elements of those offenses. If it has, then he is guilty of the lesser included offense. If it has not, then you must find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">The judge then gave the challenged instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">I caution you do not turn to the lesser included offense until or unless you have arrived at a reasonable doubt on the offenses charged, that is, possession with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">Taken as a whole, <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <em>United States v. Thomann, </em>609 F.2d 560, 565-66 (1st Cir. 1979), this charge certainly seems adequate as to the burden of proof on \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d Moreover, the judge properly charged the jury several different times as to \u201creasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cpresumptions of innocence.\u201d We find no violation of \u201cdue process\u201d or \u201cfair treatment,\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 359, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1070, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), or any other basis for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>3. Finally, defendant makes three arguments attacking the \u201cenhanced\u201d fifteen-year concurrent sentences he received as a \u201cdangerous special\u201d drug offender under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849. First, he claims that at his \u201cenhancement\u201d hearing, the trial judge should not have considered hearsay evidence, evidence derived from \u201cillegal\u201d wiretaps, and evidence not specified in the notice that the statute requires the Government to give prior to trial, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(a). The short and conclusive answer to these objections is that the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (of which \u00a7 849 is a part) specifically states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 850. This provision codifies the principle that when setting a sentence, a judge can consider a virtually unrestricted range of information, <em>see United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 50, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2615, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978), including hearsay, <em>United States v. Inendino, </em>604 F.2d 458, 463 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 932, 100 S.Ct. 276, 62 L.Ed.2d 190 (1979); <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1073, 100 S.Ct. 1018, 62 L.Ed.2d 755 (1980), other information that might be inadmissible at trial, <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>567 F.2d 610, 615 (4th Cir. 1977), and evidence not specified in a \u00a7 849(a) pretrial notice. See <em>United States v. Ilacqua, </em>562 F.2d 399, 403 (6th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 906, 917, 947, 98 S.Ct. 1453, 1473, 1532, 55 L.Ed.2d 497, 508, 545 (1978). We see no reason to depart from this rule in the case of wiretap evidence where, as here, attacks on that evidence have been raised and rejected in a prior criminal prosecution in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Second, defendant claims the Government failed to show that he is both \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d by a \u201cpreponderance of the information.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sutton, </em>415 F.Supp. 1323, 1325-27 (D.D.C.1976); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(b). Again, we disagree. In showing that defendant was \u201cspecial,\u201d the Government produced evidence that he was a \u201cprofessional,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>415 F.Supp. at 1325, which is to say that his offenses were committed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">as a part of a pattern of dealing in controlled substances which was criminal under applicable laws of any jurisdiction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">which constituted a substantial source of his income, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">in which he manifested special skill or expertise; .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(e)(2). The \u201cpattern\u201d was evidenced by the fact that only a year previously defendant had been found in the same place, -with the same \u201cfarmhands,\u201d and with 740 pounds of marijuana. <em>State v. Moccia, </em>119 N.H. 169, 400 A.2d 44 (1979); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(e). That defendant\u2019s drug sales provided a \u201csubstantial source of his income\u201d was shown by the tax court\u2019s decision in <em>Moccia v. Commissioner, </em>No. 708-78 (June 4, 1979) and by his 1976 tax return. The decision indicates that defendant\u2019s drug profits amounted to several hundred thousand dollars in 1976 \u2014 far more than the 50 percent of declared income ($30,000) that the statute requires. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(e). Defendant argues that the tax court\u2019s decision rests upon unlawful wiretap evidence. No policy of the law, however, requires us to go behind that decision to examine its evidentiary basis where the decision itself was used only for sentencing purposes, and where, in any event, defendant\u2019s attacks on the wiretap evidence have been heard, and rejected, by the New Hampshire courts. In any event, defendant\u2019s claim that the income projections are unreliable because the wiretap lasted Only eleven days is frivolous. The projections imply that defendant\u2019s drug profits exceeded the requisite $15,000 during just the period of the wiretap itself! Finally, defendant\u2019s \u201cspecial skill\u201d was shown by his prior conviction, his flight before trial, and this same wiretap evidence (which revealed that defendant was in charge of a good-sized operation, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>he described himself as a \u201cdealer\u2019s dealer\u201d). In sum, the trial judge\u2019s finding that defendant was \u201cspecial\u201d was adequately supported by the evidence, which the judge identified in the record as the statute requires. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The statute\u2019s special definition of \u201cdangerous\u201d requires that the judge find that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">a period of confinement longer than that provided for [the] felonious violation [in question] is required for the protection of the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(f). In our view, the judge\u2019s finding that defendant was \u201cspecial\u201d was also adequate to support a finding of \u201cdangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Third, defendant claims that his sentence is disproportionately severe. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(b). We note that there are certain mitigating factors in defendant\u2019s background. Nonetheless, the fifteen-year sentence is considerably less than the twenty-five years the Government sought. It is seven years more than the sentence he might have been given were he not a \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d offender. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). Yet, it is still only three years more than the sentence that might have been imposed had defendant\u2019s earlier drug conviction been under federal rather than state law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The evidence, suggesting that he was a serious professional dealer, who repeated his crimes, and who fled the jurisdiction when caught, convinces us that this is not a case for interfering with the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In sum, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments, and the conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
