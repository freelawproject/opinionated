R.S. 40:1031-36 (Louisiana Act). Invoking 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, plaintiffs <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge that the Louisiana Act is vague and overbroad, not rationally related to a legitimate state interest and infringes on first amendment guarantees. The district court upheld its validity. 501 F.Supp. 168. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Louisiana Act is patterned after the Model Drug Paraphernalia Act (Model Act) drafted by the Department of Justice<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as part of the response to the explosive growth of illegal drug traffic across the country. The Model Act seeks to avoid the constitutional infirmities which resulted in successful challenges to various state and local drug paraphernalia laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The Louisiana Act defines drug paraphernalia as \u201call equipment, products and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, or designed for use ...\u201d with a controlled substance, La.R.S. 40:1031(A)(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and lists examples.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act then identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>fies twelve factors which must be considered when determining whether a particular object is to be considered drug paraphernalia. La.R.S. 40:1032(1)-(12).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Criminal liability is imposed for the sale, distribution, or display of drug paraphernalia, La. R.S. 40:1033(A) &amp; (B), and for its use, 40:1033(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Appellants and amicus curiae raise first, fifth and fourteenth amendment challenges to the Louisiana Act. We consider each assertion raised, first addressing over-breadth and vagueness, mindful that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-25\">In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail. The court should then examine the facial vagueness challenge and, assuming the enactment implicates no constitutionally protected conduct, should uphold the challenge only if the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>102 S.Ct. 1186, 1189 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<em>Overbreadth</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A law is facially overbroad if it \u201cdoes not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of [government] control, but ... sweeps within its ambit other activities that constitute an exercise\u201d of constitutionally protected rights. <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 97, 60 S.Ct. 736, 741, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940). The overbreadth doctrine not only shields protected speech, but has been a vital force counteracting any deterrence to such speech. <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The only constitutionally protected activity implicated by the Louisiana Act is the first amendment commercial speech right of vendors of items which fall within the definition of drug paraphernalia. The Louisiana statute makes it unlawful for any person, \u201cknowing the drug related nature of the object, to display for sale or possess with the intent to distribute, any drug paraphernalia.\u201d La.R.S. 40:1033(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The overbreadth doctrine, however, \u201cdoes not apply to commercial speech.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>102 S.Ct. at 1192 <em>(citing Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n., </em>447 U.S. 557, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980)). The Court has refused to apply the overbreadth doctrine in the commercial speech context in part because persons advertising goods or services for a profit are not likely to be lightly deterred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Further, in the case at bar, as in <em>Hoffman Estates:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">insofar as any <em>commercial </em>speech interest is implicated here, it is only the attenuated interest in displaying and marketing merchandise in the manner that the retailer desires .... The ordinance is expressly directed at commercial activity promoting or encouraging illegal drug use. If that activity is deemed \u2018speech,\u2019 then it is speech proposing an illegal transaction, which a government may regulate or ban entirely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">102 S.Ct. at 1192 <em>(citing Central Hudson Gas </em>and <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>413 U.S. 376, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973)). There is no constitutionally protected conduct implicated by the Louisiana Act; the commercial speech doctrine offers appellants no succor.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\n<em>Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">Under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments, a criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide meaningful and fair warning of the proscribed conduct and adequate standards to ensure even-handed enforcement. <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). A number of factors are considered in determining the degree of vagueness constitutionally permissible. In <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>the Court stated that a successful challenge to the facial validity of an economic regulation requires a showing that the legislation is impermissibly vague in all applications, explaining that \u201ceconomic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test because its subject-matter is often more narrow, and because businesses, which face economic demands to plan behavior carefully, can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action.\u201d 102 S.Ct. at 1193. Further, the Court noted that \u201ca scienter requirement may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d Finally, \u201cthe most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mindful of these guidons, we evaluate appellants\u2019 vagueness challenge to the Louisiana Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Appellants maintain that the Act is vague because (1) the phrase \u201cused, intended for use, or designed for use\u201d fails to apprise persons of characteristics which would distinguish innocent items from drug paraphernalia; (2) the Act imposes criminal liability on the seller based on the intent of the buyer (transferred intent); (3) the Act fails to provide guidelines sufficient to avoid discriminatory enforcement; and (4) the prohibitory sections, 1033(A) &amp; (B), fail to require that the seller have the specific intent that the questioned item be used with a controlled substance. We address these contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>\u201cIntended for Use\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Appellants insist that defining drug paraphernalia as items \u201cused\u201d or \u201cintended for use,\u201d with a controlled substance fails to differentiate purely innocent items from prohibited items, and thus fails to provide adequate warning of the verboten conduct. The district court found that this language, in the context of the total statutory scheme, clearly requires criminal intent on the part of the person charged with violating the statute, and therefore does provide fair warning of proscribed activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Obviously, many items may be used in both a lawful and unlawful manner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To prosecute a person for the sale of an item, both intended and understood to be used lawfully, would run afoul of the due process clause. <em>See Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 2298. The drafters of both the Model Act and the Louisiana Act addressed this problem by infusing the requirement of specific intent into the definition of drug paraphernalia and by providing examples. The Act condemns only items used, intended for use, or designed for use with a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">The \u201cintended for use\u201d language applies to the state of mind of the individual charged with the offense of selling, distributing, or displaying drug paraphernalia. The vendor of an item which may be used innocently, incurs no criminal vulnerability unless he believes or intends that the ambivalent item will be used with a controlled substance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No item bears the stigma of drug paraphernalia under La.R.S. 40:1033(A) &amp; (B), absent the seller\u2019s intent that it be used with a controlled substance. Further, no wholesaler or manufacturer can be convicted on the basis of the retailer\u2019s intent. Therefore, the concern appellants raise that an individual could be prosecuted based on intent transferred from a third party is misplaced, at least at this stage, when the only question before us is the facial validity of the Act. In light of the protection of the scienter requirement, and considering that this is an economic regulation, we conclude that the Louisiana Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201cintended for use\u201d language is not imper-missibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Discriminatory Enforcement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Continuing in their challenge, appellants charge that the Louisiana Act is vague because it fails to provide adequate guidelines to avoid the danger of discriminatory enforcement. We find no merit in this contention. The Louisiana Act contains guidelines facially adequate to prevent discriminatory enforcement and to provide a consistent and uniform determination of items within the definitional bounds of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this regard the Louisiana Act differs significantly from the Model Act. In determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, the Model Act refers to the factors \u201ca court or other authority should consider in addition to all other logically relevant factors.\u201d The Louisiana Act contains twelve factors \u201ca court or other authority shall consider, in addition to all other legally relevant factors.\u201d The trial judge was of the opinion that this glossation narrowed the Louisiana Act and made it more precise. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The dozen factors in the Louisiana Act, a refinement of the Model Act, reflect an effort by the Louisiana Legislature to insure that only items used with controlled substances are criminalized. Appellants argue that this listing and the use of the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d in lieu of the Model Act\u2019s permissive \u201cshould\u201d raise the spectre that the Louisiana Act will be discriminatorily enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We cannot accept this proposition. We decline to pronounce the Louisiana Act unconstitutionally vague based on the speculation that it may be discriminatorily enforced. Appellants raise a facial, pre-en-forcement challenge. In that posture, as the Court observed in <em>Hoffman Estates:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">[i]n reviewing a business regulation for facial vagueness . . . the principal inquiry is whether the law affords fair warning of what is proscribed .... This emphasis is almost inescapable in reviewing a pre-enforcement challenge to a law. Here, no evidence has been, or could be, introduced to indicate whether the ordinance has been enforced in a discriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting unpopular speech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">102 S.Ct. at 1195-96.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\n<em>Designed for Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Appellants and amicus contend that the Louisiana Act\u2019s definition of drug paraphernalia as items \u201cdesigned for use\u201d with a controlled substance is fatally vague. The district court did not separately consider this clause but tested the entire phrase \u201cused, intended for use, or designed for use.\u201d Because of the requirement of criminal intent, the entire phrase was found to pass constitutional muster. We agree with the trial judge and go one step further.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">In <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>the Court of Appeals declared the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d language unconstitutional. In reversing, the Supreme Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-15\">A principal meaning of \u201cdesign\u201d is \u201cTo fashion according to a plan.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language 707 (2d ed. 1957). <em>Cf. Lanzetta v. New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 454, n.3 [59 S.Ct. 618, 619, n.3, 83 L.Ed. 888] (1939). It is therefore plain that the standard encompasses at least an item that is principally used with illegal drugs by virtue of its objective features, i.e., features designed by the manufacturer. A business person of ordinary intelligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>would understand that this term refers to the design of the manufacturer, not the intent of the retailer or customer. It is also sufficiently clear that items which are principally .used for non-drug purposes, such as ordinary pipes, are not \u201cdesigned for use\u201d with illegal drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEF\">102 S.Ct. at 1194-95.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Florida Businessmen for Free Enterprise v. City of Hollywood, </em>673 F.2d 1213 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We are persuaded that the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d language of the Louisiana Act similarly applies only to manufacturers, for their own acts of design. This interpretation is supported by the comments to the Model Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and by a common sense reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Prohibited Acts </em>\u2014 Section <em>1033</em></p>\n<p id=\"a-g-dedup-0\">As the trial judge observed, the Louisiana Act diverges most significantly from the Model Act in section 1033, which specifies the prohibited acts. The Model Act forbids the manufacture or delivery of drug paraphernalia under circumstances where one \u201creasonably should know\u201d of intended use with a controlled substance. The Louisiana Act prohibits any person or corporation from selling, distributing or displaying drug paraphernalia, \u201cknowing the drug related nature of the object.\u201d The Louisiana Act omits the constitutionally vulnerable \u201creasonably should know\u201d language.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Appellants argue.that the Louisiana Act gives inadequate notice and is thus defective because it fails to define \u201cdrug related nature of the object.\u201d The prohibited acts refer to drug paraphernalia. By definition, drug paraphernalia must be an item \u201cused, intended for use, or designed for use\u201d with a controlled substance. Appellants\u2019 suggestions that this qualifying clause refers to the purchaser or manufacturer, but not the seller, and that the definitions of \u00a7 1031 cannot be read into \u00a7 1033, are not persuasive. The intent requirement applies to the person or corporation charged. This includes the seller. The Louisiana Act is not constitutionally infirm for failure of adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">\n<em>Rationality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Appellants dispute that the Act bears a rational relation to any legitimate state interest. Acknowledging the state interest in curbing drug abuse, appellants argue that the ready availability of drug paraphernalia does not contribute to that societal problem. The district court found the Act to be rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. We find that conclusion compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Meeting the rational relationship test imposes only a modest burden on the state. <em>Williams v. Lee Optical, Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>75 </em>S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955). One need not squint in the dark to perceive a link between the illegal use of drugs, particularly by youngsters, and items used to facilitate drug use. The Louisiana Legislature is within its constitutional authority when it addresses, in this manner, the problems involved in drug abuse. Whether the measure is wise, prudent, or likely to succeed, is a decision for the legislature. The courtroom is not the forum for that debate. We echo the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Hoffman </em>Estates: \u201cMany American communities have recently enacted laws regulating or prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. Whether these laws are wise or effective is not, of course, the province of this Court.\u201d 102 S.Ct. at 1196 <em>(citing Ferguson v. Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 728-30, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 1030, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">.

The products include \u201croach clips,\u201d water pipes, cocaine spoons and sophisticated kits used to test or process these drugs. We have been advised that total sales of these products amount to at least several hundred million dollars annually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">The advertising, display and open sales of these implements, usually in so-called \u201chead shops\u201d and often in conjunction with the sale of legitimate products promoted among adolescents, are an affront to the communities in which these shops exist because they appear to condone and even glamorize the use of illegal drugs. The attraction of such shops to minors is of particular concern to these communities. As a result, interested community groups have increasingly begun to demand governmental action to deal with the drug paraphernalia industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Hearings Before the House Select Comm, on Narcotics and Drug Abuse Control, 96th Cong., 1st Sess.

The comment to Article I of the Model Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">Drug paraphernalia laws are most often attacked because they are too vaguely worded. They seldom explain what is meant by the term paraphernalia. They do not indicate whether it is the use, or the possession, or the sale of paraphernalia that is prohibited. Moreover, they are usually silent on the criminal state of mind that must accompany the prohibited conduct. This deprives an individual of fair warning as to what the law forbids. It also vests too much discretion in authorities to determine what property and what activities are controlled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">In addition to Louisiana, a substantial number of states have adopted drug paraphernalia statutes based on the Model Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>1980 Conn.Pub.Acts No. 80-224; 16 Del.Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 4701 et seq.

Appellants also contend that the factors listed in \u00a7 1032 \u201cdo not adhere to evidentiary or constitutional guidelines.\u201d Because the Act states that a court or other authority shall consider the enumerated factors, appellants assert that a court must allow the introduction of relevant evidence. So, for example, when \u00a7 1032(1) provides that statements by an owner concerning the use of an item must be considered, appellants argue that this renders the Act unconstitutional because such statements may be hearsay and their admission in evidence may violate the sixth amendment confrontation clause.

We are cognizant that there are a number of distinctions that can be drawn between the Act before us and the ordinance at issue in <em>Hoffman Estates. </em>Most importantly, the ordinance does not provide for criminal penalties. The argument could therefore be made that we should scrutinize the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d language of the Act more closely than the Court scrutinized the village ordinance. However, in <em>Hoffman Estates </em>the Court stated: \u201cthe village concedes that the ordinance is \u2018quasi-criminal,\u2019 and its prohibitory and stigmatizing effect may warrant a relatively strict test. Flipside\u2019s facial challenge fails because, under the test appropriate to either a quasi-criminal or a criminal law, the ordinance is sufficiently clear as applies to Flipside.\u201d 102 S.Ct. at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">We perceive and accord precedential value to <em>Hoffman Estates\u2019 </em>analysis of the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">.
