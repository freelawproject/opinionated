O. Smith-Inland, Inc. poses a thorny question of Louisiana law in this diversity case. We remand for such further fact-finding as may prove necessary, and the application of legal theories thus far not considered, under which EPSCO and Union Carbide may be entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-29\">The facts already developed are readily collated. In February 1977, Union Carbide entered into a contract with EPSCO looking to the replacement of a carbon steel river waterline at Union Carbide\u2019s Texas City, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Texas plant. The agreement specified the use of 16\" fiberglass pipe manufactured by A. 0. Smith. The pipe required \u201cfabrication\u201d to fit the intended use. EPSCO secured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and delivered the necessary pipe to U. S. Machine and Equipment Company, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana firm, with whom it contracted for the assembly work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">A. 0. Smith provided the pipe, in sixty-foot sections, and furnished a special tool and adhesive kits needed to taper and join the sections. Union Carbide furnished drawings to guide the assembly by the employees of U. S. Machine. The Union Carbide/EPSCO fixed price contract required that after fabrication the pipe was to be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test of 150 pounds per square inch. During the testing procedure,. Robert Carter, Jr. and William Woodward, employees of U. S. Machine, were seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Personal injury actions brought by Carter and Woodward, against A. 0. Smith, Union Carbide, EPSCO, and their liability insurers, were consolidated. Reliance Insurance Company, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer, intervened. Union Carbide and EPSCO cross claimed against A. 0. Smith. Just prior to trial, EPSCO, Union Carbide, and Reliance settled with the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who reserved their rights against A. 0. Smith. Reliance preserved its position on its intervention in the event the plaintiffs recovered from A. O. Smith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 suit proceeded to trial before a jury, with the defendants stipulating that the cross claims were to be decided by the court based on the evidence thus presented. On special interrogatories, the jury found that the plaintiffs had been injured by a defective product manufactured by A. O. Smith, that the pipe had not been subject to misuse or mishandling, and that the plaintiffs had not assumed the risk of injury. Further, and of particular relevance to the district court\u2019s disposition of the cross claims, the jury found both Union Qarbide and EPSCO free of any negligence causing injury to either plaintiff. Subsequently the issue of quantum was tried and the jury fixed damages for Carter at $475,-000 and for Woodward at $745,000. The intervention of the compensation carrier was honored, payable out of the sums awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">Based on the jury\u2019s findings on negligence, the district court rejected the EP-SCO and Union Carbide cross claims for indemnification by A. O. Smith. The trial court\u2019s reasoning is straightforward: the jury\u2019s finding that neither Union Carbide nor EPSCO was negligent precluded the categorization of EPSCO, Union Carbide, and A. O. Smith as joint tortfeasors. See La.Civ.Code art. 2324.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>district court concluded, under Louisiana Civil Code article 2103,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that EPSCO and Union Carbide were not entitled to contribution, an obvious preclusion, then, of indemnification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">In resisting the claim of error proffered by EPSCO and Union Carbide, A. O. Smith invites our attention to the opening paragraph of <em>Domingue v. Luke Fruge, Inc., </em>379 So.2d 490 (La.App.1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-6\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether indemnity is available after a settlement agreement, prior to trial, between one of several defendants and the plaintiff where a subsequent jury verdict <em>completely exonerates </em>from liability the settling defendant. The district court held that indemnity is not available. We affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">(Emphasis added.) We are not persuaded that <em>Domingue </em>resolves the dispute before us today. The quoted passage merely states the proposition that indemnity does not lie when a settling defendant subsequently is completely exonerated from all liability to the injured party. We do not perceive the case before us as fitting into that neat mould.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">As owner of the defective fiberglass pipe, Union Carbide<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> could have been liable to Carter and Woodward under a theory of negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But Union Carbide may also have been liable under the provisions of Civil Code article 2317.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-16\">Article 2317, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in <em>Loescher v. Parr, </em>324 So.2d 441 (La.1975), a scholarly opinion by Justice Tate, incorporates into Louisiana law a concept of legal fault, imposing liability on the owner or guardian of a thing, for damages caused by its vice or defect, even though there be no personal negligence. The actionable fault of the owner or guardian, in such an instance, is \u201cbased upon the breach of his legal obligation to keep his thing in such condition or in such control that it does no damage to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. City of Baton Rouge, </em>388 So.2d 737 (La.1980); <em>Hunt v. City Stores, Inc., </em>387 So.2d 585 (La.1980); <em>Marquez </em>v. <em>City Stores, Co., </em>371 So.2d 810 (La.1979); <em>Arceneaux </em>v. <em>Domingue, </em>365 So.2d 1330 (La.1978); <em>Ferguson v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>398 So.2d 72 (La.App.1981); <em>Waller v. Farmland Indus., Inc., </em>392 So.2d 1099 (La.App.1980). <em>See also Rodrigue v. Dixilyn Corp., </em>620 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. 1980). The financial accountability envisioned by article 2317 is \u201cstrict liability.\u201d <em>Hunt v. City Stores, Inc., </em>387 So.2d at 588.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>The facts of this case indicate that Union Carbide was liable to Carter and Woodward as a solidary obligor with A. O. Smith, <em>see </em>La.Civ.Code art. 2091,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but not as a joint tortfeasor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Recently, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, in rejecting the conceptual distinction between perfect and imperfect solidarity, made clear that the accountability involved is solidary even though the liability of one defendant is based on personal negligence and the liability of a second defendant is based on a relationship with the negligent actor (such as master-servant, principal-agent, parent-child). <em>Foster v. Hampton, </em>381 So.2d 789 (La.1980). <em>See Sutton </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>141 La. 469, 75 So. 209 (1917); La.Civ.Code art. 2320; <em>Sampay v. Morton Salt Co., </em>395 So.2d 326 (La.1981); Comment, <em>Tilting Against Windmills: A Solidary Rejoinder, </em>41 La.L.Rev. 1279 (1981). In addition, the Supreme Court of Louisiana has made it clear that two defendants bound to the same obligee, although under different theories of law, may yet be solidary obligors. <em>See Thomas v. W&amp;W Clarklift, Inc., </em>375 So.2d 375 (La.1979) (one defendant obligated under warranty theory with the other defendant bound by reason of negligence); <em>Appalachian Corp., Inc. v. Brooklyn Cooperage Co., Inc., </em>151 La. 41, 91 So. 539 (1922) (negligence and obligation to maintain building in good repair, <em>see </em>La.Civ.Code arts. 667 and 2322). <em>See also </em>Comment, <em>supra </em>note 10, at 695-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">As we appreciate this record, Union Carbide\u2019s liability to the injured workmen would not be premised on negligence, but rather, it would be based on ownership of the injury-causing instrumentality. This liability would be <em>in solido </em>with the manufacturer of the defective product, and may entitle Union Carbide to reimbursement from A. O. Smith. An \u201cinnocent\u201d debtor held liable <em>in solido </em>for the creditor\u2019s protection may have the recourse of indemnification against a co-obligor who is the actual wrongdoer. This equitable adjustment of rights among solidarity bound debtors has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. <em>Appalachian Corp. v. Brooklyn Cooperage Co. </em>and <em>Sutton v. Champagne </em>are early examples. <em>See </em>Johnson, <em>Developments in the Law, 1979-1980 </em>\u2014 Obligations, 41 La.L.Rev. 355, 358 (1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And we find in the Civil Code section titled \u201cOf the Rules Which Govern Obligations with Respect to Debtors In Solido,\u201d article 2106, which, while somewhat cryptic in its phraseology, supports this ultimate apportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>ment of the responsibility of solidary obli-gors. Article 2106 ordains that \u201cif the affair for which the debt has been contracted <em>in solido, </em>concerns only one of the coobligors <em>in solido, </em>that one is liable for the whole debt towards the other codebtors, who, with regard to him, are considered only as his securities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">The record before us does not permit of a definitive answer with respect to EP-SCO\u2019s cross claim. As with Union Carbide, its claim may not be rejected merely because of the jury\u2019s negligence findings. EPSCO also may have had a solidary exposure based on grounds other than simple negligence. Article 2317 speaks of \u201cthings which we have in our custody.\u201d EPSCO apparently arranged for the pipe, secured it from A. 0. Smith, and furnished it to U. S. Machine. On remand and in reconsidering this issue, the district court should make appropriate factual findings and reach legal conclusions of the applicability of the foregoing authorities and discussion to EPSCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">\u25a0 We remand for that purpose. The district court may wish to conduct an eviden-tiary hearing. We do not intend any statement of fact referred to herein, assumed or otherwise, to be taken as etched in granite. The district court may make those findings of fact pertinent to the indemnification claims it considers necessary. Likewise, the court may freely reach those conclusions of law appropriate to resolution of this matter. In doing so, the district court may wish to re-examine its conclusion that A. 0. Smith is not entitled to judgment adjustment as a consequence of the settlements and releases. <em>See </em>La.Civ.Code art. 2203. And the court, on remand, may examine any other aspects of the cross claim not discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">. In passing, the trial court referred to Union Carbide as \u201cowner\u201d of the pipe. Because title is a critical factor, on remand the court should examine this issue and determine whether Union Carbide was indeed the owner and whether EPSCO has an assertible claim of ownership or control over the pipe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">. Woodward received $207,000 \u2014 Union Carbide and EPSCO paid $197,000 and Reliance paid $10,000. Carter received $188,000 \u2014 Union Carbide and EPSCO paid $178,000 and Reliance paid $10,000. Reliance was reimbursed this $20,000 by Union Carbide and EPSCO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">. As stated by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-9\">Plaintiffs granted complete releases to EP-SCO, Union Carbide and Reliance, all parties reserving all rights against A. O. Smith. It was further agreed that if plaintiffs secured judgment against A. O. Smith, Reliance would recover on its compensation intervention to the extent allowed by law. EPSCO and Union Carbide made partial assignments to plaintiff of their cross claims against A. O. Smith, to the extent that Reliance\u2019s compensation intervention might reduce the recovery on the cross claims to be paid, respectively, to EPSCO and Union Carbide.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">. Article 2324 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-15\">He who causes another person to do an unlawful act, or assists or encourages in the commission of it, is answerable, in solido, with that person, for the damage caused by such act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-16\">Persons whose concurring fault has caused injury, death or loss to another are also answerable, in solido; provided, however, when the amount of recovery has been reduced in accordance with the preceding article, a judgment debtor shall not be liable for more than the degree of his fault to a judgment creditor to whom a greater degree of negligence has been attributed, reserving to all parties their respective rights of indemnity and contribution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">.

If the obligation arises from a contract or a quasi-contract, each debtor is liable for his virile portion. If the obligation arises from an offense or a quasi-offense, it shall be divided in proportion to each debt- or\u2019s fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-11\">A defendant who is sued on an obligation which, if it exists, is solidary may seek to enforce contribution, if he is cast, against his solidary co-debtor by making him a third party defendant in the suit, as provided in Article 1111 through 1116 of the Code of Civil Procedure, whether or not the third party defendant was sued by the plaintiff initially, and whether the defendant seeking to enforce contribution if he is cast admits or denies liability on the obligation sued on by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aol-dedup-0\">The text of articles 2103 and 2324 set forth is as amended by Act 431 of 1979. The 1979 amendments are not material to our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1137-18\">. The trial court observed that the jury\u2019s exoneration of EPSCO and Union Carbide from negligence also prevented any reduction in the judgments rendered against A. O. Smith as a consequence of the settlements and releases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1137-19\">. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1137-20\"><em>. </em>The first paragraph of Civil Code article 2315 prescribes: \u201cEvery act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1137-21\">. Article 2317 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-22\">We are responsible, not only for damage occasioned by our own act, but for that which is caused by the act of persons for whom we are answerable, <em>or of the things which we have in our custody.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-23\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1137-24\">. \u201cThe liability arises from ...

La.Civ.Code art. 2091:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-7\">There is an obligation <em>in solido </em>on the part of the debtors, when they are all obliged to the same thing, so that each may be compelled for the whole, and when the payment which is made by one of them, exonerates the others toward the creditor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">. Unlike the general common law notion of joint tortfeasors (including the situation of two or more negligent entities concurring to injure another, rendering joint and several liability for damages caused), properly read, Louisiana\u2019s rule is narrow. Article 2324\u2019s text is couched in conspiratorial terms: \u201cHe who causes another person to do an unlawful act, or assists or encourages in the commission of it, is answerable, in solido, with that person, for the damage caused by such act.\u201d A classic example is the casting of all persons participating in the tarring and feathering of another as joint tort-feasors, liable <em>in solido. Newsom v. Starns, </em>142 So. 704 (La.App.1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">. We do not view the decision in <em>Hunt v. City Stores, Inc., </em>as containing a contrary holding. We recognize that the <em>Hunt </em>court permitted only contribution under article 2103. However, it is significant that the owner of the unreasonably dangerous escalator, manufactured by another, was fully aware of the product\u2019s vice. Because City Stores \u201cfailed to warn the public of a known hazard,\u201d 387 So.2d at 590, it was found at fault and shared the loss equally with the manufacturer. In the case at bar, the jury\u2019s findings absolved Union Carbide of negligence. Its responsibility, as discussed herein, is based on statutorily imposed legal fault, dehors any requirement of negligence. La.Civ.Code art. 2317.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
