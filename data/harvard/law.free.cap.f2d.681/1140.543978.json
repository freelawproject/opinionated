Following a brief trial, the district court entered judgment for the defendant Urban League. In summary Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the court made a single eonclusory finding as the sole explanation of its decision. It found that plaintiff had \u201cfailed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was discriminated against and terminated by reason of her sex.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>that the findings of the district court are insufficient to enable us to understand the basis for its decision under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and we remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine, </em>the Supreme Court established the basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in cases involving alleged discriminatory treatment under Title VII. The Court set forth the now familiar three-part analysis: The plaintiff must first prove a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence; a successful presentation of the prima facie case shifts the burden to the defendant \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the disputed action; then, if the defendant carries this burden, the plaintiff has the opportunity to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proferred reasons are but a pretext for discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1824-25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burdine </em>refined the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>procedure. It is clear after <em>Burdine </em>that while the plaintiff\u2019s burden of establishing a prima facie case is not onerous, the plaintiff nevertheless retains the burden of persuasion throughout the presentation of the case. 450 U.S. at 252-56, 101 S.Ct. at 1093-95. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant bears only a burden of going forward with additional evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons. The defendant does not take on a burden of persuasion. If the defendant satisfies the burden of production, \u201cthe presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 101 S.Ct. at 1095 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">Although <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine </em>present detailed explanations of Title VII procedure, we recognize, as the Third Circuit has recently observed, that the order of proof at every discriminatory treatment trial need not be rigidly \u201ccompartmentalized.\u201d <em>Worthy v. United States Steel Corp., </em>616 F.2d 698, 701 (3d Cir. 1980). The findings of the district court should, however, be sufficiently clear and explicit so that the findings can be examined in the light of the evidence in the record and applicable legal principles. <em>Id.; Corley v. Jackson Police Dep\u2019t, </em>566 F.2d 994, 1000 &amp; n.8 (5th Cir. 1978) (district court\u2019s pro forma conclusions that plaintiffs\u2019 discharges were \u201cproper\u201d and \u201cfor good cause\u201d insufficient to assure reviewing court that court had complied with either <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standards or Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-14\">The district court here addressed only the ultimate issue of discrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>Although the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving discrimination, the shifting intermediate burdens of going forward are intended to \u201cbring the litigants and the court expeditiously and fairly to this ultimate question.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093. The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under Rule 52 should serve rather than defeat that purpose, and that purpose can be served only if the findings and conclusions address the intermediate issues. <em>See Lynn v. Regents of the University of California, </em>656 F.2d 1337, 1344 (9th Cir. 1981) <em>(McDonnell Douglas </em>process would be frustrated if the three-step analysis were \u201ccollapsed\u201d into one step, citing <em>Board of Trustees of Keene State College v. Sweeney, </em>439 U.S. 24, 24 n.1, 99 S.Ct. 295, 295 n.1, 58 L.Ed.2d 216 (1978) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">While this Circuit has not previously discussed the need for findings keyed to the <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>analysis in employment discrimination cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Circuit has consistently interpreted Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require that findings be \u201cso explicit as to give the appellate court a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision .... \u201d <em>Irish </em>v. <em>United States, </em>225 F.2d 3, 8 (9th Cir. 1955). <em>Accord, SouthWestern Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Simons, </em>651 F.2d 653, 655 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1714, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982); <em>Alpha Distributing Co. v. Jack Daniel Distillery, </em>454 F.2d 442, 453 (9th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 842, 95 S.Ct. 74, 42 L.Ed.2d 70 (1974); <em>In re Laguna Lake Mobile Home Park, </em>439 F.2d 4, 5 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">We could, of course, affirm the district court without the need for further findings if the plaintiff could not prevail under any possible interpretation of the evidence. Thus, the lack of reference to <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standards would not adversely affect our ability to review this case if the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to create a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-15\">There is in this case, however, ample evidence which would support a finding that the plaintiff proved a prima facie case. This record contains evidence of plaintiff\u2019s qualifications for the job; it contains an EEOC determination of reasonable cause to believe that the plaintiff was treated in a disparate manner. <em>See Plummer v. Western Int\u2019l Hotels Co., </em>656 F.2d 502, 504-05 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Soc\u2019y, </em>569 F.2d 1066, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 1978) (EEOC determinations admissible in Title VII suit, with weight determined by trier of fact). There is also evidence, albeit contradicted, of discriminatory animus in the remarks of plaintiff\u2019s superior that women of appellant\u2019s age should be at home rather than working. We cannot tell how the trier of fact evaluated any of the evidence, and we in turn are therefore unable to evaluate the contentions of the parties with respect to later phases of the <em>McDonnell DouglasBurdine </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-16\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further findings which, in the discretion of the district court, may be on the basis of the existing record or upon a record supplemented by additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">.
