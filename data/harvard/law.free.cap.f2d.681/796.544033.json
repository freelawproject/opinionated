We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We agree with the more realistic concept of the common meaning of \u201cprotection\u201d in item 685.90, TSUS used by the court below and with its conclusion that appellee\u2019s imported goods do not provide that type of protection, i.e., protection of circuits from electrical overloads, surges, and other electrical faults during abnormal situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Even though the meanings of the terms \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201cconnections\u201d in item 685.90; TSUS may appear clear superficially, they contribute little to our understanding of whether Congress intended to include the imported goods under that item either as \u201cother electrical apparatus * * * for protection of electrical circuits\u201d or as \u201cother electrical apparatus * * * for making connections to or in electrical circuits.\u201d Thus the court below was proper in reviewing legislative history to determine the intended scope of item 685.90, TSUS. <em>Nippon Kogaku (USA), Inc. v. United States, </em>69 CCPA -, 673 F.2d 380 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">After a thorough consideration of the record, briefs,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and oral argument, we find no reversible error in the decision and opinion of the court below that the imported goods were correctly classifiable in item 687.60, TSUS. Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the lower court and adopt its opinion as our own.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">The briefs included one filed by Texas Instruments Incorporated as <em>amicus curiae </em>supporting the position of appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b869-11\">NIES, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AI1V\">with whom MILLER, Judge, joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">I would agree with the majority to adopt the opinion of the Court of International Trade except for the lower court\u2019s denomination of the <em>Explanatory Notes to the Brussels Nomenclature </em>(1955) as \u201clegislative history,\u201d which it viewed as controlling with respect to the intent of Congress in adopting the subject language. Rather, as the court below also stated, the <em>Brussels Nomenclature </em>is \u201can aid to interpreting\u201d provisions of the TSUS where there is a \u201cclose similarity in the wording of the provisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Abbey Rents, </em>66 CCPA 2, 4, C.A.D. 1213, 585 F.2d 501, 504 n.5 (1978) (Baldwin, J.). Characterization as \u201clegislative history\u201d was unnecessary and it appears to me that the court gave greater weight to that \u201caid\u201d than I believe is appropriate although the result here is correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
