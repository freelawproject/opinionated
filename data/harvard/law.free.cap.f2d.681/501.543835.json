A visit until October 1,1979, was authorized by her visa; she, however, stayed past the October 1 deadline. On January 29,1981, petitioner was apprehended by an immigration official. Deportation proceedings were then commenced against the petitioner by an order to show cause dated January 30, 1981. Petitioner was charged under section 241(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.2(a), the District Director authorized the release of petitioner under a $2,000 bond. Petitioner appealed the amount of the bond and at a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, held pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.2(b), the bond was reduced to $1,500. The petitioner paid the $1,500 bond, was released, and is presently at liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">Petitioner appealed the decision of the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals contending, first, that there was no need for bond and, second, that her constitutional rights were violated because the bond was excessive and there was no transcript of the bond redetermination hearing. The Board rejected petitioner\u2019s contentions and held a $1,500 bond was necessary to ensure her presence at future deportation proceedings since she had no family in the United States and had previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ously ignored the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As of this date, no deportation hearing has been held nor order entered against petitioner. Petitioner now seeks review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Section 106 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a governs this court\u2019s jurisdiction of direct appeals of final orders of deportation. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u00a7 1105a. <em>Judicial review of orders of deportation and exclusion</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAF\">\n<em>(a) Exclusiveness of procedure</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">The procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, shall apply to, and <em>shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation, </em>heretofore or hereafter <em>made against aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(b) </em>of this title or comparable provisions of any prior Act, * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Petitioner contends the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is appealable under section 1105a. We must decide whether the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals concerning petitioner\u2019s bond is a \u201cfinal order of deportation\u201d subject to direct review in this court under section 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">There has been much litigation concerning the meaning and parameters of \u201cfinal orders of deportation.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Dastmal-chi v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>660 F.2d 880 (3d Cir. 1981). <em>See generally </em>Friendly, <em>The Gap in Lawmaking, </em>63 Col.L.Rev. 787, 795-796 (1963). In <em>Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963), the first Supreme Court case on this issue, the Court held that \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d include denials of suspension of deportation. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">* * * It seems apparent that, because of the consistent practice under the administrative regulations since 1940 of adjudicating deportability and passing on applications for discretionary relief in the same proceeding, the final administrative action that Congress was thinking of in using the phrase \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d included denials of suspension of deportation. * * * <em>[Id. </em>at 232, 84 S.Ct. at 315.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Next in a short per curiam opinion, <em>Giova v. Rosenberg, </em>379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90 (1964), the Supreme Court held that \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d encompassed denials of motions to reopen deportation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">In its most recent case on section 1105a, <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>392 U.S. 206, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968), the Supreme Court has placed a limitation upon \u201cfinal orders of deportation.\u201d In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>the petitioner conceded his deportability but obtained permission to depart the United States voluntarily. Petitioner, however, failed to voluntarily depart and was subsequently ordered to surrender for deportation. At that time, he requested a stay of deportation pending submission and disposition of an adjustment of status. The District Director found the petitioner to be ineligible for such an adjustment of status. The Court after reviewing the legislative history of section 106 of the Act held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">* * * the judicial review provisions of \u00a7 106(a) embrace <em>only those determinations made during a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b), </em>including those determinations made incident to a motion to reopen such proceedings. [Footnote omitted; emphasis supplied; 392 U.S. at 216, 88 S.Ct. at 1976.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">Thus the decision of the District Director in a proceeding separate from the deportation hearing was held not to be a \u201cfinal order of deportation\u201d subject to direct review in the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Custody, bond, and parole determinations are governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deportation proceedings, on the other hand, are governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (1976) (as amended by 95 Stat. 1620).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The literal language of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1105a requires re viewable orders be entered \u201cpursuant to administrative proceedings under section <em>1252(b) </em>of [title 8] * * *.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] The order in this case concerned a bond determination and was made pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(a), not section 1252(b). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.2(b), which details bond review hearings, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">* * * Consideration under this paragraph by the immigration judge of an application or request of an alien regarding custody or bond shall be separate and apart from any deportation hearing or proceeding under this part, and shall form no part of such hearing or proceeding or of the record thereof. The determination of the immigration judge as to custody status or bond may be based upon any information which is available to the immigration judge or which is presented to him by the alien or the Service. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Thus it is clear bond hearings are separate and apart from deportation hearings. The considerations taken into account in a bond hearing do not form part of the record in the deportation proceeding. Whether or not bond is required has no bearing on whether a final order of deportation will be entered. A bond determination is not a final order of deportation, is not made during an administrative proceeding under section 1252(b), and does not effect the deportation proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>the Court held only determinations made during a proceeding conducted under section 1252(b) and those determinations made incident to a motion to reopen such proceedings are appealable under section 1105a. An order of deportation had been entered against Cheng Fan Kwok and as a result of a subsequent denial of relief, it was clear Cheng Fan Kwok was to be deported. The Court drew a distinction between discretionary relief determinations made during a deportation hearing and those made subsequent to the deportation hearing. Our case is simpler. Not only was the determination at issue made in a proceeding separate from the deportation proceeding but no order of deportation has been entered against petitioner nor have deportation proceedings even begun. We have no idea whether or not petitioner will be deported. We therefore find that bond determinations are not \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d subject to appeal under section 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Furthermore section 1252(a) provides its own mechanism for <em>special limited </em>review of bond, custody and parole determinations. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">* * * Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or parole pending final decision of deportability <em>upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances </em>in the case of any alien to determine deportability. [Emphasis supplied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Habeas corpus proceedings brought in district court allow for more immediate review than appeals under section 1105a. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 (1976). To allow fuller, less immediate review under section 1105a would negate an important purpose of that section. That purpose is \u201cto expedite the deportation of undesirable aliens by preventing successive dilatory appeals to various federal courts * * <em>Foti, </em>375 U.S. at 226, 84 S.Ct. at 312; <em>see also United States ex rel. Marcello v. District Director, </em>634 F.2d 964, 967-970 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 3052, 69 L.Ed.2d 421 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, we hold that bond determinations made pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.2 are not directly appealable to Courts of Appeals under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. We therefore find we do not have jurisdiction of petitioner\u2019s appeal of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals. The petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-14\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201c\u00a7 1251. <em>Deportable aliens </em>\u2014 General <em>classes</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201c(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7x\">\u201c(2) entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General or is in the United States in violation of this chapter or in violation of any other law of the United States;\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\">.

But such bond or parole, whether heretofore or hereafter authorized, may be revoked at any time by the Attorney General, in his discretion, and the alien may be returned to custody under the warrant which initiated the proceedings against him and detained until final determination of his deportability. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or parole pending final decision of deportability upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances in the case of any alien to determine deportability.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\n<em>Proceedings to determine deportability; removal expenses</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u201c(b) A special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings under this section to determine the deportability of any alien, and shall administer oaths, present and receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses, and, as authorized by the Attorney General, shall make determinations, including orders of deportation. Determination of deportability in any case shall be made only upon a record made in a proceeding before a special inquiry officer, at which the alien shall have reasonable opportunity to be present, unless by reason of the alien\u2019s mental incompetency it is impracticable for him to be present, in which case the Attorney General shall prescribe necessary and proper safeguards for the rights and privileges of such alien. If any alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding under this section, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at such proceeding, the special inquiry officer may proceed to a determination in like manner as if the alien were present. In any case or class of cases in which the Attorney General believes that such procedure would be of aid in making a determination, he may require specifically or by regulation that an additional immigration officer shall be assigned to present the evidence on behalf of the United States and in such case such additional immigration officer shall have authority to present evidence, and to interrogate, examine and cross-examine the alien or other witnesses in the proceedings. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred upon the special inquiry officer conducting such proceedings. No special inquiry officer shall conduct a proceeding in any case under this section in which he shall have participated in investigative functions or in which he shall have participated (except as provided in this subsection) in prosecuting functions.
