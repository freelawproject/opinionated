We find both to be without merit and affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-21\">Appellant first contends that the district court erred when, after reviewing the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, it <em>sua sponte </em>conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing. As this court has recently noted, \u201cin determining whether to accept, reject, or modify the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations, the district court has the duty to conduct a careful and complete review.\u201d <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404 at 408 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc). A district judge, without the discretion to order a <em>de novo </em>hearing on important issues of fact, may not be able to conduct a \u201ccareful and complete review.\u201d Too, the power of a district judge to conduct such a hearing, even though no objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations' were filed, was implicitly recognized by this court when we observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-22\">In order to adequately determine the credibility of a witness as to such constitutional issues, the fact finder must observe the witness. This may be accomplished either by the district judge accepting the determination of the magistrate after reading the record, or by rejecting the magistrate\u2019s decision and coming to an independent decision after hearing the testimony and viewing the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-23\"><em>Louis v. Blackburn, </em>630 F.2d 1105 (5th Cir. 1980). We now expressly hold that a district court may, on its own motion, conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing in order to aid its review of a magistrate\u2019s report in an application for post trial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-24\">Appellant also contends that his retained counsel failed to provide adequate assistance. Trial counsel\u2019s conduct of the case, having been unsuccessful, is criticized. A fair reading of the record, however, shows that the attorney\u2019s acts were the results of strategic decisions designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>demonstrate his client\u2019s honesty and candor, as opposed to unwarranted police harassment and vindictiveness. We thus reject appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
