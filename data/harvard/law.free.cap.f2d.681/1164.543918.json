The district court dismissed a felony indictment for illegal entry on the ground of presumed vindictiveness because the indictment followed entry of a not guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge at an initial appearance before the magistrate. The Government appeals. We reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-18\">In accordance with a long-standing agreement between the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) and the Arizona United States Attorney, designed for a heavy volume of illegal entry cases, INS has the authority to file misdemeanor illegal entry complaints for later prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. Felony complaints for illegal entry, though, require prior approval by the U.S. Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-19\">On March 1, 1981, immigration agents apprehended Gallegos-Curiel, the appellee here, for entering the country illegally. The next day an immigration agent prepared and filed a complaint charging appellee with misdemeanor illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 (1976), and presented appel-lee before a magistrate, with counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ap-pellee entered a plea of not guilty at the initial appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-20\">When the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office received the trial setting order from the magistrate a few days later, it reviewed appellee\u2019s complete file, including his prior non-immigration record.

The district court granted the motion and dismissed the felony indictment. In accepting the vindictive prosecution claim, the district court concluded that the INS agent could have had access to the non-immigration record, and that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office would not have reviewed appellee\u2019s file if he had pled guilty to the misdemean- or. We must decide whether vindictiveness can be inferred from the challenged prose-cutorial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">The doctrine of vindictive prosecution must not be misapplied by blurring the distinction between what is actual retaliation and what is presumed. The presumption applies only to the extent it reflects the very real likelihood of actual vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">In <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), the Supreme Court acknowledged that a defendant may not be punished for successfully challenging his conviction, <em>id. </em>at 723-24, 89 S.Ct. at 2079, and the Court for the first time developed the doctrine of presumed vindictiveness in recognition of the fact that \u201c[t]he existence of a retaliatory motivation would, of course, be extremely difficult to prove in any individual case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 725 n.20, 89 S.Ct. at 2080 n.20. In order \u201cto assure the absence of such a [retaliatory] motivation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081, the Court held that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for doing so must appear, and if no such objective information appears, vindictiveness can be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">In <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974), the Court considered the <em>Pearce </em>rule of presumed retaliation in the context of prosecutorial behavior. There the prosecutor filed a felony indictment against a defendant after he had exercised a statutory right to trial <em>de novo </em>in state superior court following his misdemeanor conviction in an inferior court without a jury. The Court held \u201cthe opportunities for vindictiveness in this situation are such as to impel the conclusion that due process of law requires a rule analogous to that of the <em>Pearce </em>case.\u201d 417 U.S. at 27, 94 S.Ct. at 2102. The Court emphasized that the premise of the <em>Pearce </em>inferred vindictiveness rule \u201cis that the Due Process Clause is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of \u2018vindictiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">When there is no evidence of actual vindictiveness and the only question is whether it must be presumed, cases involving increased charges or punishments after trial are to be sharply distinguished from cases in which the prosecution increases charges in the course of pretrial proceedings. This has been established by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. </em>Goodwin, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982). In <em>Goodwin </em>the defendant was arraigned before a magistrate on misdemeanor and petty offenses. After plea negotiations with the prosecutor, the defendant requested a jury trial in district court. After the case was assigned to an Assistant United States Attorney, the defendant was indicted and convicted on a felony charge. He alleged vindictive prosecution. The Supreme Court held that a presumption of vindictiveness was not warranted in that pretrial setting. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The Court analyzed the timing and the nature of the right which the defendant had exercised and concluded that it did not present a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">First, the Court recognized that before the trial has begun, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized.\u201d - U.S. at - - -, 102 S.Ct. at 2493. Because the prosecutor may properly reevaluate information as the case develops, he \u201cshould remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2493 (footnote omitted). Furthermore, because before trial many procedural rights are asserted quite routinely, as \u201can integral part of the adversary process\u201d, it would be \u201cunrealistic to assume that a prosecutor\u2019s probable response to such motions is to seek to penalize and to deter,\u201d even if they do burden the prosecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">After considering the timing of the defendant\u2019s action, the Court in <em>Goodwin </em>analyzed the nature of the right asserted. Although the plea of not guilty forced the Government to prove its case, the Court found that the plea did not warrant a presumption that subsequent modification of the charges was unjustified, even when the not guilty plea was coupled with the request for and burdens imposed by a jury trial. The not guilty plea and request for jury trial did not force the duplicative expenditure of prosecutorial resources, and hence did not invoke the institutional bias against the retrial of decided issues that might motivate a vindictive reaction, as did the asserted rights in <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge. Id. </em>at - - -, 102 S.Ct. at 2494. The Court concluded that the severe presumpton of vindictive prosecution was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">The holding in <em>Goodwin </em>and the analysis developed from <em>Pearce </em>to <em>Goodwin </em>dictate our conclusion that a presumption of vindictiveness is not warranted in this case. This circuit has applied the presumption of vindictiveness doctrine in the form of the \u201cappearance of vindictiveness\u201d test. Absent direct evidence of an expressed hostility or threat to the defendant for having exercised a constitutional right, see, <em>e.g., United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., </em>646 F.2d 384 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em>grounds, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 3081, 73 L.Ed.2d 754 (1982) (per curiam); <em>United States v. DeMarco, </em>550 F.2d 1224 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 827, 98 S.Ct. 105, 54 L.Ed.2d 85 (1977), to establish a claim of vindictive prosecution the defendant must make an initial showing that charges of increased severity were filed because the accused exercised a statutory, procedural, or constitutional right in circumstances that give rise to an appearance of vindictiveness. <em>See United States v. Burt, </em>619 F.2d 831, 836 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>617 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 863, 101 S.Ct. 167, 66 L.Ed.2d 80 (1980). If there is a sufficient prima facie showing of vindictiveness, the burden shifts to the prosecution to show that any increase in the severity of the charges did not stem from a vindictive motive, or was justified by independent reasons or intervening circumstances that dispel the appearance of vindictiveness. <em>United States v. Burt, </em>619 F.2d at 836; <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>617 F.2d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-16\">The principle of vindictive prosecution is not a fiction, either in concept or in its implementation. The appearance of vindictiveness test is not a per se rule striking down any increased charge following any act by the defendant. The appearance of vindictiveness does not embody the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>fallacy, <em>see United States v. Robison, </em>644 F.2d 1270, 1273 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>United States v. Linton, </em>655 F.2d 930 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 1984, 68 L.Ed.2d 301 (1981); the link of vindictiveness cannot be inferred simply because the prosecutor\u2019s actions followed the exercise of a right, or because they would not have been taken but for exercise of a defense right. <em>United States v. Robison, </em>644 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>at 1273. Rather, the appearance of vindictiveness results only where, as a practical matter, there is a realistic or reasonable likelihood of prosecutorial conduct that would not have occurred but for hostility or a punitive animus towards the defendant because he has exercised his specific legal rights. Goodwin, - U.S. at -, -, 102 S.Ct. at 2488, 2494.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">When increased charges are filed in the routine course of prosecutorial review or as a result of continuing investigation, <em>see United States v. Griffin, </em>617 F.2d at 1347, there is no realistic likelihood of prosecutorial abuse, and therefore no appearance of vindictive prosecution arises merely because the prosecutor\u2019s action was taken after a defense right was exercised. As the Court in <em>Goodwin </em>stated, \u201c[a] charging decision does not levy an improper \u2018penalty\u2019 unless it results solely from the defendant\u2019s exercise of a protected legal right, rather than the prosecutor\u2019s normal assessment of the societal interest in prosecution.\u201d - U.S. at - n.11, 102 S.Ct. at 2492 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">Vindictiveness is antithetical to a fair evaluation of the case. If an objective assessment of the prosecution\u2019s position reveals that charges should be increased or made more precise to take account of information not previously known to the prosecutor or to state more accurately the Government\u2019s position, then the prosecution has the right, if not the duty, to do so, provided there is no procedural unfairness to the defendant, see <em>id. </em>at -, - &amp; n.14, 102 S.Ct. at 2493 &amp; n.14; <em>Griffin, </em>617 F.2d at 1348. It is only when prosecutorial actions stem from an animus toward the exercise of a defendant\u2019s rights that vindictive prosecution exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">In every case alleging inferred vindictive prosecution, there must be a threshold showing of vindictiveness or the likelihood of it before the court is justified in inquiring into the prosecutor\u2019s actual motives. The exercise of routine or clearly necessary defense motions in the pretrial stage does not meet the threshold for more detailed inquiry and does not suffice to raise the presumption of vindictiveness. As did the Supreme Court in <em>Goodwin, </em>we will analyze the timing and nature of defendant\u2019s act to determine whether the prosecutor likely acted for a punitive or retaliatory motive so that the presumption is warranted. The case before us contains no allegations of express threats or harassment. The allegations are simply that there is an appearance of vindictive prosecution because the appellee was indicted for a felony after he entered a plea of not guilty to a misdemeanor at an initial appearance before a magistrate. Under <em>Goodwin </em>that sequence of events is not alone sufficient to raise an appearance of vindictive prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">Appellee entered his initial plea of not guilty on the same day the misdemeanor complaint was prepared and the day after he was apprehended. The felony indictment was sought only a few days later, well before trial. At this pretrial stage in the proceedings, the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of society\u2019s interest in prosecuting appellee certainly could not have crystallized, and the prosecution should not be bound by the initial charge filed by the INS upon apprehension. As the Court in <em>Goodwin </em>acknowledged, \u201c[i]n the course of preparing a case for trial, the prosecutor may uncover additional information that suggests a basis for further prosecution or he simply may come to realize that information possessed by the State has a broader significance.\u201d - U.S. -at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2493. \u201cTo presume that every case is complete at the time an initial charge is filed, ..., is to presume that every prosecutor is infallible \u2014 an assumption that would ignore the practical restraints imposed by often limited prosecutorial resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at - n.14, 102 S.Ct. at 2493 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">The prosecution\u2019s assessment of appellee\u2019s case demonstrates a proper reevaluation of new and existing information concerning a defendant\u2019s conduct to further society\u2019s best interests. Such pretrial prosecutorial conduct should not be burdened with presumptions of vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>at - - -, 102 S.Ct. at 2493. The original misdemeanor complaint was prepared by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>INS under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney that had been established as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to handle the flow of illegal entry cases. The felony indictment was prepared by an agent in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office after his initial review of the case and appellee\u2019s complete file, including appellee\u2019s non-immigration criminal record, which was not available to the INS agent who prepared the misdemeanor complaint. The prosecutor thus was motivated in part by additional information, <em>cf. Perry, </em>417 U.S. at 29 n.7, 94 S.Ct. at 2103 n.7 (altered circumstances might justify more serious charge), and in part by his reevaluation of the seriousness of appellant\u2019s immigration record, which, as discussed above, <em>Goodwin </em>recognized is a proper, nontainted prosecutorial function. <em>Cf. United States v. Robison, </em>644 F.2d at 1273 (involvement of separate sovereigns negates vindictive prosecution claim); <em>Griffin, </em>617 F.2d at 1347 (investigations by two unrelated agencies refutes claim of appearance of vindictiveness). In <em>Goodwin </em>the decision to bring felony charges was made in circumstances quite similar to those here; it was made by a new prosecutor based upon his reassessment of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s crime and subsequent conduct. - U.S. at - n.2, 102 S.Ct. at 2488 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">In this pretrial setting, moreover, the entry of the not guilty plea, like the motion to be tried by jury, is routinely made and is expected as part of the adversary process, so that it is unrealistic to assume the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial response would be vindictively motivated. The timing of appellee\u2019s procedural right demonstrates clearly that no presumption of vindictiveness is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The nature of the right appellee asserted here also does not warrant a presumption of vindictiveness, as <em>Goodwin </em>directly held. \u201cThis Court in <em>Bordenkircher [v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) ] made clear that the mere fact that a defendant refuses to plead guilty and forces the Government to prove its case is insufficient to warrant a presumption that subsequent changes in the charging decision are unjustified.\u201d - U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2494. Entering a plea of not guilty is common and, in the initial stages of the proceeding, is more often a matter of form than of choice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plea does not in every case commit the defendant to such a course of confrontation with the prosecution so that we can say that it will always, or even in the ordinary course of events, pose a danger of retaliation or present a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. <em>Cf. United States v. Linton, </em>655 F.2d at 932 (claim that charges against nontarget grand jury witness after he claimed the privilege against self-incrimination were vindictively brought was \u201cso preposterous on its face as to require no discussion\u201d). Furthermore, the entry of the not guilty plea did not, as in <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blaekledge, </em>force the adjudication of issues previously decided by trial or require significant duplicative expenditures of prosecutorial resources before a final judgment could be obtained. <em>See Goodwin, </em>- U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2494; <em>cf. Blaekledge, supra </em>(invocation of statutory right to trial <em>de novo </em>in superior court following misdemeanor conviction in inferi- or court); <em>Pearce, supra </em>(exercise of statutory right to appeal following conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">Finally, it should be recognized that even if the prosecutor had increased the charges against appellee because his initial expectation that appellee would plead guilty to the misdemeanor proved unfounded, this would have been a legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Departures from the initial indictment do not raise presumptions of vindictiveness except in a rare case. The initial indictment \u201cdoes not necessarily define the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>legitimate interest in prosecution.\u201d <em>Goodwin, - </em>U.S. at - - -, 102 S.Ct. at 2492. The felony charge against appellee was clearly justified, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office properly exercised its discretion and duty to protect society\u2019s interest by increasing the charge against appellee to a felony. We hold that the procedural right exercised here, the not guilty plea at an initial appearance before the magistrate, even though it may present opportunities for vindictiveness, fails to present a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness and fails to trigger the threshold appearance of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Appellee\u2019s assertion that but for the plea of not guilty the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office would not have reviewed appellee\u2019s file and filed the felony indictment is to no avail. A sequence of events is not enough; the likelihood of retaliation is crucial. <em>See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. at 363, 98 S.Ct. at 667 (\u201cthe due process violation in cases such as <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Perry </em>lay not in the possibility that a defendant might be deterred from the exercise of a right, . . . but rather in the danger that the State might be retaliating against the accused for lawfully attacking his conviction\u201d); <em>United States v. Thurnhuber, </em>572 F.2d 1307, 1310 n.3 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>cf. Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973) (upon retrial following reversal of original conviction second jury unaware of original sentence could impose greater sentence); <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972) (after trial <em>de novo </em>court of general jurisdiction could impose sentence greater than that imposed in inferior trial court because little possibility of personal vindictiveness). <em>See also Goodwin, </em>- U.S. at - - - &amp; n.5, 102 S.Ct. at 2488-92 &amp; n.5 (discussing prior cases); <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 25-27, 94 S.Ct. at 2101 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">We conclude that the circumstances surrounding appellee\u2019s indictment for felony illegal entry after his plea of not guilty at an initial appearance before the magistrate do not raise a threshold appearance of vindictiveness sufficient to trigger an inquiry into the prosecutor\u2019s actual motives. A careful examination of whether an appearance is raised is generally essential to prevent wasteful delays of trial and to screen out frivolous vindictive prosecution claims. The severe presumption should not be invoked lightly. Goodwin, - U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2489. We hold that the trial court therefore abused its discretion in granting the motion to dismiss the felony indictment on prosecutorial vindictiveness grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">.
