To establish eligibility, he must prove that his father, at death, was \u201ccontributing to the applicant\u2019s support\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He presented the following undisputed evidence through affidavits and testimony at his Social Security Administration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Doran is the child of Doris Clark and Kim Mace. Mace and Clark began living together in December 1969. In early January, after Clark discovered that she was pregnant, Mace publicly acknowledged his paternity. At the end of January, after a disagreement, Clark moved out to a cabin on a ranch, where she was provided free lodging, and, in return for taking care of a child, free meals. During the time they lived together, Mace and Clark were both unemployed. Each contributed to the rent and food from other funds. After Ms. Clark left, Mace took a job. He did not contribute money to her support, but at her request, he made three or four trips moving her to the cabin, and hurried out to repair her roof during a rainstorm. Mace killed himself March 16,1970, when Ms. Clark was three months pregnant. Kyle Doran was born October 3, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-18\">In 1974, Doran applied for but was denied Social Security Child\u2019s insurance benefits. He then requested and was granted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who found Doran ineligible for bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>fits. The Social Security Administration Appeals Council affirmed, but the district court in 1978 remanded the case to the Secretary for reconsideration in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Adams v. Weinberger, </em>521 F.2d 656 (2d Cir. 1975). On remand, the ALJ again found Doran ineligible and the appeals council again affirmed. Doran appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The first issue is what test this court should adopt to determine whether a father was contributing sufficient support to his unborn illegitimate child to render the child eligible for benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii). The statute states that an illegitimate child is eligible for benefits if he can prove his father, at death, was \u201ccontributing to the support of the applicant.\u201d The statute is silent on the issue of the required amount of support; it contains no language suggesting how much or how often the father must contribute support to render his posthumous child eligible for survivor benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The Secretary contends the correct test for interpreting \u201ccontributing to the support of the applicant\u201d is the one now incorporated into the Social Security regulations, whether the father was contributing support to his unborn child in a regular and substantial manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Doran instead advocates the test formulated by the Second Circuit in <em>Adams. </em>There, under circumstances involving an illegitimate posthumous birth, the court examined whether the father\u2019s support \u201cwas commensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time of the father\u2019s death.\u201d 521 F.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to deference if it has a \u201creasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>390 U.S. 261, 272, 88 S.Ct. 929, 935, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968). However, \u201c[rjeviewing courts are not obliged to stand aside and rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The Social Security Act is remedial, to be construed liberally. <em>Benitez v. Califano, </em>573 F.2d 653, 655 (9th Cir. 1978). The primary purpose of the social security scheme at issue is to provide support for dependents. <em>See Jimenez v. Weinberger, </em>417 U.S. 628, 634, 94 S.Ct. 2496, 2500, 41 L.Ed.2d 363 (1974). We find merit in other courts\u2019 determinations that the Act\u2019s remedial purposes are not served by the Secretary\u2019s test. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>521 F.2d 656, 660 (2d Cir. 1975), the Second Circuit implied that in cases involving illegitimate posthumous births, the Secretary\u2019s test is not rationally related to the Act\u2019s remedial goals: \u201cAn unborn child is totally dependent upon its mother for its human needs. Thus, a legal requirement that the father\u2019s support of the unborn child must be \u2018regular\u2019 and \u2018continuous\u2019 is purposeless.\u201d The Sixth Circuit characterized the Secretary\u2019s test as \u201cludicrous,\u201d even when not applied to illegitimate posthumous births:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-12\">Obviously, continuously regular and substantial contributions is a just stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>dard when the wage earner\u2019s income is regular and substantial. But where the income of a wage earner lacks continuity and substantiality and contributions are nevertheless given, a different criterion should be applied. Where a wage earner is poor and earns an irregular income, it is ludicrous to require regular and substantial payments to his children born out of wedlock or not. The wage-earner is barely supporting himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><em>Boyland v. Califano, </em>633 F.2d 430, 434 (6th Cir. 1980). <em>See also Jones v. Harris, </em>629 F.2d 334, 336 (4th Cir. 1980) (the government\u2019s test directly contravenes the purposes of the Act \u201cbecause the loss of small, regular contributions to a poor family would cause the economic dislocation the Act seeks to prevent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In sum, the Secretary can find no support for a \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test in the remedial goals of the Act. The Secretary nonetheless contends the \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test more effectively promotes administrative convenience, and is thus the more appropriate test under <em>Mathews v. Lucas, </em>427 U.S. 495, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 49 L.Ed.2d 651 (1976), which held that administrative convenience is a constitutionally permissible rationale for congressional distinctions on the basis of illegitimacy to determine eligibility for Social Security benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 509, 96 S.Ct. at 2764. The Secretary argues that because the <em>Adams </em>test provides only vague guidelines, its resulting case-by-case adjudication hinders the efficient administration of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Doran, also relying on <em>Lucas, </em>responds that even if the Secretary\u2019s test promotes administrative convenience, this rationale is constitutionally impermissible if it conclusively denies illegitimate children the opportunity to establish their eligibility for benefits. See <em>id. </em>at 512, 96 S.Ct. at 2765; <em>Jimenez v. Weinberger, </em>417 U.S. 628, 635-36, 94 S.Ct. 2496, 2501, 41 L.Ed.2d 363 (1974). The Secretary concedes that the government may not irrebuttably presume that certain illegitimate children are ineligible, but claims the \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test does not deny an illegitimate child the opportunity to demonstrate his father\u2019s support. The Secretary contends his test merely requires the child to prove his father\u2019s support was regular and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The Secretary\u2019s test does not deny all illegitimate children the opportunity to prove their father\u2019s support, but, as the Second Circuit found, it \u201cwould prevent almost all <em>posthumous </em>[illegitimate] children from qualifying\u201d for survivor benefits. <em>Adams v. Weinberger, </em>521 F.2d 656, 660 (2d Cir. 1975) (emphasis added). Indeed, in this case, the mother left the improverished father against his will, undermining both the father\u2019s opportunity to support his unborn child and the posthumous child\u2019s opportunity to prove his father\u2019s support was \u201cregular and substantial.\u201d <em>Cf. Mills v. Habluetzel, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1549, 1553, 71 L.Ed.2d 770 (1982) (one-year state statute of limitations for illegitimate children to prove paternity held unconstitutional because it provides \u201can opportunity so truncated that few could utilize it effectively\u201d). Because the \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test denies virtually all posthumous illegitimate children the ability to demonstrate their father\u2019s support, the Secretary cannot rely on a claim that his test promotes administrative convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">We conclude that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test improperly interprets the statutory mandate and frustrates the goals of the Social Security Act. We therefore refuse to adopt the \u201cregular and substantial\u201d test to determine whether an impoverished father was \u201ccontributing to the support\u201d of his illegitimate child under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii). We instead agree with Doran that the <em>Adams </em>test is substantially related to the Act\u2019s remedial goals, affording applicants like Doran the opportunity to prove eligibility for benefits. Yet it effectively weeds out spurious claims by placing the burden on the applicant to prove his father\u2019s paternity and support, <em>see Lucas, </em>427 U.S. at 503 n.7, 96 S.Ct. at 2761 n.7. We therefore adopt the <em>Adams </em>test, whether the father\u2019s support \u201cwas commensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time of the father\u2019s death.\u201d 521 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>660. In keeping with the Act\u2019s remedial goals, we also take into account the economic circumstances of the child\u2019s father in determining whether, at death, he was \u201ccontributing to the applicant\u2019s support.\u201d <em>See Boyland v. Califano, </em>633 F.2d 430, 434 (6th Cir. 1980) (applying a test \u201cwhether the contributions that were made to the support of his children were important to them given their needs and the wage earner\u2019s economic circumstances and ability to support\u201d). <em>See also Parker v. Schweiker, </em>673 F.2d 160, 163 (6th Cir. 1982) (\u201cthe \u2018support requirement\u2019 ... must be evaluated in light of the father and child\u2019s actual circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The next issue is whether the ALJ, in reaching his conclusion that Doran was ineligible for benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii), correctly applied the <em>Adams </em>test, and examined whether the father\u2019s support was \u201ccommensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time of the father\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Mace, an insured individual, was the natural father of Kyle Doran is undisputed. Doran has thus fulfilled the first requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Doran must also prove that his father was \u201ccontributing to [Doran\u2019s] support ... at the time [Mace] died.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ostensibly applying the <em>Adams </em>test, the ALJ then ruled that Doran was ineligible because Mace had not fulfilled this statutory requirement. Appellant forcefully contends that, when evaluating the importance of Mace\u2019s contributions of services, the ALJ unrealistically assessed the needs of a three-month-old fetus when he made the finding that Mace provided \u201cno baby clothing, no crib or layette, no baby bottles, diapers or any other tangible items.\u201d We take judicial notice that few parents purchase those items before or during the third month of pregnancy, and conclude that this finding is irrelevant to the issue of the sufficiency of Mace\u2019s support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">The ALJ also found that Mace \u201cfail[ed] to make any significant attempt to meet his obligations as a prospective father.\u201d To reach that decision, he had to discount Mace\u2019s two tangible contributions to Ms. Clark\u2019s support, his help in moving her to the ranch and his repairs to her roof, which had cash value. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-366(a)(1) (1981). The ALJ found that \u201c[t]he roof repair ennured [sic] more to the landlord\u2019s benefit than to the mother and child because of their relatively short use of the premises.\u201d The evidence shows that, as soon as Ms. Clark called, Mace came to fix her cabin in a rainstorm. No evidence was offered to show that the landlord would have repaired the roof. Even if Mace\u2019s repairs incidentally benefited the landlord, protecting a mother and her unborn child from the elements certainly constitutes \u201ccontributing to the support of the applicant\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">Doran also protests that the ALJ erred when he concluded that Mace\u2019s contributions suffered by comparison with the contributions of the father in <em>Adams. </em>In <em>Adams, </em>the father, who was married and affluent, provided the mother with a place to stay for about seven months, gave her a total of $200 or $300 during that time, and, \u201c[m]ost telling[ly],\u201d <em>Adams, </em>521 F.2d at 660, contributed $100 toward the hospital bill. The father was killed when the mother was in her eighth month of pregnancy. Considering the relative affluence of the two fathers, Mace arguably contributed more expansively to the mother\u2019s support than the father in <em>Adams. </em>Mace was impoverished, and made his contributions during the first few months of Ms. Clark\u2019s pregnancy, when she had considerably fewer needs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In sum, the ALJ misperceived the requirements of the <em>Adams </em>common sense test. We hold, as a matter of law, that he misapplied the test in this case. <em>See Conley v. Ribicoff, </em>294 F.2d 190, 194 (9th Cir. 1961) (\u201c[a]n application of the evidentiary facts and their inferences to an erroneous standard ... [is] a fully reviewable question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Reopening the record would serve no purpose. Doran originally filed his claim eight years ago, and appropriate evidence was developed when the district court previously remanded the case in light of the <em>Adams </em>test. Our review of the record convinces us that Mace contributed support according to his own ability and the needs of his three-month-old fetus. When we apply the Adams common sense standard of \u201csupport,\u201d we conclude that Doran is eligible for Social Security Insurance survivor benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Secretary must compute the benefits owing to Doran and enter an appropriate order. <em>See id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-13\">. To establish eligibility for Social Security Insurance survivor benefits, children bom of a legitimate marriage need only show that their deceased parent was fully insured. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(d)(1), 402(d)(3), 416(h)(2)(B). To establish eligibility for the same benefits, illegitimate children must additionally demonstrate their dependency upon their deceased father. They may do so by proving that they are covered by a statutory presumption of dependency, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(d)(3), 416(h)(1)(B), 416(h)(2)(B), 416(h)(3)(C)(i). Alternatively, they may prove dependency under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) which provides, in pertinent part, that the illegitimate child of a deceased wage earner shall be eligible if the \u201cinsured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been the father of the applicant, and such insured individual was living with or <em>contributing to the support of the applicant </em>at the time such insured individual died.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); see Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 497-500, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 2758-2760, 49 L.Ed.2d 651 (1976). Doran contends his father contributed support sufficient to entitle appellant to benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">. The Secretary\u2019s regulation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">Contributions must be made regularly and must be large enough to meet an important part of your ordinary living costs. Ordinary living costs are the costs for your food, shelter, routine medical care, and similar necessities. If the insured person only provides gifts or donations once in a while for special purposes, they will not be considered contributions for your support. Although the insured\u2019s contributions must be made on a regular basis, temporary interruptions caused by circumstances beyond the insured person\u2019s control, such as illness or unemployment, will be disregarded unless during this interruption someone else takes over responsibility for supporting you on a permanent basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aok-dedup-0\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.366(a)(2,)(1981). The ALJ first applied a test similar to, although less restrictive than, the one contained in the Secretary\u2019s regulation: whether the father was contributing support to his unborn child \u201cin any regular or substantial manner at any time during [the] pregnancy.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\">. Curiously, the ALJ made the irrelevant observation that Mace\u2019s suicide \u201cdeprived the child of any opportunity to receive the wage earner\u2019s support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-15\">. Finding that \u201cwage earners burdened with equal poverty have nonetheless managed to do a great deal more,\u201d the ALJ also concluded that Mace\u2019s contributions compared unfavorably with the father\u2019s in Moreno <em>v. Richardson, </em>484 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>F.2d 899 (9th Cir. 1973). In <em>Moreno, </em>the appeals council had found that \u201cMoreno and the child\u2019s mother were not living together and that decedent infrequently gave her small sums of money and on two occasions gave her small gifts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 902-03. We concluded that this finding was supported by substantial evidence, and upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision that the <em>Moreno </em>father was not contributing to his unborn child\u2019s support. <em>Moreno </em>is distinguishable because, unlike the father in <em>Moreno, </em>Mace died during the very early months of the mother\u2019s pregnancy, when an unborn child\u2019s needs are minimal. While the father in <em>Moreno </em>only sporadically contributed to the mother throughout most of her pregnancy, Mace contributed according to his ability and the minimal needs of the fetus during the three months of Ms. Clark\u2019s pregnancy when he was alive. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"asl-dedup-0\">. The Second Circuit in <em>Adams </em>stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of the sections of the Act involved here is to provide support to children who have lost either the actual support of an insured parent <em>or the anticipated support which that parent would have been expected to give had his death not intervened.\u201d </em>521 F.2d at 659 (emphasis added). Appellant relies on the emphasized language to formulate a \u201closs of anticipated support\u201d test for posthumous birth cases. We need not decide whether this is an appropriate test because we hold that Mace\u2019s support was \u201ccommensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time of the father\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
