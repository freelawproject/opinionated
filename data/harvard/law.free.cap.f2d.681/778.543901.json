by T.D. 68 \u2014 9, and assessed with a 10% ad valorem duty. Appellant agreed that the goods were properly classified, but argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>they should have received duty-free treatment under the GSP in accordance with TSUS General Headnote 3(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The pertinent facts were described by the court below as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">Certain items were imported into Taiwan where they were then assembled into the ICs and photodiodes. These items consisted of silicon slices containing a multitude of fabricated electronic chips, lead frame strips, mold compound, gold wire on spools and chip mounting material, either epoxy or gold preforms. The chips were separated by a \u201cscribe and break\u201d operation. Subsequently, each chip was mounted (and by use of epoxy or gold preform made to adhere conductively) to a section of a lead frame strip. Pieces of gold wire were used to provide an electrical connection from various areas on the chip to various areas on each lead frame strip section. Plastic mold compound was then liquified and molded under pressure over each section of lead frame strip containing a bonded and connected chip (or, in one instance, two bonded and connected chips). After the mold compound hardened into a protective covering, the lead frame strips were trimmed and severed into a multitude of individual devices. The devices, at this stage, were finished ICs and photodiodes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Additionally, we note that the principal parts of the cue module, and materials such as gold wire, epoxy, and molding compounds, including those utilized in Taiwan to construct the IC\u2019s and photodiodes, were imported into Taiwan from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">The court below, granting the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, held that the \u201cvalue of the IC\u2019s and photodiodes cannot be included in the figures for the \u2018cost of material\u2019 and \u2018direct costs of processing\u2019 to determine whether these figures are not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the cue modules.\u201d The court opined that the \u201cuse of the term \u2018article\u2019 to refer to imported merchandise, and use of the term \u2018material\u2019 to refer to the value added [sic] requirement for the \u2018eligible article\u2019 in the BDC [beneficiary developing country], clearly demonstrate the Congressional intent to differentiate between \u2018articles\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018materials\u2019 on the other hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Referencing 19 CFR 10.177(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which limits inclusion in the 35 percent of appraised value (not \u201cvalue added\u201d) figure to, among other things, \u201cmaterial\u201d which was either wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the BDC or substantially transformed in the BDC into a new and different article of commerce, the court stated that, \u201cwhile the assembly of fabricated components, rather than materials, may be relevant in determining whether the \u2018eligible article\u2019 was a product of the BDC, assembly of fabricated components is not relevant respecting the 35 percent value added [sic] requirement.\u201d The court concluded that, \u201cthe GSP statute and pertinent regulations preclude the inclusion of fabricated compo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>nents produced outside the BDC and assembled in the BDC in the \u2018cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary developing country\u2019 to determine the 35 percent value added [sic] requirement. Consequently, <em>the value of the IGs and photodiodes cannot be included in the figures for the \u2018cost of materials\u2019 and \u2018direct costs of processing\u2019 </em>to determine whether these figures are not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the cue modules.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The issue, therefore, is whether the IC\u2019s and photodiodes found in the imported cue modules are \u201cmaterials\u201d which may be considered to have been \u201cproduced\u201d in Taiwan. Was there such a \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d of the parts and materials going to make up the IC\u2019s and photodiodes that \u201ca new and different article of commerce\u201d was produced?</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">There are no issues regarding the other requirements of the GSP. Taiwan is listed in General Headnote 3(c)(i) as a beneficiary developing country, the articles described by TSUS item 722.34 are GSP \u201celigible articles,\u201d and the cue modules were imported from Taiwan directly into the customs territory of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Initially, we note the conceptual difficulty which the facts of this case bring to the fore. 19 CFR 10.177(a) instructs that \u201cconstituent materials\u201d of an \u201celigible article\u201d may be considered produced in a BDC, even though imported thereinto, if they are there \u201csubstantially transformed * * * into a new and different article of commerce.\u201d One would likely believe that application of this rule normally arises upon the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d of <em>one </em>item, for example, the production of woven fabric components of shirts from imported raw fiber. In this case, however, we have several imported items \u2014 silicon slices containing unsev-ered IC chips, multiple lead frame strips, gold wire, molding compounds, etc. \u2014 some of which undergo some transformation before or in the course of being assembled by a number of machines to form the IC\u2019s and photodiodes and some of which, such as the gold preforms, are used as imported.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the narrow question before us is whether the making of the finished IC\u2019s and photodiodes can, as a matter of law, be considered under the GSP as the production of a \u201csubstantially transformed constituent material\u201d from a \u201cconstituent material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">The court below never reached the issue of substantial transformation, holding that a mere assembly of fabricated components <em>cannot, </em>within the meaning of the GSP and as a matter of law, create a \u201cmaterial\u201d to be utilized in the production of an \u201carticle.\u201d The court below relied on T.D. 76-100, 10 Cust.Bull. 176, 178, wherein it was stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">[When articles are] produced by the joining and fitting together of components [, they] are not considered substantially transformed constituent materials. Articles of this kind may well have been substantially transformed, but they are not produced from substantially transformed constituent materials. Under this criterion, partially completed components which are completed and assembled in the beneficiary developing country into finished articles or components do not qualify as substantially transformed constituent materials. By the same token, most assembly operations and operations incidental to assembly will not qualify. For example, various electronic components and a bare but otherwise finished circuit board are imported into a beneficiary developing country and there assembled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>soldering into an assembled circuit board for a computer. Although substantially transformed, the fabricated unit is not a substantially transformed constituent material of the computer, the exported eligible article produced in the beneficiary developing country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We find nothing in the GSP statutes or related rules to support this limitation on what may be considered a \u201cmaterial,\u201d nor is it determinative that Congress chose to distinguish an \u201celigible article\u201d from that which comprises it by utilizing the different terms \u201carticle\u201d and \u201cmaterial.\u201d We, therefore, hold that the decision of the court below was in error, and we turn to the substantial transformation issue outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Appellant TI argues that the \u201cdefinition of \u2018produced in\u2019 as including \u2018substantially transformed in\u2019 is entirely consistent with court decisions and administrative rulings and regulations which have been issued in numerous areas of the customs laws where a country of production must be ascertained.\u201d It is asserted that the substantial transformation test is used in determining whether merchandise is eligible for <em>drawback </em>under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313, whether one has complied with the <em>country of origin marking </em>statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, whether an article or component claimed to be of United States origin is eligible for <em>special tariff treatment </em>under TSUS item 800.00 or 807.00, whether an article imported into the Virgin Islands claimed to be a product of the United States is eligible for duty-free treatment under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395, and in determining whether an imported article may be classified as a \u201cmanufacture.\u201d Appellant states that, \u201cIn all of these instances, substantial transformation occurs when, as a result of manufacturing processes, a new and different article emerges, having a distinctive name, character, or use, which is different from that originally possessed by the article or material before being subjected to the manufacturing process.\u201d With respect to these differing areas of customs law involving substantial transformation, appellant cites a number of cases, some of which deal with transformation by assembly and some of which deal with the transformation of one item. <em>Compare, e.g., Adolphe Schwob, Inc. v. United States, </em>62 Treas.Dec. 248, T.D. 45908 (1932), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>21 CCPA 116, T.D. 46447 (1933) (watches assembled in the United States from imported parts held to have been manufactured in the United States) <em>with United States v. International Paint Co., Inc., </em>35 CCPA 87, C.A.D. 376 (1948) (imported paint substantially transformed by making it fit for use as a marine antifouling paint).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Appellant also cites Customs Service Decision 80-227, 14 Cust.Bull. No. 49 at 19-20 (1980), where the issue, in a \u201ccountry of origin marking\u201d case, was \u201cwhether assembly of integrated circuits, including attachment of the die and lead wires, encapsulation and testing, from imported semiconductor chips constitutes a substantial transformation.\u201d Noting that \u201csemiconductor chips and other materials of no functional use in their imported state are to be assembled by a manufacturer in the United States,\u201d it was stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">We are of the opinion that the procedures of attachment of the die and lead wires and encapsulation will result in a substantially transformed product. The use, character, name and value of a finished integrated circuit is substantially different from a semiconductor chip. Testing and marking only, however, are not considered to result in a substantial transformation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">In light of the recognition that \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d is utilized in various aspects of customs law, appellant urges that \u201cthe concept of substantial transformation appears \u2014 not as some creative innovation, but as a familiar rule with a consistent and uniform meaning in customs law.\u201d Applying what it perceives to be the law, appellant concludes that a substantial transformation has occurred, for \u201call the materials imported into Taiwan become irreversibly altered and integrated into a new product, having a distinctive name, character, and use * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>The Government responds that appellant\u2019s construction of the GSP based upon judicial and administrative interpretation of other statutory origin requirements is irrelevant; they \u201cdo not possess bi-fureated [sic] origin requirements for the imported \u2018article\u2019 as a whole, on the one hand, and for the \u2018materials\u2019 that were utilized in the manufacture of the imported \u2018article,\u2019 on the other hand.\u201d The Government also argues that the chips, lead frames, gold wire, and gold preform that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-4\">* * * became components of the imported cue modules in issue, through assembly into the packaged I.C.s and photodiodes which were then assembled into the cue modules in issue, were:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">(a) fabricated components that were products of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">(b) did not lose their physical identity, after final assembly into the cue modules in issue, by form, shape or otherwise; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">(c) were not improved in condition or advanced in value except by assembly and operations incidental to assembly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The Government continues\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">The assembly operations performed in Taiwan merely allow the photodiode portion of the chip to function electronically through connections with other United States fabricated components which allow signals to be received into and emitted from the photodiode chip. There was no further fabrication of the photodiode chip itself in Taiwan. The assembly of the gold wire, lead frame, mold compound, and gold preform (or epoxy) with the chip to form the packaged photodiode does not change the chip, lead frame, or gold wire; it merely allows the potential of the chip to be realized,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABqq\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">* * * the I.C. chips contain all of the electronics of the completed packaged I.C. chip and the packaged I.C. which is assembled into the cue module. These components are the essence of the I.C. chip and the packaged I.C. which is assembled into the cue module. The operations performed in the United States <em>create </em>the components of the I.C. chip known as the transistors, resistors, capacitors, diodes, and (for one type of chip in issue) the MOS structure. These components are not physically changed in any manner, shape, or form subsequent to the exportation of the I.C. chip in slice form from the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">The Government thus concludes that no substantial transformation occurred in Taiwan; \u201cTo paraphrase Gertrude Stein, an I.C. (a photodiode) is an I.C. (or photodiode), is an I.C. (or photodiode), is an I.C. (or photodiode) whether packaged or unpack-aged.\u201d While criticizing appellant for having done the same thing, the Government turns to cases from other areas of customs jurisprudence which discuss substantial transformation, concluding that \u201cthere was no fundamental change that spanned classes of articles. * * * Once one separates the wheat from the chaff of appellant\u2019s factual presentation, it becomes clear that the packaging does not transform anything.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">The question presented to us by the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d issue, not addressed by the court below, is a mixed question of technology and customs law, mostly the latter. In essence, the defendant\u2019s position, adopted by the court below, is that the making of the IC\u2019s and photodiodes was mere assembly of prefabricated components. The following are our principal reasons for disagreeing with the Government\u2019s position, adopted by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">(1) One element allegedly imported into Taiwan was IC \u201cchips.\u201d Chips were not imported. Silicon slices were imported. These were not ready to be assembled into anything in Taiwan and were never assembled into anything. The slices \u2014 carrying many hundreds of IC or photodiode elements, to be sure, but in unfinished or unseparated and \u201cunpackaged\u201d form \u2014 had to be further manufactured before chips ready for <em>assembly </em>came into existence. This involved the steps of careful scribing and production of the chips from the integral slices. The Government arguments attempt to equate chips and finished (i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201cpackaged\u201d) IC\u2019s as though, for practical purposes, they are interchangeable. The record is to the contrary. The affidavit of Jack S. Kilby of June 9, 1980, shows that although the industry has sold both chips and finished IC\u2019s, sales of the former are \u201cminute in comparison with sales of\u201d the latter, that the industry clearly distinguishes the two articles, and that when chips are sold \u201csomeone must perform the packaging process in order to convert the chip into a useable device.\u201d The truth of these statements is supported by the record. A packaged IC must be regarded as a different article of commerce from a mere chip.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">(2) Chips had to be mounted on \u201clead frames\u201d which provide electrical leads to the many electrical elements or areas of the chips, but lead frames ready for mere assembly in the usual sense of the term were not imported into Taiwan. What was imported were punched or die-cut metal strips capable of later manufacture into lead frames, after the chips were mounted thereon and connected to the leads, by operations hereafter described. Thus, individual lead frames, of different types, were produced in Taiwan from the prefabricated strips. Strips for IC lead frames contained 10 potential lead frames; those for photodiodes contained 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">(3) The wiring of the chips to connect their circuitry to their lead frame contacts was done after the chips were secured to platforms provided on the metal strips by epoxy adhesive or gold preforms (predominantly if not wholly the former). The gold wire used for this operation was imported in bulk, on spools. Each connection of a frame lead to a chip contact pad by a piece of wire, attached at each end, was as much a manufacturing operation as hand-wiring any other piece of electrical equipment from a bulk supply of wire, notwithstanding the wiring here was done by robot-type machinery. Wiring was a manufacturing operation involving a large number of steps (at least on the IC\u2019s) and not a mere joining of two or more parts within the usual meaning of the term \u201cassembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">(4) The encapsulation of the wired chips on the lead frame strip was a plastic molding operation done in a multicavity molding machine. No plastic part ready for \u201cassembly\u201d was used. It was not like enclosing a radio in a cabinet. The bulk molding compound, brought into Taiwan in \u201chockey puck\u201d form, was put into the molding machine and melted. As a liquid, it was injected into the mold cavities to surround the chip or chips, taking on an entirely new form. The thermosetting resin became solid in the mold and the whole unit was thereafter heated to effect final cure of the resin.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">(5) The lead strips, flat until after the IC or photodiode mounting, wiring, and molding operations, were further manufactured by subjecting them to \u201ctrim and shear\u201d operations which removed excess borders, severed the strip into individual units, and bent the contacts at right angles to the plane of the original strip, thus producing the \u201cpackaged\u201d IC or photodiode which only then was ready for attachment to the flexible circuit board.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">In light of the aforesaid explanations of what was actually done to the materials imported into Taiwan, we have no doubt there was compliance with the provision of 19 CFR 10.177(a)(2), \u201cmaterial which had been substantially transformed in the beneficiary developing country into a new and different article of commerce.\u201d We therefore respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the court below that the IC\u2019s and the photodiodes, as completed ready for assembly into the imported articles, were components \u201cproduced outside the BDC.\u201d We hold they were, on the contrary, materials produced in the beneficiary developing country and entitled to be included in computing the 35% of the appraised value of the imported cue modules.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The Government also argues, however, that agreement with appellant\u2019s position would frustrate the purpose of the GSP, which is to promote\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">* * * \u201cdiversification,\u201d \u201cdevelopment,\u201d and \u201cindustrialization\u201d of BDC\u2019s, and, on the other hand, to assure that the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>fits of GSP would accrue to BDC\u2019s rather than to developed countries. Clearly, the purpose was to promote manufacturing operations which convert materials into articles, as opposed to a further extension of labor intensive assembly operations which have already been promoted under the \u201c807.00 program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The Government continues, saying that \u201cIt is evident that the GSP program was intended to make developing countries self-sufficient rather than continue the chain of dependency that mere assembly operations may foster.\u201d It is concluded that, \u201cwhile the utilization of the non-BDC cost of fabricated components, in determining whether the 35% value added [sic] requirement * * * was fulfilled, would generally benefit the BDC with possible expension [sic] of trade, it would * * * frustrate the <em>major purpose </em>of our GSP * *</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Given our holding that the IC\u2019s and pho-todiodes were the result of extensive manufacturing operations in Taiwan which converted materials into articles, as distinguished from mere assembly, that there was \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d into new and different articles of commerce, and granting that a statute must be so interpreted as to implement its legislative purpose, we conclude that our decision in the case is harmonious with the legislative purpose. The facts of record indicate that a number of employees were needed, and had to be technically trained in numerous skills to \u201cconvert materials into articles\u201d in the manner we have described above, laying the groundwork for the acquisition of even higher skills and more self-sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Accordingly, the Court of International Trade\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissing the action is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">.

The IC chips arrive in Taiwan in unsevered slice form, which slice must therefore be scribed and broken up, the lead frame strips, containing many connected frames, are eventually separated as parts of individual IC\u2019s and photodiodes, and the gold wire is snipped into pieces as it comes off a spool, etc., but the only items imported into Taiwan for use in the construction of the IC\u2019s and photodiodes which are completely \u201ctransformed\u201d into something new are the molding compounds. The mold compounds, black for the IC\u2019s and transparent for the photodiodes, are utilized to encapsulate the IC chips.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b857-8\">NIES, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHqo\">dissenting-in-part.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">With respect to the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, I would reverse solely on the ground that the court erred in holding that assembly operations may not, as a matter of law, substantially transform fabricated components into a new and different article of commerce. I would, however, affirm the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Further proceedings are necessary to determine whether a constituent material has been produced in Taiwan. I do not agree that this court should hold for appellant as a matter of law. In particular, I do not assume, as a matter of law, that every article which is of a type sold in commerce is itself an article of commerce. Nor do I agree that by characterizing the processing done in Taiwan as \u201cmanufacturing\u201d rather than \u201cassembly\u201d a new and different article is necessarily created. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association v.
