We conclude that the perfected security interest has priority over the claim of the garage-keeper and affirm Judge Tomlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">This is the procedural and factual background. In June 1984 plaintiff Associates Commercial Corporation (Associates) filed a complaint against Johnson &amp; Tower\u2019s, Inc. (J &amp; T) alleging these facts. Defendant Wallia was the owner of a 1980 Ford tractor used to pull trailers. Associates previously had acquired a perfected security interest in this vehicle under Article 9 of the UCC. On November 16, 1983 Wallia brought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tractor to J &amp; T for repairs. By December 14 the repairs had been completed but Wallia failed to pay for them so J &amp; T retained possession of the tractor. Then Wallia defaulted on the monthly payments due Associates for March, April and May of 1984. Under the financing agreement these defaults entitled Associates to immediate payment of the unpaid balance and to possession of the vehicle. Associates demanded possession from J &amp; T which refused to comply. Associates sued for replevin or alternatively for damages of $33,276.96 for conversion. After filing of the answer, the parties agreed that Associates would post a $8,500 bond and obtain possession of the tractor and the parties would settle the priority dispute on cross-motions for summary judgment. <em>R. </em>4:46. On the cross-motions, Judge Tomlin ruled in Associates favor and J &amp; T now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On this appeal J &amp; T raises a number of issues: it claims that (1) the entire garage-keeper\u2019s lien act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 to 31, has previously been held unconstitutional in all respects, (2) even if not unconstitutional in its entirety, the lien-priority provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 should be declared invalid, (3) it is entitled to an artisan\u2019s common-law lien, (4) if so, it claims that an artisan\u2019s common-law lien enjoys priority over a recorded, perfected security interest under the UCC, and (5) that Associates have been unjustly enriched at J &amp; T\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Associates contends that the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 to 31, has previously been held unconstitutional \u201cin its entirety\u201d by both the New Jersey and federal courts. The lien priority issue centers around <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21, which provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">A garage keeper who shall store, maintain, keep or repair a motor vehicle or furnish gasoline, accessories or other supplies therefor, at the request or with the consent of the owner or his representative, shall .have a lien upon the motor vehicle or any part thereof for the sum due for such storing, maintaining, keeping or repairing of such motor vehicle or for furnishing gasoline, accesso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ries or other supplies therefor, and may, without process of law, detain the same at any time it is lawfully in his possession until the sum is paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">The lien shall not be superior to, nor affect a lien, title or interest of a person held by virtue of a prior conditional sale or a prior chattel mortgage properly recorded or a prior security interest perfected in accordance with chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">J &amp; T contends that in <em>Whitmore v. N.J. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492 (Ch.Div.1975), Judge Furman declared the \u201centire\u201d Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act unconstitutional because of what he said in the final sentence of his opinion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaj\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq. </em>is held to be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment in failing to afford to all automobile owners the opportunity to be heard judicially prior to divestment of title [by public sale of the automobile]. [137 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 500,].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Defendant focuses exclusively on Judge Furman\u2019s use of the phrase <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>\u201cet seq.\u201d </em>to support its contention that <em>Whitmore </em>declared the entire Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act <em>(i.e., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 to 31) unconstitutional. We disagree. A close analysis of <em>Whitmore </em>reveals that the lien priority provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 were not encompassed within Judge Furman\u2019s unconstitutionality holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">At the outset of his opinion, Judge Furman specifically said that the constitutionality of the \u201cpublic sale provisions of the Garage Keepers Lien Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 494-495 was \u201cat issue\u201d because the plaintiff-motor vehicle owners attacked the \u201cvalidity of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-29, 30, 31 which provide for a public sale [of a motor vehicle] after 30 days\u2019 retention by the garage keeper.\u201d Further, Judge Furman specifically said the garage keeper\u2019s \u201cpossessory lien until payment for repairs made to a motor vehicle\u201d was \u201cnot challenged in this action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495. Finally, while Judge Furman noted that in <em>Lee v. Cooper </em>(unreported 1974 opinion in the United States District Court for New Jersey) Judge Barlow had \u201cspecifically adjudicated the unconstitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq., </em>both as to its possessory lien and public sale provisions,\u201d Judge Furman held that the Chancery Division of the New Jersey Superior Court was \u201cnot compelled to adhere to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that decision, even on a federal constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Judge Furman then noted that, if the motor vehicle\u2019s owner wanted to avoid the consequences of the public sale provisions of the act <em>(i.e., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-29, 30 and 31), he had to utilize the \u201calternative procedure prior to the expiration of 30 days ... under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-23, 24, 25, 26 and 27\u201d, which procedure in essence required the owner to post \u201cthe entire disputed garage keeper\u2019s bill or a double bond, with court costs, prior to a public sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 499. However, Judge Furman found that the alternative statutory remedy in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-23 to 27 was \u201cblocked to the owners of automobiles who dispute their garage bills in good faith and are without sufficient funds to advance the disputed excess in cash or to pay the premium on a double bond.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. Therefore, Judge Furman ruled that the entire-bill or double-bond posting \u201cprerequisite\u201d in the alternative statutory procedure <em>(i.e., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-23 to 27) was \u201cnot a reasonable incident to ownership of an automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 349 <em>A.2d </em>560. Therefore, as noted above, he concluded his opinion in <em>Whitmore </em>as follows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq. </em>is held to be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment in failing to afford to all automobile owners the opportunity to be heard judicially prior to divestment of title [by public sale]. [137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 500],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In his February 1, 1985 oral decision in the case before us, Judge Tomlin ruled that \u201cthe provisions that were attacked in the <em>Whitmore </em>decision\u201d <em>(i.e., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-23 to 27 and 29 to 31) were \u201csuch that they can be isolated.\u201d Therefore, he found that the \u201corder of priorities\u201d embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 was \u201cpreserved\u201d despite Judge Furman\u2019s statement in <em>Whit-more </em>that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>\u201cet seq.\u201d </em>was unconstitutional. <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">We agree. The lien order-of-priority provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 were not encompassed in Judge Furman\u2019s unconstitutionality decision in <em>Whitmore. </em>This is confirmed by examining <em>In re Bill Ridgway, Inc., </em>4 <em>B.R. </em>351 (Bankr.D.N.J.1980). In <em>Ridgway, </em>Bankruptcy Court Judge Lipkin noted that in <em>Whit-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>more </em>\u201cthe State Court ... held that the N.J. Lien Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq., </em>23 to 27, 29 to 3[1], is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Ridgway, supra, </em>4 <em>B.R. </em>at 352. In this aspect, J &amp; T contends that \u201cfederal courts\u201d have declared the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act unconstitutional in its entirety. This is not wholly accurate. Defendant is correct in contending that, in <em>Ridgway, </em>the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey implicitly held that the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act was \u201ctotally invalid.\u201d But close analysis of <em>Ridgway </em>reveals a flaw in this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In <em>Ridgway, </em>Judge Lipkin first noted Judge Furman\u2019s observation in <em>Whitmore </em>that, in <em>Lee v. Cooper, </em>Judge Barlow had \u201cspecifically adjudicated the unconstitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq., </em>both as to its possessory lien and public sale provisions.\u201d 4 <em>B.R. </em>at 353. And, while Judge Lipkin did not dispute Judge Furman\u2019s holding that a New Jersey state court was not compelled to adhere to a decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Judge Lipkin noted that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey was \u201ca Federal Court in the same district as that in which Judge Barlow presided.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, \u201cunder the doctrine of stare decisis,\u201d Judge Lipkin said that he had to \u201cfollow the decision of the federal judge.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, Judge Lipkin declared the \u201casserted lien\u201d of the subject garage keeper \u201cunder the provisions of New Jersey Statute 2A:44-21\u201d to be \u201cinvalid,\u201d and ruled that this garage keeper had \u201cno lien\u201d\u2014only an \u201cunsecured claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-354.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Of course, as Judge Furman pointed out in <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>in our dual system a New Jersey state court is not compelled to adhere to decisions of lower federal courts on federal constitutional issues. 137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498. <em>Accord, State v. Norflett, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>268, 286 (1975); <em>State v. Coleman, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>16, 36 (1965) , <em>cert. </em>den. 383 <em>U.S. </em>950, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1210, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>212 (1966) . Consequently, neither the District Court\u2019s unreported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>1974 decision in <em>Lee v. Cooper </em>nor the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s 1980 decision in <em>Ridgway </em>is binding on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Moreover, Judge Lipkin in <em>Ridgway </em>may have read Judge Barlow\u2019s opinion in <em>Lee v. Cooper </em>too broadly. As both Judge Furman and Judge Lipkin noted, in <em>Lee v. Cooper, </em>Judge Barlow held <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>unconstitutional as to its \u201cpossessory lien\u201d and \u201cpublic sale\u201d provisions. <em>Whitmore, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498; <em>Ridgway, </em>4 <em>B.R. </em>at 353. However, the \u201cpossessory lien\u201d portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 is wholly contained within the first paragraph of this two-paragraph statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQi\">A garage keeper who shall store, maintain, keep or repair a motor vehicle ... shall have a lien upon the motor vehicle or any part thereof for the sum due for such storing, maintaining, keeping or repairing of such motor vehicle ... <em>and may, without process of law, detain the same at any time it is lawfully in his possession until the sum is paid. </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Thus, in holding unconstitutional the \u201cpossessory\u201d lien portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21, Judge Barlow in <em>Lee v. Cooper </em>apparently only invalidated the garage keeper\u2019s statutory right under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 to, \u201cwithout process of law, detain the ... [motor vehicle] at any time it is lawfully in his possession until the sum [due] is paid.\u201d But this still left constitutionally intact the garage keeper\u2019s <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 non-possessory \u201clien upon the motor vehicle ... for the sum due for ... repairing of such motor vehicle,\u201d which lien is not \u201csuperior to\u201d nor can \u201caffect\u201d any lien, title or interest (1) under a prior conditional sale or chattel mortgage properly recorded, or (2) under a prior security interest perfected pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In short, while Judge Lipkin in <em>Ridgway </em>did implicitly declare the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act unconstitutional and invalid in its entirety, he did so solely based on Judge Barlow\u2019s prior decision in <em>Lee v. Cooper. </em>But Judge Barlow apparently did not invalidate all of the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act. Therefore, <em>Ridgway </em>in the final analysis adds little or nothing to advance J &amp; T\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In conclusion, we agree with Judge Tomlin\u2019s ruling that the lien \u201corder of priorities\u201d embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cpreserved\u201d, despite the prior rulings in <em>Lee v. Cooper </em>and <em>Whitmore </em>declaring unconstitutional other sections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq. </em>and other portions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21, and the ruling in <em>Ridgway </em>implicitly invalidating all of the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that this act has been held unconstitutional in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">J &amp; T next contends that if the \u201cpriority\u201d provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 are still constitutionally valid, the Legislature never intended that a garage keeper\u2019s lien rights should still be subordinated to a prior secured creditor once the sale provisions of the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act were declared unconstitutional. According to J &amp; T, once the sale provisions of the act were declared invalid, a garage keeper had \u201cno efficient or meaningful remedy\u201d by which he could \u201ceither (1) force the owner to pay the bill, or (2) sell the vehicle.\u201d Therefore, J &amp; T asserts that, if the Legislature had foreseen the unconstitutionality of the act\u2019s sale provisions, it would never have intended the act\u2019s priority provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 to \u201ccontinue in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">J &amp; T perhaps overlooks that, subordinated or not, even a non-possessory lien is better than no lien at all. As plaintiff points out, \u201cthe garagekeeper does not lose his lien [under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21] if he loses possession.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-22. Further, while the garage-keeper\u2019s <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 nonpossessory lien may not be very valuable should a prior secured creditor\u2019s lien exist, this would be the case in any event (i.e., even if the sale provisions had not been declared unconstitutional), and in the absence of such a prior secured creditor, the garage-keeper\u2019s lien has priority over later secured creditors and all unsecured creditors\u2014a circumstance not without some value to the garage keeper. We reject defendant\u2019s non-sever-ability contention that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature foreseen the unconstitutionality of the Act\u2019s sale provisions,\u201d it would have viewed the remaining garage-keeper\u2019s lien under <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>2A:44-21 as so \u201cvalueless\u201d to the garage keeper that the Legislature \u201cwould have neither expected nor desired the Act\u2019s priority provisions [in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21] to have remained effective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As a corollary to II, J &amp; T contends that, assuming that the entire Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act is unconstitutional, nonseverable and wholly void, defendant still \u201cmay claim its common law possessory artisan\u2019s lien recognized under New Jersey law.\u201d In response, Associates asserts that even if that the entire Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act is unconstitutional, defendant has \u201cno right to a common law artisan\u2019s lien.\u201d Associates is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Crucible Steel Co. v. Polack Tyre &amp; Rubber Co., </em>92 <em>N.J.L. </em>221 (E. &amp; A. 1918), Justice Kalisch held that the 1915 Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act extends the \u201ccommon law right of lien\u201d to \u201cother conditions in business life than those that existed at common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. Thus, he noted that the 1915 act \u201cgives the garage keeper a lien for the storing and maintaining of motor vehicles\u201d (a means of conveyance \u201cunknown to the common law\u201d) and \u201cfor furnishing gasoline, accessories or other supplies for motor vehicles\u201d (for which \u201cno right of lien could have properly existed at common law\u201d). <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, Justice Kalisch held that the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act \u201cenlarges and extends the right of lien to conditions not included at common law.\u201d <em>Ibid. Accord B.C.S. Corp. v. Frick, </em>19 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>129, 130-131, 18 A.2d 560 (D.Ct.1941) (motor vehicles and garage keepers were \u201cunknown at common law\u201d; therefore, garage keepers are not entitled to a lien \u201cas a common law lienor\u201d for labor and materials furnished in the repair of motor vehicles).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">In <em>Ferrante v. Foley, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>432 (1967), the Supreme Court held that, under the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act, a garage keeper \u201ccan claim only the statutory lien on motor vehicles upon which it worked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. And the Court noted that a garage keeper\u2019s lien under the act \u201cdiffers from the artisan\u2019s [common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>law] lien in many respects.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>One difference was that a garage keeper\u2019s lien under the act \u201capplies only to motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Another difference was that, if the garage keeper worked on a motor vehicle, he \u201chad only a garage keeper\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. Of course, the Court noted that, if the garage keeper worked on personal property \u201cother than motor vehicles, he may still claim his common-law right to an artisan\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. <em>Accord Diesel v. Associates Fin. Serv., </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>53, 54-55 (App.Div.1973) (the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act is \u201cexclusive and in lieu of the common law [artisan\u2019s] lien\u201d with regard to motor vehicles; the \u201conly lien\u201d a garage keeper has for repairing a motor vehicle is \u201cthat afforded by the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21\u201d) and <em>Onondaga Truck Lease Inc. v. Hovell, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 465 (Cty.Ct.1969), aff\u2019d 111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549 (App.Div.1970) (the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act is the \u201csole source of authority\u201d for creating a lien in favor of one providing services for motor vehicles; without this statute such a person is \u201cnot entitled to a lien\u201d). <em>See also Whitmore, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 494, 496 (the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act is an \u201cextension of\u201d and \u201cenlarges on\u201d the artisan\u2019s common law lien), and <em>Ridgway, </em>4 <em>B.R. </em>at 352 (the Garage Keeper\u2019s lien for body work done on the automobile was asserted <em>\u201cnot under common law principles, </em>but rather by force of a state statute [emphasis in original]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Consequently, we see no merit to J &amp; T\u2019s contention that, with regard to its repairs to the subject motor vehicle, it may claim a common-law artisan\u2019s lien because once the Lien Act is invalidated, its common-law artisan\u2019s lien is \u201crevived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Defendant J &amp; T further contends in a slightly different vein that, by expending labor, skill and materials in the improvement of the tractor, it \u201cenhanced\u201d the vehicle\u2019s value and therefore may claim an \u201cartisan\u2019s possessory lien which takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>priority over the interests of a secured creditor under common law principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">While in New Jersey there is \u201cno statute establishing an artisan\u2019s lien,\u201d New Jersey recognizes the \u201ccommon-law possessory artisan\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Ferrante, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>at 436. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-32. To achieve the status of the holder of an artisan\u2019s common-law lien \u201cwith respect to personal property,\u201d the artisan, by his labor and skill, must contribute to the \u201cimprovement\u201d of the property. <em>Ferrante, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>at 436-437. If the artisan does so, he \u201cacquires the right to a specific lien on the property\u201d and \u201cretains this interest in the property until paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Before the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>12A:1-101 <em>et seq.), </em>by judicial construction the holder of an artisan\u2019s lien took priority over a duly-recorded security interest. <em>Id. </em>at 436. <em>See also </em>New Jersey Study Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310 at 474. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310, the holder of a lien arising from work \u201ctakes priority over [the holder of] a perfected security interest unless the lien is statutory and the statute expressly provides otherwise.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">An artisan\u2019s lien is a \u201ccommon-law lien rather than a statutory lien.\u201d <em>Ferrante, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>at 436. But, as noted in III, a garage keeper who performs work on an automobile \u201chas only a garage keeper\u2019s lien\u201d under the Garage Keeper\u2019s Lien Act and \u201ccan claim only the statutory lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437-438. Thus, only if the personal property worked on is \u201cnot a motor vehicle\u201d can a garage keeper claim the status of the holder of an artisan\u2019s lien, and the priority enjoyed by it. <em>Id. </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Since defendant concedes that the subject personal property here is a motor vehicle, it cannot claim an artisan\u2019s lien. Further, the \u201cpriority over a perfected security interest\u201d established in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310 cannot be applied to the garage keeper\u2019s lien under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21, because (1) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 expressly provides that the garage keeper\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>lien \u201cshall not be superior to, nor affect a lien, title or interest of a person held by virtue of ... a prior security interest perfected in accordance with chapter 9 of Title 12A,\u201d and (2) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310 expressly provides that a lien given by \u201cstatute or rule of law\u201d for materials or services furnished with respect to \u201cgoods subject to a security interest\u201d has priority over a perfected security interest unless (a) \u201cthe lien is statutory\u201d and, (b) that statute \u201cexpressly provides otherwise\u201d. An \u201cexpress statutory provision,\u201d such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-21 \u201coverrides the rule of \u00a7 9-310.\u201d New Jersey Study Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:9-310 at 474. Thus even if defendant did enhance the tractor\u2019s value, it may not claim an artisan\u2019s lien at common law and its attendant priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Defendant finally contends that, if plaintiff is allowed to prevail, it will be \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d at defendant\u2019s expense. On November 16, 1983 Wallia delivered the subject tractor to defendant for repairs. By December 14, 1983 defendant had repaired it, for which repairs defendant presented Wallia with a bill for $8,372.09. Wallia failed to pay defendant\u2019s bill and also failed to pay the conditional sale installment payments due plaintiff on March 28, April 28 and May 28, 1984. Pursuant to the July 17, 1984 consent order defendant released the tractor to plaintiff, who sold it on October 7, 1984 for $25,000 which did not cover the amount due plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The doctrine of unjust enrichment rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another. <em>Callano v. Oakwood Park Homes Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 108 (App.Div. 1966). \u201cThe key words are enrich and unjustly [Emphasis in original].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. To recover under this doctrine, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant \u201creceived a benefit, and that retention of the benefit without payment therefor would be unjust.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Defendant contends that, when Wallia delivered the tractor to defendant on November 16, 1983, it was in \u201cnonfunctioning\u201d condition but asserts that by December 14, 1983 it had repaired the tractor \u201cso that it was once more functional.\u201d Furthermore, defendant maintains that, if plaintiff had sold the truck on October 7, 1984 in its pre-repair, nonfunctioning condition, plaintiff would have received \u201csubstantially less\u201d than the $25,000 recovered at that sale. Therefore, defendant contends that, by repairing the tractor between November 16 and December 14, 1983, it did \u201cenhance the value\u201d of the tractor \u201cin the amount of $8,372.09.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">While plaintiff concedes that defendant\u2019s bill for these repairs was $8,372.09 it correctly notes that \u201cno evidence has been presented ... as to how much these repairs enhanced the vehicle in question.\u201d According to plaintiff, it is a fallacy to presume that the \u201cvalue of repairs\u201d to a motor vehicle will be fully \u201crealized\u201d at a wholesale auction sale of that vehicle. For example, plaintiff points out that the repairs may not be \u201cnecessary\u201d or may be \u201cill-considered\u201d and worth \u201csubstantially less\u201d than the repair bill value in the wholesale auction sale marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">It is true that defendant has not proven that its repairs enhanced the sale value of the tractor by the full amount of its $8,372.09 repair bill. However, it is obvious that a functioning tractor will bring more at an auction sale than a nonfunctioning one. Therefore, while of undetermined value, plaintiff \u201creceived a benefit\u201d from defendant\u2019s repairs. <em>Callano, </em>91 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">However, the real question is whether plaintiff\u2019s retention of that benefit without payment therefore \u201cwould be unjust.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A common thread running throughout successful invocation of the doctrine of unjust enrichment is \u201cthat the plaintiff expected remuneration from the defendant, or if the true facts were known to plaintiff, he would have expected remuneration from defendant, at the time the benefit was conferred.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>According to defendant, Wallia\u2019s tractor had broken down in New Jersey and was transported to defendant\u2019s place of business on November 16, 1983 for repairs. And defendant concedes (1) that, on or about November 16, 1983 \u201cWallia requested that the truck be fixed\u201d; (2) that, \u201cpursuant to the request of the truck\u2019s owner, Tegendra Wallia,\u201d defendant completed the repairs by December 14, 1983; (3) that defendant had completed these repairs \u201cwith good faith expectation that Wallia would pay the repair bill as promised\u201d and (4) that \u201cWallia defaulted on the repair bill.\u201d Further, defendant concedes (a) that plaintiff had not ordered the November-December 1983 repairs, and (b) that Wallia did not begin to default on the monthly conditional sale contract installments due plaintiff until March 28, 1984, over three months after defendant had completed and billed Wallia for the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Thus, defendant never expected remuneration from plaintiff for the repairs Wallia authorized on November 16, 1983. Likewise, even if defendant had known of plaintiff\u2019s security interest, \u201cat the time the benefit was conferred\u201d between November 16 and December 14, 1983, defendant still would not have then expected remuneration from plaintiff, because Wallia did not begin to default on the installment payments due plaintiff until March 28, 1984. In conclusion, while plaintiff may have received a benefit from defendant\u2019s repairs to the tractor, we do not see how plaintiff\u2019s retention of such benefit without payment therefor is \u201cinequitable or unjust.\u201d <em>Callano, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">J <em>&amp; </em>T could have anticipated that the vehicle was subject to a financing statement for a substantial sum, made some inquiry, and taken steps to protect its position before proceeding on this repair work. It did not do so. Associates was a bona fide financer and extender of credit which properly relied on the validity of its perfected security interest. We see no reason to apply common-law restitution principles which conflict with the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
