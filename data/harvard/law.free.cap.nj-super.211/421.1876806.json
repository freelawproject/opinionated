Defendant appeals the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In moving for a dismissal of the indictment on the grounds of double jeopardy at trial, defendant contended that the prosecutor intentionally referred to the hearsay in his opening statement even though he knew that he could not get the evidence in during the trial. The trial judge in denying defendant\u2019s motion stated he was satisfied the prosecutor did not intend to cause a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>784, 794, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2062, 23 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>707, 716 (1969). This clause protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against multiple punishments or repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>600, 606, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1075, 1078, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>267, 273 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">When a mistrial has been declared over defendant\u2019s objection, a new trial is permitted under the double jeopardy clause only when the mistrial was required by manifest necessity and the ends of justice would have been defeated by allowing the trial to continue. <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>458, 459, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1066, 1068, 35 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>425, 428 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">However, different principles apply when a mistrial has been declared at the defendant\u2019s request. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 607, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1079, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 273-274. In <em>Dinitz </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the double jeopardy clause protects a defendant against governmental actions that are intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby subject defendant to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. 424 <em>U.S. </em>at 611, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1081, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 276. The Court further held that the double jeopardy clause bars retrials where bad-faith conduct by the judge or prosecutor threatens the harassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declarations of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tion a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In 1982 the United States Supreme Court narrowed the grounds upon which a new trial is barred. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>667, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2083, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>416 (1982). The previous standard, which merely required \u201cbad faith conduct\u201d or \u201charassment\u201d by the judge or prosecutor, was rejected because it offered virtually no standards for its application. <em>Ibid. </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 674, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2088, 72 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 424. The Court decided that \u201conly where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.\u201d 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 676,102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2089, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 425. The Court limited the circumstances under which a defendant may invoke double jeopardy to \u201cthose cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 679,102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2091,72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 427. The Court reasoned that criminal defendants as a class would not necessarily benefit from a broader standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFR\">Knowing that the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial would all but inevitably bring with it an attempt to bar a second trial on grounds of double jeopardy, the judge presiding over the first trial might well be more loath to grant a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial. If a mistrial were in fact warranted under the applicable law, of course, the defendant could in many instances successfully appeal a judgment of conviction on the same grounds that he urged a mistrial, and the Double Jeopardy Clause would present no bar to retrial. But some of the advantages secured to him by the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2014the freedom from extended anxiety, and the necessity to confront the government\u2019s case only once\u2014would be to a large extent lost in the process of trial to verdict, reversal on appeal, and subsequent retrial. [456 <em>U.S. </em>at 676-677, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2089, 72 L.Ed.2d at 425-426; footnotes and citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We are convinced that there is no basis for departing from the holding in <em>Kennedy. </em>We stated our position in <em>State v. Andrial, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.l985) thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">When a defendant successfully moves for a mistrial, he may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him only when the prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into making the motion. <em>[Id. </em>at 8].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Defendant argues that because <em>Andrial </em>has not been cited or adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court its applicability in New Jersey is clouded.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion in <em>Kennedy </em>noted that state courts may conclude that a retrial violates a state constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision even though a retrial does not violate the federal constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision. 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 680-681, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2091, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Art. I, f 11 of the New Jersey Constitution provides: \u201cNo person shall, after acquittal, be tried for the same offense.\u201d The fifth amendment to the federal constitution states: \u201c... nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Although the fifth amendment is facially broader, our state clause has been held coextensive with the federal clause in application. <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>395, 404 (1976). New Jersey courts have consistently applied double jeopardy principles which accord with the federal constitution because its language is broader than our state constitution\u2019s clause. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370 (1980). New Jersey\u2019s double jeopardy provision being facially narrower than the clause contained in the United States Constitution, <em>State v. Jones, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 205-206 (App.Div.1983), we conclude there is no basis for this court to give New Jersey\u2019s provision broader application.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Defendant cites <em>State v. Phelps, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 520 (1984) as evidence that New Jersey has not adopted the <em>Kennedy </em>standard. His reliance is misplaced. In <em>Phelps </em>the Court decided there was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy and of defendant\u2019s participation in that conspiracy, independent of the coconspirator\u2019s declarations, as to admit into evidence the typed statements of coconspirators. 96 <em>N.J. </em>at 520. In passing, the Court stated that if a mistrial is granted because of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, double jeopardy may prevent a retrial of defendant. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court then cited <em>Rechtschaffer </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>proposition that defendant should not be subjected to the harassment of a second trial when the prosecutorial misbehavior or manipulation causes the mistrial. 96 <em>N.J. </em>at 520. Since the Court in <em>Phelps </em>held that admitting the statements was not error, it did not focus on what new trial standard to apply. It is not appropriate to rely on <em>Phelps </em>for the proposition that this state does not follow the double jeopardy standard set forth in <em>Kennedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Defendant contends that even if the <em>Kennedy </em>standard governed this case the prosecutor\u2019s conduct intentionally goaded defendant into moving for a mistrial and that a retrial was barred on the grounds of double jeopardy. He points out that just prior to trial, the court heard oral argument concerning defendant\u2019s motion to have the identity of the informer disclosed, and that during argument, it was stated that if the State proceeded erroneously on a conspiracy charge and the court later perceived that it was improperly drawn, the State\u2019s case could be dismissed based on the <em>Phelps </em>holding. Defendant contended that since the court discussed the law during oral argument on defendant\u2019s motion to reveal the informant\u2019s identity, the prosecutor knew that the informant\u2019s hearsay was not admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">A police officer may explain the reason he approached a suspect or went to the scene of a crime by stating that he did so \u201cupon information received.\u201d <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 268 (1973). This testimony is admissible to show that the officer was not acting in an arbitrary manner. <em>Ibid. </em>However, when the officer becomes more specific by repeating what some other person told him concerning a crime by the accused, the testimony violates the hearsay rule. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that his office received information concerning gambling activity was deemed improper and the judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the <em>Bankston </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">He also decided, pursuant to the <em>Kennedy </em>standard, that only where the prosecutor intends to goad defendant into moving for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>a mistrial may defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first one on his own motion. In denying defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">... lam satisfied that the Prosecutor did not intend to cause a mistrial, that I believe him when he says that it was his view that the reference to receiving gambling information was admissible, although I do not find it easy to believe that. It is possible that he may have been mistaken with respect to his understanding, with respect to reaching a proper understanding of the test as set forth in <em>Bangston [sic </em>]. Therefore, I\u2019m satisfied that double jeopardy does not bar a second, a \u201cSecond\u201d trial of this defendant, of these charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor did not intentionally goad defendant into moving for a mistrial is supported by the record. While the prosecutor was aware of the <em>Bankston </em>decision he interpreted it differently than the court. The court\u2019s discussion of <em>Phelps </em>in oral argument prior to trial would not have assisted the prosecutor in his interpretation of <em>Bankston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Further, we find no evidence that the prosecutor had an incentive to abort the trial. We uphold the denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
