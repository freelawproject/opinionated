Friedman, in the amount of $875,000 and his wife, Ruth Friedman, in the amount of $10,000 on her <em>per quod </em>claim. The sole viable issue on the appeal is the alleged excessiveness of the $875,000 verdict, because other initially raised issues have become moot as a result of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lang v. Baker, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>147 (1985), and the unappealed determination by the trial judge that defendant Columbia Motor Corporation (Columbia) must indemnify the other defendants for their liability to plaintiffs. The February 20, 1985 Order for Judgment and Other Relief included a denial of Columbia\u2019s motion for a new trial as to damages or <em>remittitur </em>pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:49-1. Although not addressed in the original briefs filed in the appeal, possible plain error clearly capable of producing an unjust result was noticed by us at oral argument, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and supplemental briefs have been filed and oral arguments heard on an issue that we have determined to require a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Kenneth J. Friedman was born on July 28, 1943, and was 39 years old when he was injured on July 29, 1981, in an automobile accident. A defectively designed master brake cylinder, installed on his 1966 MGB Roadster by defendant C &amp; S Car Service, failed and caused him to crash into another car and suffer a comminuted fracture of his left wrist. C <em>&amp; </em>S had obtained the master brake cylinder from defendant Rallye Imported Auto Parts, Inc., which had purchased it from defendant Columbia. It is not disputed that Columbia is ultimately liable for all present damages, interest and costs which total less than the $2 million coverage provided by its liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Kenneth J. Friedman has a Ph.D. in biological sciences and prior to the accident was an Assistant Professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of the State of New Jersey (UMDNJ). Although he can no longer perform \u201chighly sophisticated microsurgical research experiments,\u201d he has been promoted since the accident to Associate Professor and there was no claim for past, present or future lost wages or any other economic loss. There was no claim for any medical expenses either, and presumably there was full coverage under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1. <em>et seq. </em>The request for money damages was, accordingly, for pain, suffering, disability and impairment and in his brief plaintiff has summarized the proven elements and suggested justifiable values as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">1. Initial injury, cast and four days hospitalization $ 30,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">2. Three months cast, nine months physical therapy, disability 40.000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">3. Darrach procedure, three days hospitalization, therapy 30.000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">4. Future surgical decompression of median nerve to correct carpal tunnel syndrome, surgery to fuse dominant wrist 40.000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>5. Years of study and work perfecting microsurgical techniques 90,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">6. 26 year work life estimate from date of accident (age 39) to age 65 @ $15,000 for deprivation of professional skill (microsurgery ability) 390,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">7. Pain, suffering, disability and impairment @ $40 per day for approximately 11,800 days <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 472,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">Total $1,092,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Although plaintiff notes that the per diem figures could be \u201cmoved up or down somewhat\u201d the total<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is asserted to underscore the reasonableness of the $875,000 verdict for Dr. Friedman. We disagree because we believe that items six and seven are overstated in failing to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the present value of future losses. Since the jury was advised of the Table of Life Expectancy contained in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice, they should also have been advised of the present value of $1.00 per annum contained in the same appendix. As to item seven, the present value of $1.00 per annum for the life of a 41 year old male, using the 577 % interest table in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice is 13.6281. Applying that factor to the $14,600 yearly figure ($40 x 365) for future noneconomic loss results in a total of $198,-970.26 or $273,029.74 less than the $472,000 projected by plaintiff. Although the table cannot be used directly in calculating the item six loss, the present value of the $15,000 per year for the future work life estimate, again using a 577% interest rate as used in the table in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>$204,937.50.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is $185,062.50 less than the $390,000 projected by plaintiff. The total of the required reductions from plaintiffs figures is $458,092.24.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to reflect the time value of money in calculating the present value<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of future losses. Plaintiffs $1,092,000 total becomes $633,907.76 which, on this basis, disproves the reasonableness of the $875,000 jury verdict for Dr. Friedman. Item four also involves future losses that in our view require jury instructions as to present value in the event they utilize the time-unit basis of calculating unliquidated damages, as plaintiff suggested in this case pursuant to <em>R. </em>l:7-l.(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">PLAINTIFF'S SUMMATION INCLUDING TIME-UNIT ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">During the charge conference, immediately before summations, plaintiff\u2019s counsel advised the judge he would be making a \u201ctime unit summation\u201d as permitted by <em>R. </em>1:7\u20141(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">(b) Closing Statement____ In civil cases any party may suggest to the trier of fact, with respect to any element of damages, that unliquidated damages be calculated on a time-unit basis without reference to a specific sum. In the event such comments are made to a jury, the judge shall instruct the jury that they are argumentative only and do not constitute evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Defendants\u2019 summations made no reference to an anticipated time-unit summation by plaintiff. As to damages, counsel for plaintiff summed up in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">These are the special damages. Now, we get into the general damages. We\u2019re all familiar with a working wage, usually for an eight hour day. You\u2019re going to have to figure out what the wages of pain are. Unlike your working wage, the hours of pain you\u2019re in and the problems it causes isn\u2019t limited, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>doesn\u2019t work on an eight hour day. We\u2019re talking about a twenty-four hour wage of pain and limitation of motion. You\u2019ll have to ask yourself what\u2019s one day of a filing, what\u2019s a fair compensation, just what is a good night\u2019s sleep worth? What\u2019s a fair amount to compensate for a good night\u2019s sleep and know that you\u2019ve never had it for three and a half years, you\u2019re never going to have it again, because your problems are even worse. What\u2019s it worth not to do your microsurgery, not to be able to lift anything heavy, not to be able to do for your spouse you [sic ] like you used to do, to have a constant gnawing, to have somethings <em>[sic </em>] drop through your fingers, and to have it so that the pain is so intense four times a day that you have to stop everything that you were doing and just sort of hold on and wait for it to go away. Think of what one twenty-four hour period of all that is worth, and when you think well, what number should I use here, I suggest to you that you choose your largest figure because you\u2019re better off erring on the side of full compensation than to come to a smaller figure and have Dr. Friedman go not fully compensated for his injuries. You figure out what one day is worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Now, multiply that times 365 and you get some approximation of what a year\u2019s worth of this suffering is, a fair amount of compensation for that one year. You come to this figure and whatever it is comes to that figure and you multiply that question mark figure times three and a half which is approximately how long Dr. Friedman has suffered with this problem. And then add that figure in over here and then take the figure again and multiply that times thirty and you have your figure over here. When you get through adding up all of these, particularly when you gel through adding up one day times 365, basically times three and a half, you\u2019re going to come to a figure that\u2019s probably alot [s\u00bfc ] larger than you thought this case was worth and you\u2019re going to say to yourself, Oh, I can\u2019t award that much money, it\u2019s just too much money. But if you cut it in half, you\u2019re going to do half justice, because long after we\u2019re gone from here and you\u2019ve forgotten Dr. Friedman's name, I\u2019ve forgotten Dr. Friedman\u2019s name and nobody even thinks about Dr. Friedman, twenty years from now he\u2019s still going to be up at night suffering with his wrist joint. And if you lower that amount, you\u2019re going to be depriving him of all the future pain and suffering that he\u2019s going to endure and he\u2019s not going to be able to come back to court to seek compensation for that pain and suffering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">Now, I think basically we\u2019ve got a pretty good system of justice and you\u2019re in charge of justice, you\u2019re it. That\u2019s nothing I can do or the Judge can do, you\u2019re the ones that decide. And you have more power now, I don\u2019t know any of you, you have more power now than you\u2019ll ever have in your life. You\u2019re the only ones that can remedy this situation. The Judge can\u2019t decide it, I can\u2019t decide it, only yourselves. And when you decide what\u2019s the right thing to do, what\u2019s the right amount of damages to award, I suggest to you that Dr. Friedman\u2019s injuries are substantial and in fact monumental. And that your award should be commensurate with his damages, that your award should be a substantial and monumental award to compensate him for all of his injuries up to the present and into the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">THE CHARGE ON DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqf\">No economists had testified and, as far as the record reveals, there was no request to charge as to present value of future losses (from the tables in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice), and no request to charge as to inflation. In relevant part, the judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">All right. Now, getting to the claim of damages, there are rules that I have to give you, as far as that\u2019s concerned also. Now, first, let me say that you\u2019ve heard Mr. Berkowitz in his summation, and as he\u2019s entitled to do, he presented to you his arguments on a blackboard, what passes for a blackboard in our Courtroom. He used what the Court refers to, as a time-unit basis for his argument. As I say, I\u2019m not in any way saying he should or can\u2019t, he\u2019s entitled to do what he did. In fact, that he used such an argument, I\u2019m required to give you the following charge. That is, that presentation was argumentative only, and does not constitute evidence. Obviously, the blackboard was not put in evidence, and Mr. Berkowitz knew it couldn\u2019t be, and it doesn\u2019t go into the Jury Room with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">All right. Now, let me give you the rules of damages, which are applicable to this case. If you find, that the plaintiffs are entitled to a verdict, when I say plaintiffs, because if you find that Dr. Friedman is entitled to a verdict, then under our law, his wife is also entitled to be considered by you with respect to damages under the appropriate charge, as I\u2019ve given it to you would be entitled to an award of damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Taking first Dr. Friedman. There are several items of damage for which he may be compensated, if he\u2019s entitled to a verdict to be awarded in one lump sum. What I\u2019m giving you are a number of factors to think about, but when you come back, you\u2019re going to find on this sheet, you have just one line, just come up with one sum, whatever it is for Dr. Kenneth Friedman. He would be entitled to a fair and reasonable compensation for any temporary or permanent injury resulting in disability to or impairment of his facilities, his health, his ability to participate in activities proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Disability or impairment means the worsening, weakening, or loss of facilities, health or ability to participate in activities. He would be entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for his pain, suffering, discomfort and distress, past, present and future sustained through the defendant\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">Now, the measure of damages for disability or impairment of pain and suffering, for discomfort and distress is what a reasonable man or woman would consider to be adequate and just in all the circumstances of the case to compensate the plaintiff for his disability, impairment, pain and suffering, discomfort and distress, past, present and future, no more and no less. You notice in there I say what a reasonable man or woman would consider to be adequate and just, that\u2019s you. You make the decision. We have computers for everything, but for this particular job. The only computer is your collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>mind. All this information is put into your minds, and you come out with the figure. You are the reasonable man and woman. I can\u2019t provide you with any formula by which a plaintiff alleged pain and suffering and disability may be measured in terms of money. The laws provided no better yardstick for your guidance, than your own enlightened conscience. The problem is one, that involved the exercise of sound judgement as to what is fair and just and reasonable under all the circumstances. In this undertaking, you should have regard for the testimony of the plaintiff, bearing on the subject of his discomfort. You should measure that testimony against the background of your own common experience in light of your own appreciation of the inherent probabilities, as your own frank appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s demeanor and general credibility as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">You should scrutinize all the other evidence presented by all the parties on this subject, including, of course, the testimony of the doctors who appeared. Having given weight and consideration to each of the factors, the extent that you feel such weight or consideration is merited, you\u2019ll arrive at a judgement that fits the sum of money, that plaintiff shall receive and compensation for his disability, impairment of facilities, pain, suffering, in discomfort and distress, past, present and future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">Now, there\u2019s no evidence before you, and plaintiff is not seeking any medical bills, any hospital bills, any bills of that type. That\u2019s all taken care of from another source. You don\u2019t have to consider it or concern yourselves with it, it\u2019s not before you. What I\u2019ve just given you is what you should consider, pain and suffering, permanent, temporary, disability, pain, suffering from the time it happened down to, if you find under the facts presented to you, for the rest of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">Now, that\u2019s been read to you, as the plaintiff is entitled to, the life expectancy of Dr. Friedman. His life expectancy is 30.61 years, based upon the fact, that he was born on July 28, 1943. Now, if any of you happen to be bom about that period of time, this is no guarantee. We don\u2019t guarantee that our box tells you, you\u2019re going to live 30.61 years, that\u2019s a statistical figure, hopefully you\u2019ll life [sic] longer. We know that unfortunately some people don\u2019t make it, they die by reason of accident or from ill health of some type. The government gives us this figure, 30.61 years based upon thousands of people, that are born on that day. By reason of the fact, that this figure is given to you, I give you the following charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">That the figure of 30.61 years is an estimated figure on the probable length of life based on statistical data. It\u2019s contained in an actuarial table attached to the rules of Court. Since it\u2019s a general rule, you should use it with caution in individual cases. The plaintiff may live longer than the actuarial table, or he may die or be killed in a much shorter period of time. You should consider the life expectancy figure in your determination of damages, if any, to be awarded for future pain and suffering, disability and impairment. You should exercise your sound judgement in applying the life expectancy figure without treating it as a necessary and fixed rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAIN AND SUFFERING</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Prior to the September 13, 1982 effective date of <em>R. </em>1:7-1.(b), New Jersey held it was improper for counsel to argue to a jury that it use a so-called per diem formula for the calculation of damages for pain and suffering. <em>Cox v. Valley Fair Corp., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>381, 384 (1980); <em>Botta v. Brunner, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>82 (1958). Our Supreme Court has not yet addressed the question of whether a jury can or must be instructed to consider the present value of future pain, suffering, disability and impairment. Cases in other jurisdictions are divided on the issue. Illustrative opinions favoring the proposition, in recognition of the time value of money, include <em>Metz v. United Technologies Corp., </em>754 <em>F.</em>2d 63 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Gretchen v. United States, </em>618 F.2d 177 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Chiarello v. Domenico Bus Service, Inc., </em>542 <em>F.</em>2d 883 (2d Cir.1976); <em>Abbott v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>197 <em>Neb. </em>11, 246 <em>N.W.</em>2d 647 (Sup.Ct.1976); <em>Wileman v. Wade, </em>665 <em>S.W.</em>2d 519 (Tex.App.5 Dist.1983); <em>Texas and Pacific Railway Company v. Buckles, </em>232 <em>F.</em>2d 257 (5th Cir.1956), <em>cert. </em>den. 351 <em>U.S. </em>984, 76 <em>S.Ct. </em>1052, 100 <em>L.Ed. </em>1498 (1956). Contrary views appear in <em>McKenna v. New York, </em>112 <em>A.D.</em>2d 996, 492 <em>N.Y.S.</em>2d 805 (A.D.2 Dept.1985); <em>Ball v. Burlington Northern R.Co., </em>672 <em>S.W.</em>2d 358 (Mo.App.1984); <em>Flanigan v. Burlington Northern Inc., </em>632 <em>F.</em>2d 880 (8th Cir.1980), <em>cert. </em>den. 450 <em>U.S. </em>921,101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1370, 67 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 349 (1981); <em>Barlage v. The Place, Inc., </em>277 <em>N.W.</em>2d 193 (Minn.Sup.Ct.1979); <em>Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Handley, </em>341 <em>S.W.</em>2d 203 (Tex.Civ.App.1960). <em>See also </em>Annotations in 3 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 940 (1981), 60 <em>A.L.R.</em>2d 1331 (1958), and 28 <em>A.L.R. </em>1177 (1924). In addition, <em>see </em>22 <em>Am.Jur. </em>2d, <em>Damages, </em>\u00a7 108 at 157; Dobbs, <em>Handbook on the Law of Remedies, </em>\u00a7 8.7 at 574 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In our view, a jury should always be instructed on the general principles applicable to the present value of future losses when a time-unit basis argument is made as to calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>tion of unliquidated damages. This will best assure attainment of the twin objectives of fair and reasonable compensation for plaintiffs and non-excessive verdicts against defendants. It will accord with the principle applicable in wrongful death actions that future pecuniary losses should be discounted to present value. <em>Tenore v. Nu Car Carriers, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>466, 474 (1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It will further reflect the public interest involved since, as in this and most cases, the true costs of plaintiffs\u2019 recoveries are borne by the public in the form of insurance and product costs. It may also reduce the presently perceived need to limit noneconomic loss recoveries by statutory ceilings. Bills are presently pending before Congress<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the New Jersey Legislature <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that would, among other things, impose such \u201ccaps.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Plaintiff contends, however, that even if a present value charge would have been appropriate, there was no reversible error because defendant did not request such a jury instruction. We disagree. First of all, we will notice plain error capable of producing an unjust result \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d even if not raised below. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. <em>See also R. </em>1:7-2 and <em>R. </em>1:7-5. Secondly, since the charge properly included reference to plaintiff\u2019s life expectancy as contained in the Table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of Life Expectancy in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice, it should also have included the applicable portion of the Table of Present Value of $1 Annuity contained in the same appendix. Those tables also include widow\u2019s and widower\u2019s percentages of sale that must be used to value dower and curtesy interests pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:63-3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold that the present value of $1 annuity tables must be charged to a jury when a time-unit closing statement is made as to future losses for unliquidated damages pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:7-1. (b). The crucial importance is evident in a case such as this where no economists or other financial experts testified as to calculation of future losses. Although pain and suffering awards are \u201chighly impressionistic\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and will not be upset except in clear cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the circumstances of this case indicate a strong likelihood that the jury was misled in reaching the $875,000 verdict. Long before the New Jersey Supreme Court held in <em>Lang v. Baker, supra, </em>that an <em>R. </em>4:5-2 statement of damages claimed does not place a ceiling on recoveries, plaintiff filed a $150,000 statement and later amended it to $250,000. In a December 1984 certification, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said he demanded $250,000 at a July 1984 settlement conference and the judge said that \u201cfor settlement purposes\u201d the case \u201chad to be worth $150,000 to $175,000.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Counsel further noted that just prior to trial he \u201coffered to cap damages at $500,000 in exchange for defendants stipulating liability.\u201d Columbia\u2019s counsel claimed at the motion for a new trial or <em>remittitur </em>that the demand immediately before trial was $175,000 and the judge apparently agreed. The judge noted, and we agree, that pretrial demands are \u201cof no particular point\u201d in determining whether a verdict is excessive. The judge also concluded that the $875,000 verdict was high, but \u201cnot so shocking in view of ... the fact that [Dr. Friedman] spent many, many years acquiring a high degree of professional skill which he says was taken ... away from him____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Seasonable minds can obviously disagree as to whether the verdict in a case such as this is excessive, and but for the already noted deficiencies in the damages charge we would hesitate to reverse the denial of a new trial or <em>remittitur. </em>We are fully satisfied, however, that under the circumstances of this case the omissions were clearly capable of producing an unjust result in that (1) in all likelihood the jury utilized the time-unit method of calculating the damages and (2) in all likelihood they did not consider present value principles in ascertaining the value of future losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">With respect to the failure of Columbia to request a present value charge, <em>Housen v. Olesky, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95 (App.Div. 1961), is instructive. There plaintiff orally requested, in front of the jury, a supplemental charge as to the Tables of Life Expectancy and Present Value and the court said \u201cI so charge.\u201d While disapproving of this procedure, we found no harmful error to defendant since the statement was probably ineffective and, in any event, defendant had made no such request. Judge Conford stated, however, that as to plaintiff\u2019s requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">These concerned the tables of life expectancy and of the <em>present value of future income, </em>not mentioned in the charge. These matters, especially the latter, were <em>important, if not essential </em>to a complete and proper <em>charge; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>counsel might well have expected these subjects to be treated in the charge without advance request. <em>[Id. </em>at 98; emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"> In our case, we conclude that a present value charge was not only important, but was crucial to a complete and proper charge on damages. A proper jury charge is essential for a fair trial and should cover all essential matters. <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>198, 210 (1984). The required instruction here involved was of the type that a judge must give even without a request from counsel. <em>Wild v. Roman, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 413 (App.Div.1966). <em>Cf Polulich v. J.G. Schmidt Tool Die &amp; Stamping Co., </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135 (App.Div.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY</p>\n<p id=\"A_sr\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, plaintiff contends that there was no plain error in the charge because there was no \u201cinflation\u201d instruction which, with the absence of \u201cpresent value\u201d instructions results, in effect, in application of an acceptable \u201ctotal offset\u201d method of calculation of future pain and suffering damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In <em>Pfeifer, supra </em>n. 11, Justice Stevens, for a unanimous United States Supreme Court held that application of a state\u2019s \u201ctotal offset\u201d theory as a mandatory rule in the federal courts was error. While acknowledging its virtue of simplicity, he concluded that a \u201creal interest rate\u201d of between <em>1% </em>and 3% would be acceptable if a trial court explained its choice. Real interest is the excess of nominal interest over inflation and reflects the time value of money. It also reflects, of course, the risk and other market factors inherent in various types of investments, with the lowest \u201creal\u201d rate of return being earned by \u201crisk-free\u201d securities. See also, the comprehensive analysis in <em>Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>382 <em>F.Supp. </em>1271 (D.Conn.1974), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 524 <em>F.</em>2d 384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>(2d Cir.1975), and note the statement, on the appeal, by Judge Friendly (concurring dubitante):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">The question here, how far awards of damages for disabling personal injury or for death shall attempt to make allowance for future inflation, is of great concern to the states since awards like that made here [$444,056] will further escalate the heavily mounting burden of liability insurance costs. [524 <em>F. </em>2d at 390]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We, too, reject the \u201ctotal offset\u201d theory in the light of both historical and current real rates of return on investments. The arithmetic mean total annual returns from 1926 through 1985 were 12% for common stocks, 5.1% for long term corporate bonds, 4.4% for long-term government bonds and 3.5% for U.S. Treasury Bills, while inflation was 3.2%.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The geometric means (rate of return per annum compounded annually) were lower in all cases, as was inflation. <em>Ibbotson, </em>pp. 22-25. Treasury Bill returns are considered to be the only risk-free security and since mid-1980 the returns on Treasury Bills have substantially exceeded the inflation rate, so that the real risk-less rate was 5.2% over 1981-1985. <em>Ibbotson, </em>p. 64. During this same current five year period long-term government bonds annual returns averaged 16.8% while inflation averaged only 4.9%. <em>Ibbotson, </em>pp. 60 and 120. One estimate of expected trends of inflation (measured by the percent change, year to year for the consumer price index) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">1986 3.5%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">1987 4.1%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>1988 3.7%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARa\">1989 3.3%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG2s\">1990 2.8%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATD\">1991 2.1% <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">It is, of course, impossible to know with certainty what future inflation and investment returns will be. The evidence is clear, however, that there is a time value of money reflecting a \u201creal return,\u201d so that the \u201ctotal offset\u201d theory is economically debatable and certainly should not be adopted in New Jersey as a rule of law. In the absence of any expert testimony to assist a jury, and where a time-unit argument has been made utilizing the life expectancy table, the instructions to the jury should include both an inflation charge and a present value charge with the applicable present value of $1 figure contained in Appendix I to the Rules of Court. The significance of the application of the present value of an annuity multiplier to future periodic losses has been demonstrated above when applied to amounts suggested in plaintiffs brief. Lesser, but significant, figures indicating the excessiveness of the $875,000 verdict may be seen from the following schedule\u2014using simple assumptions for purposes only of illustration. Counsel\u2019s summation suggested a \u201csubstantial and monumental award\u201d consisting of a number of items he termed \u201cspecial damages\u201d plus \u201cgeneral damages\u201d computed on a time-unit basis. He urged a daily figure to be multiplied by 365 for a year and then to be further multiplied by 30 years. Assuming that the jury found \u201cspecial damages\u201d of $155,000, the remaining $720,000 of the $875,000 lump sum verdict would have been calculated as 30 years times $24,000. Discounting at illustrative interest rates<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> produces the following results for a 30 year period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Compound Interest % Present Value of $1 Annuity Present Value Of $24,000/Year For 30 Years \u201cSpecial Damages\u201d Present Value of $875,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akx\">&gt;/&gt; 27.79 $666,960 $155,000 $821,960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtF\">1 25.81 619.440 155.000 774.440</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">l'/a 24.02 576,480 155.000 731,480</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aihl\">2 22.40 537,600 155.000 692,600</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ-\">2'/a 20.93 502,320 155.000 657,320</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM7W\">3 19.60 470,400 155.000 625,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax1\"><em>3'k </em>18.39 441,360 155.000 596,360</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap9\">4 17.29 414.960 155.000 569.960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3f5\"><em>i'k </em>16.29 390.960 155.000 545.960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXD\">5 15.37 368,880 155.000 523,880</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai2\">5\u2018/a 14.53 348,720 155.000 503,720</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGh\">6 13.76 330,240 155.000 485,240</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">12<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 8.06 193.440 155.000 348.440</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-62\">The bottom line is that there are significant differences, using the tables in Appendix I to the Rules of Court or standard annuity tables, in the present value of future pain and suffering (as in the case of future wage loss) due to the time value of money. Other related considerations suggesting rejection of the \u201ctotal offset\u201d theory are next noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-63\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b705-64\">INCOME TAXES, PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND COUNSEL FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b705-65\">So far as the record in this case reveals, there was no request made and no charge given that an award of damages would be free of federal and New Jersey income taxes under 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 104(a)(2) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-6 b. We have recently held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>such a charge must be given upon request. <em>Bussell v. DeWalt Products Corp., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 293 (App.Div.1985), certif. granted 102 <em>N.J. </em>398 (1986). With the magnitude of the damages sought in a case such as this, the significance of the tax-free nature of a recovery is obvious. On retrial,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the judge should so instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">As we also noted in <em>Bussell, supra, </em>the effect of asking a jury to separately calculate damages to the date of trial and then for the future may result in overstating the latter portion of a lump-sum award when prejudgment interest is added to the lump-sum from \u201cthe date of the institution of the action or from a date six months after the date the cause of action arises, whichever is later\u201d as provided in <em>R. </em>4:42-11.(b). 204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294-295. The February 20, 1985 order in this ease allowed a total of $234,850 prejudgment interest on the $875,000 verdict and continues to accrue at 12% unless suspended by the trial court in accordance with the rule. It is therefore recommended that the suggestion in <em>Jones &amp; Loughlin v. Pfeiffer, supra </em>n.,11 (at n. 22 of the opinion), be followed and the entire stream of pain and suffering be discounted back to the date of injury before prejudgment interest is added thereto. Alternatively, the jury might be requested to separately report the components of a lump-sum verdict to permit proper application of the prejudgment interest rule. <em>Nylander v. Rogers, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>236, 239-240 (1963). <em>See also Gretchen v. United States, supra, </em>618 F.2d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Finally, although not urged by plaintiff in this case, we take note of the suggestion by Judge Blumenfeld in <em>Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>382 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1292, n. 26, that in some cases refusal to discount future losses to present value may reflect a belief that there is no real overcompensation because of the counsel fees that a plaintiff must bear. Such reasoning would be improper because of the obvious discrimination against plaintiffs suffering only past losses. In any event, the prejudgment interest of 12% in the present case, which is itself not subject to contingent counsel fees, would more than offset the maximum fees permissible under the <em>R. </em>l:21-7(c) scale applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial on damages only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-14\">The jury had been advised that Dr. Friedman\u2019s life expectancy at the date of trial was 30.16 years. In summation, plaintiff\u2019s counsel referred to the correct figure of 30.61 contained in Appendix I to the Rules of Practice, and then used the rounded figure of 30 in his <em>R. </em>1:7\u20141(b) closing statement \u201ctime-unit\u201d argument.
