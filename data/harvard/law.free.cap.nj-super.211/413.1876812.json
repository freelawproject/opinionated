Defendant also argues that the verdict was against the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>evidence and that the court erred in permitting plaintiffs expert witness to testify from his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Following trial, the jury found plaintiff and defendant each 50% negligent and assessed plaintiffs damages at $80,000. Judgment was entered for plaintiff in the amount of $40,000, plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In early May 1982 plaintiff, an employee of defendant, was approached by another employee, Bobby Zullo, the captain of the Dynasty softball team, who suggested that he try out for the team. Zullo had also solicited new members for the team by placing an ad in the Daily Reporter, a company newspaper published by defendant. The Dynasty team was one of 12 intramural teams in a softball league composed of and run by defendant\u2019s employees. The team members chose team captains who in turn selected a league coordinator. The coordinator scheduled the teams for use of the two fields which were owned by defendant and located adjacent to its buildings in Rahway. The games were played after work and defendant provided the equipment in addition to the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On May 4, 1982, plaintiff was on defendant\u2019s Grand Avenue field for the first time to try out for the Dynasty team. He was fielding balls in right field when, according to plaintiff, he hit a \u201cbig rock, among other things,\u201d fell, and \u201ctwisted my knee and everything up.\u201d According to plaintiff \u201cthe field had big rocks in it. It had tree stumps\u201d and \u201cthe ground was all unlevel\u201d with small rocks and stones thereon. Plaintiff further testified that he tripped over a rock \u201cas large as a football,\u201d and that he had not previously noticed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Robert Gregory, employed as defendant\u2019s grounds supervisor, testified that his responsibilities included maintenance of the softball fields, including the Grand Avenue field where the accident occurred. He explained that in April 1982 his crew put down clay in the appropriate areas of the Grand Avenue field and that the field was enclosed by a fence which had existed before the area was made into a ball field. There were signs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the fence which read: \u201cNo Trespassing, Private Property, Merck &amp; Company\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">According to Gregory, the company had received complaints about the trees in right field. Although the trees were located beyond the playing areas, the employees had wanted the entire field open so more employees could practice on it at one time. In 1981 Merck hired a company to remove trees from that area. Gregory claimed, that the stumps were removed at that time, and were placed \u201ctwo to three feet into the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Gregory\u2019s crew cut the grass on the Grand Avenue field on April 30 and again on May 4, 1982, the day the fields were opened for use. On May 4 the crew used a vacuum mower, which not only cuts grass but also picks up paper, small stones and twigs. The mower cut at a level of two and one-half inches above the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Gregory maintained that he inspected the entire Grand Avenue field on May 4, 1982 and part of the regular duties of his crew was to police the ball field and to look for hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Louis McQueen, a member of the grounds crew employed by defendant, played softball on another of defendant\u2019s teams. He testified that the Grand Avenue field was fairly well maintained but that the condition of the field, and particularly the right field area, was \u201cvery poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Anthony Houck, a research chemist employed by defendant, was in right field when plaintiff fell. He testified that he inspected the field before the practice and warned plaintiff to be careful because the field was \u201cspongy\u201d. Houck did not see any rocks on the field and thought that the field was maintained in good condition. He saw that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cright foot went out from underneath him and he went to the ground\u201d while chasing a ball in the right field area.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Houck also testified that he personally encouraged employee participation in the softball league because participation by employees was \u201cgood for morale\u201d which in turn was good for productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Defendant contends that both on plaintiff\u2019s pretrial motion and when instructing the jury, the court below erred in determining as a matter of law that defendant owed plaintiff the duty of care applicable to an invitee. In instructing the jury at the end of the case the trial judge stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">Mr. Russell, was an invitee and I\u2019m going to give you what the definition of an invitee and the duty that\u2019s owed to an invitee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">An invitee is one who is permitted to enter or remain on land for a purpose of the owner, he enters by invitation, expressed or implied. The owner of the land, in this case Merck, who by invitation, expressed or implied, induced persons to come upon its premise is under a duty to exercise ordinary care to render the premise reasonably safe for the purposes embraced in this invitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">When we talk about premise, we all know we\u2019re talking about the Grand Avenue softball field. Thus, it must exercise reasonable care for the invitee safely. It must take such steps as are reasonable and prudent to correct or give warning of hazardous conditions or defects actually known to it or its employees and of hazardous conditions or defects which it or its employees by the exercise of reasonable care could discover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The question involved on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that plaintiff was an \u201cinvitee,\u201d as opposed to a \u201clicensee\u201d while on the ball field.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The duty owed by defendant as an occupier of land to plaintiff is dependent on plaintiff\u2019s status at the time of the accident. <em>Snyder v. I. Jay Realty Co., </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>303, 311 (1959); <em>Daggett v. Di Trani, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 188-189 (App.Div. 1984). \u201c[Sjtatus is determined by the circumstances which bring the plaintiff to the property.\u201d <em>Daggett, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 189. As Judge Fritz noted in <em>Daggett, </em>\u201cAn invitee, in the legal sense, is \u2018one who is on the premises to confer some benefits upon the invitor other than purely social.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">As stated in <em>Benedict v. Podwats, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402 (App. Div.1970), aff\u2019d o.b. 57 <em>N.J. </em>219 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">It is true that \u2018the duty owed by an occupier of land to third persons coming thereon is determined according to the status of such third person, <em>i.e., </em>invitee, licensee or trespasser. Indeed, the ascertainment of that status is an essential preliminary to the application of the standard of care to be exercised by the land occupier. [Cases cited.]\u2019 <em>Snyder v. I. Jay Realty Co., </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>303, 311 (1959).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>A \u2018social guest\u2019 has been defined as a gratuitous licensee in that while he is on the premises of another as a result of an \u2018invitation\u2019 in the laymen\u2019s sense of the word, he is'not an \u2018invitee\u2019 within the legal meaning of the term. The social guest enjoys the hospitality of the host and expects that the host will take the same care of him as he does of himself and his family. However, the host must warn a social guest of risks of harm or dangerous conditions of which the host has knowledge and the guest is unaware. <em>Berger v. Shapiro, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>89, 97-98 (1959); <em>Restatement of Torts </em>2d (1965), \u00a7 342.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">On the other hand, the duty of care owed by an occupier of land to his \u2018invitee,\u2019 legally understood, as the trial court properly charged, \u2018is to use reasonable care to make the premises safe, and this includes the duty to make a reasonable inspection to discover defective conditions.\u2019 <em>Handleman v. Cox, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>95, 111 (1963). [109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 406-407],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We conclude that employee morale, although intangible, constitutes some \u201cbenefit\u201d beyond that which is purely social and is therefore sufficient to classify plaintiff as an invitee. It was long recognized in the context of claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that company-sponsored or encouraged employee softball teams produce a benefit to the employer in terms of improved employee morale. <em>Complitano v. Steel &amp; Alloy Tank Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>300 (1961), rev\u2019g on dissent, 63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 456, 466-469 (App.Div.1960) (Conford, J.A.D. dissenting); <em>Tocci v. Tessler &amp; Weiss, Inc., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>582, 593-594 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">By <em>L. </em>1979, <em>c. </em>283, \u00a7 1, the Legislature decided that injuries sustained during recreational or social activities should no longer be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act unless such \u201cactivities are a regular incident of employment and produce a benefit to the employer beyond improvement in employee health and morale____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. <em>See Sarzillo v. Turner Const. Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>114, 117-120 (1985). Defendant argues that by virtue of the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the benefits received by the employer are no longer relevant with respect to a common law claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we conclude that while employee morale is no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>relevant to render compensable an injury sustained in the course of recreational activity, the benefit may nevertheless suffice for purposes of evaluating the employee\u2019s status as an invitee.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Here, defendant provided the fields for the teams\u2019 use and provided for their maintenance. Defendant also provided bats and balls and allowed solicitation of players through the company newspaper. Thus it is evident that defendant encouraged this activity. We conclude that defendant would not have absorbed the cost of the equipment and maintenance of the fields if it did not believe that it would in some way benefit from the activity. In <em>Complitano, supra, </em>the Supreme Court, by adopting Judge Conford\u2019s dissent, concluded that the employer\u2019s sponsorship of the teams \u201cwas motivated, in part, by the desire for better management relations with the employees engaged in the sponsored activity\u201d, 63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 467 and that, \u201cThere is nothing insubstantial about the commercial value of that kind of good will in today\u2019s labor-management climate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that that statement remains true in the context of present day labor-management relations and is relevant for purposes of evaluating plaintiff\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that the \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d test is not the exclusive one for determining whether an implied invitation exists. <em>Handleman v. Cox, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>95, 106 (1963). In <em>Handleman </em>the Court referred to the \u201cinvitation test,\u201d and quoted the following explanation of that test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">Rather it [the invitation test] bases \u2018invitation\u2019 on the fact that the occupier by his arrangement of the premises or other conduct has led the entrant to believe \u2018that [the premises] were intended to be used by visitors\u2019 for the purpose which this entrant was pursuing, \u2018and that such use was not only acquiesced in by the owner [or possessor], but that it was in accordance with the intention and design with which the way or place was adapted and prepared. * * * \u2019 Such arrangement or other conduct encourages people to enter the land with a sense of assurance that it has been prepared for their safety. <em>[Id. </em>at 108-109 quoting 2 <em>Harper &amp; James Torts, </em>\u00a7 27.12 at 1479 (1956) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">... It is not so much a lack of economic benefit to the occupier which deprives persons lawfully upon the premises of the status of invitee, but, \u2018[i]t is rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the fact that the premises obviously are not provided for such a purpose; that the visitor is not <em>solicited or encouraged </em>to come for such an end; in short, that he <em>must understand </em>that his presence will be <em>suffered at most, </em>and that he is not invited to come.\u2019 [Citation omitted] [39 <em>N.J. </em>at 109 emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The reason for the different status of a licensee or social guest is that he is presumed to understand that he will be \u201con the same footing as one of the family, and must take the premises as the occupier himself uses them, without any preparations made for his safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We believe that this test applies in common law suits by employees where the accident itself is not compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation statute. Defendant obviously intended that the fields be used by its employees for softball, since its grounds crew maintained the fields for that purpose and it provided equipment such as bats and balls. That employees could reasonably expect that the fields had been prepared for their safety is evident from the fact that they contacted defendant\u2019s grounds supervisor to find out when the fields would be ready for use. This is clearly not a case where the employees\u2019 use of the fields was merely tolerated or \u201csuffered\u201d by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The facts pertinent to the question of plaintiff\u2019s status were not substantially disputed, and, at least in this case where the facts were not the subject of any material dispute, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s status as an invitee was properly decided by the judge rather than the jury. As stated by Judge Kilkenny in <em>Benedict v. Podwats, supra, </em>\u201cThe facts were not in dispute, so that there was no need for jury intervention to determine factual issues____ Upon the undisputed facts, [his] legal status was properly a question of law to be determined by the trial judge. Certainly, he was better qualified than the jury to determine the legal conclusion to be drawn from the uncontradicted facts.\u201d [109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 408].</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">We conclude that the remaining issues raised by defendant do not warrant extended discussion. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(A), (B), (C), (E). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANX\">Defendant does not dispute that where an injury is not compensable under the the workers\u2019 compensation statute, a common law remedy is available. <em>See Imre v. Riegel Paper Corp., </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>438, 450 (1957). <em>See also Millison v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161 (1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
