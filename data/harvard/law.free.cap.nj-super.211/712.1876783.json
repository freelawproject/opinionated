The trial judge found that the damage to plaintiffs container which was coupled to a trailer chassis was not part of a \u201ctrailer\u201d covered by an insurance policy issued by defendant Great American Surplus Lines Insurance Co. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The facts are essentially uncontested. On December 10, 1981, plaintiff\u2019s trailer which was 13 feet 6 inches high incurred damage when it attempted to pass under a bridge whose clearance was only 12 feet 6 inches. The trailer consisted of a \u201cchassis\u201d, or wheels and frame, to which a box or \u201ccontainer\u201d was attached.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The attachment of the container and chassis was accomplished by clamps. The effect of this coupling was to render a chassis and container identical to the trailer portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>of a conventional tractor trailer. The entire weight of the container is supported by the chassis and the coupled unit is then towed by a tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The parties\u2019 contract of insurance provided coverage for \u201closs to a trailer caused by a collision.\u201d The policy defines \u201ctrailer,\u201d however the definition is not helpful in determining whether plaintiff\u2019s trailer is a trailer within the meaning of the policy language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the policy provides coverage only for damages sustained to the chassis portion of plaintiff\u2019s trailer. Defendant thus refused to accept liability for damages to the container portion of the trailer alleging it to be excluded by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Since there is an ambiguity in the meaning of \u201ctrailer\u201d we turn our attention to interpreting the term \u201ctrailer\u201d as employed in the insurance policy in question. In the absence of a specific definition in an insurance policy, the words used by the insurer must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary, plain and usual meaning. <em>Jorgenson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>136 <em>N.J.L. </em>148, 152 (N.J.Sup.Ct.1947); <em>Lansco, Inc. v. Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 281-282 (Ch.Div.1975), certif. den. 73 <em>N.J. </em>57 (1977). <em>See also Cooper v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>86, 93; <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 525 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">While this issue has not been dealt with in a reported decision in New Jersey, other jurisdictions faced with the problem have referred to dictionary definitions in determining the plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the term \u201ctrailer\u201d in an insurance policy. <em>See Safeguard Insurance Co. v. Justice, </em>203 <em>Va. </em>972, 128 <em>S.E.2d </em>286 (Sup.Ct.1962); <em>Jones v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Beiber, </em>251 <em>Iowa </em>969, 103 <em>N.W.2d </em>364 (Sup.Ct.1960). \u201cTrailer\u201d is defined as \u201ca vehicle or one in a succession of vehicles hauled usually by some other vehicle: as a nonautomotive highway or industrial-plant vehicle designed to be hauled ...\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(unabridged 1971). Other jurisdictions when determining the common usage of the term \u201ctrailer\u201d have used their motor vehicle codes for guidance. <em>See Corsi Bros. v. Daly, </em>242 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>865, 39 Misc.2d 1076 (1963) aff\u2019d 21 <em>A.D.2d </em>853, 252 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>253 (1964); <em>Safeguard Insurance Co. v. Justice, </em>203 <em>Va. </em>972, 128 <em>S.E.2d </em>286 (Sup.Ct. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Our Motor Vehicle and Traffic Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1 defines: \u201cTrailer\u201d as a \u201cvehicle with or without motive power, other than a pole trailer, designed for carrying persons or property and for being drawn by a motor vehicle and so constructed that no part of its weight rests upon the towing vehicle.\u201d \u201cSemitrailer\u201d is defined as a \u201cvehicle with or without motive power, other than a pole trailer, designed for carrying persons or property and for being drawn by a motor vehicle and so constructed that some part of its weight and that of its load rests upon or is carried by another vehicle.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1. The fact a \u201ctrailer\u201d has none of its weight resting upon the vehicle pulling it while a \u201csemitrailer\u201d has part of its weight on the other vehicle is not significant when it is the plain ordinary meaning of \u201ctrailer\u201d which is the focus of our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The ordinary person looking at a truck pulling a \u201ctrailer\u201d on the highway would not be able to discern whether the \u201ctrailer\u201d was a trailer, semitrailer or container. Clearly the plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning of \u201ctrailer\u201d to the public if based on observation would include semis, tractor trailers and plaintiffs coupled chassis and containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Ambiguities and uncertainties in an insurance contract are to be resolved against the insurance company under New Jersey law. <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 N.J. 325, 336 (1985); <em>Doria v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>71-72 (App.Div.1986); <em>Oldring v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>492 <em>F.Supp. </em>994, 998 (D.C.N.J.1980). As stated by our Supreme Court in <em>Sparks:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">The doctrine that courts do not lightly interfere with freedom of contract must be applied cautiously and realistically with regard to complex contracts of insurance, since such contracts are highly technical, extremely difficult to understand, and not subject to bargaining over the terms. They are contracts of adhesion, prepared unilaterally by the insurer, and have always been subjected to careful judicial scrutiny to avoid injury to the public. <em>[Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 335; citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Consequently, the insurer, as the drafter of the policy, is responsible for phrasing its contracts with such clarity as to avoid ambiguity in meaning. In the event that ambiguity does exist, \u201cdoubts as to the existence of coverage must be resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Here, the necessity of such a rule is highlighted. Defendant insurance company is the sole insurer of all vehicles used by plaintiffs business and that business is the transporting of chassis and containers. Therefore, if we were to interpret \u201ctrailer\u201d narrowly as defendant argues, none of the chassis and containers owned and operated by plaintiff would fall within the policy. Our review of the record indicates that such.an interpretation is totally inconsistent with the parties\u2019 original intent to establish insurance coverage for plaintiff\u2019s business. <em>See Doria v. Ins. Co. of North America, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71; <em>Kopp v. Newark Ins. Co., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 420 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Insurance contracts are to be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the average policy holder. <em>Perrine v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>120, 126 (1970); <em>Allen v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>294, 305 (1965); <em>Bauman v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>12, 25 (1961). <em>See also Zuckerman v. Nat. Union Fire Ins., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304, 320-321 (1985); <em>Doria v. Ins. Co. of North America, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71; <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525. Here, it was reasonable for plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>expect that the policy in question provided coverage for both chassis and containers. Therefore, we hold as a matter of law that a container coupled to a chassis constitutes a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">A cargo shipping container, or \"container,\u201d is a permanent, reusable article of transport equipment made of metal and equipped with doors for easy access to the goods inside. Assigned to facilitate the handling, loading, storage aboard ship, carriage, unloading and delivery of large numbers of packages of goods contained within, containers minimize the costs and risks of processing each package individually. The use of containers rather than conventional \"trailers\u201d and \"semitrailers\u201d developed as an efficient and economical method of handling and transporting cargo. Containers provide a means for transferring cargo from one form of transportation such as a ship to another form of transportation, such as rail or truck, without the necessity of transferring each individual item of cargo each time the mode of transportation changes. <em>See Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. County of Alameda, </em>12 <em>Cal.3d </em>772, 528 P.2d 56, 117 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>448 (Sup.Ct.1974) citing Simm, \"The Law of Shipping Containers\u201d 5 <em>J. Maritime L. </em>507, 513 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The insurance policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\"trailer\" means a trailer or semitrailer not owned by the named insured while in his possession under a written trailer interchange agreement wherein he assumes liability for loss to such trailer while in his possession, but \u201ctrailer\u201d shall not include robes, wearing apparel or personal effects.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
