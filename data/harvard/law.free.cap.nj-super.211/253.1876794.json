The 46 count complaint included wrongful death and survival actions as well as individual claims for infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>distress. Named as defendants were Saddlehill, Inc., the owner of the building, and its president, William Koestner, Anthony Corp., the managing agent, and its president, Anthony Iafelice, Elevator Maintenance Inc., an independent contractor, and its president, John Copabianco, and New Jersey Elevator Gate &amp; Door, Inc., a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In the complaint, defendants Saddlehill, Koestner, Anthony Corp. and Iafelice were charged with failing to properly maintain the elevator in a safe condition. Plaintiffs also alleged that Elevator Maintenance and Copabianco negligently replaced the elevator door and failed to install a safety device referred to as a \u201ctoe guard\u201d which would have prevented the elevator from moving while the door was open. Plaintiffs further claimed that New Jersey Elevator, the party that actually installed the door, was equally negligent in failing to install the toe guard. Plaintiffs sought both compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">All of the defendants filed answers and cross claims for contribution. Prior to trial, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages was dismissed. The trial judge additionally dismissed their individual actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs settled their claims against Elevator Maintenance, Copabianco and New Jersey Elevator for $100,000 before the jury was selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Following a protracted trial, the jury rendered its verdict. In a special interrogatory, the jury determined that Saddlehill and Koestner were not guilty of \u201cseparate and independent active negligence.\u201d However, the jury apportioned fault in the following manner: 5% for Saddlehill and Koestner, 5% for Anthony Corp. and Iafalice and 90% for Elevator Maintenance, Copabianco and New Jersey Elevator. The jury awarded $15,000 in damages in the survival action. However, the jury found no pecuniary damages in the wrongful death action. Based upon the percentages of negligence determined by the jury, the trial judge molded the verdict and entered a judgment against Sad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>dlehill and Koestner in the sum of $750 and against Anthony Corp. and Iafelice in the same amount. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Despite the voluminous record, the essential facts are not in dispute. The genesis of this action was a tragic accident which occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. on July 6,1981. Plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was crushed by an elevator in her North Bergen apartment building. Apparently, she had attempted to enter the elevator in the basement of the complex. The accident was attributable to the absence of a \u201ctoe guard,\u201d a safety device designed to prevent the elevator from moving while its doors were open.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">There were no witnesses to the incident, but the investigation of the police confirmed that the decedent became wedged between the outer door of the elevator and the cabin\u2019s inner gate, a space approximately eight inches wide. It would appear that someone on an upper floor summoned the elevator before the decedent could enter the inner door, and the outer gate closed behind her. She was then pulled up the elevator shaft until her head met the upper floor. In a matter of seconds, the decedent\u2019s head was crushed, and her badly battered body fell into the well of the shaft where it was discovered later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Elevator Maintenance had a service contract with Koestner which had been in force since 1970. One of the duties of Elevator Maintenance was to inspect the building\u2019s elevator on a periodic basis. On August 8, 1980 Koestner received a memorandum advising him that the elevator door and frame in the basement were \u201cbeyond repair.\u201d Several months later, Koestner directed Elevator Maintenance to replace the door and perform the necessary services. A contract was signed on November 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">New Jersey Elevator, a subcontractor, installed a new outer door in early December, 1980. The old wooden door had been equipped with a toe guard. However, the subcontractor unaccountably failed to replace it. Although the superintendent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the building was aware of this fact, he attached no significance to the absence of a toe guard because he was uncertain as to its function. Similarly, Iafelice inspected the elevator following installation of the new door, but he too was unaware of the need for a toe guard. A repair supervisor employed by Elevator Maintenance also inspected the door and found nothing amiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Defendants\u2019 expert, a licensed engineer, testified that \u201cspacer plates\u201d\u2014his phrase for toe guards\u2014are \u201cin common use\u201d in the industry. He further stated that well accepted safety standards mandated installation of such a device. He concluded that the failure of Elevator Maintenance to install one on the basement floor \u201cconstitute[d] a violation\u201d of those safety standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Much of the evidence presented at trial pertained to the question of damages. Consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green v. Bittner, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12-17 (1980), plaintiffs were accorded broad latitude in presenting evidence concerning the pecuniary value of the loss of decedent\u2019s companionship and advice. In addition, plaintiffs presented two experts, Dr. M. Geraldine Gage, a professor of family economics at the University of Minnesota, and David Budin, an actuarial consultant, who testified that there was a likelihood of increasing \u201ceconomic transfers\u201d from child to parents with the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As noted previously, the jury apparently found all of the parties negligent but ascribed most of the fault to Elevator Maintenance and New Jersey Elevator. The jury awarded no damages in the wrongful death action. In the survival action, the jury awarded $15,000 in damages. The judge molded the verdict to reflect a reduction of the damages based upon the percentage of negligence ascribed to the settling tortfeasors, Elevator Maintenance and New Jersey Elevator. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Plaintiffs advance a plethora of arguments in their effort to obtain a reversal and a new trial. Although phrased in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>variety of ways, their complaints fall into six general categories. These include arguments that: (1) the judge\u2019s pretrial orders dismissing their claim for punitive damages and their individual actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress constituted reversible error, (2) the judge\u2019s evidentiary decisions were erroneous, (3) defense counsel\u2019s conduct deprived plaintiffs of their right to a fair trial, (4) the judge\u2019s instructions were misleading and failed to apprise the jury of the applicable principles of law, (5) the damages awarded by the jury should not have been reduced by the percentage of negligence ascribed to the settling tortfeasors and (6) the failure of the jury to award damages in the wrongful death action constituted a miscarriage of justice. Only the last two contentions require extended comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We first address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Elevator Maintenance and New Jersey Elevator were not joint tortfeasors and that the trial judge incorrectly reduced the damages awarded by the jury in accordance with the percentage of negligence attributable to them. Although ambiguously phrased, the principal thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that defendants owed a nondelegable duty to maintain the elevator in a safe condition and, therefore, the negligence of the independent contractor and subcontractor must be imputed to them. They, thus, contend that the trial judge erroneously reduced the damages awarded by the jury by the percentage of negligence ascribed to Elevator Maintenance and New Jersey Elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We start with the thesis that an owner of a building has a nondelegable duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of tenants and persons using the premises at his invitation. <em>Mayer v. Fairlawn Jewish Center, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>549, 555 (1962); <em>Gill v. Krassner, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 15 (App.Div.1950); <em>Levine v. Bochiaro, </em>137 <em>N.J.L. </em>215, 219 (E. &amp; A. 1948); <em>Hussey v. Long Dock R.R. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J.L. </em>380, 384 (E. &amp; A.1924). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts, </em>\u00a7 63 at 445-446 (5 ed. 1984); 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 26.11 at 1406-1408 (1956). A landlord who leases portions of his building is obliged to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of common facilities under his control, to the end that the premises will be reasonably safe and fit for the uses which he has invited others to make of them. <em>Levine v. Bochiaro, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 218. That duty is nondelegable. The owner may not relieve himself of that responsibility by his unilateral act of engaging an independent contractor to discharge it for him. In other words, \u201cthe lessor\u2019s duty to exercise due care in the maintenance of a common facility remains with him whether [he] chooses to discharge [it] himself, or by his employee, or by a third party who, as to the landlord, may have the status of an independent contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219. <em>See also Mayer v. Fairlawn Jewish Center, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 555; <em>Gill v. Krassner, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">These principles have their genesis in our early common law and are presently codified in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:10-4.1. That regulation, adopted pursuant to the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>55:13A-1 <em>et seq.), </em>states that \u201c[o]wners, including agents ..., managing agents and superintendents shall have the general duties outlined herein\u201d and that no \u201csuch person [shall] be relieved of any responsibility by the terms or provisions of any lease, contract or agreement.\u201d This regulation is augmented by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:10-12.1 to 12.4 which provide detailed standards of safety pertaining to the maintenance of common elevators. As noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Trentacost v. Brussel, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>214, 230 (1980), these regulations provide minimum standards for safety and habitability in multiple dwellings and have the \u201cforce of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">These principles are entirely reasonable and are based upon important policy considerations. The party to whom the lessor owes a nondelegable duty ought not to be required to concern himself with contracts made by the owner for the discharge of his responsibility. <em>Levine v. Bochiaro, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.L. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>219. The lessor may secure indemnity by either agreement with the contractor or the pursuit of such remedies as the law may afford, including common law indemnification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 219-220. <em>See Mayer v. Fairlawn Jewish Center, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 555-556. However, the landlord cannot relieve himself of responsibility for injuries negligently inflicted upon third persons as a result of the act or omission of an independent contractor hired by him to perform his nondelegable duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Plaintiffs are, thus, correct in their assertion that defendants were vicariously liable for the negligent acts of the settling tortfeasors. However, even if the landlord\u2019s liability were wholly vicarious\u2014and based on the jury\u2019s verdict we are convinced that it was not\u2014plaintiffs could derive no comfort from that fact. The fact remains that plaintiffs settled their claim against the independent contractor and subcontractor. While we agree that this settlement did not serve to extinguish their cause of action against defendants, <em>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 559 (1980); <em>Daily v. Somberg, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>372, 383 (1958); <em>McFadden v. Turner, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 366 (App.Div.1978); <em>Rossum v. Jones, </em>97 <em>N.J. Super. </em>382, 390 (App.Div.1967), it is nonetheless equally true that the settlement cannot be wholly ignored. Our cases have long recognized that a plaintiff\u2019s settlement with one tortfeasor has consequences on claims against another tortfeasor, <em>Theobald v. Kenney\u2019s Suburban House, Inc., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>203, 206-209, 212 (1966); <em>Theobald v. Angelos, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>228, 235 (1965), and this is true even though the latter\u2019s liability is solely vicarious. <em>Cf. McFadden v. Turner, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364-365; <em>Moss v. Jones, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 184 (App.Div.1966). Where an individual\u2019s liability is soley vicarious, a plaintiff is entitled to only one satisfaction for the same loss and, thus, damages for which the nonsettling defendant is ultimately responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>must be reduced <em>pro tanto </em>by the amount obtained from any settlement previously entered into between the injured party and the person who actually committed the negligent act. <em>Cf. Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 885(3) at 333, 335 (1977); <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d, \u00a7 50 at 40-42 (1980); <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 48 at 330-332; 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, supra, </em>\u00a7 10.1 at 714; <em>Restatement, Contracts </em>2d, \u00a7\u00a7 293, 294(3), 295(3) at 421, 423, 427 (1977). Hence, if the defendants\u2019 responsibility for the decedent\u2019s death were found to rest solely upon the theory of vicarious liability, they would be entitled to reduce the damages awarded by the jury against them by the amount of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Conversely, if defendants\u2019 liability were predicated on acts of independent negligence, as we believe the jury found, the Comparative Negligence Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 <em>et seq.) </em>would come into play.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Enactment of that statutory scheme dramatically altered prior decisional law which held that a settlement with one of several joint tortfeasors resulted in a <em>pro rata </em>reduction in the verdict against the remaining tortfeasors. <em>Theobold v. Angelos, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 241. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.15-5.2 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">In all negligence actions in which the question of liability is in dispute, the trier of fact shall make the following as findings of fact:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adv\">a. The amount of damages which would be recoverable by the injured party-regardless of any consideration of negligence, that is, the full value of the injured party\u2019s damages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>b. The extent, in the form of a percentage, of each parties\u2019 negligence. The percentage of negligence of each party shall be based on 100% and the total of all percentages of negligence of all the parties to a suit shall be 100%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">e. The judge shall mold the judgment from the finding of fact made by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.3 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">The party so recovering, may recover the full amount of the molded verdict from any party against whom such recovering party is not barred from recovery. Any party who is so compelled to pay more than such party\u2019s percentage share may seek contribution from the other joint tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Presently, each tortfeasor is ultimately liable for the same percentage of the judgment as the degree of negligence attributed to him. As we pointed out in <em>Rogers v. Spady, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 277 (App.Div.1977), \u201c[a] natural corollary to this is that when a claimant settles with a codefendant, that percentage of negligence found attributable [to him] ... will be deducted from the verdict returned against the other codefendants found liable, <em>i.e., </em>the remaining joint tortfeasors will be liable for that percentage of negligence attributable to them.\u201d <em>See also Ramos v. Browning Ferris Ind. of So. Jersey, Inc., </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 106 (App.Div.1984), certif. granted 101 <em>N.J. </em>211 (1985). <em>Cf. Lee\u2019s Hawaiian Islanders, Inc. v. Safety First Prod., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 506 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 99 <em>N.J. </em>205 (1984). Stated another way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">Now the effect on the plaintiff of a joint tortfeasor\u2019s settlement will depend upon the percentage of fault found against him. When one defendant settles, the remaining codefendant or codefendants are chargeable with the total verdict less that attributable to the settling defendant\u2019s percentage share. <em>[Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 569.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">It is against this backdrop that we must consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument. Unfortunately, the verdict returned by the jury is not altogether clear. As we mentioned previously, in response to a special interrogatory, the jury found that defendants were not guilty of \u201cseparate and independent active negligence separate from any negligence of [the settling tortfeasors].\u201d However, the jury also determined that defendants were 10% negligent and the settling tortfeasors were 90% negligent. Although the verdict is ambiguous, we construe it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>as a determination that defendants were partially at fault. Our interpretation of the jury\u2019s verdict comports with the instructions given by the trial judge. In our view, the jury found that defendants were not guilty of \u201cseparate and independent active negligence\u201d because they did not themselves actively and affirmatively install the defective elevator door. Rather, their negligence was essentially passive in that, according to the jury, they either knew or should have been aware of the settling tortfeasors\u2019 failure to install a toe guard. The jury determined that defendants were independently negligent on that account. Since they were adjudged jointly negligent, the Comparative Negligence Act was fully applicable and the judge correctly reduced the damages in accordance with the percentage of fault ascribed to the settling tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We next consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the jury\u2019s verdict awarding no damages in the wrongful death action constituted a miscarriage of justice. Although we are mindful of our Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Green v. Bittner, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 4, that such a verdict \u201cshould ordinarily be set aside ... and a new trial ordered,\u201d our thorough review of the record here convinces us that the jury\u2019s determination should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Our Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned trial judges \u201cto resist the natural temptation to substitute their judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 597 (1977). The judge does not sit as a \u201cthirteenth and decisive juror.\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6 (1969). A jury\u2019s verdict \u201cis entitled to very considerable respect\u201d and should be overturned only \u201cupon the basis of a carefully reasoned and factually supported (and articulated) determination ... that the continued viability of the judgment would constitute a manifest denial of justice.\u201d <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 597-598.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The deference accorded a jury\u2019s verdict has \u201croots deep in the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. As expressed by Chief Justice Hughes, \u201cthe presumption of correctness of a verdict by a jury has behind it the wisdom of centuries of common law merged into our constitutional framework.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That is not to say that a jury\u2019s verdict is sacred. When a court undertakes to review it, however, the task must \u201cbe approached, in all contingencies, with utmost circumspection____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Here, we are fortunate to have the benefit of the trial judge\u2019s reasons for denying a new trial on damages. His views are expressed in great detail in an extensive letter opinion. In that opinion, the judge provided his evaluation of the \u201cwitness[es\u2019] credibility,\u201d their \u201cdemeanor\u201d and his \u201cfeel of the case\u201d\u2014 factors which may not be reflected in the printed word of the written record. See <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 7. We emphasize that his opinion confirms what our independent and thorough review of the record discloses. The simple fact is that the evidence presented by plaintiffs with regard to damages was wholly unpersuasive. The testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts was highly speculative and conjectural, as they themselves admitted on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We are fully convinced from our careful reading of the record that plaintiffs received a fair trial. We perceive no justifiable basis to disturb the jury\u2019s determination and afford plaintiffs another opportunity to litigate the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">We have carefully reviewed plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments in light of the voluminous record and are convinced that they are devoid of merit. We are entirely satisfied that the judge correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages and their individual actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress. In that respect, we are in complete accord with the trial judge\u2019s determination that there was no justifiable basis to warrant a punitive award. <em>Nappe v. Anschelew</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>itz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 49 (1984). It cannot fairly be said that defendants\u2019 conduct was sufficiently egregious to justify punitive damages. <em>Leimgruber v. Claridge Associates, Ltd., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 454 (1977); <em>Berg v. Reaction Motors Div., </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>396, 414 (1962). We are also in complete agreement with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 individual actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress did not satisfy the standards adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 101 (1980). It is undisputed that a critical element\u2014\u201cobservation of the death or injury at the scene of the accident\u201d\u2014is not present here. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Equally unpersuasive is plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary decisions. We need not address all of the arguments separately. We merely repeat that plaintiffs were accorded extremely broad latitude in presenting evidence relating to their loss of the decedent\u2019s advice and companionship. The minimal restrictions placed upon the presentation of such evidence clearly fell within the trial judge\u2019s broad discretionary authority. <em>State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 106 (1982); <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 144 (1978); <em>Evid.R. </em>4. We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that defendants\u2019 expert was unqualified, <em>Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>135, 141 (1950); <em>Spiegle v. Seaman, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 478 (App.Div.1978); <em>Evid.R. </em>19, that his conclusions constituted a \u201cnet opinion,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 91 (1984); <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524 (1981); <em>Parker v. Goldstein, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 484 (App.Div.1963), certif. den. 40 <em>N.J. </em>225 (1963) and that his opinion impermissibly embraced the \u201cultimate issue\u201d to be resolved by the jury. <em>State v. Boiardo, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 238 (App.Div.1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N.J. </em>130 (1970) , <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U.S. </em>948, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>931, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>231 (1971) ; <em>Evid.R. </em>56(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We next consider plaintiffs\u2019 contention that defense counsel\u2019s conduct impaired their right to a fair trial. At the outset, we note that both counsel were unnecessarily acrimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>nious and equally at fault. The trial judge exercised admirable restraint and patience in dealing with their petty bickering. Of course, we recognize that in the pressurized atmosphere that develops in a courtroom during an extended trial, counsel may find it increasingly difficult to submit to an unfavorable ruling. Fierce argument between the attorneys often creates the motivation to add a few final words even after the judge has rendered a definitive decision. The controlling principle is clear. We emphasize that it is incumbent upon counsel to put aside their disappointment and save the point in issue for appellate review. We find it necessary to stress this rule because the record is replete with instances in which it was transgressed by both counsel. Our thorough review of the record convinces us, however, that plaintiffs were not denied a fair trial on that account. Many of the acrimonious colloquies referred to in plaintiffs\u2019 brief occurred out of the presence of the jury. In any event, we are entirely satisfied that the attorneys\u2019 often improper conduct had no impact upon the jury\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial judge\u2019s instructions were misleading and failed to apprise the jury of the applicable legal principles. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, it was not incumbent upon the judge to instruct the jury with regard to the defendants\u2019 respective responsibilities under the elevator maintenance and repair contracts. As the judge aptly observed, the contents of the contracts had no bearing on the independent contractor\u2019s duty in tort. Elevator Maintenance and New Jersey Elevator, under well-established principles, had \u201ca duty to persons, other than the one with whom [they had] made the contract, to carry out [the] undertaken work in a careful and prudent manner____\u201d <em>Aronsohn v. Mandara, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>92, 105 (1984). Failing that, a jury could find them \u201cresponsible to third persons for their personal injuries ... proximately caused by [their] failure to exercise that care ... irrespective of privity.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We also conclude that the trial judge did not commit error in refusing to advise the jury of the effect of its comparative negligence findings upon the damages actually awarded. An \u201cultimate outcome\u201d charge is generally required when a plaintiff and one or more defendants are comparatively negligent. <em>Roman v. Mitchell, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>336, 345 (1980). Otherwise, the jury might erroneously conclude that the plaintiff will recover damages notwithstanding its finding that his negligence was greater than the combined fault of the defendants. In such a case, the jury \u201cshould be given an ultimate outcome charge so that its deliberations on percentages of negligence will not be had in a vacuum, or possibly based on a mistaken notion of how the statute operates.\u201d <em>Ibid. Cf. O\u2019Brien v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>114, 124 (1971). Here, there was no issue of the decedent\u2019s negligence. Therefore, there was no affirmative claim that would have justified the ultimate outcome charge, and we perceive no authorization or direction in <em>Roman v. Mitchell, supra, </em>compelling that course. <em>See Colucci by Colucci v. Thomas Nicol Asphalt Co., </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 518 (App.Div.1984). <em>Contra Dimogerondakis v. Dimogerondakis, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 522-523 (Law Div.1984). Even assuming, however, that such a charge should ordinarily be given in a case involving a settling tortfeasor, it is abundantly clear that a trial judge \u201cin the exercise of sound discretion, [can] withhold the instruction if it would tend to mislead or confuse the jury.\u201d <em>Roman v. Mitchell, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 346-347. The jurors here endured a lengthy trial, and it is apparent from the record that the judge was striving to avoid unnecessary confusion. He repeatedly emphasized that it was the jury\u2019s duty to award full damages sufficient to completely recompense plaintiffs for their pecuniary loss. We discern no justifiable basis to disturb his discretionary decision under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We further find that the judge properly refused to instruct the jury concerning the landlord\u2019s duty to provide adequate security. The evidence proffered by plaintiffs in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>respect was highly speculative. We discern no error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Lastly, we find that the trial judge\u2019s instructions with respect to damages in the wrongful death action fully comported with the principles enunciated in <em>Green v. Bittner, supra. </em>Again, we need not address each of plaintiffs\u2019 separate contentions in that respect. Suffice it to say, the judge\u2019s instructions, read in their entirety, adequately apprised the jury of the applicable principles of law. We perceive no error in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:40A-1, which became effective following the decedent\u2019s death, limits the effectiveness of such indemnification agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Comparative Negligence Act is applicable where there are joint tortfeasors. Clearly, the Act does not apply where the liability of one of the defendants is solely vicarious. Although the term \"joint tortfeasor\u201d is not defined in the Comparative Negligence Act, it should be construed in light of the definition provided in the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law. <em>Arcell v. Ashland Chemical Co., Inc., </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 485 (Law Div.1977). We note in that regard that the Contribution Law states generally that where a party\u2019s liability is solely vicarious, he and the actively negligent tortfeasor \u201cshall be considered a single tortfeasor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1. <em>Cf. Public Service Elec. and Gas Co. v. Waldroup, </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 431-432 (App.Div.1955); <em>Marley v.
