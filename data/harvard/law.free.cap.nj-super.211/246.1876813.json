Plaintiffs\u2019 basement and its contents sustained water damage as a result of a rupture in a hose which connected their sump pump to a drain. Their homeowner\u2019s policy with defendant covered loss due to \u201c[ajccidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating or air conditioning system or from within a household appliance.\u201d Defendant disclaimed liability under a clause which excluded \u201closs resulting directly or indirectly from ... [wjater damage, meaning ... water below the surface of the ground ...\u201d We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The basic facts are not disputed. On May 30, 1984 the basement in plaintiffs\u2019 home filled with water when a hose ruptured. The hose connected a sump pump to a drain in the basement. The sump pump was portable and was located in a sump pit in the basement. The pump was powered by plugging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>its electrical cord into a standard wall outlet. Plaintiff Michael Stone, an attorney, gave the lay opinion that the only water in the basement came from the hose and that there was no water seepage. He concedes that the purpose of the sump pump was to remove subsurface water, <em>i.e., </em>when the water table reaches the level of the sump pit it is expelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The homeowner's policy in question covered \u201cdirect loss ... caused by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">14. Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating or air conditioning system or from within a household appliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The relevant exclusion clause stated: \u201cWe do not cover loss directly or indirectly from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">3. Water Damage, meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">a. flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">b. water which backs up through sewers or drains; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">c. water below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming pool or other structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">Direct loss by fire, explosion or theft resulting from water damage is covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">In his oral opinion the judge noted that there might be an issue as to whether the sump pump and attached hose constituted a household appliance as opposed to a fixture, but he found it unnecessary to reach that question since in his view an exclusion in the policy made it clear the loss was not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">In interpreting insurance contracts the basic rule is to determine the intention of the parties from the language of the policy, giving effect to all of its parts so as to accord a reasonable meaning to its terms. <em>Caruso v. John Hancock &amp;c., Insurance Co., </em>136 <em>N.J.L. 597, </em>598 (E. &amp; A.1947); <em>Tooker v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 222-223 (App.Div.1974). When the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous the court must enforce the contract as it finds it; the court cannot make a better contract for the parties than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>they themselves made. <em>Flynn v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 488 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>5 (1977); <em>Am. Leg. Hosp. v. St. Paul\u2019s Fire Ins. Co., </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 397 (App.Div.1969). Rules of construction favoring the insured cannot be employed to disregard the clear intent of the policy language. <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 246-247 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">However, where an ambiguity exists, it must be resolved against the insurer. <em>DiOrio v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>257, 269 (1979); <em>Bryan Const. Co., Inc. v. Employers\u2019 Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>375, 377 (1972). If the controlling language will support two meanings, one favorable to the insurer and the other to the insured, the interpretation favoring coverage should be applied. <em>Corcoran v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 243 (App.Div.1975). \u201cAccordingly, such contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that recognizes the reasonable expectation of the insured.\u201d <em>Zuckerman v. Nat. Union Fire Ins., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304, 320-321 (1985). Coverage clauses should be interpreted liberally, whereas those of exclusion should be strictly construed. <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576 (1970); <em>Ellmex Const. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. Super. </em>195, 205 (App.Div.1985). Even if a particular phrase or term is capable of being interpreted in the manner sought by the insurer, \u201cwhere another interpretation favorable to the insured reasonably can be made that construction must be applied.\u201d 202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sump pump with its attached hose was a fixture, and therefore not a household appliance or part of the plumbing system. Plaintiff Michael Stone\u2019s second affidavit attests to the portability of the sump pump, and photographs appear to support his claim that we are not dealing with a fixture. In any event, \u201cappliance\u201d and \u201cfixture\u201d are not mutually exclusive terms. An appliance is a tool, instrument or device adapted for a particular use, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>can be a fixture. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) </em>104-105 (1976). We conclude that to the average insured a portable sump pump of the type involved here is no less an appliance than a dehumidifier or a washing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Defendant promised to insure plaintiffs against direct loss caused by an accidental discharge or overflow of water from part of the plumbing system or from a household appliance, which is what occurred here. The policy, however, excludes losses caused directly or indirectly by subsurface water, which was what the sump pump was pumping out. Defendant argues that if included and excluded risks concurrently cause a loss the insured cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The rule urged by defendant was adopted by this court in <em>Brindley v. Fireman\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.1955), which involved a homeowner\u2019s policy that insured against loss by windstorm but excluded loss caused directly or indirectly by waves or high water. Plaintiffs\u2019 shore house suffered damage during a storm which occurred while they were away. In most instances it was not possible to separate the damage caused by wind from that caused by water with any degree of certainty. In those circumstances, this court stated: \u201cLoss due to the effect of causes both within and outside the coverage, operating conjointly, is generally considered not recoverable under this kind of provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The insured\u2019s \u201cproofs must be such as to enable the factfinder to find without resort to sheer conjecture the amount of the particular loss ascribable to the hazard assumed by the carrier.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Newman v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>86 <em>N.J. Super. </em>391, 403 (App.Div.1965) this court adhered to the rule set forth in <em>Brindley, </em>rejecting an insured\u2019s contention that <em>Brindley </em>was contrary to sound policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Plaintiffs argue that this rule does not apply here because the two causes of the loss, the existence of the underground water and the broken sump pump occurred sequentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>not concurrently. They contend that the rule set forth in <em>Franklin Packaging Co. v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188 (App.Div.1979), certif. den. 84 <em>N.J. </em>434 (1980), is dispositive. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Franklin Packaging </em>the policy covered vandalism but excluded \u201closs caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by\u201d water which backed up through a drain. The insured\u2019s stock in trade suffered water damage when vandals broke a valve on an air conditioning unit, which created a constant flow of water. Normally that water would have drained harmlessly out through a six-inch drain, but at the time the drain pipe was blocked by a burlap bag left behind by plumbers. The insurer argued the loss was excluded, relying on <em>Brindley, supra, </em>and <em>Newman, supra. </em>This court found coverage, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">The genera] rule applicable to a factual context which presents a facial conflict between the risk covered and an exclusion is found in 5 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 3083 at 309-311 (1970):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201cWhere a peril specifically insured against sets other causes in motion which, in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produced the result for which recovery is sought, the insured peril is regarded as the proximate cause of the entire loss. It is not necessarily the last act in a chain of events which is, therefore, regarded as the proximate cause, but the efficient or predominant cause which sets into motion the chain of events producing the loss. An incidental peril outside the policy, contributing to the risk insured against, will not defeat recovery * * *. In other words, it has been held that recovery may be allowed where the insured risk was the last step in the chain of causation set in motion by an uninsured peril, or where the insured risk itself set into operation a chain of causation in which the last step may have been an excepted risk. ([Emphasis omitted])\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE0t\">The cases relied on by defendant in support of its contention that <em>Apple-man \u2019s </em>general rule is not authority in New Jersey are inapposite and not within the purview of the rule. In both <em>Newman v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391 (App.Div.1965), and <em>Brindley v. Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.1955), plaintiffs had extended coverage for \u201cdirect loss by windstorm\u201d under policies which excluded wave and high water damage \u201cwhether driven by wind or not.\u201d In both, wind and high water occurred simultaneously, and plaintiffs were required to show that damage incurred was caused by wind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Here we are dealing with sequential and not simultaneous events, the first being the insured against risk of vandalism, the last a backup due to the blockage of the drain. The sequence fits precisely within the general rule stated in <em>Appleman. </em>[171 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 191]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Here, the underground water, an excluded peril, started the loss-producing chain of causation, but the last event, the ruptured hose on the appliance, was a covered risk. In <em>World Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Carolina Mills Dist. Co., </em>169 <em>F.</em>2d 826 (8th Cir.1948) the policy insured against loss caused by an accidental discharge or overflow of water from the plumbing system, but excluded losses caused by sewer backups. A heavy rain forced a sewer backup but the water would not have gotten into plaintiffs\u2019 basement, damaging plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise, unless the pressure from the backup broke a metal cap in the premises\u2019 plumbing system. The Court found coverage even though, as in the present case, the exclusion clause purportedly disclaimed liability for losses caused \u201cdirectly or indirectly.\u201d <em>See </em>169 F.2d at 828-831. <em>Accord King v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>84 <em>N.M. </em>550, 505 P.2d 1226 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We find <em>Al Berman, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>216 F.2d 626 (3d Cir.1954), relied on by defendant and the trial court, to be distinguishable because the loss there was not within the coverage portion of the policy. Further, we do not find <em>Berman </em>to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant and remand to the trial court for a determination of the extent of plaintiffs\u2019 damages caused as a direct result of the ruptured hose as distinguished from any damage caused by water seepage alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Regarding plaintiffs\u2019 claim for interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, we call the trial court\u2019s attention to <em>Ellmex Const. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208-214.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
