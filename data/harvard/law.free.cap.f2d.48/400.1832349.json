Appellant also pleaded registration No. 102,174, issued January 26, 1915, of its trade-mark for use on sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-27\">It .appears from an agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties that appellant and its predecessors used the word \u201cRevere\u201d as a trade-name on its goods from 1873 to' April, 1912; that since 1912 appellant has used its registered trade-mark on six different types of sugar; that its sugar is sold in grocery .and other stores in cardboard containers, and also in five, ten, and twenty-five. pound sacks; that it has expended large sums of money in advertising its goods under its trade-mark; that, since 1922 its sales have exceeded $21,000,000 annually; that its goods are well known to the public throughout the United States as \u201cRevere sugar\u201d; that appellee is in the wholesale grocery business at Chicago, Ill., under the name \u201cRevere Wholesale Grocery Company,\u201d and has used the involved trade-mark on some of the articles enumerated in the application for registration since March 10, 1923, and on the other-enumerated .articles since October 18, 1927; that the name \u201cRevere\u201d is, and for longer than a century has been, a \u201csurname or proper name\u201d in the United States; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>there are cities and villages in the United States by that name; that several corporations have the name \u201cRevere\u201d as a part of their corporate name; and that the involved trade-mark has been registered by many others for use on a variety of products, including wheat flour.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The Examiner of Interferences held that, with the exception of maple syrup and cane syrup, the goods of the respective parties did not possess the same descriptive properties; that appellant had used its trade-mark since long prior to any use by appellee of his trade-mark; and that, .although the marks so closely resemble each other as to be likely to cause confusion in the trade, appellee was entitled to register his mark on all articles named in the application for registration, except maple syrup and cane syrup.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Commissioner of Patents held that appellant had used its trade-mark since long prior to its use by appellee; that appellant\u2019s trade-mark was a valuable .asset in its business; that the marks were substantially the same; that, with the exception of maple syrup, cane syrup, candies,\u2019sugared ginger, sugared kumquats, sugared dates, candied orange peel, candied lemon peel, and candied citron, the goods of the parties did not possess the same descriptive properties; and that therefore appellee was entitled to the registration of its mark for use on all other products set out in his application for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It is claimed by appellant that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties, that the marks are confusingly similar, and that it will be damaged by the registration of the involved trade-mark to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">It is contended by counsel for appellee that the goods of the parties do not possess the same descriptive properties, that appellant is not the originator of its trade-mark and therefore is entitled to limited protection only, and that appellee is entitled to have his mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The validity of appellant\u2019s trade-mark registration is not before us, and will not be considered by this court in a proceeding of this character.

A. 906; National Biscuit Company v. Joseph <em>W. </em>Sheridan, 44 F.(2d) 987, 18 C. C. P. A. -; Decker <em>&amp; </em>Cohn, Inc., v. S. Liebovitz &amp; Sons, Inc., 46 F.(2d) 179, 18 C. C. P. A.; Celanese Corporation of America v. Vanity Fair Silk Mills, 47 F.(2d) 373, 18 C. C. P. A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Appellee is in the wholesale grocery business, and the food products on which he uses his alleged trade-mark are sold in the same stores as the goods of appellant. The trademarks are almost identical. It would seem to us, therefore, that, if appellee is permitted to use his alleged trade-mark on his goods concurrently with the use by appellant of its trade-mark on its goods, confusion as to the origin of the goods of the respective parties would likely result. Accordingly, we are of opinion that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties within the principles heretofore announced by this court. California Packing Corporation v. Tillman &amp; Bendel, 40 F.(2d) 108, 17 C. C. P. A. 1048; B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Hockmeyer (Zip-on Co., Substituted) 40 F.(2d) 99, 17 C. C. P. A. 1068; Sun-Maid Raisin Growers - of California v.

A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">It appears from the record that appellant has used its trade-mark since long prior to. the adoption and use by appellee of his alleged trade-mark; that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties; that the marks are confusingly similar; and that appellant would be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s alleged trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">GARRETT, Associate Judge, concurs in. the conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
