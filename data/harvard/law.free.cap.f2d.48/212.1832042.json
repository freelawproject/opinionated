(Vernon\u2019s Ann. Civ. St. art. 835a). The said act authorized the appointment of a receiver for any incorporated town or city, under the conditions alleged in the bill, by the District Court of the district in which the town or city might be situated. The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and .this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">While the appeal was pending and before a hearing, the Legislature of Texas, by an Act passed on March 4, 1931, repealed chapter 46 of the General Laws of the Forty-First Legislature (2d Called Sess.), above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">Whether the decision of the District Court was correct when rendered is now immaterial as jurisdiction, and appellants right of action depended wholly upon the Act of October 1, 1929. Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, 26 L. Ed. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">It follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
