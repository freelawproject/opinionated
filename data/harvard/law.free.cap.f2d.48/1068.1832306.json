Before completion of the building, appellee, for reasons it deemed sufficient, ceased work. It then claimed to be due the sum of $46,900, for which it filed a' mechanic\u2019s lien. Appellant contended that there was no justification for the abandonment of the contract. The question, among others, was referred to the special master, who found in favor of appellee, and his finding was confirmed by the court. Prior to the report of the special master, appellee\u2019s claim, covering \u201cfull amount due,\u201d \u2018was assigned to appellant. It is apparent that on the date of the decree below the parties had effected a compromise, and that therefore the ease became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-16\">The appeal must be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-17\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
