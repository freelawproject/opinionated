The material facts as summarized by the lower court are substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">As early as August 13, 1878, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor registered its trade-mark for baking powder and cream of tartar. This trade-mark consisted of a tiger\u2019s head with the word \u201cMonarch\u201d printed or engraved above the tiger\u2019s head in large white and enameled letters,, with the words \u201cBaking Powder\u201d in an angular scroll below the tiger\u2019s head. In 1883 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor registered the word \u201cMonarch\u201d similarly printed or engraved, which has been generally used in connection with the head of a lion as a trademark for canned goods and other preserved fruits. In 1886 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor registered the words \u201cMonarch Mills,\u201d printed in large white Gothic type above a lion\u2019s head for the products of its \u201cCoffee and Spice Mills.\u201d In 1922 plaintiff registered for practically all of its products, consisting of condiments, canned fruits, coffee, tea, canned meats, canned vegetables, flour, and divers cereals, another trade-mark. This last-mentioned trade-mark consisted of the word \u201cMonarch\u201d printed or engraved in a crescent shape in large black Gothic capitals above its usual lion\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">Defendant has never registered the word \u201cMonarch\u201d as a trade-mark, but uses this word now on packaged coffee and on coffee sold in sealed cans, printing or engraving the word on either side in black Gothic capitals, so that it appears to simulate fairly closely the word \u201cMonarch\u201d as used by the plaintiff. Defendant has never used either the lion\u2019s head nor the tiger\u2019s head as a part of this designation. Defendant\u2019s predecessors began business in 1853. In 1886 Henry Petring, one of the original organizers, died, and the business was then carried on by two of his sons, one of whom died in 1925, and the other retired from the defendant corporation some two years before the commencement of this action. The predecessors of defendant used the word \u201cMonarch\u201d to designate coffee sold by it and its predecessors as early as 1879. Defendant\u2019s predecessors sold in more than a dozen states, including the state of Missouri, large quantities of coffee branded \u201cMonarch\u201d on the containers as early as 1897\u00bb In 1907 defendant began to sell its roasted packaged coffee, contained in paper bags, cardboard cartons, and tin cans, extensively by mail, until at the time of the trial of this suit it had a very large business so carried on in many states.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">Defendant has never advertised extensively, if at all, while the plaintiff has spent, and is now spending, very large sums of money in advertising its well-known \u201cMonarch\u201d brand of foods, drinks, and condiments. At least since 1907, if ever, the defendant has not used the word \u201cMonarch\u201d to show the origin of its coffee, but since that time, of the twenty odd brands of coffee handled by it, only one was designated as its \u201cMonarch\u201d brand. It never used the word \u201cMonarch\u201d to designate any other of its goods or groceries, save and except coffee, and the word was used as a brand or grade mark, rather than \u2019as a trade-mark. Defendant\u2019s cans, paper packages, and cardboard cartons used for the coffee sold by it were of a different shape and color from those of the plaintiff. The printing, except as to the word \u201cMonarch,\u201d was also dissimilar in shape and color, and the word \u201cPetring\u2019s\u201d appeared on all of the defendant\u2019s packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">As early as 1925 numerous retailers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the defendant\u2019s packaged and canned \u201cMonarch\u201d brand of coffee, advertised it in the local papers as \u201cMonarch\u201d with no further identification, for the purpose of palming off a cheaper product for that of the established brand of coffee put out by the plaintiff, and they succeeded in palming off on their customers this cheaper \u201cMonarch\u201d coffee of the defendant for the dearer and higher grade product of the plaintiff. This the retail dealers were enabled to do by reason of the fact that the packages and containers of both plaintiff and defendant bore the word \u201cMonarch.\u201d Customers were deceived because of these advertisements which indicated that the coffee advertised was of the \u201cMonarch\u201d brand which had become widely known as the coffee put out by the plaintiff, and in the grocery trade generally, the word \u201cMonarch\u201d had come to mean the products or goods of Reid, Murdoch &amp; Co. This trade-mark had been used by plaintiff only on foods of a very high quality, which, under this trade-mark, had been widely advertised as such by the plaintiff at a very large expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">While buyers were misled by these acts of the retailers, the defendant did not directly connive with the retailers, except that it used the word \u201cMonarch\u201d as a brand mark for one of its brands of coffee. A careful examination and comparison of the respective containers of the defendant and plaintiff would disclose a dissimilarity, save for the use of the word \u201cMonarch\u201d on both classes of containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to the trade-mark in controversy, but was not entitled to relief in the suit because: (1) Defendant had not connived with the retail merchants, nor participated in the acts of unfair competition, and hence was not responsible therefor; and (2) that the plaintiff, by its laches, was estopped from now complaining of the defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cMonarch.\u201d These conclusions of the lower court are challenged by plaintiff on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">It appears that, while the defendant made some use of the word .\u201cMonarch\u201d in connection with its coffee, it was not a trademark use, but it was used as a grade mark to designate or identify one of its various grades of cheap coffee. Such use of the name would not entitle it to its use as a trademark. Touraine Co. v. Washburn &amp; Co., 52 App. D. C. 356, 286 F. 1020; Macmahan Pharmacal Co. v. Denver Chemical Co. (C. C. A.) 113 F. 468; N. K. Fairbank Co. v. Luekel, King &amp; Cake Soap Co. (C. C. A.) 102 F. 327. This, we understand, was the view of the lower court, but, notwithstanding this announced view, both of the parties seek to reargue the question here. We think the lower court was correct in so concluding, and we are of the view that the defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cMonarch\u201d was an infringement on plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark. Layton Pure Food Co. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co. (C. C. A.) 182 F. 24; Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg &amp; Bros. (C. C. A.) 25 F.(2d) 284, 287; Gordon\u2019s Dry Gin Co. v. Eddy &amp; Fisher Co. (D. C.) 246 F. 954; McDonald &amp; Morrison Mfg. Co. v. H. Mueller Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 183 F. 972, 974. As said by this court in Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg <em>&amp; </em>Bros., supra: \u201cThere may be infringement where the substantial and distinctive part of the trademark is copied or imitated. * * * Dissimilarity in size, form, and color of the label and place where it is applied are not conclusive against infringement. <em>n </em>Where a trade-mark contains a dominating or distinguishing word such as the word 'Queen\u2019 in the instant ease, and where the purchasing public has come to know and designate the article by such dominating word, the use of such word by another in marking similar goods may constitute infringement, although the latter mark, aside from such dominating word, may be dissimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">This court in McDonald &amp; Morrison Mfg. Co. v. H. Mueller Mfg. Co., supra, said: \u201cThe test is not whether, when goods are placed side by side, a difference can be recognized in the labels or marks'; but the test is, when such goods are not placed side by side, would an ordinarily. prudent purchaser be liable to purchase the one, believing that he was purchasing the other?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">It is, however, the contention of the defendant, and the lower court so held, that the plaintiff was not entitled to injunctive relief against it for unfair competition because it had not connived with the retail grocers in their acts of unfair competition. It is true the defendant had no direct part in these acts of\u2018unfair competition. The goods, however, as put out by it bore the name \u201cMonarch,\u201d and, while it is true the containers bore other distinguishing marks, yet the use of the word \u201cMonarch\u201d furnished the merchants with the means or tools of committing a fraud upon the public. The acts of these retail merchants might well have been anticipated by the defendant. These goods were supplied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>defendant for the purpose of being resold on the market, and the use of this word \u201cMon-' arch\u201d by it made it possible for the retail merchants to commit a fraud upon the public to the injury of the plaintiff. N. K. Fairbank Co. v. R. W. Bell Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 77 F. 869; Yon Murom v. Frash (C. C.) 56 F. 830; N. K. Fairbank Co. v. Luckel, King &amp; Cake Soap Co. (C. C. A.) 102 F. 327; Rice &amp; Hutchins v. Yera Shoe Co. (C. C. A.) 290 F. 124; Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. Vainer, 101 U. S. 51, 63, 25 L. Ed. 993; Chapelle v. Applebaum (D. C.) 254 F. 709; New England Awl &amp; Needle Co. v. Marlborough Co., 168 Mass. 154, 46 N. E. 386, 387, 60 Am. St. Rep. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Defendant\u2019s contention in the instant ease is effectively answered in the opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes in New England Awl <em>&amp; </em>Needle Co. v. Marlborough Co., supra, where it is said: \u201cThey knew that they were putting the power to do so into the retail dealers\u2019 hands. It hardly can be doubted that they contemplated that the wholesale dealer at whose request they put up their awls in this form, with full knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s prior use, would or might try to deceive the public, and whether they did or not is immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The same rule is announced in Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. David Trainer, supra, where it is said: \u201cNeither will the complainant be deprived of remedy in equity, even if it be shown by the respondent that all the persons who bought goods from him bearing the trade-mark of the real owner were well aware that they were not of the complainant\u2019s manufacture. If the goods were so supplied by the wrong-doer for the purpose of being resold in the market, the injury to the complainant is sufficient to entitle him to relief in equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We are of the view that the defendant must, therefore, be held responsible for these conceded acts of unfair competition, and plaintiff was entitled to injunetional relief, unless precluded by its laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">It remains to consider whether, as held by the lower court, the plaintiff was estopped from maintaining this suit by reason of \"its laches. The practice of the grocers in advertising defendant\u2019s coffee as \u201cMonarch\u201d did not come to the knowledge of the plaintiff until 1925, at which time it promptly gave notice of protest to the defendant. There was apparently some correspondence in 1901 and 1908 with reference to the use of this name by the defendant. The correspondence, however, does not indicate acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff in the use of its trademark, and the evidence indicates that the defendant abandoned the use of the word as a mark on the goods complained of at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\"> Violation of a trade-mark and unfair competition constitute a continuing wrong, and, while laches may be a ground for denying a right to recover damages, it will not ordinarily constitute a bar to an injunction for future infringement. There is no claim that the defendant, in carrying on its mail order business, has expended any money to build up a good will in the name which it claims is a grade mark. Any delay, therefore, on behalf of the plaintiff in asserting its exclusive right to the use of this name has not caused any injury to the defendant. The deception practiced by the retail grocers was not, it must be remembered, known to plaintiff until about 1925. This unfair competition threatens to be a continuing wrong against plaintiff\u2019s well-advertised trade-mark and good will. Under these circumstances, it cannot properly be held that plaintiff was guilty of such laches as to preclude its right to injunetional relief. Layton Pure Food Co. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co. (C. C. A.) 182 F. 24, 33; Layton Pure Food Co. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co. (C. C. A.) 182 F. 35, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 274; Moline Plow Co. v. Omaha Iron Store (C. C. A.) 235 F. 519, 525; Valvoline Oil Co. v. Havoline Oil Co. (D. C.) 211 F. 189; Edward <em>&amp; </em>John Burke v. Bishop (C. C.) 175 F. 167; Beattie Mfg. Co. v. Smith et al. (C. C. A.) 275 F. 164; Dr. Peter H. Fahrney <em>&amp; </em>Sons Co. v. Ruminer et al. (C. C. A.) 153 F. 735, 737; N. K. Fairbank Co. v. Luckel, King &amp; Cake Soap Co. (C. C. A.) 116 F. 332; Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U. S. 42, 21 S. Ct. 16, 45 L. Ed. 77; McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 24 L. Ed. 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">This court in Layton Pure Food Co. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., supra, said: \u201cThe owner of a trade-mark is not chargeable with laches for failure to prosecute an infringer before he knows or has such notice as would lead an ordinarily prudent person to inquire and learn the existence of the infringement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">In Moline Plow Co. v. Omaha Iron Store Co., supra, this court again said: \u201cThe record contains no substantial evidence of an abandonment of its rights by the Moline Company, and constant of continuing trespasses neither deprive the victim of his equitable right to an injunction against their con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>tinuanee in the future, nor confer upon the trespasser any right to perpetuate them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">TVhat is said by this court in Layton Pure Pood Co. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., supra, is here apposite. It is there said: \u201cThe complainant is the owner of a trade-mark for baking soda and baking powder consisting of this picture of a cow and this is valuable property. It is entitled to be protected in the exclusive use of this property. Every sale under this trade-mark of a package of baking powder manufactured by another is an infringement of the complainant\u2019s right and a trespass upon its property. While the delay of the complainant and its apparent acquiescence in past trespasses may make it inequitable to compel the defendant to account' for the profit it derived from them, they confer upon it no right either at law or in equity to continue them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">It has been said by the Supreme Court in McLean v. Fleming, that even \u201cinexcusable laches in seeking redress was no defense against that 'part of the prayer of the bill that sought to restrain an infringement in the future.\u201d Dr. Peter H. Eah-mey &amp;' Sons Co. v. Ruminer, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The lower court was of the view that its holding that the plaintiff should be precluded by reason of its laches found support in Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., supra, but in that ease the court said: \u201cWe think that an injunction should issue against all these defendants, but that, as the Siegel-Cooper Company appears to have acted in good faith, and the sales of the others were small, they should not be required to account for gains and profits. The fact that the Siegel-Cooper Company acted innocently <em>does not exonerate it from the charge of infringement.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In the instant ease the lower court might very properly have denied the plaintiff\u2019s prayer for an accounting or for damages, but we are of the view that the court was in error in denying the plaintiff injunetional relief. The judgment is, therefore, reversed, and the cause remanded, for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b845-8\">STONE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"At4H\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">I feel compelled to dissent upon the ground of the laches of appellant. This was the basis of the determination of the trial court. That determination well expressed the situation in an opinion which seems sound to me and which makes repetition here unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
