Pursuant to the verdict of the jury the court announced sentence: \u201cThat the said defendant be imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, in the State of Washington, for the period of three (3) years on count four, said term of imprisonment to date from his delivery to the warden of said penitentiary; that said defendant be fined in the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) on count four; that he be fined the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.-00) on count three, and that he be fined the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) on count five; that in default'of payment thereof he stand committed to said penitentiary\u00bb until said fines are paid or he is otherwise discharged by law, said commitment in default of payment of said fines to. run concurrently with each other and to date from the expiration of the term of imprisonment imposed under said count four.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-28\">On the following day, April 11, 1930, as shown by the minutes of the trial court, the defendant being present with his counsel, this judgment was vacated and the following judgment entered: \u201cThat said defendant be imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, in the State'of Washington, for the period of three (3) years on count three; said term of imprisonment to date from his delivery to the warden of said penitentiary; that said defendant be fined the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) on count three; that he be fined the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on count four; that he be fined the sum of one thousand dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>lars ($1,000.00) on count five; that in default of payment thereof he' stands committed to ' said penitentiary until said fines are paid or he is otherwise discharged by law, said commitment in default of payment of said fines to run concurrently with each other andi to date from the expiration of the term of imprisonment imposed under said count three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The record contains a \u201cproposed bill of exceptions\u201d which evidently was not presented to the judge of the trial court for his approval, as required by law and by the rules of court. In any event, it is not signed and properly authenticated, and therefore cannot be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Counsel for the defendant relies upon and argues four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cI. That the court erred in denying or ignoring the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search and seizure by said federal prohibition agents, which evidence was used at the trial of said defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201cII. That the court erred in demanding of the defendant that he produce a certain affidavit, the contents of which were highly prejudicial to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201cIII. That the argument of counsel for the Government and the comment of the court during the course of the trial were highly prejudicial to the defendant. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201cIV. That the court erred in denying the motion in arrest of judgment macle by the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Assignment I relates to the ruling of the court on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence obtained during the search of defendant\u2019s residence by federal prohibition officers. In the absence of the bill of exceptions this ruling is not open for review. In the case of Doran v. United States, 31 F. (2d) 754, 755, Judge Dietrich, speaking for this court' said: \u201cA motion seasonably made for the suppression of part of the evidence, on .the ground that it was obtained through an unlawful search, was heard upon affidavits and oral testimony prior to the trial, and denied. ' The testimony so adduced is not brought here by bill of exceptions or otherwise, and the order is therefore not open for review.\u201d See, also, Beach v. United States, 35 F.(2d) 837 (C. C. A. 9th); Lockhart v. United States, 35 F.(2d) 905 (C. C. A. 9th); Sapp v. United States (C. C. A.) 35 F.(2d) 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Assignments II and III relate to alleged errors of the court, and counsel for the government during the course of the trial. For the reasons just stated these assignments are likewise not open for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">Assignment IV relates to the ruling of the court on defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, and is the only one properly before us for review. .As above stated, upon the return of the verdict the court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island in the state of Washington for a- period of three years and imposed a fine of $3,000 on count 4 of the indictment. This sentence was urn-authorized both as to the term and place of imprisonment. Count 4 of the indictment charges the defendant merely with a misdemeanor, namely, the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, and the court in imposing the Sentence undoubtedly was laboring under the impression that count 4 was the count charging the sale of intoxicating liquor. On-the following day and during the same term of court the court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, vacated the judgment and sentence and imposed the same judgment and sentence under count 3, the sales count, and at the same time imposed a fine of $500 under count 4, the possession count. Counsel for the defendant contends that \u201cthe above sentences were legal tho the one was excessive, to-wit: the sentence on the fourth (4th) count, but it has been held that where a sentence is excessive it does not render the judgment void except, as to the excess,\u201d and he argues that, as to the excess, defendant\u2019s sentence should be modified by this court. We agree with counsel that all of the sentences were legal, except the sentences under count 4. It is true that this sentence is merely excessive in so far as the amount of the fine is concerned, but it is void in other respects. It must be remembered that the fourth count charged the defendant with the commission of a misdemeanor, and that upon conviction thereof the court sentenced him to pay a fine and to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for the term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">A misdemeanor is an offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. 35 Stat. 1152, 18 USCA \u00a7 541. There is, consequently, no escape from the conclusion that the judgment of the court sentencing the defendant to imprisonment in the penitentiary was in violation of 'the statutes of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">\u201cThe court below was without jurisdiction to pass any such sentences, and the orders directing the sentences of imprisonment to&gt; be executed in a penitentiary are void. This is not a case of mere error, but one in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the court below transcended its powers. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 176 [21 L. Ed. 872]; Ex parte Parks, 93 U. S. 18, 23 [23 L. Ed. 787]; Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 343 [25 L. Ed. 676]; Ex parte Rowland, 104 U. S. 604, 612 [26 L. Ed. 861]; In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 738, 8 S. Ct. 1263 [32 L. Ed. 274]; Hans Nielsen, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 176,182, 9 S. Ct. 672 [33 L. Ed. 118].\u201d In re Mills, 135 U. S. 263, 270, 10 S. Ct. 762, 764, 34 L. Ed. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The Supreme Court in speaking of the penitentiary sentence said: \u201cThat is a sentence which can only be imposed- where it is specifically prescribed, or where the imprisonment ordered is for a period longer than one year, or at hard labor.\u201d In re Bonner, 151 U. S. 242, 254,14 S. Ct. 323, 324, 38 L. Ed. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The National Prohibition Act (c. 85, Title 2, \u00a7 29, 41 Stat. 316, 27 USCA \u00a7 46) prescribes the punishment for the first offense of the crime of possessing intoxicating liquor a fine not exceeding $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201cIt follows that the court had no jurisdiction to order an imprisonment, when the place is not specified in the law, to be executed in a, penitentiary, when the imprisonment is not ordered for a period longer than one year, or at hard labor. The statute is equivalent to a direct denial of any authority on the part of the court to direct that imprisonment be executed in a penitentiary in any cases, \u25a0other than those specified.\u201d In re Bonner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In the same ease the court quotes from In re Mills, 135 U. S. 263, 10 S. Ct. 762, 34 L. Ed. 107, as follows: \u201c \u2018A sentence simply of' \u201cimprisonment,\u201d \u2019 said the court, \u2018in the case of a person convicted of an offense against the United States, where the statute prescribing the punishment does not require that the accused shall be confined in a penitentiary, cannot be executed by confinement * * * \u201cfor a period longer than one year.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">It will thus be seen that the trial court in the instant case was without jurisdiction to sentence defendant to imprisonment in the penitentiary under the fourth count of the indictment. See, also, Ex Parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L. Ed. 872. The court being without jurisdiction to impose a penitentiary sentence in the first instance, it was within its power and jurisdiction during the same term to vacate the sentence and impose a valid one, especially in view of the fact that the judgment specifies that the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment dates from his delivery to the warden of the penitentiary, and that no part of the sentence had been executed. The Supreme Court in the ease of Goddard v. Ordway, 101 U. S. 745, 752, 25 L. Ed. 1040, said: \u201cIn Ex parte Lange (18 Wall. 163, [21 L. Ed. 872]), we said that \u2018the general power of the court over its own judgments, orders, and decrees, in both civil and criminal cases, during the existence of the term at which they are first made, is undeniable.\u2019 Bassett v. United States, 9 Wall. 38 [ 19 L. Ed. 548]; Doss v. Tyack, 14 How. 297 [14 L. Ed. 428]. As part of the \u2018roll of that term,\u2019 they are deemed to be \u2018in the breast of the court during the\u2018whole term.\u2019 Bac. Abr., tit. Amendment and Jeofail, A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">\u201cAs a general practice, the sentence, when imposed by a court of record, is within the power of the court during the session in which it is entered, and may be amended at any time during such session, provided a punishment already partly suffered be not increased.\u201d Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice (9th Ed.) \u00a7 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">\u201cA sentence * * * \u00bfloes not commence until the person sentenced is taken to the prison.\u201d Dimmick v. Tompkins, 194 U. S. 540, 24 S. Ct. 780, 48 L. Ed. 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">In the instant ease, at the time the defendant was resentenced he had not begun the service of his original sentence, and therefore no question of jeopardy or double punishment is here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
