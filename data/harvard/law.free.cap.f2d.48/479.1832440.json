The third count charged him with unlawfully having in his possession 362 gallons of whisky for beverage purposes; the venue being laid in Lamb county, Tex., which it was alleged was in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas. The fourth count charged .appellant with maintaining a common nuisance. According to the evidence for the government, appellant\u2019s son, on April 22, 1930, sold at one time to two purchasers two half-gallon jars of liquor which were taken out of the cellar of appellant\u2019s home. One of the purchasers w.as a Texas State Ranger, who returned with a search warrant on April 25, and, upon a search of the cellar, found and seized the quantity of liquor described in the third count of the indictment. The whole 362 gallons were concealed behind a false wall, the secret door to which was electrically locked, and at the time of the seizure were acknowledged by appellant to he his property. The defense to the charge of unlawful possession was that the liquor had been put in appellant\u2019s cellar during his absence from home and without his knowledge or consent. In support of this claim, the sheriff\u2019s son was called as a witness, and testified that on April 24 appellant came to the home of the sheriff, who was absent at the time, and reported to his mother, the sheriff\u2019s wife, that there was some whisky at his (.appellant\u2019s) house. Appellant offered to prove by this witness that he said he objected to having \u2022the whisky left on his premises, and wanted the sheriff to come and get.it, hut the court refused to let in that part of the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">A variance is claimed because it is said the indictment charged appellant with the unlawful possession of liquor in the Amarillo division, whereas the possession proved was in the Lubbock division. The indictment also charged that the offense was committed in Lamb county, Tex., which we take judicial notice is in the Lubbock division. 28 USCA \u00a7 189a. The inadvertent, erroneous allegation that Lamb county is in the Amarillo division is not descriptive of the offense, and is therefore to he treated as surplusage. 2 Bishop\u2019s Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Appellant was permitted to prove that he reported to the sheriff\u2019s wife the fact that there was liquor on his premises as indicating a consciousness of innocence. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 174, 293. There was no error in refusing to allow him to go further and prove the self-serving declaration that he did not want the liquor on his premises, but desired the sheriff to come and get it. It is argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under the fourth count for maintaining a nuisance; but the sufficiency of the evidence under this count was not raised at the trial, and therefore is not properly presented for consideration here. We are of opinion, however, that there was evidence enough to prove the maintenance of a nuisance when it is considered that the two sales proved were made from a large supply of liquor which the jury were authorized to find appellant was keeping in his cellar for sale. Lewinsohn v. United States (C. C. A.) 278 F. 421; Denapolis v. United States (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">It is also complained that the court failed to give a charge on the law of circumstantial evidence. The case did not depend entirely on evidence of this character, since there was direct evidence of the admission by appellant that the liquor found in the cellar belonged to him. It is not error to refuse to charge a jury upon the insufficiency of a part of the testimony. Blanton v. United States (C. C. A.) 213 F. 320, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1238; 16 C. J. 1008. Besides, there was no request for a specific instruction on the law of circumstantial evidence; hence the court cannot he put in error for failing to give an instruction on that subject of its own motion. Gilmore v. United States (C. C. A.) 39 F.(2d) 897. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>charges as were requested upon the weight of the evidence were in substance given by the court in its general charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
