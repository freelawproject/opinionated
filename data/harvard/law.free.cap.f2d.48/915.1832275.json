The combination with a reciprocating pump having power and water ends connected together by a cradle, of one or more tie rods secured to the power and water ends, and connecting .the same together for relieving the cradle of undue strain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">The references are:</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">Halsey, 295,000, March 11, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">Worthen, 314,161, March 17, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">The application relates to tie rods for pumps. The Board of Appeals in its deei.sion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-22\">\u201cOrdinarily the power and water ends of a steam power pump are spaced apart by a casting known as a cradle bolted at its ends to the adjacent ends of the power and water ends. Applicant asserts that in practice the jarring of the reciprocating mechanism of the pump causes the cast metal of the cradle to crystallize and fracture, necessitating .disuse of the pump until a new cradle can be obtained to replace the broken part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-23\">\u201cTo obviate fracture due to crystallization and tensile strains applicant has initially strengthened the pump by adding longitudinally perforated lugs to the power and water parts and has tied these parts and the intervening cradle together by tie rods or bolts passed through the perforated lugs. The parts are held securely together by nuts on the screw threaded ends of the tie rods bearing against the lugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-24\">The reference Worthen does not show a cast cradle, but does show tie rods, bosses and nuts on the tie rods, the whole connecting the power and water ends of a pump. The patentee states in his specification that he employs a number of such rods, usually-three, to produce a cradle of small size. In other words, his device is not a reinforcement of a cradle, but the rods themselves form the cradle.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-25\">The patent to Halsey relates to a steam rock drill, and figure 1 of the drawing shows a tie rod with a nut on one end thereof to hold the parts together.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-26\">The Board of Appeals in its decision said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agl\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * The use of tie rods to secure parts against separation due to tensile strains occurs in every day practice as in rock drilling machines where the heads of the cylinder are held together with the body of the cylinder by tie rods or bolts. An example of such practice is shown in the patent to Halsey, No. 295,000, March 11,1884.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-27\">\u201cIn the patent to Worthen, cited by the examiner, the tie rods D have their ends reduced in diameter and sereAv-threaded to pass through the perforated lugs extending from the adjacent heads of the power and water parts of the pump. The tie rods D serve the same purpose as applicant\u2019s cradle and tie rods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-28\">\u201cWe agree with the examiner that to employ the usual cradle with what is shoAvn in Worthen would not be patentable and furthermore the addition of strengthening tie rods to an old construction where needed would not involve invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-29\">We agree Avith the conclusion reached by the Board of Appeals. Assuming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Worthen reference is not a direct anticipation of appellant\u2019s device, we think that appellant\u2019s tie rods are merely a reinforcing device which, in view of the prior art, is an obvious use and does not involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">There are numerous authorities to the effect that ordinarily the application of reinforcing devices to a structure does not involve invention. Crouch v. Roemer, 103 U. S. 797, 26 L. Ed. 426; Parson Mfg. Co. v. Coe (C. C. A.) 185 F. 522; Turner v. Lauter Piano Co. (C. C. A.) 248 F. 930, 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">There are three affidavits found in the record pertaining to commercial success of appellant\u2019s device. One of such affidavits was filed in the Patent Office after the decision by the Board of Appeals, and after appellant had filed with the Commissioner of Patents a notice of appeal to this court. If otherwise relevant, said last-named affidavit could not be considered by us for the reasons stated in the case of In re Fisher, 37 F.(2d) 628,17 C. C. P. A. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">As to the other affidavits, the rule is well established that only where there is doubt as to want of patentability can evidence of commercial success be considered. In re Husted, 39 F.(2d) 713,17 C. C. P. A. 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In the case at bar, we have no doubt of the lack of patentability of appellant\u2019s device, hence evidence of commercial success cannot be considered by us as affecting such \u25a0question of patentability.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
