The petition was dismissed by the Examiner of Interferences, and his decision, was affirmed by the Commissioner of Patents, and from the latter\u2019s decision this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-25\">The Hammermill Paper Company of Erie, Pa., hereafter called Hammermill, on March 31, 1925, registered the trade-mark \u201cLuna\u201d for bond writing paper. The date of the first use of this trade-mark of the registrant in interstate commerce was in February, 1924, and ever since that date Hammer-mill has shipped large and increasing quantities of bond writing paper bearing the trademark \u201cLuna Bond, Made in H. S. A.,\u201d into various states and into many different countries of the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-26\">In December, 1924, appellant, J. P. Heilbronn Company, hereafter known as Heilbronn, placed upon the market-in competition with Hammermill tits own bond writing paper bearing the trade-mark \u201cLuna Bond\u201d; the words being printed in the same style as that of Hammermill, and accompanied by a crescent or half-moon, with the outline of a face in the hollow of the crescent.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-27\">The Oregon Pulp <em>&amp; </em>Paper Company, of the state of Oregon, was the manufacturer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>the paper for Heilbronn. When Hammer-mill objected to the said paper company manufacturing the paper, Heilbronn gave the paper company an indemnity bond, and then proceeded to petition for cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Heilbronn\u2019s first ground for cancellation is based upon the fact that, prior to the use of the word \u201cLuna\u201d by Hammermill, appellant had us\u00e9d, upon other kinds of paper such as pads, wrappers, booklets, etc., a trade-mark which was described by the Commissioner in his decision as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-5\">\u201c * * * The representation of a crescent within the concave portion of which appears a representation of a man\u2019s face, and a representation of a five-pointed star enclosing the letter \u201cH\u201d appears hung or suspended from the upper horn of the moon crescent. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Heilbronn\u2019s position is that, since that symbol includes1 the crescent, and since it claims that \u201cLuna\u201d is the Spanish word for moon, the use of the Hammermill trade-mark \u201cLuna\u201d will lead to confusion and to the damage of Heilbronn; that, since \u201cLuna\u201d means moon in Spanish, appellee\u2019s mark \u201cLima\u201d in Spanish countries will be Confused by the paper purchasing public with appellant\u2019s so-called crescent mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">'Appellant further contends that appellee has not shown \u201cclean hands\u201d as based upon facts which will be briefly stated: American Paper Exports, Inc., was the selling agency for Hammermill, and S. Allen Presby was the agent and customer of said American Paper Exports, Inc., in the Philippine Islands. In 1924, when a shipment of Hammermill\u2019s \u201cLuna\u201d goods, shipped by American Paper Exports, Inc., arrived in the Philippines, Heilbronn brought suit against Presby and another for injunction and damages, basing its suit on Heilbronn\u2019s Philippine registered trade-mark, which mark consisted of the crescent and the star inclosing the letter \u201cH.\u201d In settlement of the suit, it was agreed that Presby would not import paper bearing the \u201cLuna\u201d trade-mark into the Philippines, and that the mark \u201cLuna\u201d or \u201cLuna Bond,\u201d in the Philippines, was owned by Heilbronn.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">This evidence was evidently offered bn the theory that it amounted to an admission by Hammermill that, by the1 use of its trademark \u201cLuna,\u201d it was infringing appellant\u2019s mark. It is nowhere shown that the parties to the contract had any authority to contract with reference to appellee\u2019s trade-mark rights, and we <em>regard </em>it of no importance in the determination of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">The record shows that appellee sold its goods in Cuba prior to 'any sale of the same being made in the Philippines, and that the word \u201cLuna\u201d is the name of a party in Cuba v\u00bfho ordered some of appellee\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">The word \u201cLuna,\u201d both in the English and Spanish languages, has reference to the moon. Appellant states that \u201cLuna\u201d means moon; that it means a moon goddess, and that \u201cLunar\u201d is defined as \u201cpertaining to or resembling the Moon, orbed or crescent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">Appellant argues that, under a long line of decisions, which it cites, the use of a word has the same effect as the use of a picture, if the word means the same as the picture. One of the leading cases on this subject is In re Maclin-Zimmer-McGill Tobacco Co., Inc., 49 App. D. C. 181, 262 E. 635, where it was held that the right to employ a symbol necessarily included the right to employ the word. Another ease cited is G. Sindenberg and Co. v. <em>W. </em>H. Childs and Son, 146 M. D. 345, 15 T. M. Rep. 237, where the word \u201cCapitol\u201d was refused registration by reason of the registered trade-mark consisting of a picture of the Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">The difficulty with appellant\u2019s contention in this regard is that his trade-mark does not consist of a moon. It does not purport to be the representation of a moon. A portion of it may be said to be a crescent or part of a moon with a grotesque face, accompanied by a star hanging to the upper horn, in which star is the letter \u201cH.\u201d There is no evidence of consequence in the record that appellant ever used the word \u201cmoon\u201d or the picture of a moon or the word \u201cLuna\u201d in connection with the sale of its goods prior to appellee\u2019s use of the word \u201cLuna.\u201d Conceding that appellant had the right to the exclusive use of the trade-mark used by it prior to the date of appellee\u2019s use of its \u201cLuna\u201d mark, appellee had the right to register its mark, and appellant\u2019s cancellation proceeding must fail if it is not likely that confusion will result from the concurrent use of both marks on goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">Appellant\u2019s mark, which was used prior to appellee\u2019s use of its \u201cLuna\u201d mark, we think was used1 upon goods of the same descriptive properties as those of appellee, yet it is conceded that they were not exactly the same kind of goods. The marks being neither similar in appearance nor sound, we do not believe there is now, or was on the date appellee registered its mark, any likelihood of confusion arising from the concurrent use of both marks. The <em>record as </em>a whole shows no actual confusion or circumstances and facts which would indicate likelihood of eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>fusion. The right of appellee to use in connection with its mark a picture or a representation of a moon or any part of the same or to characterize its goods as moon goods either here or in Latin countries is not before us. Its registration is for the use of the word \u201cLuna\u201d on bond writing paper, and we are unable to see how appellant could be damaged in the use of its combination mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">We agree with the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, and the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
