Said mark was registered on March 1, 1916, under the ten-year exclusive use provision of the Trade-Mark Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-27\">The Gilbert Company, appellant, applicant, is a firm composed of J. H. McGill and Gilbert B. Mustin, and it is claimed that the origin of the word \u201cGilberts,\u201d which appellant seeks to register, is formed by a combination of part of the surname of J. H. McGill and the Christian name of Gilbert B. Mustin. The Gilbert Company shows use, since May, 1926, of the trade-mark \u201cGilberts\u201d in script, almost identical with that of appellee, upon medicated chewing gum. The mark of appellant, which it seeks to register, contains the name \u201cGilberts,\u201d as above indicated, as its most pronounced feature, accompanied by . the words \u201cSoda Mint Gum\u201d and a small triangle, all placed in a rectangular black background. The words \u201cSoda Mint Gum\u201d are disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-28\">The examiner of interferences dismissed the opposition on the ground that candy and chewing gum were not goods of the same descriptive properties. The commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>reversed this finding of the examiner of interferences and held that the goods were of the same descriptive properties, and that the marks were almost identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Appellant insists that its goods are in the nature of a medical preparation and that there would be no likelihood of confusion between a medicated chewing gum and chocolates.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The record establishes clearly that the chocolates of appellee, of more than eighteen different varieties and of very high grade, are sold in drug stores, candy stores, cigar stores, hotels, department stores, clubs, and various other places; that the said \u201cGilberts\u201d chocolates are well and favorably known in such places of business; that chewing gum is displayed and sold in the same places of business as chocolates; and that the goods are usually displayed side by side.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">We think chewing gum such as appellant manufactures and sells is merchandise of the same descriptive properties as chocolate candies.

Lawrenceburg Roller Mills Co., 40 F.(2d) 119; 17 C. C. P. A. 1093; Cluett, Peabody <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Hartogensis, 41 F.(2d) 94, 17 C. C. P. A. 1166; Skookum Packers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pacific Northwestern Canning Co., 45 F. (2d) 912, 18 C. C. P. A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cGilberts\u201d is taken from the name of the owner or founder of the company. Since it is in script and is registered under the ten-year exclusive use clause of the act, the right to the ownership and use of such a trade-mark is not seriously questioned here. See Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids and Davids, 233 U. S. 461, 34 S. Ct. 648, 58 L. Ed. 1046; J. B. Williams Co. v. Williams, 48 F.(2d) 398, 18 C. C. P. A. -. Appellant\u2019s claim of right to use the word \u201cGilberts\u201d does not involve the question of the right of a party to use his own name in the sale of his goods. It is not claimed that the word \u201cGilberts\u201d of appellant is the name of the manufacturer or seller of the goods, except as above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">We think, since the goods are of the same descriptive properties, and the trademarks are 'practically identical, that confusion would result within the meaning of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20,1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85) and that registration of appellant\u2019s mark should not be granted, and that the Commissioner of Patents properly denied registration, and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
