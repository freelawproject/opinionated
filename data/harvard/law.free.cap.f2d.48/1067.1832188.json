This appeal was then taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-20\">In this court the appellee concedes that the issue herein is on all fours with that decided by us on June 2, 1930, in the appeal of Hines v. United States ex rel. Livingston, 59 App. D. C. 363, 42 F.(2d) 347, and that the decision rendered in that case governs the present appeal, if it is to be adhered to. It is also conceded that in such event the contention of appellee herein must be overruled and the judgment of the lower court be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-21\">Upon a. consideration of our decision in the Livingston Case, wherein certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court at its October term, 1930, 51 S. Ct. 35, 75 L. Ed.-, and in conformity with the important rule of stare decisis, we enter a similar decision in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-24\">The judgment of the lower court is accordingly reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings not insistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
