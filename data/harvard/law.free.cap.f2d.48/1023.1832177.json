Walters, 59 App. D. C. 237, 38 F.(2d) 942, we ruled that, under the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 654), validating payments for commutation of quarters, heat, and light, and of rental allowances on account of dependents, the Comptroller General is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether pay of a naval officer, withheld prior to July 1, 1923, on account of allowances for dependent mother, should he refunded. We further ruled that, where a statute vests discretion in an executive officer, the exercise of that discretion, unless arbitrary or capricious, is not subject to control by mandamus or mandatory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-24\">The facts in the present case are substantially similar to those in the Walters Case. For reasons stated in the opinion in that case, the decree in this case must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-25\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
