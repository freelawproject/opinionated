As he drove by, however, it looked like it was getting excessive because one of the men was down on the ground and the others were hitting him. Bid looked in his rearview mirror and saw the two men viciously punching and kicking the man on the ground. One man was at the victim\u2019s feet and was kicking him in the lower body and crotch. The other man was at the victim\u2019s head, \u201cdoing more of the beating on the head\u201d and \u201creally working on him.\u201d The men were kicking the victim and appeared to be enjoying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Bid made a U-tum and drove back. The victim was not moving, appeared to be \u201cout cold,\u201d and the two men were hitting and kicking him around like a \u201crag doll.\u201d It was \u201cpretty brutal\u201d and they were \u201cgiving it all they had.\u201d The attack was not constant; the men would step back, then kick and hit the victim again. Bid gunned his engine and when the men saw that Bid was going to stop his truck, they took off running. Bid did not get a good look at their faces, but one man, who was wearing a baseball cap, had a look of defiance.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Bid called 9-1-1 and told the dispatcher that the victim, later identified as Jacques Harpst, was \u201chaving a hard time breathing,\u201d was \u201cgurgling,\u201d and was \u201cnot responsive.\u201d Harpst\u2019s pockets were pulled out and Bid thought the two men \u201cmight have rolled him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Officer Jack Hatton responded to the scene. Harpst was bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose, and both of his eyes were swollen to the size of golf balls. Harpst made gurgling sounds as he tried to breathe. Hatton suspected defendant, who lived a block away, was involved. A subsequent investigation proved that his suspicions were correct, and that defendant\u2019s accomplice was Michael Romero.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Harpst, age 48, did not recall the beating but remembered waking up in the hospital and being there for several months. Harpst was in the neurosurgery intensive care unit at UC Davis Medical Center. According to his brother Michael, Harpst was not \u201cconscious\u201d when. Michael first came to visit him in the hospital, and Harpst had tubes down his throat. Michael remembered Harpst becoming \u201cconscious\u201d a couple .of weeks after the attack, when Harpst began moving his eyes and arms and began fighting to get out of his restraints. According to Michael, the beating altered Harpst\u2019s memory, hearing, sense of smell and ability to use a computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Dr. David Shatz, a trauma surgeon, was one of the health care providers who treated Harpst. A trauma surgeon takes care of the most severely injured patients, and when certain criteria are met, paramedics take a patient directly to a trauma center rather than a standard emergency room. Dr. Shatz saw Harpst when he first arrived, and based on a review of Harpst\u2019s medical charts, Dr. Shatz testified that Harpst had facial fractures and \u201ca depressed mental status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Dr. Shatz described the Glasgow Coma Scale, which physicians use to grade degrees of brain impairment. The Glasgow Coma Scale takes into account three aspects: the ability to move, the ability to speak, and the ability to move one\u2019s eyes around. The worst score a person can have is one point in each of the three categories, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of three. A person with a score of three is \u201ctotally comatose.\u201d According to Dr. Shatz, a dead body would have a score of three. The best possible score, the score for a normal healthy person, is a score of 15. A drunk person would likely score a 14. A score of eight means the brain is severely injured and the person cannot protect his or her airway from aspirating vomit.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Dr. Shatz said Harpst scored a nine on the Glasgow Coma Scale, which reflected a severe brain injury. Because of the severe injury, doctors opted to intubate him to protect his airway. When the prosecutor asked Dr. Shatz if it was fair to say in layman\u2019s terms that Harpst was comatose, the doctor replied, \u201cI will stick with the scale.\u201d Harpst remained on a ventilator for a few days, and was in the intensive care unit for a month. Dr. Shatz testified that Harpst was \u201cconscious\u201d during the month he was in the intensive care unit, but Harpst was unable to push the nursing button for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Detective Warren Estrada interviewed defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Vanessa Ramos, and a recording of the interview was played for the jury. Ramos also testified at trial, although she was less forthcoming than in her interview with Estrada. Ramos identified Romero as the man who was with defendant when Harpst was beaten. She stated that defendant had been a member of the Red Nose Pittz, a Norte\u00f1o gang, for a number of years. The Red Nose Pittz liked to jump people. In fact, defendant\u2019s brother was locked up for assaulting a light-rail inspector. Ramos stated the gang will beat up whoever \u201ctalks shit to [thjem\u201d or happens to walk by when the gang members are drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">On the night in question, Ramos was with defendant, Romero and Erica Raya at Raya\u2019s apartment. Defendant was wearing a cap and a white jacket, and Romero had on a dark jacket. Defendant and Romero walked to Del Taco and returned about 1:00 a.m. They all sat around talking and then the two men left to \u201cbum a cigarette\u201d off someone. Defendant and Romero returned around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. Romero was out of breath and immediately went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>into the bathroom because he had blood on his hands. He also had a tooth in his fist; Romero removed the tooth and put it in his wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Defendant told Ramos he asked a guy walking by for a cigarette and the guy \u201cflipped out.\u201d Romero said he ran up to the guy because he thought the guy was going to hit defendant. Ramos asked if defendant hit the guy, and defendant said \u201cno,\u201d but then said \u201cyes.\u201d Defendant said Romero kept hitting the guy. According to Ramos, Romero appeared \u201cfucking happy that he hit the guy or something.\u201d Ramos also said defendant told her he wanted a cigarette, but then wanted to see if the guy had any money. She told him it was \u201chella stupid\u201d to rob people. Defendant asked Ramos to check if he had blood on his white jacket but she did not see any.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">According to Raya, when defendant and Romero returned to her apartment they said they had beaten a guy who reacted badly when defendant asked for a cigarette. They all spent the night at Raya\u2019s place, and later on that morning she heard defendant say they beat up the guy and robbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Detective Estrada interviewed defendant in February 2009, and a redacted recording of the interview was played for the jury. Initially, defendant denied hitting Harpst. But defendant eventually said he hit Harpst\u2019s neck or face once at the beginning of the altercation, and that Romero did most of the fighting. Defendant thought Romero probably believed Harpst was disrespecting him when Harpst \u201cflipped out\u201d about their request for a cigarette and then threw one at defendant. When Detective Estrada asked what defendant would do if someone disrespected him in front of his \u201chomeboys,\u201d defendant said, \u201cYou disrespect them back.\u201d Defendant said rumors were going around about the fight, and people said the victim was dead or brain-dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Officer Anthony Herrera also interviewed defendant. Defendant told Officer Herrera the altercation started because the victim disrespected defendant by throwing cigarettes at him. Defendant said he hit Harpst a few times, but mainly in the leg area. According to defendant, Romero stomped on Harpst\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Officer Herrera\u2019s main focus during the interview was on defendant\u2019s gang activity. Defendant belonged to the Red Nose Pittz and his gang friends called him Ryda because he was willing \u201cto ride for the gang,\u201d which meant to commit crimes for them. Defendant admitted that he and other gang members would beat up and rob people; it was part of being in the gang. During one of defendant\u2019s previous contacts with Officer Herrera, he told Officer Herrera they committed crimes to show the Broderick Boys that the Red Nose Pittz were worthy of being Norte\u00f1os in the Broderick area, and because they were tired of getting beaten up by the Broderick Boys. The Broderick Boys were the predominant gang in the West Sacramento area.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Officer Michael Duggins testified as a gang expert regarding Norte\u00f1os in general, and the Red Nose Pittz in particular. The Norte\u00f1os\u2019 principal activities are assault with great bodily injury, murder and robbery. The Red Nose Pittz and the Broderick Boys are both Norte\u00f1o subsets, and their rivals are the Sure\u00f1os. The Red Nose Pittz are from Citrus Heights, while the Broderick Boys\u2019 territory is West Sacramento. According to Officer Duggins, both defendant and Romero were active members of the Red Nose Pittz.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Officer Duggins said that to get into a gang, it is not enough to associate with gang members; one has to engage in criminal activity that will benefit the gang. The use of force or fear creates respect with gang members. Gang members typically use monikers. A common one is Ryda, which means you are willing to ride along with the gang to party or commit crimes with them. Officer Duggins reviewed various photographs of defendant, Romero and other gang members throwing gang signs and wearing gang colors, and explained how they indicated their gang involvement. Officer Duggins had prior contacts with defendant in which defendant admitted he was a gang member.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Officer Duggins opined that the beating and robbery of Harpst was committed in furtherance of the gang because (1) the gang member and gang gained a material b\u00e9nefit from whatever was taken from the victim and (2) the gang member and gang achieved an increase in status. According to Officer Duggins, the crime increased defendant\u2019s status in the gang, and elevated the gang\u2019s status in the community via word of mouth. Officer Duggins testified that when he and fellow law enforcement officers were investigating the assault, many people had heard about the crime. Defendant and Romero were well-known gang members and these offenses elevated the gang\u2019s status. Ramos, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, told Officer Duggins that defendant had participated with other gang members in assaulting and robbing people to gain the gang\u2019s respect, and that they would brag about their escapades \u201cto show that they had put in work for the gang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">I-III</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support the great bodily injury enhancement because there is no substantial evidence that the victim became comatose due to brain injury, as required by section 12022.7, subdivision (b). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Section 12022.7, subdivision (b) states: \u201cAny person who personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice in the commission of a felony or attempted felony <em>which causes the victim to become comatose due to brain injury </em>or to suffer paralysis of a permanent nature shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for five years. As used in this subdivision, \u2018paralysis\u2019 means a major or complete loss of motor function resulting from injury to the nervous system or to a muscular mechanism.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Under the plain language of the statute, the fact the victim suffered a brain injury is not sufficient to impose the enhancement; the victim must be rendered comatose due to the brain injury. Although it is not necessary for the victim to become comatose permanently <em>(People v. Galvan </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 846, 855 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 776] [\u201cenhancement applies to comatose victims, whether the state of their coma is permanent or not\u201d; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tokash </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1378 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 814] (Tokash) [same]), there must be evidence showing the victim was comatose at some point.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute does not define the meaning of the term \u201ccomatose.\u201d One dictionary defines it as \u201cof, resembling, or affected with coma\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 246), and a coma is defined as \u201cprofound unconsciousness caused by disease, injury, or poison.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But in <em>Tokash, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th 1373, the appellate court took judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>notice of medical literature stating that \u201ca Glasgow Coma Scale of eight or less is the accepted definition of the comatose patient.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1377.) Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel refers us to similar medical authority that patients with a score between three and eight have a severe disability in brain function resulting in a coma, while a score of nine to 12 reflects a moderate disability with physical or cognitive impairments that may or may not resolve. His request that we take judicial notice of these medical authorities is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Here, there is a failure of proof that Harpst was ever comatose. Although Harpst\u2019s brother said Harpst was not \u201cconscious\u201d at first, Dr. Shatz expressly stated that Harpst was \u201cconscious\u201d during the time Harpst was in the intensive care unit, and Dr. Shatz declined to say that Harpst was comatose. Shatz chose instead to refer to the Glasgow Coma Scale in assessing Harpst\u2019s mental status and said he had a score of nine. Medical authority indicates that a score of eight or less defines a comatose patient. Furthermore, there was no evidence that Harpst\u2019s doctors ever put him into an induced coma with paralytics and sedatives. (Cf. <em>Tokash, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1377-1378 [a medically necessary, chemically induced coma is sufficient to support a \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (b) enhancement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">There is no question that Harpst was seriously injured, was initially nonresponsive, and suffered a significant brain injury as a result of the assault. But under the express language of the statute more is required; he must have been rendered comatose. There was no substantial evidence introduced at trial demonstrating that Harpst was rendered comatose due to his brain injury. Accordingly, we will strike the great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (b)) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (b)) enhancement is stricken. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to prepare an amended and corrected abstract of judgment that reflects this modification to the judgment and corrects a typographical error on the abstract by deleting \u201c667\u201d next to count 1, under \u201cSECTION NO.\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>replacing it with \u201c664.\u201d The trial court shall forward a certified copy of the amended and corrected abstract of judgment to California\u2019s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Raye, P. J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 1, 2013, S209119.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> According to <em>Tokash, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at page 1378, \u201cthe evolution of the legislative language after the bill\u2019s original introduction, which can offer \u2018considerable enlightenment as to legislative intent\u2019 <em>(People v. Goodloe </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 485, 491 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 15]), confirms the Legislature did not intend to limit the enhancement to victims in permanent comas. Subdivision (b) of section 12022.7 was added by the enactment of Senate Bill No. 529. (Stats. 1993, ch. 607, \u00a7 2, p. 3260.) As originally introduced in the Legislature, the subdivision (b) enhancement applied only if the injury caused the victim to \u2018become clinically brain dead,\u2019 connoting a permanent state. (Sen. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 529 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) May 20, 1993 at &lt;http:// www.leginfo.ca.gov/&gt; [as of Feb. 22, 2000].) During the legislative process, the phrase \u2018clinically brain dead\u2019 was replaced with the word \u2018comatose.\u2019 (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 529 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) July 15, 1993 at &lt;http://www.leginfo.ca. gov/&gt; [as of Feb. 22, 2000].) The change in terminology from brain dead to comatose demonstrated an intent that the enhancement applied even though the victim\u2019s comatose condition was not permanent and irreversible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
