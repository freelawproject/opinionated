J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6-q\">Following an automobile accident, one of the drivers, appellant Dellreitta Gui\u00f3n, identified herself to the investigating officer as Jean Haile and arranged to have her son bring a driver\u2019s license in Haile\u2019s name to the scene. Gui\u00f3n then presented that license to the officer. Later that day, Gui\u00f3n admitted she had lied and revealed her true name. Based on these facts, a jury convicted Gui\u00f3n of felony false personation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 529, former subd. 3) (former section 529(3)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A search of Gui\u00f3n\u2019s apartment conducted several days after she falsely identified herself produced evidence that led to her conviction of two additional charges, possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350), and unlawful acquisition of personal identifying information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 530.5, subd. (c)(1)) (section 530.5(c)(1)). Gui\u00f3n appeals from the judgment of conviction, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a trial continuance, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the identity theft charge (\u00a7 530.5(c)(1)), and the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction for false personation (former \u00a7 529(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude there was insufficient evidence of a violation of former section 529(3) to sustain that conviction because that provision requires \u201cmore than mere impersonation. It requires that the impersonator use\u2014not just assert\u2014the false identity in one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>ways listed in [the statute\u2019s] three former subdivisions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Casarez </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1190 [138 Cal.Rptr.3d 178] <em>(Casarez).) </em>In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we also reverse the identity theft conviction. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">Gui\u00f3n was charged by information with false personation of Jean Marie Haile-Brown (former \u00a7 529(3))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (count 1); possessing cocaine base (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) (count 2); receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subd. (a)) (count 3); and unlawfully obtaining personal identifying information (\u00a7 530.5(c)(1)) (count 4). At trial, Gui\u00f3n acknowledged three prior misdemeanor convictions for petty theft and a prior felony conviction for grand theft in the 1980\u2019s, a felony petty theft conviction with priors in 1994, a child abuse arrest in 2003 or 2004, and a battery conviction in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">A. <em>Trial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">On May 7, 2009, City of San Pablo Police Officer Kenneth White responded to the scene of a vehicle collision between Gui\u00f3n and another driver. Both cars were damaged, and he could not determine which driver was at fault. White asked Gui\u00f3n to identify herself. She was unable to provide identification and first claimed that her name was \u201cCynthia Dille,\u201d with a date of birth of April 17, 1962. When a records check failed to locate anyone with that name and date of birth, Gui\u00f3n gave her date of birth as January 22, 1959. When White was still unable to find any record of such a person, Gui\u00f3n claimed to be \u201cCynthia Marshall.\u201d Again no matching records could be found. White told Gui\u00f3n that he would need to take her to the police station to confirm her identity. Gui\u00f3n then claimed to be Jean Marie Haile and said she would call her son to bring her identification. Her son arrived and handed Gui\u00f3n a California driver\u2019s license in Haile\u2019s name, with what appeared to be Gui\u00f3n\u2019s photograph. Gui\u00f3n then handed Haile\u2019s driver\u2019s license to White, saying, \u201cSee, this is me.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the appearance of the driver\u2019s license, White believed it was fake. When confronted, Gui\u00f3n admitted the identification was false but claimed she could not obtain real identification because she was in the federal witness protection program. White placed Gui\u00f3n under arrest. As they drove to the police station, Gui\u00f3n volunteered her real name and said she had been using Haile\u2019s name for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>Haile testified that her identification, including her driver\u2019s license, had been lost or stolen three times in the previous five years, she did not know Gui\u00f3n, and Gui\u00f3n did not have permission to use her identification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her driver\u2019s license number matched the number on the false identification Gui\u00f3n presented to Officer White.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">On May 12, 2009, in the course of an investigation sparked by Gui\u00f3n\u2019s use of a false name, City of San Pablo Police Detective Daniel Wiegers searched Gui\u00f3n\u2019s residence pursuant to a warrant. He found rock cocaine that Gui\u00f3n admitted was hers. He also found Medi-Cal paperwork in several different names, with different Social Security numbers and dates of birth; a photocopy of a Health Plan of San Mateo employee identification badge with the name Vernon C. Pierce under Gui\u00f3n\u2019s picture; identification cards in the names of Wilfred Stevenson, Michael Stone, and Adriana Amaya-Abella; a driver\u2019s license for Davion Butler; a credit union ATM/check card for Amy Sindicic; Chase Bank correspondence for Arcelia Galan; and bills and bank correspondence for Ivory Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">Amaya-Abella testified at trial that the identification card in her name found in Gui\u00f3n\u2019s apartment belonged to her, she had lost it in San Leandro in or before 2004, and Gui\u00f3n did not have her consent to possess it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Gui\u00f3n testified in her own behalf, and said she gave White false names because her own driver\u2019s license had been suspended. She said a friend she knew only as \u201cCookie\u201d had left Haile\u2019s driver\u2019s license at her home. Gui\u00f3n said her son handed the license directly to Officer White, and she thought he had provided her true identification card. She offered various explanations for the items that were found in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">B. <em>Verdicts and Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">At the close of the People\u2019s evidence, the court dismissed count 3 following a defense motion under section 1118.1. The jury found Gui\u00f3n guilty on the three remaining counts. The trial court sentenced Gui\u00f3n to the lower term of one year four months in state prison on count 1, along with a concurrent prison term of one year four months on count 2, and a concurrent county jail term of one year on count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">Gui\u00f3n filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAV\">A., B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">C. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence of False Personation (Former \u00a7 529(3))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">Gui\u00f3n contends the evidence does not support her conviction for false personation under former section 529(3). Former section 529 provides in part: \u201cEvery person who falsely personates another in either his or her private or official capacity, and <em>in such assumed character </em>either: [f] 1. Becomes bail or surety for any party in any proceeding whatever, before any court or officer authorized to take such bail or surety; [][] 2. Verifies, publishes, acknowledges, or proves, in the name of another person, any written instrument, with intent that the same may be recorded, delivered, or used as true; or, [f] 3. Does any other act whereby, if done by the person falsely personated, he might, in any event, become liable to any suit or prosecution, or to pay any sum of money, or to incur any charge, forfeiture, or penalty, or whereby any benefit might accrue to the party personating, or to any other person; . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) A person who violates section 529 commits either a misdemeanor or a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">Gui\u00f3n asserts, in order to establish a violation of former section 529(3), there must be proof she committed some affirmative and distinct act beyond falsely identifying herself to White that might have exposed Haile to liability or produced some benefit to herself,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the prosecution failed to prove the necessary \u201cadditional act.\u201d Specifically, she maintains: \u201c[She] gave a false driver\u2019s license bearing the personal information of . . . Haile to . . . White. However, [she] <em>did nothing else while impersonating </em>. . . <em>Haile </em>.... The prosecution urged the jury to convict on the theory that by offering Haile\u2019s name to the police, [Gui\u00f3n] subjected [Haile] to civil liability for the automobile accident. The problem with this theory is [that] it collapses the additional act requirement into the false personation requirement.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">1. <em>The \u201cAdditional Act\u201d Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">The proper interpretation of former section 529(3) is a question we review de novo. <em>(People v. Singleton </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1337 [66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 738] <em>(Singleton).) </em>\u201c \u2018As in any case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. [Citation.] We begin by examining the statute\u2019s words, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182, quoting <em>People v. Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">\u201cUnder section 529, it is either a misdemeanor or a felony to falsely impersonate another person and, while doing so, commit an additional act.\u201d <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1179, fn. omitted.) \u201cThe additional act may be one of three types, as the statute provided.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Section 529 </em>is clear that the prohibited act is not only separate from the false personation, but may not occur before the falsehood; the act must occur while \u201cin such assumed character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Although the People do not dispute Gui\u00f3n\u2019s construction of former section 529, the dissent contends she misinterprets the statute, and no additional act is required beyond a misidentification that, in context, exposes the one falsely personated to liability or creates the benefit specified. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1437-1438, 1440, 1447.) According to the dissent, Gui\u00f3n violated former section 529(3) because her false identification triggered a potential liability for Haile for the accident that preceded the falsehood. The dissent\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the language of the statute and the cases that have interpreted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1279 [273 Cal.Rptr. 209] <em>(Robertson), </em>the defendant was convicted of false personation under former section 529(3) after falsely identifying himself to police as his brother when he was caught stealing a truck. <em>(Robertson </em>at p. 1279.) In evaluating the elements of former section 529(3), the court stated, \u201cz'n <em>addition </em>to the act of impersonation itself [there must be] an \u2018act\u2019 which, had it been done by the person falsely personated, might have subjected that person to either a suit or some kind of debt or fine; or which benefitted the defendant or \u2018any other person\u2019 in some way.\u201d (223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1281, italics added.) The court concluded the additional act requirement had been met, as the defendant not only falsely identified himself in the first instance, but continued masquerading as his brother throughout his arraignment, signed his brother\u2019s name to a booking form and an own-recognizance release form, and failed to appear at a scheduled hearing, resulting in the issuance of a bench warrant for his brother\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">In <em>People v. Cole </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1672 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 788] <em>(Cole), </em>the defendant was arrested for burglary <em>and. </em>gave the officer a false name and birth date. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1674.) Under the dissent\u2019s reasoning, this alone should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>satisfy the requirements of former section 529(3); providing another person\u2019s name might assist the arrestee in avoiding or delaying the consequences of his crime and might cause the other person\u2019s arrest and incarceration. But the court in <em>Cole </em>reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for false personation because no separate act was committed <em>while the arrestee was acting in his false role. (Cole, </em>at pp. 1675-1676, relying on <em>Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d 1277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">In <em>People v. Chardon </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 205 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 438], the defendant was convicted of false personation under former section 529(3) after falsely identifying herself to police as her sister when she was stopped for speeding with a suspended license. <em>(Chardon, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 208-209 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) She relied on <em>Cole, </em>arguing her acts were all \u201c \u2018part of the act of providing the false information\u2019 and did not include \u2018any other act\u2019 which would expose her sister to liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 212.) The court disagreed, finding that, after initially providing false identification information to the officer, the defendant engaged in an additional act that exposed her sister to further criminal liability by signing her sister\u2019s name \u201cto the citation\u2019s promise to appear.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Stacy </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1229 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 312] <em>(Stacy), </em>the defendant provided her cousin\u2019s name and an incorrect birth date to a police officer following her detention for driving under the influence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1234.) Despite the officer\u2019s repeated requests that she provide her true name, the defendant maintained her false identity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1232.) While in that \u201cassumed character,\u201d she refused to complete a required second breathalyzer test or provide a blood sample, even though she was advised her refusal to complete these tests would result in the automatic suspension of her driver\u2019s license. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1232-1233.) Subsequently, the police established the defendant\u2019s tme identity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1233.) On appeal, the defendant argued there was insufficient evidence she committed another act beyond falsely identifying herself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1235.) The court disagreed; \u201cUnder [former section 529(3)], it is a felony to impersonate another person, and, <em>while doing so, </em>commit any other act that (1) if done by the person being impersonated, might cause that person liability for any prosecution, or (2) might benefit the impersonator in some way.\u201d <em>(Stacy </em>at p. 1234, italics added, fn. omitted.) \u201cThe additional act required by section 529 is something beyond, or compounding, the initial false personation to the arresting officer; it must be more than simply providing information regarding the false identity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1235.) The court found sufficient evidence to convict the defendant on the charge of false personation because she \u201crefused to complete the mandatory second breath test or consent to having her blood drawn\u201d and \u201c[h]er refusal to complete the chemical testing, while acting as [her cousin], put [her cousin] at risk of liability for refusing to submit to and/or complete the chemical testing requirements\u201d under the Vehicle Code. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>Finally, the court in <em>Casarez </em>considered the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction for false personation in the absence of an act committed while in the assumed character. In that case, the defendant provided a false name and birth certificate to avoid being taken into custody on an outstanding warrant, but the court found insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction because he did not <em>use </em>the false identity in one of the ways listed in the statute. <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1178, 1190, 1192.) In so holding, the court undertook an extensive review of section 529 in the context of the statutory scheme and the cases considering that provision. The court explained, \u201cWithout an additional act, the mere impersonation generally constitutes only a misdemeanor,\u201d noting that a contrary construction would render section 529 duplicative of other penal statutes making false personation a misdemeanor. <em>(Casarez, </em>at pp. 1190, 1192; see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 529a [offering a false birth certificate with the intent to represent oneself as another person], 529.5 [possessing a fake driver\u2019s license], 529.7 [possessing an official driver\u2019s license to which one is not entitled], 148.9 [falsely identifying oneself to a peace officer during a lawful detention or arrest in order to evade proper identification].) The <em>Casarez </em>court stated: \u201cWe assume the Legislature had section 529 in mind when it later added sections 529a, 529.5, and 529.7\u2014purposely defining new misdemeanor crimes that are distinguishable from section 529 <em>and its additional act requirement. </em>Creating a misdemeanor in section 529a that already existed as a felony in section 529, its nearest neighbor, would have been an utterly irrational legislative act. We will not attribute such a senseless absurdity to the Legislature. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Casarez, </em>at p. 1192, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">As these decisions make clear, former section 529(3) requires more than \u201cproof that the defendant falsely personated another real person in a context that exposed the impersonated individual to potential liability or provided someone a relevant benefit,\u201d as the dissent would hold (conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1447); it requires an act separate from the false identification that occurred while the defendant was acting \u201cin such assumed character.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">2. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence to Show an \u201cAdditional Act\u201d by Gui\u00f3n</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">The People accept our interpretation of the statute, but contend the evidence shows Gui\u00f3n committed the requisite additional act. Once the statute is construed, the question of whether the evidence presented at trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>sufficient to establish a violation of the statute, as so construed, is subject to deferential review. <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182.) Our \u201ctask is to \u2018review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Singleton, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.4th at p. 1339.) The People argue, \u201c[Gui\u00f3n] did more than orally identify herself as Jean Haile. After . . . White performed a [computer] check on the name and found no match, [Gui\u00f3n] called her son, who arrived at the scene with Haile\u2019s driver\u2019s license. When [Gui\u00f3n] produced the driver\u2019s license, Haile was potentially exposed to liability for the car accident .... When [Gui\u00f3n] presented the license, the violation of section 529 was complete.\u201d Thus, the People contend, in effect, that the statute\u2019s requirement of a separate act following the false personation was satisfied by the additional effort undertaken by Gui\u00f3n to substantiate her oral misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">The court in <em>Cole </em>rejected a similar contention. While sitting in the patrol car after his arrest for burglary, the defendant in that case falsely identified himself as \u201cLarry Quesenberry\u201d and provided Quesenberry\u2019s birth date. <em>(Cole, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1674.) After a computer check, the officer asked the defendant if his middle name was \u201cRay,\u201d and he falsely responded that it was. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded the defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate section 529: \u201c[G]iving a false birth date and middle name was no more than part of the act of providing the false information upon which the false identity was based. Each statement made in the course of providing contemporaneous statements amounting to false identification logically cannot be construed as separate acts compounding each prior statement.\u201d <em>(Cole, </em>at p. 1676; see <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1191-1192 [\u201c[Sjection 529 requires an additional act beyond . . . false identifications to elevate the crime to a felony, and that act must be more than merely offering an identifying document, such as a driver\u2019s license or birth certificate to support the impersonator\u2019s false claim of identity.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">Accordingly, we hold former section 529(3) requires proof of an act committed by Gui\u00f3n, while she was in her false role, that might have caused Haile liability or provided benefit to Gui\u00f3n. Because there is no substantial evidence that this occurred, Gui\u00f3n\u2019s conviction on count 1 cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">3. <em>The Proper Disposition on Count 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">We asked the parties for supplemental briefing regarding the appropriate disposition if we concluded Gui\u00f3n\u2019s conviction of false personation was not supported by the evidence. In response, the People cited section 148.9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>subdivision (a) and <em>Cole, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1675-1677, contending we should \u201cmodify the judgment to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of false identification to an officer during a lawful detention or arrest to evade proper identification.\u201d Gui\u00f3n argues that the proper remedy is to simply reverse the conviction because \u201csection 148.9 is not a lesser included offense\u201d of section 529 and the court therefore lacks authority to modify the judgment in this manner. We agree with Gui\u00f3n.

I agree that, consistent with the plain language of the statute, something more than simple false personation is required to establish a violation. I disagree that the additional requirement is a distinct physical act that must <em>follow </em>the act of false personation; rather, false personation <em>in a context </em>that results in the prohibited acts listed in section 529, former subdivisions 1-3 also violates the statute. This interpretation is harmonious with the statutory scheme (including \u00a7\u00a7 148.9, 529a, 529.5, 529.7) and is consistent with the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>reached in prior cases, with the exception of <em>People v.

A single act that both involved false personation and caused the described liability or benefit should establish a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>The majority, however, holds that the plain language of former section 529(3) requires an act separate from and following the false identification, relying on the statutory phrase <em>\u201cin such assumed </em>character.\u201d I disagree. The phrase \u201cin such assumed character\u201d is fully consistent with the simultaneous occurrence of the act of false personation and one of the acts proscribed in section 529, former subdivisions 1, 2 and 3. As an example, one who does the <em>single act </em>of signing an affidavit with another person\u2019s name while pretending to be the impersonated individual both \u201cfalsely personates another\u201d and <em>in such assumed character </em>\u201cverifies\u201d a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d (an act proscribed by \u00a7 529, former subd. 2 (former section 529(2))). (See <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1184\u20141185 [construing \u201cwritten instrument\u201d to include a written legal document and \u201cverify\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v. Maurin </em>(1888) 77 Cal. 436, 439 [19 P. 832] [construing \u201cpersonate\u201d to mean to pretend to others to be in fact another person].) I see no reason why this <em>single act </em>would not constitute a violation of the statute. Similarly, a single act of taking possession of property while pretending to be a person entitled to possession of the property would, in my view, constitute a violation of section 529, former subdivision 1 (former section 529(1)). (Cf. <em>People v. Knox </em>(1897) 119 Cal. 73, 73-74 [51 P. 19] [person who took custody of child while pretending to be an officer of the law was not guilty of violating former \u00a7 529(1) because he did not falsely personate a specific individual (pretended only to have an official capacity), <em>not </em>because he committed one rather than two acts].) Similarly, a single act of doing something that potentially imposes liability on the falsely personated individual or provides someone a relevant benefit, when done while impersonating another, should be deemed a violation of former section 529(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Under the majority\u2019s construction, \u201cand\u201d in the statutory language must be read as \u201cand <em>then.\u201d </em>The only justification suggested by the majority opinion for this reading is that it is somehow compelled by the phrase \u201cin such assumed character.\u201d I simply disagree as a matter of logic and semantics, for the reasons already stated. An act may be committed \u201cin [the] assumed character\u201d of a false personation when it occurs simultaneously with the false personation; it need not <em>follow </em>a distinct act of false personation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Gui\u00f3n raises an additional argument. She seems to argue that the plain language of the phrase \u201cany <em>other </em>act\u201d in former section 529(3) (italics added) indicates that an affirmative physical act <em>in addition to </em>the act of false personation is required before the subdivision is violated. I disagree. \u201cOther\u201d in the phrase \u201cany other act\u201d can just as logically refer back to the specific acts listed in section 529, former subdivisions 1 and 2, and not to \u201cfalse personation.\u201d Under this reading, section 529 is violated when someone, while falsely impersonating another, either (1) becomes bail or surety, (2) verifies (or does a similar act with respect to) a written instrument, or (3) does any other act (i.e., other than becoming bail or surety or verifying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>written instrument) that potentially exposes the impersonated individual to liability or provides someone a relevant benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">In sum, the plain language of the statute is fully consistent with a prohibition of simultaneous performance of an act of false personation and an act proscribed by one of the three former subdivisions. At most, the statutory language is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">B. <em>Legislative Purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">Assuming for purposes of argument that the plain language of former section 529(3) is ambiguous, I consider the appropriate guides to resolving such ambiguity: the legislative purpose of the statute and its statutory context. <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">\u201c[Statutes prohibiting impersonation have two purposes. One is to prevent harm to the person falsely represented; the second is to ensure the integrity of judicial and governmental processes.\u201d <em>(Lee, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 45.) The majority\u2019s construction of section 529 does not further these purposes. One who falsely personates another in a context that could expose the impersonated individual to liability harms that person. If the context is a judicial or governmental proceeding, the conduct also undermines the integrity of judicial or governmental process. Nevertheless, under the majority\u2019s construction, the perpetrator would be criminally liable only if an additional, and in my view irrelevant, requirement is met: the false personation must precede a discrete act that creates the risk of liability. The majority offers no explanation for why the Legislature would impose such a requirement, which has no apparent relationship to the purposes of the statute. On the contrary, those purposes are best served if the statute is construed to require false personation <em>in a context </em>that might expose the impersonated individual to liability regardless of whether one or two discrete acts are involved. Stated differently, the crime is committed when one <em>uses </em>the identity of another person <em>in a manner or in a context </em>that might result in liability to the other person or a relevant benefit to someone. (See <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1190 [\u201csection 529 . . . requires that the impersonator use\u2014not just assert\u2014the false identity in one of the ways listed in the three former subdivisions\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">C. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">Review of the larger statutory framework further persuades me that my construction of former section 529(3) is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>Section 530, which was enacted with section 529 in 1872 and amended in the same manner as section 529 in 1905 (see <em>Lee, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 46, fn. 5), uses language very similar to the disputed language of section 529. Section 530 provides (and has provided since 1905): <em>\u201cEvery person who falsely personates another, </em>in either his private or official capacity, <em>and in such assumed character receives any money or property, </em>knowing that it is intended to be delivered to the individual so personated, with intent to convert the same to his own use, or to that of another person, or to deprive the true owner thereof, is punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as for larceny of the money or property so received.\u201d (Italics added.) Under the majority\u2019s construction, this statute would require two distinct acts: first, an act of false personation <em>and then </em>the receipt of money or property in such assumed character (with knowledge that it belongs to the impersonated individual and with intent to convert). Thus, a person who committed the <em>single </em>act of accepting a delivery of goods intended for another person by falsely acknowledging that he or she was the impersonated individual (and with the requisite knowledge and intent) would not violate the statute, even though his conduct harmed the impersonated individual to the same extent as someone who first falsely personated the owner of the goods and then accepted the property in his or her name. I see no basis for imposing an additional act requirement on section 530, as it would frustrate rather than further the purposes of the false personation statutes, just as the imposition of an additional act requirement frustrates rather than furthers the purposes of former section 529(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Other laws that were also enacted together with section 529 in 1872\u2014sections 528 (marriage under false personation), 531 (fraudulent conveyance), 532 (use of fraud to deprive another of property, labor or services), 533 (sale of land that was already sold), 534 (false representation of authority to sell or mortgage property without spouse\u2019s consent), 535 (fraudulent sale by auction)\u2014similarly base criminal liability on false representations <em>in a particular context </em>and do not require false representation to be followed by a distinct proscribed act. Again, I see no reason why former section 529(3) should be interpreted differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">The majority cites <em>Casarez </em>as authority that former section 529(3) must be construed to impose a two-act requirement in order to harmonize it with a larger statutory scheme. (See <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1190-1192.) <em>Casarez </em>compares section 529 to similar statutes that have been enacted in recent decades: (1) section 148.9,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which criminalizes false personation to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>peace officer for the purpose of evading detection during a lawful arrest or detention, and (2) sections 529a, 529.5 and 529.7,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which criminalize possession or use of false identification. <em>Casarez </em>distinguishes these statutes as follows; \u201csection 529 requires more than mere impersonation. It requires that the impersonator use\u2014not just assert\u2014the false identity in one of the ways listed in the three former subdivisions.\u201d (Casarez, at p. 1190.) I agree with this analysis. However, <em>Casarez </em>then adopts the phrase \u201cadditional act\u201d to describe this <em>use </em>requirement. I disagree with that terminology and its implications. The critical distinction between former section 529(3) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>other statutes is that it punishes false personation that leads to a particular result\u2014exposure of the impersonated individual to liability or a relevant benefit to someone. The unsupported \u201cadditional act\u201d distracts from this core element of former section 529(3) and creates an obstacle to the law\u2019s enforcement that is untethered to the language or purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">In sum, I agree with the <em>Casarez </em>analysis quoted by the majority as long as the references to an \u201cadditional act\u201d requirement are understood to refer to the requirement that the false identity be used in a way that leads to the described liability or benefit: \u201c[Wjithout [section 529\u2019s use requirement], . . . mere impersonation generally constitutes only a misdemeanor [under the current statutory scheme]. When, for example, the defendant offers a false birth certificate with the intent to represent himself as another person, he commits a misdemeanor under section 529a. When he possesses a fake driver\u2019s license or an official driver\u2019s license to which he is not entitled, he commits a misdemeanor under sections 529.5 and 529.7, respectively. And when he falsely identifies himself to an officer during a lawful detention or arrest to evade proper identification by the officer, he commits a misdemeanor under section 148.9. Former section 529 requires [more than] these false identifications to elevate the crime to a felony[; that is,] more than merely offering an identifying document, such as a driver\u2019s license or birth certificate to support the impersonator\u2019s false claim of identity.\u201d <em>(Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1190-1192, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The facts of <em>Casarez </em>illustrate that, under my construction of former section 529(3), there remains a meaningful distinction between that statute and sections 148.9, 529a, 529.5 and 529.7 even without an additional act requirement. In <em>Casarez, </em>the defendant was a passenger in a car that was pulled over by a police officer. The officer suspected (correctly) that the defendant had an outstanding warrant and asked the defendant to identify himself. The defendant provided his brother\u2019s name and produced his brother\u2019s birth certificate as identification. The appellate court properly concluded the defendant was not guilty of violating section 529. (Casarez, <em>supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1177-1178.) The defendant falsely identified himself to the officer for the purpose of evading proper identification during the officer\u2019s investigation into whether he had an outstanding warrant. Thus, he apparently violated section 148.9. (\u00a7 148.9, subd. (a) (section 148.9(a)); see <em>Casarez, </em>at pp. 1179-1180 &amp; fn. 4, 1191 &amp; fn. 11 [implying the defendant violated \u00a7 148.9, but not former \u00a7 529(2)].) However, the defendant did not perform this act of false personation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>in a context </em>that might impose liability on his brother. The defendant was being questioned about a crime he was already identified as having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>committed, rather than a crime that he had just committed, which might have been attributed to his brother. The outstanding warrant was in the defendant\u2019s name, not his brother\u2019s name. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s act of false personation did not expose his brother to potential liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">D. <em>Case Law Recognizing a Two-act Requirement in Section 529</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">The source of the additional act requirement adopted by the majority is a line of case law that originates in a 1990 decision of this district, <em>Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d 1277. I do not find the cases persuasive on the issue of whether two discrete and sequential acts are required to establish a violation of former section 529(3). The two-act language in these cases derives from <em>Robertson1 </em>s effort to distinguish the elements of section 148.9(a) and former section 529(3) in order to decide a statutory preemption issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While I agree with Robertson\u2019s statutory preemption ruling, I believe the court adopted overbroad \u201cadditional act\u201d language in deciding the issue. This error has been repeated in subsequent cases, resulting in an unnecessary and unjustified requirement in establishing a violation of former section 529(3). Nevertheless, I agree with the outcome of these cases with the single exception of <em>Cole, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1672. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, my construction of former section 529(3) does not work a significant disruption in settled California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">The five relevant cases are: <em>Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d 1277; <em>Cole, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1672; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chardon </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 205 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 438] (Chardon); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stacy </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1229 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 312] <em>(Stacy); </em>and <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">In <em>Robertson, </em>the defendant used his brother\u2019s name when he was asked to identify himself upon arrest. When later released from custody, he signed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>brother\u2019s name on a booking form and on an own-recognizance release form. All of these acts exposed the brother to possible prosecution. <em>(Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279.) After the defendant failed to appear in court, a bench warrant was issued and the brother was arrested, found incompetent to stand trial, committed to a state hospital, and held in custody for about 18 months before the [false] impersonation was discovered. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1282.) The defendant did not dispute that he had violated former section 529(3), but only argued that under statutory preemption principles he could only be convicted of violating section 148.9(a). <em>(Robertson, </em>at pp. 1279-1280.) The <em>Robertson </em>court rejected the preemption argument in part because former section 529(3) contained elements not required to prove a violation of section 148.9(a). <em>(Robertson, </em>at pp. 1281-1282.) \u201c[I]n addition to the act of [false] impersonation itself [there must be] an \u2018act\u2019 which, had it been done by the person falsely personated, might have subjected that person to either a suit or some kind of debt or fine; or which benefitted the defendant or \u2018any other person\u2019 in some way.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The court held that this additional \u201cact\u201d was established by the evidence, observing that the \u201cinitial falsehood on appellant\u2019s part was compounded many times by what happened thereafter,\u201d and that \u201cas a result of appellant\u2019s impersonation of his brother, the brother was unjustly incarcerated for a year and a half.\u201d <em>(Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1282-1283.) In other words, the court observed both (1) that the defendant performed many acts of false personation and (2) that the false personation caused his brother to suffer severe liability. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In my view, the fact that the false personation took place in a context that exposed the brother to liability was sufficient alone to establish a violation of former section 529(3), regardless of how many different acts that the defendant committed thereafter, and that the defendant\u2019s <em>initial </em>act of providing his brother\u2019s name to the arresting officer, which exposed his brother to criminal liability for the charged crime, was sufficient to establish a violation of former section 529(3). I concur in the result of <em>Robertson, </em>therefore, but disagree with its language that suggests there must be separate and sequential acts to establish a violation of former section 529(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">In <em>Cole, </em>the defendant provided his arresting officer with a false name and birth date. \u201cWhen the officer ran a computer check of the name and date of birth, the middle name \u2018Ray\u2019 appeared; [the defendant] responded affirmatively when the officer asked him if \u2018Ray\u2019 was his middle name.\u201d On these facts, the defendant was convicted of felony violation of former section 529(3). <em>(Cole, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1674.) The defendant challenged the conviction, citing <em>Robertson, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at page 1281, and arguing there was \u201cno evidence of an act in addition to that of falsely identifying himself to the arresting officer.\u201d The People cited the defendant\u2019s acts of providing a birth date and confirming a middle name as the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>additional acts. <em>(Cole, </em>at p. 1675.) The appellate court reversed, reading <em>Robertson </em>to require affirmative acts that were distinct from the act or acts of false personation and that compounded the effects of the false personation. <em>(Cole, </em>at pp. 1675-1676 [\u201cabundantly clear from the record in <em>Robertson </em>that [the Robertson] defendant engaged in acts in addition to the act of providing false identification to a police officer\u201d; \u201cgiving a false birth date and middle name was no more than part of the <em>[Cole </em>defendant\u2019s] act of providing the false information upon which the false identity was based\u201d].) In my view, the <em>Cole </em>court erred by searching for separate <em>acts </em>that followed false personation, rather than focusing on the crux of the statute: whether the defendant\u2019s false personation conduct imposed a potential <em>liability </em>on someone or provided a relevant potential <em>benefit. Cole </em>thus exemplifies a significant problem with the two-act construction of former section 529(3): it diverts courts\u2019 attention from the issues that really matter in establishing a violation of former section 529(3). Assuming the impersonated individual in <em>Cole </em>was a real person, the <em>Cole </em>defendant\u2019s <em>initial </em>act of falsely identifying himself to the arresting officer was sufficient alone to establish a violation of former section 529(3), even though it also established a violation of section 148.9(a). In my view, therefore, the <em>Cole </em>court erred in reversing the former section 529(3) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">In <em>Chardon, </em>the defendant\u2019s car was pulled over after she was observed driving at a speed of 95 miles per hour. The defendant gave her sister\u2019s name when the detaining officer asked her to identify herself, provided her sister\u2019s middle name and birth date, and signed her sister\u2019s name to a promise to appear on a citation. She was convicted of violating section 529. <em>(Chardon, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 208-210.) The appellate court distinguished <em>Cole </em>and affirmed the conviction because \u201cdefendant here engaged in an <em>additional </em>act of false personation which exposed her sister to further criminal liability\u201d when she signed the citation\u2019s promise to appear, \u201cwhich exposed her sister not only to liability for the citation but also to potential criminal liability for failing to appear at the scheduled hearing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 212.) I agree with the result in <em>Chardon, </em>but not all of its reasoning. <em>Chardon </em>appropriately focused on the manner in which the defendant\u2019s conduct exposed the impersonated individual to potential liability. However, the court\u2019s effort to identify a distinct act additional to the initial act of false personation was unnecessary. In my view, the defendant\u2019s <em>initial </em>act of providing her sister\u2019s name to the detaining officer, who had observed her driving 95 miles an hour, exposed her sister to potential criminal liability and was sufficient to establish a violation of former section 529(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">In <em>Stacy, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th 1229, the defendant was pulled over after she was observed committing several traffic violations. The detaining officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on her breath and slurred speech when she spoke. The defendant identified herself to the officer using someone else\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>name and birth date. While she was being taken to jail, she gave an officer a driver\u2019s license in that person\u2019s name. Once at jail, she refused to complete a required second breathalyzer test or provide a blood sample, which could have resulted in the suspension of the impersonated individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license. She was convicted of violating section 529. <em>(Stacy, </em>at pp. 1231-1233.) The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s act of refusing to undergo the mandatory second breath test or provide blood sample put the impersonated individual at risk of a license suspension and thus satisfied the additional act requirement described in <em>Cole </em>and <em>Chardon. (Stacy, </em>at pp. 1235-1236.) Again, I agree with the result in <em>Stacy, </em>but I disagree that the conviction could only be upheld based on proof of that second act. The defendant\u2019s initial act of falsely identifying herself to the detaining officer, who had observed her driving in an intoxicated state, exposed the impersonated individual to liability and satisfied the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">I have already explained why I agree with the result in <em>Casarez, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th 1173, but disagree with some of its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">In sum, I read former section 529(3) to require proof that the defendant falsely personated another real person in a context that exposed the impersonated individual to potential liability or provided someone a relevant benefit. There is no basis in the statutory language, purpose or framework to require proof of a discrete act <em>following </em>an act of false personation that gives rise to the described liability or benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">II. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">Based on my construction of former section 529(3), I would reject Gui\u00f3n\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim and affirm her conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">Whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish a violation of the statute under a proper construction of the statute is subject to deferential review. <em>(People v. Singleton, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.4th at p. 1339.) When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, our \u201ctask is to \u2018review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">Gui\u00f3n exposed Haile to potential civil liability by falsely impersonating Haile during a police investigation into a car collision. Indeed, both the prosecutor and defense counsel argued in closing that the relevant \u201cliability\u201d for the former section 529(3) charge was the driver\u2019s potential civil liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>for the car crash. By falsely personating Haile in a context that exposed Haile to this potential liability, Guion violated former section 529(3). Her conviction for this offense should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1321-7\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1321-8\"> Following the majority opinion\u2019s approach, I cite to the version of section 529 (Stats. 1983, ch. 1092, \u00a7 296, p. 4050) in effect at the time of Onion\u2019s offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1321-9\"> Current section 529 (Stats. 2011, ch. 15, \u00a7 381) is substantively identical: \u201c(a) Every person who falsely personates another in either his or her private or official capacity, and in that assumed character does any of the following, is punishable pursuant to subdivision (b): [SO (1) Becomes bail or surety for any party in any proceeding whatever, before any court or officer authorized to take that bail or surety.
