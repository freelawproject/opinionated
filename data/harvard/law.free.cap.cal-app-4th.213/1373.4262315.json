Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> residential robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5), forcible rape while acting in concert (\u00a7 264.1), forcible oral copulation while acting in concert (\u00a7 288a, subd. (d)), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)). The court found defendant had one prior conviction for selling drugs (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a)) and two prior convictions for robbery (\u00a7 211). The court sentenced defendant to 107 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">Defendant contends that an extended lapse of time between the filing of the complaint and his arrest violated his rights to due process and a speedy trial; that the trial court abused its discretion in replacing a deliberating juror with an alternate juror; and that the trial court erred in admitting certain expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>testimony. We find no merit in these contentions and shall affirm the judgment. We shall publish only the portion of our opinion addressing the removal of a deliberating juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">1. <em>The time lapse between the filing of charges and defendant\u2019s arrest did not violate his rights to due process and a speedy trial.*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">2. <em>The trial court properly removed a deliberating juror who was unable to follow the law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">The trial court removed a juror during deliberations upon concluding that the juror was unable to follow the law. (\u00a7 1089.) Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion and violated his state and federal constitutional right to trial by jury by dismissing the juror because the record does not establish to a demonstrable reality that the juror was unable to perform his duties. Although the replacement of a juror during the course of deliberations can be justified only under extreme circumstances, we shall set out in some detail the juror\u2019s behavior that demonstrates the patience and care with which the trial court proceeded. The court did not abuse its discretion when ultimately forced to conclude that the juror was unable to follow its instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">A. <em>Jury deliberations and juror removal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">Deliberations began on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 15, 2011. About two hours into deliberations the jury sent a note with questions and requests for materials, as follows: \u201cWas there any evidence of DNA swabs from mouth of Jane Doe? [j[] Transcript and audio initial interviews w/ Jane Doe at hospital, 12/28/04; and initial interviews with Angela and Erica Doe, at police station. [1] White binder from crime scene. [][] Color photo of revolver, in Oakland residence, [f] Transcript &amp; audio of photo lineup session. [|] DNA typing lab results. [][] List of all prosecution and defense exhibit[]s.\u201d The jury then recessed for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>The next day, Wednesday, March 16, the court conferred with counsel and then called the jury into the courtroom to respond in detail to each item in the note. Its response included an explanation that there was no evidence introduced at trial about DNA testing of oral swabs from Jane Doe and no DNA laboratory results apart from the expert\u2019s testimony, which upon request would be read back to the jury. The court also explained that only portions of the audiotaped witness interviews and the photo lineup session with Erica had been introduced as evidence and that those recordings could also be replayed in the courtroom upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The jury resumed deliberations for a few minutes, then sent a note requesting all available audio recordings, the \u201centire\u201d reporter\u2019s transcript and a \u201c[tjimeline of case development: dates of actions taken by detectives, crime labs, searches conducted, samples taken, etc.\u201d The court arranged to have the recordings played for the jury and explained that the entire reporter\u2019s transcript would not be read but that portions would be read if the jury had specific questions. The court also explained that it could not create a timeline but that an individual juror was free to develop one from the juror\u2019s notes and recollection of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Another note, previously typewritten at home by Juror No. 9, was presented to the court immediately after the morning recess on March 16. The note read: \u201cAccess to the computer has become an essential part of daily life. College students use laptops to take notes in class, sort through a multitude of concepts and ideas, do homework, draft papers, and revise papers. The students also have access to printers, [ft] It would be a serious handicap not to have access to the computer, [ft] In sorting through the facts of this case, the jurors may also need the help of a computer, say, merely for word-processing: [ft]-to establish the timeline [ft]-to note which exhibit establishes what fact, or raises what questions [ft]-to track the consistency or inconsistency in the same witness\u2019 testimony [ft]-to track the consistency and inconsistency among different witnesses and documents [ft]-to put down, in writing, the ideas that have come to the juror\u2019s mind, so that the ideas can be scrutinized (by himself or herself individually at first) more closely and more objectively at a later time [ft]-in light of the whole record, after reviewing all of the evidence [ft]-to track the questions in one\u2019s mind [ft]-to figure out which elements of crimes have, or have not, been proven [ft]-to organize, rethink, and revise all of the above in an efficient manner [ft]-Will a computer for word-processing be made available to the jurors? [ft] Will a LaserJet printer be made available to the jury? [ft] Can a juror use his or her own at home, under the condition that no one else will have access to the computer throughout the trial? [ft] Will a juror be permitted to bring his or her own LaserJet printer to the jury deliberation room?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>The court responded that a juror should not evaluate the case at home and that neither a computer nor printer would be provided in the jury room. The court encouraged the jurors to discuss the evidence together and to use a board in the jury room for outlining their points. The court explained: \u201cThis is a different process than maybe what you do when you\u2019re at work or if you\u2019re at school .... This is a deliberative process. Part of what the benefit of the jury is . . . you have 12 people sharing their ideas about ... the evidence they heard and how the law would apply to the evidence. . . . [f] . . . [I]f we could put all the facts in a computer and deliver an answer, we wouldn\u2019t need a jury. But that\u2019s not the process we engage in here. This is a process of . . . give and take where people talk to each other. They don\u2019t forego their opinions about the evidence but they listen to other people\u2019s opinions and they evaluate things in that fashion. [][]... [I]t\u2019s different than a purely quantitative evaluation of everything. People are human beings. The jury is 12 human beings, thinking and talking about the evidence together. It\u2019s not such a mathematical process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Following the court\u2019s explanation and the playing of the audiotape evidence, the jury resumed deliberations for only a few minutes before presenting another note. The note, written at Juror No. 9\u2019s request, asked for a definition of the word \u201cabiding\u201d and asked \u201cis it possible for someone to come or stay to review the evidence on their own\u201d apart from the other jurors. The court responded that individual review of the evidence when the jury was not assembled was not possible, and that no further definition of \u201cabiding\u201d would be provided apart from the instructions previously given. The jury then resumed deliberations for about two hours before the end of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The next morning, Thursday, March 17, the jury foreperson sent a note to the court asking if the jurors could have extra copies of the instructions and take the instructions home. The foreperson also stated that \u201c[o]ne juror is not comfortable with [the] process[,] causing others to feel they cannot proceed\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat is the process of using an alternate when a juror is causing conflict with [the] group?\u201d The court provided each juror with a copy of the instructions, to be kept at court, and questioned the foreperson about the concerns expressed in the note concerning the deliberative process. The foreperson said a \u201cparticular juror,\u201d later identified as Juror No. 9, had questions about many words in the jury instructions and was \u201cnot open to discussion of the words or the definitions\u201d but wants \u201cto have formalized questions continuously submitted to the court\u201d for further definition rather than looking \u201cinside the instructions for definitions\u201d or using \u201cthe common definition\u201d of the word. The foreperson reported that Juror No. 9 was not comfortable with the jury instructions, \u201cthe process of coming to a conclusion, of analyzing circumstantial versus direct evidence\u201d and that, as a result, other jurors felt that deliberations were not \u201ca working process\u201d and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>experiencing \u201cspiked emotions.\u201d Out of the jury\u2019s presence, the court expressed to counsel its concern that Juror No. 9 was not \u201cunderstanding the law.\u201d The court recalled the foreperson and asked him if \u201cthe dynamics of the deliberations\u201d might change if additional words were defined or if the jury was advised by the court that certain words could not be further defined. The foreperson said it was possible but explained that Juror No. 9 was rereading \u201cevery single instruction\u201d and struggling over many terms, including the meaning of \u201cintent.\u201d The court remarked privately to counsel that it questioned if one is capable of serving on a jury if one \u201ccan\u2019t understand and apply the term \u2018intent.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The court, with counsel\u2019s consent, questioned Juror No. 9 to see if he was capable of proceeding. The court cautioned the juror not to disclose the substance of the deliberations and focused on whether the jury had everything it needed to deliberate. The court noted that the jurors had been given all trial exhibits for review and individual copies of the jury instructions and asked Juror No. 9 if he had \u201ceverything you need to deliberate\u201d and discuss the charges with the other jurors. Juror No. 9 said he was \u201cnot at that stage yet.\u201d The juror said he was not ready to deliberate because he needed more time to study his notes and the jury instructions. The court asked Juror No. 9 if he would be ready to deliberate after further review of the jury instructions and he said \u201cprobably.\u201d The court asked if there were any words in the jury instructions that the juror felt were not sufficiently defined, and the juror said the problem with relying on the plain meaning of English words was that \u201ceverybody may not have the same understanding of the English words or interpretation\u201d and \u201cdifferent people have different perceptions.\u201d The court said \u201cthat\u2019s part of the jury process,\u201d and Juror No. 9 said \u201cit\u2019s not right, because the instruction about the law should come from the court\u201d and wanted the jury to submit questions to the court when there were differing interpretations. The court asked if Juror No. 9 had been the one to request to stay late to review the evidence and he said that he had because he \u201cwas slow in reading English.\u201d Juror No. 9 was bom abroad but had lived in the United States for \u201cmany years\u201d and had a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from an American university. He said he had \u201ctaken a criminal law class\u201d and had heard the terms contained in the jury instructions but found it \u201ccomplicated\u201d and wondered \u201cfor people who did not take such a class, how can they possibly understand instructions so quickly?\u201d As an accommodation, the court offered to send the rest of the jurors home early and let Juror No. 9 stay to review his notes and the jury instructions that day and the following days when the jury was not scheduled to deliberate. Juror No. 9 accepted and said he \u201cbelieved\u201d he would be prepared to deliberate after doing so. The juror spent nine hours over several days alone in the jury room reviewing his notes and the jury instmctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>Deliberations resumed on the afternoon of Monday, March 21 and continued through Wednesday, March 23. On the morning of March 24, the foreperson sent a note to the court stating, \u201cWe the jury have not been able to reach a unanimous consensus on any of the charges at this time. [][] It is the opinion of several jurors that one juror is having challenges with the concept[] of \u2018reasonable.\u2019 One juror, in particular, continues to discuss ideas from his personal experiences that were not presented in this case as evidence nor are they relevant to the case before us. [j[] This has caused conflict within the group of jurors and elevated tempers to the point that the group will not be able to reach agreement on the charges before us. [f] At this time we would either require an alternate juror or move towards a hung jury verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Juror No. 9 wrote a reply note saying he disagreed with the foreperson\u2019s statement and thought deliberations should continue. Juror No. 9 said, \u201cThe jury instruction calls for us to rely on common sense and experience. Relying in part on my experience in life, I feel that on the basis of the evidence as presented ... I do not believe that the prosecution has sufficiently proven the allegations to allow me to form an abiding conviction about the guilt alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The court called the jury into the courtroom. The court first addressed the foreperson\u2019s note about the inability to reach a consensus. The foreperson said the jury had discussions and preliminary votes on six of the seven charges and had cast ballots on a couple of charges. The vote on the last ballot was 11 to one. The court asked the foreperson, then Juror No. 9, if there was any legal clarification the court could provide to assist the jury in reaching a verdict. Juror No. 9 said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to ask for except for understanding of the Constitution or the jury instruction, because people have different interpretations.\u201d The court asked if he had a specific question and, after further exchange, Juror No. 9 noted that the juror questionnaire said a juror \u201cmust follow the law regardless whether you believe in it or not. And, I mean, at that time I hesitated and but then I\u2014there is something I don\u2019t agree with, I mean, then why does [the] Constitution require us to follow something we don\u2019t believe in? [f] So this may be a question in everybody\u2019s mind, and it\u2019s so\u2014so why is the standard set so high that defendant is\u2014should be presumed innocent? And why can\u2019t we apply the lower standard of proof such as preponderance of the evidence?\u201d The court asked Juror No. 9 to write a note with his legal questions so court and counsel could confer about a possible response, and declared a long lunch recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Juror No. 9 wrote five pages of questions. The numerous questions included the following: \u201cWhy is there a difference in the standard of proof between civil trials and criminal law?\u201d; \u201cDoes it make sense that a defendant may be found not guilty in a criminal trial, but guilty in a civil trial (based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>the same facts)?\u201d; \u201cWhen I have reasonable doubt, how do I tell that my doubt has risen only to the level of preponderance of the evidence, but has not reached the level of beyond a reasonable doubt (for sure ?)\u201d; \u201cWhy must we pledge that we must follow the law even when the law is itself in dispute in court?\u201d; \u201cWhy must a defendant be presumed innocent?\u201d; \u201cWhy is defense not required to present any evidence, or to call any witness?\u201d; \u201cDoes the fact that an evidence has been admitted by the court into evidence mean that the court has determined that the evidence is reliable?\u201d; \u201cWhen a witness gives contradictory testimony, I am at a loss as to how to determine, objectively, which testimony I should believe\u201d; \u201cWhat constitutes juror misconduct requiring disqualification, mistrial, or new trial?\u201d; \u201cWhat if a juror suddenly realizes that the juror can no longer be impartial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">The court conferred with counsel. The prosecutor questioned the juror\u2019s \u201creadiness\u201d to serve as a juror and said Juror No. 9\u2019s note posed many questions that were of \u201ca broad ranging nature\u201d \u201cfar beyond the purview of a juror.\u201d Defense counsel objected to removing Juror No. 9 from the jury but said the court should not \u201cendeavor to answer the questions\u201d because the \u201ccontents of the questions divulge\u201d the \u201cdeliberative process of the jury.\u201d The court expressed doubts that Juror No. 9 was following the law and decided to examine him further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Juror No. 9 said that some of the questions he posed referred to other jurors, not himself, including the question asking what happens if a juror \u201ccan no longer be impartial.\u201d Outside of the jurors\u2019 presence, defense counsel argued that Juror No. 9\u2019s note was \u201cessentially describing the deliberative process\u201d and that no further inquiry or action was necessary. The prosecutor disagreed, arguing that the juror\u2019s written questions went \u201cfar beyond what was put to him by the court this morning\u201d and demonstrate that Juror No. 9\u2019s mind was ranging beyond \u201cthe issues placed before the jury in this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The court concluded that Juror No. 9 was not following the law. The court found that Juror No. 9 was \u201cconsidering things that he\u2019s been told not to consider,\u201d asking, for example, why the defense is not required to present any evidence or call any witnesses. The court observed that, from the outset of trial, \u201cthe court has admonished the jurors that that\u2019s the constitutional protection that the defendant is entitled to, and the fact that he\u2019s raising that after four days of deliberation indicates to the court that he\u2019s not following the law.\u201d The court also noted that Juror No. 9 questioned why a defendant is presumed innocent, despite clear instructions to that effect, and is \u201cconsidering why there\u2019s a different standard of proof in civil versus criminal\u201d trials. The court said Juror No. 9 was not \u201cfollowing the law that the court has instructed him on or following the court\u2019s directions as to what he\u2019s supposed to deal with here. [H]e\u2019s clearly getting way beyond the scope\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>and \u201cengages in flights of legal fancy,\u201d \u201cspeculating on things that are far beyond the record.\u201d The court also noted that Juror No. 9 expressed an inability to judge credibility in writing in his note that he was \u201cat a loss as to how to determine\u201d which testimony to believe. The court found Juror No. 9 \u201cincapable of executing his obligations as a juror in a fair and impartial manner,\u201d removed him from the jury and seated an alternate juror in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Jury deliberations began anew on the afternoon of Thursday, March 24. The jury deliberated for the rest of that day and recessed until Monday, March 28. The jury reached a verdict on the afternoon of March 28. The jury found defendant guilty of five counts and not guilty of two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">B. <em>The court did not abuse its discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">\u201c \u2018The trial court may discharge a juror for good cause at any time, including during deliberations, if the court finds that the juror is unable to perform his or her duty. (\u00a7 1089.) \u201cWhen a court is informed of allegations which, if proven true, would constitute good cause for a juror\u2019s removal, a hearing is <em>required. </em>[Citations.]\u201d [Citation.] . . . \u201cGrounds for investigation or discharge of a juror may be established by his statements or conduct, including events which occur during jury deliberations and are reported by fellow panelists.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Homick </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 816, 898 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 289 P.3d 791].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">\u201cGreat caution is required in deciding to excuse a sitting juror\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen and Johnson </em>(2011) 53 Cal.4th 60, 71 [133 Cal.Rptr.3d 548, 264 P.3d 336]) especially where, as here, a lone holdout juror is excused.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cA court\u2019s intervention may upset the delicate balance of deliberations. The requirement of a unanimous criminal verdict is an important safeguard, long recognized in American jurisprudence. This safeguard rests on the premise that each individual juror must exercise his or her own judgment in evaluating the case. The fact that other jurors may disagree with a panel member\u2019s conclusions, or find disagreement frustrating, does not necessarily establish misconduct.\u201d <em>(Allen and Johnson, </em>at p. 71.) But removal of a holdout juror is proper where the facts demonstrate the juror is unable to follow the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 846, 928 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 190, 235 P.3d 873].) A \u201ctrial court\u2019s attempt to ensure the jurors understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>law,\u201d and removal of a holdout juror who would not or could not follow the law, \u201ccannot be viewed as an improper attempt to overcome a deadlock in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">\u201cWhile removal of a juror is committed to the discretion of the trial court, upon review, the juror\u2019s disqualification must appear on the record as a demonstrable reality. \u2018The demonstrable reality test entails a more comprehensive and less deferential review\u2019 than substantial evidence review. \u2018It requires a showing that the court as trier of fact did rely on evidence that, in light of the entire record, supports its conclusion that bias [or other good cause for removal] was established. It is important to make clear that a reviewing court does not <em>reweigh </em>the evidence under either test. Under the demonstrable reality standard, however, the reviewing court must be confident that the trial court\u2019s conclusion is manifestly supported by evidence on which the court actually relied.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Homick, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 899, some italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Juror No. 9 was not following the law is well supported by the record set out in detail above. Defendant argues that Juror No. 9 \u201cwas very conscientious and hardworking.\u201d That appears to be true, but despite his best efforts, the juror manifestly was unable to focus on the relevant principles and to apply the court\u2019s instructions to the facts of the case before him. The juror appears to have been overwhelmed by the task of a juror, questioning the basic principles he was instructed to accept, such as the presumption of innocence, and the meaning of many commonly used words in the court\u2019s instructions. It is true, as defendant points out, that Juror No. 9 told the court that some of the questions he posed were \u201craised by the other jurors,\u201d but there is no other indication that any other juror was having any difficulty in understanding or following the court\u2019s instructions. In all events, most of the questions posed by Juror No. 9 clearly related his own deep uncertainties and inability to follow the court\u2019s instructions. He asked, \u201cWhen I have reasonable doubt, how do I tell that my doubt has risen only to the level of preponderance of the evidence, but has not reached the level of beyond a reasonable doubt (for sure?).\u201d He acknowledged, \u201cWhen a witness gives contradictory testimony, I am at a loss as to how to determine, objectively, which testimony I should believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Juror No. 9\u2019s questions went far beyond issues relevant to the case. He asked: \u201cWhy must we pledge that we must follow the law even when the law is itself in dispute in court?,\u201d which he explained referred to conflicts between federal and state courts. The juror was unable to concentrate his attention on relevant legal matters despite accommodations and assistance by the trial court, including hours of independent study of jury instructions and trial notes. The trial court rightly concluded that Juror No. 9 went \u201cway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>beyond the scope\u201d of the trial as he \u201cspeculated] on things that are far beyond the record\u201d and was unable to follow the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred in limiting its investigation to Juror No. 9 without inquiring into possible misconduct by other jurors. Defendant contends that evidence of misconduct was embedded in Juror No. 9\u2019s five pages of questions, and in the question, \u201cWhat if a juror suddenly realizes that the juror can no longer be impartial?,\u201d which he said referred to \u201cother persons.\u201d As our high court has observed, \u201cA trial court made aware of the possibility of a juror\u2019s misconduct, and particularly possible misconduct occurring during the jury\u2019s deliberations, is placed on a course that is fraught with the risk of reversible error at each fork in the road. [Citation.] The court must first decide whether the information before the court warrants any investigation into the matter. [Citation.] If some inquiry is called for, the trial court must take care not to conduct an investigation that is too cursory [citation], but the court also must not intrude too deeply into the jury\u2019s deliberative process in order to avoid invading the sanctity of the deliberations or creating a coercive effect on those deliberations [citation]. After having completed an adequate (but not overly invasive) inquiry into the misconduct issue, the trial court must then decide whether, under section 1089, there is \u2018good cause\u2019 to excuse the juror at issue. The court at this final fork might err in declining to dismiss a juror who should have been excused [citation] or excusing a juror who should have been retained [citation]. In making these decisions, a trial court might at times be placed between a rock and a hard place . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Fuiava </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 710-711 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 147, 269 P.3d 568], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The trial court here navigated this difficult course well and did not abuse its discretion by limiting its investigation to Juror No. 9. The information provided by Juror No. 9 did not warrant inquiry into the conduct of the other jurors. His general question about juror impartiality indicated, at most, that he believed other jurors were not impartial. Such feelings are not uncommon during heated deliberations and here the juror provided no reason to believe other jurors were not impartial. The expression of such a sentiment without any evidence of juror bias does not compel further investigation. Nor was investigation of other jurors compelled by the suggestion that evidentiary issues such as the reliability of admitted evidence and the burden of proof were \u201craised\u201d during discussions among the jurors.  These matters were proper subjects of jury deliberation. There is no evidence that the other jurors were not following the law on these subjects. The court acted properly here in limiting the scope of its inquiry and not delving into the content of the jury\u2019s deliberations. A trial court must take care \u201c \u2018to avoid intruding unnecessarily upon the sanctity of the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.
