J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">Appellants Joe Requa, Wendell G. Moen, Jay Davis, and Donna Ventura (hereafter collectively Retirees) all spent decades working at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore). During their employment there, Livermore was operated by the University of California (the University or UC), a state agency governed by The Regents of the University of California (the Regents). After retiring from Livermore, Retirees all received University-sponsored group health insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In 2007, management and operation of Livermore was transferred from the University to a private consortium. On January 1, 2008, Retirees\u2019 University-sponsored group health insurance was terminated, and the consortium assumed responsibility for providing Retirees\u2019 health insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Retirees later brought an action for mandamus against the Regents, claiming that the elimination of their University-sponsored group health insurance benefits constituted an unconstitutional impairment of either an express or implied contract the Regents had formed with Retirees. Their petition also claimed the doctrines of promissory and equitable estoppel prohibited the termination of their University-sponsored group health insurance benefits. They further sought a declaratory judgment. After the Regents successfully demurred to Retirees\u2019 original petition, they filed an amended pleading. The Regents again filed a demurrer, which the trial court sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Retirees appeal from the resulting judgment. They contend their amended petition adequately pleaded causes of action for impairment of express and implied contract, as well as causes of action for promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, and declaratory relief. We agree with Retirees with respect to all but their claim for impairment of express contract. We conclude their other claims should not have been resolved on demurrer. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in part and reverse it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u201cIn ruling on the demurrer, the trial court had to accept as true all material facts properly pleaded in [Retirees\u2019] petition, disregarding only conclusions of law and allegations contrary to judicially noticed facts.\u201d <em>(Burt </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 273, 277 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 373].) On appeal, we must do the same, and we therefore set out below the material allegations of the Retirees\u2019 first amended petition for writ of mandate. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 277, 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Livermore opened in 1952 as a branch of the University of California Radiation Laboratory. From 1952 until 2007, the University operated Livermore under a contract with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) or predecessor agencies of the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Retirees are all former employees of the University. All of them spent decades working at Livermore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During that time, Retirees were regular employees of the University, and while the Regents managed Livermore, they treated University employees who worked there in the same manner as other University employees. Livermore employees were entitled to the same benefits and were subject to the same terms and conditions of work and personnel policies as other University employees. By virtue of their employment at Livermore, Retirees became members of the University of California Retirement System (UCRS), which later became known as the University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">In 1961, the Regents adopted a resolution authorizing medical benefits for University employees and retirees. At the time the Regents first authorized retiree medical benefits, there was no policy or provision of state law, nor any provision of the Regents\u2019 own policies, that prohibited or limited the Regents\u2019 authority to offer such benefits. The Regents\u2019 authorization did not include any provision permitting the Regents to terminate or eliminate these benefits, and the Regents did not reserve the authority to modify vested retirement benefits in a manner that was inconsistent with California law or to transfer the responsibility for providing a vested benefit to another entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">After authorizing medical benefits, the University began telling employees they would receive health coverage while working and during retirement so long as they met eligibility requirements. For example, in 1979, the Regents published a booklet concerning UCRS. Under the heading \u201cHealth Insurance During Retirement,\u201d the booklet stated, \u201cYou may continue your University-sponsored group health plan coverage for you and your family after you retire. In most cases the premiums will be the same as when you were employed, and you will continue to receive The Regents\u2019 health plan contribution. The balance of the premium will be deducted from your monthly Retirement Income.\u201d The following year, Livermore published a \u201cBenefits Information Packet\u201d summarizing its health insurance benefits. With regard to health insurance benefits during retirement, the document stated, \u201cCoverage can be continued as long as monthly income received from retirement system is large enough to cover employee contribution. Employer contribution continues during retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">A 1984 UCRS booklet entitled \u201cYour retirement plan coordinated with Social Security\u201d explained that \u201c[i]f the conditions shown in the box are met, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>UC-sponsored health and dental plan coverage can be continued for yourself and enrolled family members when UCRS monthly benefits are paid. The University\u2019s monthly contribution for your plan premiums also continues, in the same amount as for active employees, if the conditions are met.\u2019\u2019 The only \u201ccondition[] in the box\u201d for receiving continued health and dental coverage during retirement was that \u201cUCRS benefits must start <em>within four months after your employment ends\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Livermore issued a publication entitled \u201cBenefits\u201d in 1988,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which it said, \u201c[Bjenefit plans make up a large part of your compensation\u201d and \u201care like your other paycheck.\u201d The publication also stated, \u201cWhen you retire you can keep your health, dental and legal plan coverages; [Livermore\u2019s] contributions to the health and dental plans continue, provided you retire within four months of separating from [Livermore].\u201d \u201cBenefits\u201d told employees the publication was a \u201cgeneral overview of your personal and family benefit plans. You shouldn\u2019t consider it a promise or guarantee of plan coverage or benefits. You have to meet eligibility rules for coverage and qualification rules to receive benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In 1990, Livermore\u2019s benefits office distributed a document entitled \u201cThe Retiree Handbook.\u201d On a page headed \u201cInsurance\u201d appeared the question, \u201cHow does retirement affect my insurance plans?\u201d The response stated, \u201cWhether a member of [the Public Employee Retirement System] or UCRP, your University group medical and dental plans may be continued when you retire, <em>provided that you are enrolled at the time of retirement.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In the late 1990s, the Regents began inserting language into benefits books and publications stating that retiree medical benefits were not vested and could be modified or eliminated at any time. The Regents distributed the University of California Retirement Handbook (Retirement Handbook) in 1998. That handbook explained that retiring employees electing \u201cUCRP monthly retirement income . . . may be eligible to continue . . . UC medical and/or dental coverage if\u2019 they met certain eligibility criteria. It also stated, \u201cHealth and welfare benefits are not accrued or vested benefit entitlements. UC\u2019s contribution toward the monthly cost of the coverage is determined by UC and may change or stop altogether, subject to the state of California\u2019s annual budget appropriation.\u201d In small print on the inside back cover of the 1998 handbook, the following language appeared: \u201cWhat is written here does not constitute a guarantee of plan coverage or benefits\u2014particular rules and eligibility requirements must be met before benefits can be received. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>University of California intends to continue the benefits described here indefinitely; however, the benefits of all employees, annuitants, and plan beneficiaries are subject to change or termination at the time of contract renewal or at any other time by the University or other governing authorities. The University also reserves the right to determine new premiums and employer contributions at any time. Health and welfare benefits are subject to legislative appropriation and are not accrued or vested benefit entitlements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In approximately December 2000, the Regents published a University of California Retirement Plan Election Handbook. Regarding \u201cUC-Sponsored Health and Welfare Coverage,\u201d this handbook stated, \u201cGenerally, if you are eligible to continue coverage and you elect monthly retirement income, you may continue the same coverage.\u201d It also explained that retirees can change their medical and/or dental plans after they retire \u201cduring Open Enrollment, which is usually held each November.\u201d The handbook also included the following language: \u201cUC reserves the right to determine new premiums and employer contributions at any time. Health and welfare benefits are subject to legislative appropriation and are not accrued or vested benefit entitlements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">At all relevant times, Retirees met the eligibility requirements for University-sponsored group health plan coverage. They retired between 1996 and 2006 (see fn. 1, ante) after decades of service to Livermore, where they had remained in significant part because they would receive University-sponsored group health plan coverage when they retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Between the 1960s and 2007, the Regents provided the same medical benefits to active and retired employees who had worked at Livermore as they provided to other active and retired University employees. Until late 2007 or early 2008, the Regents treated Livermore retirees in the same manner as other University retirees. The Regents provided Retirees with the promised medical benefits from their retirement until 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In 2007, the DOE did not renew its contract with the Regents to manage Livermore, contracting instead with a newly created private consortium known as Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On or about January 1, 2008, the Regents terminated Retirees\u2019 health coverage under the University plan and shifted responsibility for providing retiree medical benefits for Livermore retirees to LLNS. At that time, the University assured Livermore retirees that they would continue to receive substantially equivalent medical benefits from LLNS.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In August 2008, Requa advised the University\u2019s acting general counsel that he believed the Regents had acted unlawfully by terminating University-provided medical benefits and shifting that responsibility to LLNS. While the University did not respond directly to Requa\u2019s concerns, counsel for LLNS responded by e-mail on September 16, 2008, stating that \u201cmedical costs for [Livermore] retirees have always been paid for by [the] operating costs of [Livermore]\u201d and that \u201ccoverage could change or be terminated at any time.\u201d Counsel for LLNS also said DOE had determined \u201cthat [Livermore] employees who retired from UC would no longer be included in the UC retiree pool for coverage purposes\u201d and that in the future, benefits \u201cmay not be equivalent to those offered by the University.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">LLNS has provided coverage that is more expensive than, and inferior to, the health benefits formerly provided by UCRP. In addition, Retirees have been removed from the University-wide risk pool comprised of both active and retired employees and are segregated into a smaller, older, and more infirm group, which will cause the cost of their coverage to increase more rapidly compared to other University retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On August 11, 2010, Retirees filed their original petition for writ of mandate against the Regents in Alameda County Superior Court. The petition alleged causes of action for impairment of contract, promissory estoppel, and declaratory relief. The Regents filed a demurrer, which the trial court sustained with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On January 24, 2011, Retirees filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate (FAP). It alleged causes of action for impairment of implied contract, impairment of express contract, promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, and declaratory relief. The contract counts alleged that the Regents\u2019 termination of Retirees\u2019 vested rights to University-sponsored group health insurance coverage violated the contract clause of the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.) Attached to the FAP were excerpts from benefit handbooks the University had distributed to employees between 1979 and 2000. The Regents again responded by demurrer, and on May 26, 2011, the trial court sustained the Regents\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The trial court cited three reasons for dismissing Retirees\u2019 contract counts. First, it found that none of the language in the benefit handbooks cited by Retirees was \u201csufficient to create either an express or implied contract upon which to base a cause of action for impairment of contract.\u201d Instead, it found that \u201cthe statements are replete with conditional language.\u201d The trial court also noted that \u201cas early as 1990, some 20 years before the Petition was filed,\u201d the Regents had included language in the benefits booklets and handouts \u201cclearly stating that retiree medical benefits were not vested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>could be modified or eliminated at any time.\u201d Furthermore, the Regents had inserted \u201creservation of rights language\u201d in the retirement information materials distributed after 1990, and the trial court found that statements made after 1990 \u201care indisputably not express contractual promises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Second, the trial court also ruled that Retirees had failed \u201cto provide any statutory or legislative authorization which would allow such a promise to be binding\u201d on the Regents. Absent such statutory or legislative authority, even if a promise had been made to Retirees, \u201csuch a promise would not constitute [a] binding contract against [the Regents], a public entity.\u201d The court found that Retirees had \u201cidentified no minutes, formal resolution or standing order issued by [the Regents] conferring on [Retirees] retirement medical benefits of a certain type in perpetuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Third, the trial court held that Retirees\u2019 allegations that retiree medical benefits are vested rights created via implied contract were unsupported by case law. It concluded that \u201cCalifornia courts have been clear in holding that absent clear intent on the part of the public entity, a long-term financial commitment for retiree medical benefits cannot-be implied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The lower court sustained the demurrer to the promissory estoppel cause of action because it found Retirees had alleged no clear and unambiguous promise to lifetime retiree medical benefits. As to equitable estoppel, the court found that the Retirees could not allege the Regents \u201cknew that retirement medical benefits were not vested rights and were subject to modification and elimination, yet never communicated such information to [Retirees].\u201d Finally, because the cause of action for declaratory relief was derivative of the other four causes of action, the trial court sustained the demurrer to that cause of action as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Judgment was entered on June 8, 2011, and Retirees filed a notice of appeal on July 29, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Retirees claim the superior court improperly sustained the Regents\u2019 demurrer to the FAR They argue they have adequately pleaded claims for breach of either an express or implied contract. For that argument, Retirees rely heavily on our state Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Retired Employees Assn. of Orange County, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1171 [134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 779, 266 P.3d 287] <em>(Retired </em>Employees), a decision we will discuss in some detail below. Retirees also claim the FAP is sufficient to plead claims for promissory and equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The Regents defend the superior court\u2019s decision on a number of grounds, arguing principally that Retirees have not overcome the general presumption that a public employer\u2019s statutory scheme is not intended to create private contractual rights. According to the Regents, courts may impose implied contractual obligations on a public employer only where the relevant legislative body clearly evinces an intent to create an implied contract. Here, the Regents contend, Retirees have identified no documents that clearly evince such an intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They further argue Retirees have not overcome the presumption against the formation of a vested right to health insurance benefits. The Regents also assert that Retirees have failed to allege facts sufficient to make out their claims for promissory and equitable estoppel. Finally, the Regents argue we should affirm the judgment on the alternative ground that Retirees\u2019 claims are barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We will first discuss our standard of review, an issue about which the parties initially disagreed in their briefs. We will then turn to an examination of the <em>Retired Employees </em>decision before addressing the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u201cJust as the trial court, an appellate court reviewing a judgment entered after a demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend assumes the truth of all properly pleaded material facts unless contradicted by judicially noticed matters. [Citation.] The appellate court determines whether, reading the petition as a whole and giving it a reasonable interpretation, the pleading states facts sufficient to state a cause of action or a reasonable possibility exists that any defects can be cured by amendment. [Citations.] If the answer to either question is yes, then the trial court erred in making its ruling. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Burt v. County of Orange, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In performing our review, we are mindful that \u201c[i]t is not the ordinary function of a demurrer to test the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations or the accuracy with which he describes the defendant\u2019s conduct. A demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading.\u201d <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213 [197 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].) In considering the merits of a demurrer, \u201cthe facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [176 Cal.Rptr. 824].) Thus, when reviewing the propriety of a judgment sustaining a demurrer, the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 or petitioners\u2019 \u201cability to prove . . . allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.\u201d <em>(Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 496 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In reviewing the superior court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer, \u201cwe examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 415 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189].) While our focus is on the pleadings, \u201c[rjelevant matters that are properly the subject of judicial notice may be treated as having been pled.\u201d <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Creel Printing &amp; Publishing Co. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 736, 742 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 787].) Even if the trial court has not mled on a party\u2019s request for judicial notice, we may ourselves take judicial notice of appropriate matters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(SC Manufactured Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liebert </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 68, 82-83, fn. 8 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 73].) If the allegations of the complaint or petition conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>with attached exhibits, we give preference to the exhibits. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 83.) If the exhibits are ambiguous but can be construed as the plaintiffs or petitioners suggest, then we must accept their construction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, we must accept the plaintiffs\u2019 or petitioners\u2019 allegations regarding the construction of an ambiguous contract, \u201c[s]o long as the pleading does not place a clearly erroneous construction upon the provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>(Marina Tenants Assn. v. Deauville Marina Development Co. </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 122, 128 [226 Cal.Rptr. 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">II. <em>The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in </em>Retired Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">One of the reasons the trial court gave for sustaining the Regents\u2019 demurrer was that there could be no implied contract for retiree medical benefits. Since judgment was entered in this case, however, the California Supreme Court has disagreed. In <em>Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th 1171, the court held that \u201cunder California law, a vested right to health benefits for retired county employees can be implied under certain circumstances from a county ordinance or resolution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The holding in <em>Retired Employees </em>came in response to a certified question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at pp. 1176, 1178, 1194.) The underlying federal litigation arose out of a suit brought by REAOC (the Retired Employees Association of Orange County, Inc.), an organization of retired Orange County employees, against Orange County (County). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1177.) In 1966, County had begun to offer group medical insurance to its retired employees. It initially calculated the premiums for active and retired employees separately, but in 1985, County began to combine active and retired employees into a single unified pool for purposes of calculating health insurance premiums. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe single unified pool . . . had the effect of subsidizing health insurance for retirees, in that it lowered retiree premiums below their actual costs, while raising active employee premiums above their actual costs.\u201d For budgetary reasons, in 2007, County passed a resolution splitting the pool of active and retired employees. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">REAOC sued County, seeking an injunction prohibiting the county from splitting the pool of active and retired employees. <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1177.) \u201cREAOC conceded that the <em>express </em>provisions of the various memoranda of understanding . . . and the Orange County Board of Supervisors (Board) resolutions were silent as to the duration of the unified pool. But REAOC nonetheless alleged that County\u2019s action constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>impairment of contract in violation of the federal and state Constitutions, in that County\u2019s long-standing and consistent practice of pooling active and retired employees, along with County\u2019s representations to employees regarding a unified pool, created an <em>implied </em>contractual right to a continuation of the single unified pool for employees who retired before January 1, 2008.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1177-1178.) Among other things, REAOC relied on representations contained in booklets County distributed to active employees describing health benefits available in retirement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1178.) After the federal district court granted summary judgment to County, REAOC appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which then asked the California Supreme Court to decide whether an implied contract to which a county is a party could confer vested rights to health benefits. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In the California Supreme Court, County argued \u201c(1) that a county government and its employees cannot form an implied contract; (2) that even if implied contracts are cognizable in the public employment context, such contracts cannot create vested rights; and (3) that even if vested contractual rights for county employees may be implied, such rights cannot include health benefits.\u201d <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1179.) Our Supreme Court rejected each of these arguments. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1179-1193.) Most significant for our purposes is the court\u2019s discussion of the first issue\u2014how implied contracts may be formed in public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>Retired Employees </em>held that a county may be bound by the terms of an implied contract so long as there is no legislative prohibition against such arrangements, such as a statute or ordinance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1176, citing <em>Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 246 [74 Cal.Rptr. 398, 449 P.2d 462] <em>(Youngman).) </em>The court cautioned that courts must be sensitive to the fact that the principal function of governmental bodies is to make laws that establish policy, not to make contracts. <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1185.) \u201c \u2018Thus, it is presumed that a statutory scheme is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights and a person who asserts the creation of a contract with the state has the burden of overcoming that presumption.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1186.) After reviewing California case law on the issue, the court concluded generally \u201cthat legislation in California may be said to create contractual rights when the statutory language or circumstances accompanying its passage \u2018clearly \u201c. . . evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the [governmental body].\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Although the intent to make a contract must be clear, our case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>does not inexorably require that the intent be express. [Citation.] A contractual right can be implied from legislation in appropriate circumstances. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1187.) Thus, while we must \u201c \u2018proceed cautiously both in identifying a contract within the language of a . . . statute and in defining the contours of any contractual obligation^]\u2019. . . [t]he requirement of a \u2018clear showing\u2019 that legislation was intended to create the asserted contractual obligation [citation] should ensure that neither the governing body nor the public will be blindsided by unexpected obligations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1188-1189, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The court in <em>Retired Employees </em>also held that vested contractual rights may be implied from legislation in certain circumstances; vesting is simply a matter of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1189.) Thus, public employee benefits may become vested by implication in appropriate circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1190.) \u201cHowever, as with any contractual obligation that would bind one party for a period extending far beyond the term of the contract of employment, implied rights to vested benefits should not be inferred without a clear basis in the contract or convincing extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Having summarized the holdings in <em>Retired Employees, </em>we now apply its analysis to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">III. <em>Retirees Have Adequately Pleaded a Cause of Action for Breach of an Implied Contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Retirees contend that under <em>Retired Employees, </em>the University\u2019s obligation to provide lifetime retiree medical benefits to them on the same terms as other University retirees may be implied from the authorization of those benefits in 1961, the uninterrupted provision of those benefits for more than 50 years, and from the University\u2019s publications assuring employees they would receive health benefits in retirement so long as they met certain eligibility requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They contend the lower court erred in finding Retirees had identified no minutes, formal resolution or standing order from the Regents conferring on Retirees retirement medical benefits in perpetuity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Having reviewed the allegations of the FAP and the matters properly subject to judicial notice, we conclude Retirees are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Retirees alleged that the Regents first authorized medical benefits for Livermore retirees in the 1960s. This authorization was alleged to have been given \u201cin accordance with policies and procedures used by the Regents in the ordinary course of their business and in the proper exercise of their powers.\u201d Retirees also alleged that the Regents did not reserve any right to terminate, eliminate, or modify these benefits in a manner that was not consistent with the legal authority of California public agencies to modify vested retirement benefits, nor did the Regents reserve the right to transfer the responsibility for providing this benefit to another entity. According to the FAP, the Regents also did not reserve any right to exclude Livermore retirees from coverage under University-sponsored group health coverage or to treat those retirees differently from other University employees and retirees. Retirees claimed that from the 1960s until 2007, the Regents have provided retiree medical benefits without interruption.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In addition to the allegations of the FAP, Retirees properly sought judicial notice of an October 23,1961 resolution by the Regents. (See <em>Flournoy, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d at p. 233, fn. 10.) In that resolution, the Regents authorized the president of the University, in connection with the University\u2019s \u201cEmployee Health and Life Insurance Program,\u201d \u201cto approve for continued payroll deductions and health insurance subsidy those existing plans which are willing to amend their benefits <em>to provide equal benefits to retired </em>employees.\u201d (Italics added.) Retirees allege that for more than 50 years after issuing this resolution, the Regents provided University retirees the same medical benefits they provided to University employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Thus, the essential allegations of Retirees\u2019 claim of implied contract were that the Regents authorized University-sponsored group health insurance coverage for retirees, and then during Retirees\u2019 employment at Livermore, the Regents\u2014through various benefit booklets and handbooks published by their authorized representatives\u2014offered to provide Retirees with University-sponsored group health plan coverage when they retired. (See <em>Hunter v. Sparling </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 711, 721-722 [197 P.2d 807] [enforceable promise to pay pension benefits inferred from personnel policies]; <em>Kashmiri </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 809, 828-833 [67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 635] [University\u2019s promise on its Web site and in catalogues not to raise certain fees held to be an implied contract].) Retirees allegedly accepted this offer through working at Livermore and continuing to provide services over time, and they claim they remained there because of the promise they would have University-sponsored group health plan coverage in retirement. (See <em>Hannon Engineering, Inc. v. Reim </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 415, 425 [179 Cal.Rptr. 78] [pension plan offered by employer and impliedly accepted by employee by remaining in employment constitutes a contract, whether plan is public or private; continued employment is consideration for promise to pay pension].) The booklets and handbooks informed University employees that they could continue their University-sponsored group health insurance coverage after they retired, provided they met certain eligibility criteria. Retirees alleged that they met these criteria at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u201cIn pleading a cause of action on an agreement implied from conduct, only the facts from which the promise is implied must be alleged.\u201d <em>(Youngman, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pp. 246-247.) The foregoing allegations suffice to plead a cause of action based on an implied contract. (See <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Cory </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 494, 504-505 [202 Cal.Rptr. 611].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">IV. <em>The Regents\u2019 Arguments in Support of the Trial Court\u2019s Order Are Unpersuasive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Regents offer a number of arguments in support of the trial court\u2019s ruling. For the most part, these arguments are not directed to the sufficiency of the allegations of the FAP, but rather are based almost entirely on matters outside of the operative pleading. As such, they have limited force given the procedural posture of this case, which requires us to accept the truth of Retirees\u2019 allegations and restricts our review to those allegations and matters that are properly subject to judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">A. <em>Retirees Are Not Required to Prove Their Case to Overcome a Demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Regents first argue Retirees have \u201cprovided no documents that clearly evince\u201d an intent on the Regents\u2019 part to provide lifetime retiree health benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are somewhat puzzled by this argument, because we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on a demurrer, and we must therefore assume the truth of all of the allegations of the FAR <em>(Burt v. County of Orange, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 279.) To prevail on appeal, Retirees are not required to show they already possess the evidence that will prove their case. The only question before us is whether the <em>allegations of the FAP </em>are sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory. <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">B. <em>The FAP Sufficiently Alleges the Regents Have Authorized Retiree Health Benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Regents next claim they have not delegated their authority to contract with employees for lifetime retiree health benefits, nor have they passed legislation granting such benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They note, correctly, that matters of employee compensation and benefits fall within their constitutional grant of authority. <em>(In re Work Uniform Cases </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 328, 344 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 635].) But they misread the FAP when they contend it alleges that the contract was created only by statements made by the Regents and their authorized representatives. The FAP alleges the retiree health benefits were properly authorized by the Regents themselves. As we read the pleading, Retirees allege that this express authorization, the later statements of the Regents and their authorized representatives, and the uninterrupted provision of University-sponsored group health benefits from Retirees\u2019 retirement dates through 2007, create an implied contract to provide Retirees with University-sponsored group health benefits throughout the period of their retirement. In <em>Retired Employees, </em>the California Supreme Court held that very similar allegations were sufficient to state a claim for breach of implied contract. <em>(Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at pp. 1177-1178, 1183, 1187 [County\u2019s removal of retired employees from unified medical insurance pool alleged to have impaired contract because of County\u2019s long-standing practice of pooling active and retired employees and County\u2019s representations to employees regarding unified pool].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>C. <em>The Extent and Limits of the Regents\u2019 Authority Can Only Be Determined After Discovery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The Regents contend there is no document or \u201cregental action\u201d limiting their ability to provide different benefits to Livermore retirees than to other University retirees. In the court below, however, Retirees offered a 1971 benefits booklet stating, \u201cThe complete provisions of the UCRS are set forth in the Standing Order of The Regents relating to the University of California Retirement System. All informational booklets are subject in every respect to the Standing Order, and where any differences may occur, the Standing Order shall govern.\u201d If it can be located, the terms of the standing order to which this booklet refers might define the Regents\u2019 authority with respect to retiree health benefits. Obviously, this is a matter that must await further factual development, but it demonstrates this issue cannot properly be resolved on demurrer. Moreover, the Regents\u2019 argument seems to contradict the FAP, which alleges that after authorizing the benefits at issue, the Regents reserved no right to modify or eliminate them or to treat Livermore retirees differently from other University retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">D. <em>Retirees\u2019 Interpretation of the Benefits Booklets Is Not Clearly Erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Regents next contend that the benefits booklets and handbooks attached to the FAP contain no promise of lifetime retiree health benefits. In fact, the Regents read the language of these materials as showing an intent not to create vested rights. Like the trial court, they rely on language in the booklets stating that employees\u2019 health benefits \u201cmay continue\u201d or \u201ccan be continued\u201d in retirement. The Regents and the trial court view this as conditional language that cannot create a vested right to University-sponsored health benefits in retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">But as Retirees point out, these booklets contain language that could be read as implying a commitment to provide these benefits <em>throughout </em>retirement, rather than for an unspecified shorter period <em>during </em>retirement. For example, a 1980 benefit publication states that during retirement, health insurance \u201c[c] overage can be continued <em>as long as monthly income received from retirement system is large enough to cover employee contribution.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) A 1990 publication informed Livermore employees that \u201cyour University group medical and dental plans may be continued when you retire, <em>provided that you are enrolled at the time of retirement.\u201d </em>It also contemplated that retirees would be able to participate in the annual open enrollment period, which suggests that the provision of retiree group health insurance benefits would be ongoing. With regard to open enrollment, the University\u2019s 1998 <em>Retirement Handbook </em>states, \u201cUC will send you information <em>each year </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>explaining your options.\u201d (Italics added.) These publications might reasonably be construed as promising Retirees continuing University-sponsored group health insurance so long as they met the stated eligibility criteria and that such coverage would continue throughout the entire period of their retirement. Since it appears the FAP \u201cdoes not place a clearly erroneous construction upon the provisions of the [alleged] contract, in passing upon the sufficiency of the [petition], we must accept as correct [Retirees\u2019] allegations as to the meaning of the agreement.\u201d <em>(Marina Tenants Assn. </em>v. <em>Deauville Marina Development Co., supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at p. 128.) Retirees\u2019 interpretation may ultimately prove invalid, but it was improper for the trial court to resolve the issue against them based solely on the FAP and the attached materials. (See <em>Aragon-Haas v. Family Security Ins. Services, Inc. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 232, 239 [282 Cal.Rptr. 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">E. <em>The Reservation of Rights Language in the Benefits Booklets Is Ambiguous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The Regents also rely on reservation of rights language appearing in benefits booklets as demonstrating the University\u2019s intent <em>not </em>to create vested rights. We do not find this language as unequivocal as the Regents do. The Regents cite a 1988 Livermore publication entitled \u201cBenefits\u201d which states that the publication \u201cgives a general overview of your personal and family benefit plans. You shouldn\u2019t consider it a promise or guarantee of plan coverage or benefits.\u201d But the very next sentence states, \u201cYou have to meet eligibility rules for coverage and qualification rules to receive benefits.\u201d Read together, the two statements may simply mean that benefits are contingent upon meeting eligibility requirements, not that the benefits are not vested retirement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Similarly, the 1998 Retirement Handbook says, \u201cHealth and welfare benefits are not accrued or vested benefit entitlements.\u201d It also goes on to say that \u201cUC\u2019s contribution toward the monthly cost of the coverage is determined by UC and may change or stop altogether, subject to the state of California\u2019s annual budget appropriation.\u201d As Retirees suggest, this language might be read to mean that the University may change or eliminate its contribution toward the cost of coverage, if the state\u2019s budget appropriation so required. Indeed, a 2000 UCRP publication explains that \u201c[hjealth and welfare benefits are subject to legislative appropriation and are not accrued or vested benefit entitlements.\u201d The Regents do not claim, however, that Retirees\u2019 University-sponsored health insurance coverage was terminated because of the state\u2019s budgetary appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In a related argument, the Regents note that the booklets use the words \u201clifetime,\u201d \u201cfor the rest of your life,\u201d or \u201cfor life\u201d when referring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>retirement income. Since no such language appears in connection with retiree health insurance benefits, the Regents ask us to infer that such benefits are not guaranteed for life. We are unwilling to make such an inference as a matter of law, because other provisions of the booklets upon which the Regents rely are arguably in conflict with this reading. For example, the Regents cite a May 1979 UCRS publication entitled \u201cUCRS and Social Security,\u201d which uses the phrase \u201c[lifetime retirement income.\u201d But under the heading \u201cVesting,\u201d that same publication states, \u201cAfter you have five years of UCRS service credit, or when you are age 62, you have a non-forfeitable (vested) right to a retirement benefit that is based on both your own <em>and </em>Regents\u2019 contributions.\u201d We asked the parties to address at oral argument what effect, if any, this language might have on Retirees\u2019 claims, and they offered differing interpretations. As a court reviewing a demurrer ruling, however, we can express no definitive view as to the meaning of this language. Nevertheless, it provides further support for our conclusion that it cannot be said as a matter of law that Retirees have failed to plead the existence of an implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">F. <em>The Allegations of the FAP Are Deemed True, Even if Retirees Have Not Yet Discovered \u201cSource Documents. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Regents repeat their argument that Retirees have failed to overcome the presumption that legislative acts do not give rise to an implied contract for vested benefits. (See <em>Retired Employees, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 1186.) They claim that because Retirees have not identified any \u201csource documents that could support their conclusory contentions of an implied contract^] [t]he allegations ... are not deemed true on demurrer.\u201d In essence, the Regents argue that because Retirees have not produced the evidence that will prove their case, we need not accept the truth of the allegations in the FAR The cases the Regents cite in support of this rather extraordinary argument do not come close to supporting it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Moreover, the Regents have conceded they authorized retiree group health insurance benefits. If, as the Regents claim, such benefits can only be authorized by \u201cregental action,\u201d then it would seem to follow that a \u201csource document\u201d authorizing those benefits must exist. Retirees have already identified one such source document\u2014the October 23, 1961 resolution. And while it appears the Regents may not keep their own copies of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>documents, this does not preclude the possibility that discovery may yield others bearing on the subject matter of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">V.-VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The judgment is affirmed to the extent it dismissed Retirees\u2019 claim for impairment of express contract. In all other respects, the judgment is reversed. Retirees shall recover their costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Simons, J., and Bruiniers, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> Requa was first hired by the University in 1961, but left in 1963 to continue his education.

These materials were proper subjects of judicial notice, and we may consider them on appeal. (See <em>California State Employees\u2019 Assn. v.

Claiming these facts <em>could </em>form the basis of an express contract is not the same as claiming that they do. Moreover, we may decline to consider arguments raised only in footnotes. <em>(Sabi v.

At oral argument, the Regents\u2019 counsel contended Retirees\u2019 claims were based entirely on an implied contract, and Retirees\u2019 counsel did not disagree.

We note nevertheless that whatever this 2011 standing order may mean, it would tell us only what the <em>current </em>authority of the president of the University is. It says nothing about what the president\u2019s authority may have been at the times relevant to Retirees\u2019 action.
