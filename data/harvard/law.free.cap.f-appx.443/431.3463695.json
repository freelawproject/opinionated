On appeal, Jasem argues that the BIA erred in concluding that there were insufficient changed country conditions in Iraq by ignoring evidence of increased violence along with a simultaneous decrease in security.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>We review the denial of a motion to reopen an immigration petition for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">An alien may file one motion to reopen removal proceedings and generally must file the motion within ninety days of the date of the BIA\u2019s final administrative removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, these time and numerical limitations do not apply where (1) the motion seeks asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief; (2) the motion is based on changed country conditions; and (3) the evidence of changed conditions is material and \u201cwas not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) and 1003.23(b)(4)\u00ae; <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256. Proving that evidence is material is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d because an alien seeking to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of changed country conditions must demonstrate \u201cthat, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">To establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, \u201can applicant must establish that [he] has a well-founded fear that [he] will be persecuted if removed to [his] home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1), and 1231(b)(3). To qualify for CAT relief, an applicant must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured upon his return to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). We have stated that private acts of violence, general criminal activity, and purely personal retribution do not qualify as persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Moreover, we have held that noncriminal informants do not constitute a particular social group under the INA. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1197-98 (11th Cir.2006). Nor does asylum eligibility extend \u201cto anyone who fears the general danger that inevitably accompanies political ferment and factional strife.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jasem\u2019s second motion to reopen. First, because the BIA adequately reviewed Jasem\u2019s motion and the evidence of changed country conditions that he filed in support, the BIA did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258. Second, Jasem\u2019s second motion to reopen was untimely and number-barred, because it was filed four years after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal but did not demonstrate changed country conditions in Iraq that were material and could not have been discovered at the time of the removal proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 1256. Rather, while Jasem\u2019s evidence showed ongoing general violence stemming from the government\u2019s transition, he did not demonstrate increased violence specifically directed at individuals similar to him. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1328 (\u201cthe INA does not extend eligibility for asylum to anyone who fears the general danger that inevitably accompanies political ferment and factional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>strife.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, he failed to demonstrate that the \u201cnew evidence would likely change the result in his case,\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1257, and consequently the agency did not abuse its discretion in this denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-17\">. To be sure, Jasem testified that an alien smuggler asserted a personal vendetta that constitutes a direct and targeted threat. However, purely personal retribution and private acts of violence do not qualify as persecution based on a statutorily protected ground, and, even as a noncriminal informant for the United States, Jasem would not fall within a particular social group. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258; <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
