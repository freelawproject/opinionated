On appeal, Rosado-Sabido argues that the district court erred in finding that his previous conviction for receipt of stolen property constituted an aggravated felony, that the district court should not have aggregated his sentences, and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-18\">Rosado-Sabido first argues that his previous conviction for receipt of stolen property was not an aggravated felony and thus the conviction should not be used to enhance his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Rosado-Sabido contends that the court did not sentence him to, and he could not have served, 365 days in jail beginning around May 1987 because he was deported to Mexico as early as September 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-19\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous when our review of the evidence leaves us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>155 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). If the district court\u2019s weighing of the evidence between two possible interpretations was plausible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>we will not disturb the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines require that, if a defendant was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, the offense level should be increased by eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). For purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, an aggravated felony is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), the Immigration and Nationality Act. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3). Section 1101(a)(43)(G) defines an aggravated felony as including a \u201ctheft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The government produced a sentencing order in the district court that shows that Rosado-Sabido was sentenced to an additional 365 days for his 1986 conviction. In addition, we have held that although the defendant did not <em>serve </em>his entire sentence because he was deported, the length of the sentence <em>imposed </em>determined whether his prior conviction would constitute and aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Maldonado-Ramirez, </em>216 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir.2000). Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that Rosado-Sabido\u2019s prior conviction, for which the sentence imposed exceeded one year, was an aggravated felony that subjected him to an increased sentence for his illegal reentry offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Rosado-Sabido next argues that the district court erred by aggregating the receipt of stolen property\u2019s original sentence of 66 days, imposed in 1986, with the second sentence of 365 days, imposed in 1987. Specifically, Rosado-Sabido argues that ambiguity exists regarding whether the Immigration and Nationality Act, which references a \u201cterm of imprisonment,\u201d applies, or whether the application note to \u00a7 2L1.2, which defines the term \u201csentence imposed,\u201d applies. He argues that while it is clear under \u00a7 2L1.2 that \u201csentence imposed\u201d includes sentence terms after probation revocation, the Immigration and Nationality Act does not explicitly state, with regard to a \u201cterm of imprisonment,\u201d whether probation revocation sentences are included.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">We review a district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 959, 178 L.Ed.2d 791 (2011). However, when an appellant raises an issue for the first time on appeal, we apply the plain error standard of review. <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003). The appellant must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>Where a rule or statute plainly requires a court to do something, it is plain error for the court not to do so. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2003). But, where the explicit language of a rule or statute does not resolve an issue, and neither we nor the Supreme Court has resolved the issue, there can be no plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The Immigration and Nationality Act, which defines an aggravated felony, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">Any reference to a term of imprisonment or a sentence with respect to an offense is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). The Immigration and Nationality Act does not specifically note whether a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d includes sentences imposed because of probation revocation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>defines a \u201csentence imposed\u201d as including \u201cany term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Even if Rosado-Sabido were able to demonstrate that the district court erred by relying on the \u201csentence imposed\u201d definition under the comment to \u00a7 2L1.2 rather than the unclear \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d definition under the Immigration and Nationality Act, such reliance would not constitute plain error because neither we nor the Supreme Court has resolved that issue definitively. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291. While the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 specifically requires that courts look to the Immigration and Nationality Act for the definition of an aggravated felony, no rule or statute plainly requires a court to use the \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d definition instead of the \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d definition, and there can be no plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 1290. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Finally, Rosado-Sabido argues that the 24-month sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Particularly, he argues that the district court overemphasized deterrence, should have considered that he is assimilated into the United States, and that his sentence-enhancing conviction was both minor and stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 600, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentence the district court imposes must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If there is no claim of procedural error, we review for substantive error. <em>See id. </em>(holding that if the sentence is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence). We review the totality of the facts and circumstances to gauge for substantive error. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert </em>denied,-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it fails to carry out the statutory purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Dean, </em>635 F.3d 1200, 1209 (11th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. June 9, 2011) (No. 10-10987). We have noted that a sentence that is well below the statutory maximum is likely reasonable. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006). We will not presume a within-guidelines range to be reasonable, but we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The district court explicitly stated that it had considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">The sentencing factors set forth in Title 18 U.S.Code 3553(a), specifically the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense and promote respect for the law, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">The district court considered the statutory purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a), and the reasonableness of the sentence is further demonstrated because the 24-month sentence is well below the 20-year maximum. <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52. Finally, because the 24-month sentence is within the guidelines range, we can expect that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
