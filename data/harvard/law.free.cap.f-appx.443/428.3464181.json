On appeal, she argues that her sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of her low risk of recidivism. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">We have previously held that it was substantively unreasonable for a district court to impose a sentence of probation following a bank fraud scheme that inflicted a loss totaling more than $480,000. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). We specifically concluded that the sentence of probation did not \u201creflect the seriousness of the crime, promote respect for the law, ... provide just punishment for the offense, ... [or] afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Here, Moody\u2019s 12-month-and-l-day sentence, at the low end of her guideline range, was not substantively unreasonable in light of (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, and (3) the need to deter criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As the district court noted, Moody\u2019s crime involved an ongoing series of fraudulent transactions, rather than a single isolated incident. It also resulted in a loss of $190,399.42. Based on somewhat similar facts, we held in <em>Crisp </em>that a sentence of probation was not reasonable. <em>Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1290-91. Thus, the district court\u2019s judgment with regard to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is entitled to deference and, under these circumstances, it did not make a clear error in judgment in sentencing Moody to 12 months and 1 day in prison. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
