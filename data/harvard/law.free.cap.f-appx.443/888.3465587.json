He argues that the district court erred by x\u2019elying solely upon the description contained in the presentence report of his two prior Illinois convictions for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance as the basis for imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00ae. Because, he failed to object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">In accordance with <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Government has supplemented the record with copies of the Illinois indictment and judgment indicating that Sandoval was convicted, under a pseudonym, of two counts of knowingly delivering a substance containing cocaine in violation of Illinois Compiled Statute Chapter 720, Act 570, Section 401(c)(2); we may consider these documents in determining whether the district court plainly erred. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). Sandoval does not contend that these crimes do not constitute \u201cdrug trafficking offenses\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and has therefore abandoned any such argument. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
