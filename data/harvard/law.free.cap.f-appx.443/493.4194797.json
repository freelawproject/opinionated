Lewis filed a motion to dismiss the aggravated identity theft count, which the district court denied. Lewis then signed a plea agreement, entering a guilty plea to one count of bank fraud and one count of making, uttering or possessing a forged security of an organization, and entering a conditional plea to the aggravated identity theft count, whereby she reserved the right to appeal the denial of her motion to dismiss. The district court sentenced her to a total of 102 months\u2019 incarceration. She appeals her aggravated identity theft conviction and all of her sentences. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">Lewis signed a \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d establishing the following. From 2001 to 2010, she worked as a bookkeeper and office manager for the Leon County Research and Development Authority (LCRDA). During that time, she embezzled $647,542.83 from LCRDA by forging LCRDA checks made payable to herself and depositing them into her personal bank account. She endorsed the checks using the signature stamp of LCRDA chairman Thomas Barron, without Barron\u2019s knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">After she entered her guilty plea but before she was sentenced, Lewis filed a petition for bankruptcy. In her bankruptcy petition, she failed to disclose that she had previously filed for bankruptcy several years earlier and failed to disclose certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>property when listing her assets. At sentencing, the district court calculated a guidelines range of 70-87 months for the bank fraud and forged security counts, refusing to apply a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility due to the false statements Lewis made in her bankruptcy petition. The district court then sentenced Lewis to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment for the bank fraud and forged security counts, and imposed the mandatory consecutive sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the aggravated identity theft count.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASa\">A. <em>Aggravated Identity Theft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The aggravated identity theft statute prohibits the knowing transfer, possession, or use, without lawful authority, of \u201ca means of identification of another person,\u201d in relation to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1844, the bank fraud statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(1), (c)(5). \u201cMeans of identification\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-7\">any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-8\">(A) name, social security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-9\">(B) unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-10\">(C) unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-12\">(D)telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e) ]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). \u201cAccess device,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1028, is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMv\">any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">Lewis argues that the district court erred when it denied her motion to dismiss the aggravated identity theft charge on the ground that the conduct with which she was charged and to which she admitted\u2014 embezzling money from her employer by creating and passing forged checks \u2014 does not constitute aggravated identity theft. She contends that, because the statutory definition of \u201caccess device\u201d excludes \u201ctransfer[s] originated solely by paper instrument,\u201d the conduct of falsifying a signature on a stolen check and cashing the check does not constitute the knowing transfer, possession, or use, without lawful authority, of \u201ca means of identification of another person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">The flaw in Lewis\u2019s argument is that an \u201caccess device\u201d is only one of several items that Congress listed, in the disjunctive, as a \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). Thus, simply failing to satisfy the definition of \u201caccess device\u201d does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>not end the analysis with respect to whether a signature on a stolen check is a \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d Any name that may be used to identify a specific individual, including the individual\u2019s \u201cname,\u201d will satisfy the definition of \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d even if it does not satisfy the definition of \u201caccess device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the signature of an individual\u2019s name specifically identifies that individual, we conclude that forging another\u2019s signature constitutes the use of a \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d <em>Accord United States v. Blixt, </em>548 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[F]orging another\u2019s signature constitutes the use of that person\u2019s name for the purpose of applying the Aggravated Identity Theft statute.\u201d). Here, the indictment explicitly charged Lewis with using \u201cthe name and signature of T.B.\u201d \u2014 and not an \u201caccess device\u201d \u2014 as a \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d Accordingly, the district court properly denied Lewis\u2019s motion to dismiss the aggravated identity theft count.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">B. <em>Acceptance of Responsibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level reduction in the offense level of a defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for her offense, with an additional one-level reduction possible if the government so moves. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. A district court\u2019s assessment of a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is entitled to great deference, and we review it for clear error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment will not be set aside unless the facts in the record clearly establish that the defendant has accepted responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 1022-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility and must present more than just a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.3. \u201cAlthough a guilty plea may be significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, it may be outweighed by other conduct inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1023; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.3. A district court may consider the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct in deciding whether to apply a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>See United States v. Pace, </em>17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">As it is undisputed that, after pleading guilty, Lewis signed a false petition and submitted false schedules under the penalty of perjury in the bankruptcy proceedings, the district court was entitled to conclude that Lewis\u2019s subsequent conduct negated or outweighed her attempts to accept responsibility by voluntarily turning over assets and pleading guilty. Accordingly, we cannot say that the court clearly erred in concluding that Lewis did not meet her burden of demonstrating acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the legal question of whether an indictment sufficiently alleges a statutorily proscribed offense. <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1045 (11th Cir. 2002). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation. <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
