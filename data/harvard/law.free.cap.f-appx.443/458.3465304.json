Abdelgalel appeals the district court\u2019s order striking his post-judgment application for attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">A.Complaint and Request for EAJA Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In 2005, Abdelgalel filed an application for naturalization with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d). After his application had not been adjudicated for three years, Abdelga-lel brought this mandamus action seeking an order requiring the USCIS to adjudicate his naturalization application and pay attorneys fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Abdelgalel originally filed this mandamus action in the Southern District of Alabama. Abdelgalel\u2019s attorney, Robert Ratliff, is admitted to practice law in Alabama and is a member of the Southern District of Alabama\u2019s bar. Abdelgalel, however, later moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and eventually this mandamus action was transferred to the Middle District of Florida. Ratliff, Abdelgalel\u2019s attorney, is not admitted to practice in Florida and is not a member of the Middle District of Florida\u2019s bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Ultimately, the district court in Florida granted the writ of mandamus, remanded the case to the USCIS to adjudicate the naturalization application within ninety days and stayed Abdelgalel\u2019s attorneys fee request. After the USCIS timely approved Abdelgalel\u2019s naturalization application, Abedelgalel renewed his request for attorneys fees. In a December 14, 2009 order, the district court denied the motion, concluding that Abdelgalel was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">B. December 14, 2009 Order Warning Abdelgalel that Pleadings by Ratliff Would Be Stricken</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">In its December 14, 2009 order, the district court stated, \u201cAny additional filings by Plaintiffs counsel in this case shall be STRICKEN from the record <em>until counsel has been admitted to practice in the Middle District of Florida </em>or until he has filed, and this Court has granted, a motion to appear <em>pro hoc vice </em>in the instant matter.\u201d (Emphasis added). Ratliff then obtained local counsel, Charles Murray, who entered an appearance and signed and filed a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s December 14, 2009 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">C. First Appeal and Post-Remand Pleadings Signed by Ratliff</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">In his first appeal to this Court, Abdel-galel argued that he was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA. This Court agreed and remanded for the district court to address whether Abdelgalel had met the other requirements for an award of attorneys fees under the EAJA. <em>Abdelgalel v. Holder, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 472 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">On remand, Abdelgalel filed his application for the award of attorneys fees and costs totaling $23,199.23. Abdelgalel\u2019s application requested fees only for the work of Alabama attorney Ratliff and two paralegals. Abdelgalel\u2019s application did not request any fees for local Florida counsel Murray. Both Ratliff and Murray signed Abdelgalel\u2019s fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">The government then filed a brief in opposition to any award of attorney\u2019s fees. Abdelgalel then filed a motion, pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(c), requesting leave to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>a reply brief. Both Ratliff and Murray signed this motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The district court denied Abedelgalel\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief because it did not certify that he had conferred with opposing counsel, as required by Local Rule 3.01(g). The district court gave Abdelgalel fourteen days to ref\u00edle a compliant motion for leave, which Abedel-galel did. Both Ratliff and Murray signed this new motion for leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">D. Show Cause Order</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On December 2, 2010, the district court denied Abdelgalel\u2019s motion to file a reply brief. In this same order, the district court gave Abdelgalel fourteen days to show cause why his motion for attorneys fees should not be stricken from the record \u201cfor his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain admittance to practice in the Middle District of Florida or file a motion to appear <em>pro hac vice </em>in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Local counsel Murray signed Abdelga-lel\u2019s response to the show cause order. Abdelgalel\u2019s response explained that all post-appeal pleadings were supposed to be filed by Murray, who was admitted to practice in the Middle District of Florida. Although Ratliff was not admitted to practice in the Middle District Court in Florida, Ratliffs name remained on the fee application because \u201cthe fees sought were attributable almost exclusively to [him].\u201d By mistake, a paralegal shared by Ratliff and Murray electronically transmitted Ab-delgalel\u2019s fee application under the ECF identifier for Ratliff. Abdelgalel argued that although the paralegal made this \u201cadministrative error in transmission,\u201d Murray signed the fee application, indicating that he was \u201cthe attorney for the Plaintiff and that indication should control.\u201d Ratliff did not seek admission <em>pro hac vice. </em>Abdelgalel also did not attempt, or offer, to submit an amended fee application signed by only Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">E. Order Striking Fee Application</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">In a December 15, 2010 order, the district court struck Abdelgalel\u2019s application for attorneys fees \u201cwithout prejudice to a similar motion restricted to those fees incurred by Plaintiffs counsel on appeal, Charles A. Murray, if appropriate.\u201d The district court acknowledged Abdelgalel\u2019s argument that Alabama attorney Ratliffs \u201csignature appears on the motion because the fees sought are attributable almost exclusively to him and the use of his electronic transmittal identifier was merely \u2018an administrative glitch.\u2019 \u201d However, the district court found that this explanation was not sufficient to show cause, concluding \u201c[e]ven so, it is unclear how this explains Mr. Ratliffs prior or continued appearance in this District without proper admittance.\u201d Abdelgalel did not file a separate application for Murray\u2019s attorneys fees and instead filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AG7O\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to entertain Abdelgalel\u2019s appeal because the district court\u2019s December 15, 2010 order, striking Abdelgalel\u2019s attorneys fee application, is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">Generally, our jurisdiction is limited to appeals from final judgments of the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>see also Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2010). Whether we have jurisdiction \u201chinges on the nature of the order,\u201d and \u201cwe take a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>functional approach, looking not to the form of the district court\u2019s order but to its actual effect.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 828-29 (quotation marks omitted). Where, as here, the order on appeal was issued in post-judgment proceedings, the order \u201cis final for purposes of section 1291 only if the order disposes of all issues raised in the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829; <em>see also Delaney\u2019s Inc. v. Illinois Union Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that \u201c[i]f a post-judgment order is apparently the last order to be entered in the action, it is final and appealable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s order struck Abdelgalel\u2019s fee application with prejudice with respect to Ratliffs attorneys fees. Thus, the district court\u2019s order had the effect of denying those attorneys fees and disposing of all issues raised in Abdelga-lel\u2019s attorneys fee application. Although the district court gave Abdelgalel leave to file a new fee application with respect to Murray\u2019s fees (which Abdelgalel had not yet sought), Abdelgalel chose not to do so. Instead, Abdelgalel filed a notice of appeal, thus rendering the district court\u2019s December 15, 2010 order final. <em>Cf. Briehler v. City of Miami, </em>926 F.2d 1001, 1002 (11th Cir.1991) (explaining that an order dismissing a complaint with leave to amend is final when the plaintiff instead elects to file a notice of appeal). Accordingly, appellate jurisdiction exists to review the district court\u2019s December 15, 2010 order striking Abdelgalel\u2019s application for attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">B. District Court\u2019s December 15, 2010 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">On appeal, Abdelgalel argues that the district court abused its discretion when it struck his application for attorneys fees with prejudice as to Ratliff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The Middle District of Florida prohibits an attorney from appearing before it unless the attorney is either a member of The Florida Bar who has been generally admitted to practice before the Middle District of Florida, pursuant to Local Rule 2.01, or is a member in good standing of the bar of a district court outside Florida and has been specially admitted to practice before it, pursuant to Local Rule 2.02.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When \u201cappearing as counsel by filing any paper or pleading,\u201d a specially admitted attorney must also file a \u201cwritten designation and consent-to-act on the part of some member of the bar of [the Middle District of Florida], upon whom all notices and papers may be served and who will be responsible for the progress of the case, including the trial in default of the nonresident attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We afford \u201cgreat deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules\u201d and will not \u201csecond guess\u201d the district court on such grounds. <em>Clark v. Hous. Auth. of City of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727-28 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In addition, the \u201cfederal courts are accorded certain inherent powers\u201d used \u201cto manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d <em>Sahyers v. Prugh, Holliday &amp; Karatinos, P.L., </em>560 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA federal court may wield its inherent power over the lawyers who practice before it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2132, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (stating that the scope of a court\u2019s inherent power includes \u201cthe power to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it\u201d). Similarly, the district court\u2019s power to strike a pleading, like the power to dismiss a claim or action, \u201cis inherent in a trial court\u2019s authority to enforce its orders and ensure prompt disposition of legal actions.\u201d <em>State Exch. Bank v. Hartline, </em>693 F.2d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Here, the district court struck Abdelga-lel\u2019s attorneys fee application for Ratliffs fees with prejudice because: (1) in violation of the district court\u2019s order and Local Rules 2.01 and 2.02, Ratliff, an Alabama attorney, continued to sign pleadings, as attorney of record, filed in the Middle District Court in Florida; and (2) Ratliff was not generally or specially admitted to practice in the Middle District of Florida. By signing pleadings as attorney of record, Ratliff was appearing before the district court in Florida without being properly admitted to practice there.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In its December 14, 2009 order, the district court gave Ratliff and his client notice that any further such pleadings would be stricken from the record. Ratliff appears to have understood the district court\u2019s warning because the next pleading filed, Abdelgalel\u2019s notice of appeal, was signed by only Murray, the local counsel retained specifically to address the district court\u2019s concern. Nonetheless, upon remand from this Court, Ratliff reverted to his former practice of signing the pleadings filed in the district court in Florida. Specifically, Abdelgalel\u2019s application for his attorneys fees and his motion to file a reply brief bore both Ratliffs and Murray\u2019s signatures as attorneys of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Moreover, when the district court alerted Abdelgalel to this fact in its December 2, 2010 show cause order, Abdelgalel did not seek to amend his fee application to correct the defect as to Ratliffs fees. Ab-delgalel also did not ask for more time to permit Alabama counsel Ratliff to obtain special admission in the Middle District of Florida, or even explain why Ratliff had failed to seek such admission, before signing the pleadings. Instead, Abdelgalel argued essentially that Alabama counsel Ratliff did not need to seek special admission to sign the pleadings filed in the Middle District Court in Florida because local counsel Murray also signed and then electronically transmitted the pleadings to the district court. However, a non-resident attorney may not obtain special admission without designating local counsel to act in the event of the non-resident attorney\u2019s default. <em>See </em>Local Rule 2.02(a). Thus, the mere fact that Abdelgalel had local counsel did not permit Ratliff to sign pleadings filed in the district court without being specially admitted. Given Ratliffs protracted failure to seek special admission to the Middle District bar, the district court was within its discretion in concluding that Abdelgalel\u2019s response was insufficient and that striking the fee application with prejudice as to Alabama counsel Ratliff was warranted under the circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Abdelgalel argues that the district court\u2019s sanction was barred by the EAJA, which makes the award of attorneys fees mandatory if the statutory criteria are met. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) (providing that the \u201ccourt <em>shall </em>award to the prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust\u201d (emphasis added)). However, \u201cat least in the absence of very clear words from Congress, we do not presume that a statute supersedes the customary powers of a court to govern the practice of lawyers in litigation before it.\u201d <em>Sahyers, </em>560 F.3d at 1245 n. 6 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 47, 111 S.Ct. at 2134 (stating that \u201cwe do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles such as the scope of the court\u2019s inherent power\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Nothing in the language of the EAJA suggests that Congress intended to abrogate the district court\u2019s traditional inherent powers to enforce its local rules and court orders, to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In addition, Abdelgalel argues that, because attorneys fees awarded under the EAJA are payable to the litigant, <em>see </em>As<em>true v. Ratliff, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2521, 2526-27, 177 L.Ed.2d 91 (2010), the district court\u2019s sanction unfairly punishes Abdelgalel for his Alabama attorney\u2019s actions in Florida. We do not think this fact renders the denial of EAJA attorneys fees unjust in this ease. Although the district court awards the EAJA fees to the litigants, their attorneys are \u201cthe real parties in interest.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 798 n. 6, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 1823 n. 6, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002). Furthermore, as the Supreme Court concluded in the context of an involuntary dismissal, a district court does not abuse its discretion by holding a plaintiff accountable for his retained attorney\u2019s conduct. <em>See, e.g., Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (involving counsel\u2019s failure to attend a scheduled pretrial conference, which resulted in dismissal of the action for failure to prosecute). Abdelgalel \u201cvoluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the act or omissions of this freely selected agent.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 633-34, 82 S.Ct. at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Given the district court\u2019s power to oversee its bar, the deference we afford a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules, and the particular circumstances of this case, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in striking Abdelga-lel\u2019s fee application with prejudice as to Ratliffs attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. Local Rule 3.01(c) prohibits parties from filing a reply brief without first obtaining leave from the district court. Local R. 3.01(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">. We review a district court\u2019s decision to strike a pleading for abuse of discretion. <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 863 (11th Cir.2004). Similarly, \"[w]e review the issuance of sanctions and the denial of a request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sahyers v. Prugh, Holliday &amp; Karatinos, P.L., </em>560 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). A district court does not abuse its discretion when it has \u201ca range of choices and the court's choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A_Q\">. The district courts' authority to promulgate rules governing who may conduct cases before them is conferred by statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. Contrary to Abdelgalel's contention, the district court did not labor under a mistake of fact. The district court understood that both Ratliff and Murray represented Abdelgalel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>that both attorneys signed the pleadings as attorneys of record and that the paralegal\u2019s use of Ratliff's ECF identifier to electronically transmit the attorneys fee application was a mistake. The district court concluded that these facts did not show sufficient cause. As the district court explained, the conduct that violated the district court s order and the Local Rules was not the paralegal\u2019s use of Ratliff's ECF identifier to electronically transmit the pleadings, but Ratliff\u2019s continued appearance in the district court, evidenced by his signing the pleadings, without first being admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
