In this appeal, Hardy argues that the district court erred in (1) denying his Rule 60(b) motion on the ground that the motion was in substance a successive \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) denying his request to treat his Rule 60(b) motion as a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">In the underlying criminal prosecution, Hardy was charged with and pled guilty to two substantive counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. The district court sentenced Hardy as a career offender in light of a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, which at the time constituted a qualifying crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and based on a prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. There is no dispute as to whether Hardy did in fact commit these two offenses. Due to the career offender designation, Hardy\u2019s criminal history designation increased from V to VI, and his base offense level increased from level 26 to 32, which the district court reduced to 29 based on Hardy\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for his crimes. The guideline range for a base offense level of 29 was 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. Without career offender status, Hardy would have had a base offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of V, which would have made the guideline range for his sentence 84 to 105 months. The district court subsequently sentenced Hardy to 151 months of incarceration. Hardy appealed his sentence and claimed that his classification as a career offender was er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>roneous because a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was not a qualifying crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. This court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">After this court denied his appeal, Hardy filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. In this motion, Hardy again raised his claim that his classification as a career offender was in error because his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was not a crime of violence. The district court denied this motion, and Hardy did not appeal. Thereafter, Hardy filed a Rule 60(b)(5) motion which he entitled \u201cMotion to Vacate Judgment, Entered and Resting on a Legal Principle After the Supreme Court\u2019s Abrogation that Can No Longer Under Those Bases Be Sustained.\u201d In this motion, he asserted that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender and was thus improperly sentenced. However, the district court characterized Hardy\u2019s motion as a successive motion to vacate brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and not as a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the sentence. Therefore, the district court dismissed Hardy\u2019s motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because his motion did not meet the requirements of the savings clause \u2014 which allows prisoners to bring a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in limited circumstances as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 \u2014 and the Eleventh Circuit had not given Hardy permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (referring to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(3)(B)). Hardy appealed, and the district court granted a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law;\u201d thus, this court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Collateral attacks on the legality of a federal sentence typically must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>Courts must look past the label of a motion in order to determine its actual legal effect and must treat the motion according to its legal effect, rather than its formal name. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Rule 60(b) motions cannot be used to \u201cevade the second or successive petition bar ... by either adding a new ground for relief or attacking the federal court\u2019s previous rejection of a claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc) </em>(holding that the rule espoused in <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005), which decided that state prisoners could not circumvent the bar on successive habeas petitions by filing Rule 60(b) motions, applies equally to federal prisoners). Therefore, when a federal prisoner seeks to \u201cassert or reassert a claim for relief, instead of pointing out a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>defect in the integrity of the earlier \u00a7 2255 motion preceding in his case ... his motion is the equivalent of a second or successive <em>motion.Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Hardy\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion brought a claim that he was improperly sentenced based on an inappropriate determination that he was a career offender. The district court denied the motion on October 26, 2004, and Hardy did not appeal. Hardy has now filed another motion to vacate his sentence and argues the exact same issue as in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Though he masks this motion as a Rule 60(b) motion, it is attacking a previous rejection of the claim on the merits. Regardless of Hardy\u2019s label of the motion, it is a \u00a7 2255 challenge to the legality of Hardy\u2019s sentence. Therefore, it must be analyzed according to the rules set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for second or successive motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">A second or successive motion cannot be entertained by the district court unless it has first been certified by the appropriate court of appeals as containing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (2011). Hardy did not obtain this court\u2019s authorization for a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Furthermore, this court would not be able to grant such authorization because Hardy cannot satisfy either requirement in \u00a7 2255(h). There is no argument that newly discovered evidence exists, and Hardy does not claim that he is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1318. Therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this motion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003). However, \u00a7 2255(e) does contain a savings clause that will allow a federal prisoner to bring a second or successive habeas motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in certain limited situations without fulfilling the requirements of 28 \u00a7 2255(h). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Pursuant to the savings clause found in \u00a7 2255(e), a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion can be heard by a district court absent authorization by a court of appeals if the federal prisoner can establish that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. In order to take advantage of the savings clause, the federal prisoner must file a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking his conviction and sentence. <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. However, \u201c[t]he existence of the statutory bar on second and successive motions cannot mean that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [Hardy\u2019s] detention within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we recently decided in <em>Gilbert, </em>with facts strikingly similar to the current case, the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) does not permit a prisoner to bring a claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines have been misapplied in determining his sentence if that claim is unavailable because of \u00a7 2255(h)\u2019s bar on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Here, had <em>Archer </em>been decided at the time of Hardy\u2019s sentencing, he would not have been sentenced as a career offender; however, Hardy\u2019s motion seeks to assert or reassert a claim for relief and does not point out a defect in the earlier \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Therefore, it is an impermissible second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion that runs afoul of the bar on such motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>absent authorization from the court of appeals. The statute precludes a different outcome despite the intervening change in the case law interpreting the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Finally, some circuits have broadened the aforementioned \u201cactual innocence\u201d statutory exception found in \u00a7 2255(h) by utilizing the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) to include those situations in which a federal prisoner is confined for an offense that subsequent case law determines does not constitute a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 1318-19. This court has also shown a willingness to allow a prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 motion pursuant to the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause if the Supreme Court decided a \u201cretroactively applicable, circuit law-busting decision\u201d that \u201cestablished that he had been convicted of a <em>nonexistent crime.\" Id. </em>at 1319 (citing <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1242-45 (11th Cir.1999)) (emphasis added). However, a jury of his peers convicted Hardy of two counts of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, and no case law has determined that these offenses do not constitute crimes. Moreover, the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception has only been applied to errors in sentencing when a \u201cconstitutional error resulted in the petitioner becoming statutorily eligible for a death sentence that could not otherwise have been imposed.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 348-50, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2523-25, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992); <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1320. That is not the situation with which we are faced in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">For the aforementioned reasons we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Hardy\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. This section allows federal prisoners to claim a right to be released from imprisonment on the grounds that \"the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or the laws of the United States ... or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aqq\">.
