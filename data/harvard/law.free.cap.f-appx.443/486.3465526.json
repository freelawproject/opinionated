The BIA concluded that Banjoko was removable for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude and entering into a fraudulent marriage, and denied his applications for asylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude punishable by a sentence of at least one year. <em>Vuksanovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>439 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2006) (citing Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 212(a)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1182(a)(2)(A)). Although the term \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is not defined by statute, we consider \u201ccrime[s] involving dishonesty or false statement\u201d as involving moral turpitude. <em>See Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2002). In determining whether a crime involves moral turpitude, we take into account \u201cthe inherent nature of the offense, as defined in the relevant statute, rather than the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s particular conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Banjoko pleaded guilty to \u2014 and was convicted of \u2014 conspiracy to commit witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1512(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1512(b)(1) provides criminal liability for knowingly attempting to intimidate, threaten, or persuade corruptly another person, or engaging in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of a person in an official proceeding. Because the statutory definition of Banjoko\u2019s offense involves dishonesty, it constitutes a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude.\u201d For this reason, and because this offense is punishable by up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. <em>See Vuksa-novic, </em>439 F.3d at 1310. We do, however, retain limited jurisdiction to review whether Banjoko is \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001). We may also consider constitutional claims or questions of law presented for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">We conclude that Banjoko, who is undisputably an alien, is removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of being admitted. The term \u201cadmitted\u201d is defined by statute to mean \u201cthe lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). Here, Banjoko entered the United States in 1994, without inspection, and later adjusted his status to that of a conditional permanent resident on August 13, 1998. In cases such as this one \u2014 where an alien enters the country without inspection and later adjusts his status \u2014 the alien is deemed to have been \u201cadmitted\u201d when he adjusts his status. <em>See In re: Rosas-Ramirez, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 616, 619-23 (B.I.A. 1999) (concluding that an alien who entered the country without inspection was \u201cadmitted\u201d for purposes of INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) when she adjusted her status to that of \u201can alien lawfully admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ted to permanent residence\u201d). Thus, because Banjoko was \u201cadmitted\u201d in August 1998 and committed his offense in May and June 2003 \u2014 less than five years later \u2014 he is removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Banjoko raises two constitutional challenges over which we have jurisdiction. We review constitutional challenges to removal proceedings <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). To establish a due process violation, Banjoko \u201cmust show that [he was] deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused [him] substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42. \u201cTo show substantial prejudice, an alien must demonstrate that, in the absence of the alleged violations, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">At a removal hearing in 2005, the IJ made factual findings about the circumstances of Banjoko\u2019s marriage and concluded that he was removable for entering into a fraudulent marriage. The IJ also determined that the evidence established the allegations in the Notice to Appear, which included that Banjoko was convicted of conspiracy to commit witness tampering, a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. At a second removal hearing in 2009, a second IJ \u2014 in addition to denying Banjoko\u2019s application for asylum and CAT relief \u2014 summarized the evidence from the 2005 removal hearing and determined that Banjoko was removable both for entering into a fraudulent marriage and for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Banjoko argues that the second IJ violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by making factual findings and conclusions of law about his criminal conviction without personally hearing the evidence, observing witnesses, or listening to the parties\u2019 arguments on that issue. Because the evidence about Banjoko\u2019s conviction was already developed fully on the record, the second IJ\u2019s conclusions were consistent with the first IJ\u2019s decision, and the BIA concluded independently that Banjoko was removable for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude, Banjoko fails to establish that \u2014 but for the second IJ\u2019s alleged constitutional error\u2014 the outcome of his removal proceedings would have been different. <em>See Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Banjoko also argues that his Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated when the government presented a written declaration and hearsay testimony in lieu of his alleged wife\u2019s live testimony. Because the challenged evidence was relevant only to Banjoko\u2019s removability for entering into a fraudulent marriage \u2014 and he was ordered removed on an independent ground \u2014 he fails to demonstrate that he suffered substantial prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-18\">. The BIA also denied Banjoko\u2019s application for withholding of removal. Because Ban-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>joko does not challenge this denial on appeal, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. At the removal hearing, the government admitted copies of Banjoko\u2019s judgment and guilty plea, without objection. These documents constituted clear and convincing evidence of his conviction. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A), (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
