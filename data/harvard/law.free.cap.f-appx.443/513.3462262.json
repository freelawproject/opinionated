He filed that motion jointly with his parents, who became eligible for adjustment of status during the course of these proceedings. The motion asked the BIA to reopen the case and remand it to the IJ so that Acu-na-Vargas\u2019 parents could pursue their applications for adjustment of status and so that he could file his own independent application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The BIA issued two decisions on the motion to reopen. One decision granted the motion with respect to Acuna-Vargas\u2019 parents; the other denied it with respect to him. In the decision denying the motion, the BIA observed that a party seeking to reopen proceedings bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to establish a prima facie case of eligibility by submitting affidavits or other evidence that is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">The BIA determined that Acuna-Vargas had not met that standard, pointing out that Acuna-Vargas was instead seeking reopening \u201cdue to his changed personal circumstances, i.e., his parents\u2019 eligibility for adjustment of status, so that he can present an independent application for asylum.\u201d With respect to the evidence he submitted with the motion, the Board concluded that none of it had been \u201cunavailable at the time of the hearing below\u201d or established his prima facie eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The authority for motions to reopen immigration proceedings \u201cderives solely from regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), a \u201cmotion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). We \u201cemploy a very deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision on a motion to reopen regardless of the underlying basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThere are at least three independent grounds upon which the Board may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. at 725).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Acuna-Vargas\u2019 motion to reopen because (1) he failed to establish a prima facie case that he is eligible for the requested relief, as the BIA had already denied his father\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief based on the same proffered evidence, and (2) he failed to present any evidence that was material and previously unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">. In this same decision denying the motion to reopen, the BIA also denied Acuna-Vargas\u2019 motion to reconsider. Acuna-Vargas has not offered any argument on whether the BIA erred in denying the motion to reconsider. As a result, he has abandoned that issue on appeal. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1256 n. 6 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that petitioners had abandoned the issue of whether the IJ should have granted them either asylum or withholding of removal based on membership in a social group by failing to argue that issue on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
