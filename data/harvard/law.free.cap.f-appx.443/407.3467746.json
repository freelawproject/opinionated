(\u201cWestchester\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d). Westchester claims DHHS\u2019s denial of Westchester\u2019s request for permission to depose a DHHS employee was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). After review of the briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to DHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">This case arises from a state court breach-of-contract action brought by Defendant Westchester, to which the federal government and DHHS are not participants. The state court action relates to an agreement between Westchester and Nova Southeastern University (\u201cNova\u201d). Pursuant to that agreement, Westchester used its Medicare provider status to seek reimbursement from Medicare for the costs of Nova\u2019s dental residency program. When Medicare rejected certain reimbursement requests by Westchester, the Westches-ter-Nova agreement deteriorated, leading to the state court lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">Medicare based its reimbursement rejections in part on audits conducted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Debbie Paul, an audit branch manager for DHHS\u2019s intermediary, First Coast Service Options, Inc. Because of Paul\u2019s role in the reimbursement requests, Westchester sought to depose Paul in the state court action. To that end, Westchester sent DHHS a letter requesting permission to take Paul\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">DHHS requires that any request for deposition testimony follow the procedures set forth in its regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.4. More particularly, the request \u201cmust state the nature of the requested testimony, why the information sought is unavailable by any other means, and the reasons why the testimony would be in the interest of the DHHS or the federal government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.4(a). \u201cThe availability of Department employees to testify in litigation not involving federal parties is governed by the Department\u2019s policy to maintain strict impartiality with respect to private litigants and to minimize the disruption of official duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.1(b). The regulations further provide that a DHHS employee may only provide testimony \u201cconcerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties\u201d if it is \u201cauthorized by the Agency head ... based on a determination by the Agency head, after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, that compliance with the request would promote the objectives of the Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In accordance with DHHS\u2019s regulations, Westchester\u2019s deposition request first set forth \u201cthe nature of the requested testimony.\u201d Its request focused on several audits Paul performed of Westchester\u2019s Medicare reimbursement requests for Nova. West-Chester\u2019s letter stated it expected testimony regarding the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">[Paul\u2019s] analysis and conclusions with respect to the Dental Program in connection with the audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2005; the sufficiency of the documentation provided in support of the Dental Program; communications between Ms. Paul and Westchester regarding the Dental Program; and communications between Ms. Paul and Nova regarding the Dental Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Next, Westchester\u2019s letter claimed the information was unavailable by any other means. The letter elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">First Coast has sole access to the requested testimony, records, and information that resulted in the disallowance of substantial costs in Westchester\u2019s costs [sic] reports relating to the dental residency program. Specifically, Ms. Paul oversaw the relevant audits and was in direct contact with Westchester during the course of each audit. Ms. Paul\u2019s review and analysis of the dental program, including her finding of the insufficiency of the documents provided in support of the program, was made directly to Westchester. She was an integral part of the audits of Westches-ter\u2019s cost reports, and her analysis and conclusions with respect to the dental program and [sic] are important elements to the resolution of this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Westchester\u2019s letter concluded that \u201c[a]s discussed above, the testimony is in the interest of DHHS and the Federal Government because it involves the proper admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>istration of the Medicare Program.\u201d No other reasons were provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In a letter dated January 28, 2010, DHHS denied Westchester\u2019s deposition request. After reiterating Westchester\u2019s requested categories of testimony, DHHS stated that in accordance with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4, it \u201cdisagree[d] that the information sought is unavailable by any other means.\u201d DHHS\u2019s letter pointed out that \u201c[t]he parties to this case, themselves, are best able to testify with respect to any direct communications they may have had with Ms. Paul.\u201d The DHHS letter advised that its \u201cdecision to decline the requested testimony is in keeping with the Department\u2019s policy to maintain impartiality with respect to private litigants and to minimize the disruption of official duties in accordance with 45 C.F.R.[ ]2.1.\u201d DHHS then directed Westchester to inform DHHS of any further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Subsequently, Westchester filed a lawsuit in the district court, seeking an order (1) setting aside DHHS\u2019s decision as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and (2) ordering Paul to appear for a deposition. DHHS then filed a motion for summary judgment, which was followed by Westchester\u2019s own summary judgment motion. A magistrate judge held a hearing on the parties\u2019 motions and recommended that the district court grant DHHS\u2019s motion and deny Westchester\u2019s. After consideration of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and the administrative record, the district court adopted the report and granted DHHS\u2019s motion, finding that DHHS\u2019s denial of Westches-ter\u2019s deposition request was not arbitrary or capricious. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) \u00a7 702 provides that \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. Here, DHHS\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs deposition request is agency action subject to judicial review under APA \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">In reviewing an agency action pursuant to valid agency regulations, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard of review used by the district court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702; <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2009). That is, \u201c[t]he reviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Miccosukee Tribe, </em>566 F.3d at 1264. This \u201cexceedingly deferential\u201d standard examines \u201cwhether the [agency] decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">In this case, we cannot say DHHS\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious. DHHS, in rejecting Westchester\u2019s request, stated that it \u201cdisagree[d] that the information is unavailable by any other means.\u201d DHHS explicitly noted that Westchester and Nova \u201care best able\u201d to provide the information concerning their communications with Paul. When read alongside Westchester\u2019s letter, DHHS\u2019s statements demonstrate it considered the relevant factors, as presented in West-chester\u2019s letter, and arrived at a rational conclusion that the information was available from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">An examination of Westchester\u2019s letter readily shows this, for Westchester\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>description of the requested testimony defeats its claim of unavailability. As to the first request for Paul\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusions\u201d regarding the Westchester audits, Westchester\u2019s letter stated: \u201cMs. Paul oversaw the relevant audits and was <em>in direct contact with Westchester </em>during the course of each audit.\u201d As to the second request for Paul\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cthe sufficiency of documentation provided in support of the dental program,\u201d West-chester\u2019s letter stated: \u201cMs. Paul\u2019s review and analysis of the dental program, <em>including her finding of the insufficiency of the documents provided in support of the program, </em>was <em>made directly to Westches-ter.\u201d </em>As to the third and fourth requests for \u201ccommunications between Paul\u201d and Westchester and Nova, Westchester would itself have knowledge of what it communicated to Paul, and could depose Nova employees to similar end. While Westchester might prefer to depose Paul, DHHS\u2019s regulations make no exceptions for party preferences. The regulations inquire only whether the information is otherwise unavailable. Westchester\u2019s letter on its face did not meet its burden under DHHS\u2019s valid <em>Touhy </em>regulations. <em>See Touhy, </em>340 U.S. at 469-70, 71 S.Ct. 416; <em>Moore, </em>927 F.2d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Accordingly, we agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that DHHS\u2019s denial of Westchester\u2019s deposition request was not arbitrary or capricious under APA \u00a7 702. DHHS adequately considered the relevant factors and its decision contained no clear error of judgment. <em>See Fund for Animals, </em>85 F.3d at 541. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of DHHS is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">. Pursuant to the federal \"housekeeping statute,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, executive agencies may promulgate regulations concerning testimony by agency employees. <em>See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, </em>340 U.S. 462, 469-70, 71 S.Ct. 416, 420, 95 L.Ed. 417 (1951); <em>Moore v. Armour Pharm. Co., </em>927 F.2d 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.1991). Regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute are referred to as an agency's <em>\"Touhy </em>\u201d regulations. <em>See, e.g., Hasie v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, </em>633 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
