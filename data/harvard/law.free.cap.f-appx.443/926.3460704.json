He contends that his within guidelines sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. More specifically, Robles argues that, because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and results in \u201cdouble counting\u201d of prior offenses, his guidelines sentence does not merit a presumption of reasonableness. He also maintains that the guidelines range failed to reflect the seriousness of his offense and his benign motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>We need not decide whether, despite his arguments in the district court in support of a downward variance, Robles\u2019s failure to object to the reasonableness of his sentence results in plain error review. <em>Compare United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008), <em>mth United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Robles\u2019s arguments fail under either a plain error or an abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">We have rejected the contention that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to a sentence within the guideline range merely because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data and because it may result in double-counting. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009). Robles\u2019s reliance on his allegedly benign motive for reentering the United States is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA defendant\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Because Robles has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
