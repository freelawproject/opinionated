Grider argues that the district court erred in failing to give a requested jury instruction on the burden of proof for these claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">Since 2001, bars owned by Grider and his brother, including The Skybar Caf\u00e9 (\u201cSkybar\u201d), have been the subject of private complaints and warnings by the City of Auburn Police Department (\u201cAPD\u201d) for serving minors alcohol, fighting, and serving alcoholic beverages after 2:00 a.m. on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Sunday mornings. In 2007, Grider<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued the City of Auburn (the \u201cCity\u201d) and ten City employees in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Alabama state law. Grider alleged that the City was enforcing its laws in a discriminatory manner in order to harass Grider and put Skybar out of business and that several City employees, including Officer Carver, maliciously prosecuted Grider for a fabricated charge of bribing a public official. This is now the second appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">A. First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In the first appeal, multiple defendants, including Officer Carver, appealed the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity and state-law immunity. We affirmed the denial of immunity to Officer Carver on Grider\u2019s malicious prosecution claims under \u00a7 1983 and state law, but we reversed the denial of state-law immunity to the other defendants on the remaining claims. <em>See Grider v. City of Auburn, </em>618 F.3d 1240, 1269 (11th Cir.2010). We remanded for a trial on the malicious prosecution claims against Officer Carver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">B. Trial on the Malicious Prosecution Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Following remand, the district court conducted a jury trial on Plaintiff Grider\u2019s malicious prosecution claims against Officer Carver for charging Grider with bribery of a public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">At trial, Plaintiff Grider called Officer Carver as the first witness. Officer Carver testified that, on September 29, 2005, he and his partner, Officer Jason Crook, were assigned to foot patrol in downtown Auburn. Another officer directed Officers Crook and Carver to investigate possible alcohol violations at Skybar. Officers Crook and Carver proceeded to the back of Skybar, where they saw people drinking but did not see any sales of alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">According to Officer Carver, Grider confronted the officers and showed the officers three $50 bills and told them that if they let Grider \u201cslide there was a dollar bill for each of [them].\u201d Grider placed the money on the ground and walked away. Officer Carver testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d and immediately called his supervisor to report the attempted bribery. Officer Carver\u2019s supervisor told him to collect the money, enter the money into evidence, and complete a report of the incident. Officer Carver complied and did not arrest Grider that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The next day, Officer Carver signed an \u201cAffidavit Charging Crime,\u201d charging that Grider attempted to bribe Carver with $150 in folded currency. Carver\u2019s affidavit also states that the bribery was attempted so Carver would not enforce \u201cAuburn City ordinance 3-1(11), which The Sky Bar was in violation because it was still open serving alcohol after 2am.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the arrest warrant, signed by the \u201cClerk, District/Circuit Court,\u201d charged Grider with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 ISA-10-61 (the bribery statute),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and mentions no underlying violation of a city alcohol ordinance. Officer Carver consistently testified that Grider placed the three $50 bills on the ground as a bribe. As to Skybar\u2019s serving alcohol, Officer Carver acknowledged at trial that he had not seen anyone actually served alcohol at Skybar that night; he merely saw people who already had drinks in their hands. Officer Crook\u2019s testimony largely confirmed Officer Carver\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">For his part, Plaintiff Grider testified and denied ever offering the officers money to bribe them not to enforce any law. Grider testified that, on the night of the incident, Skybar was not admitting any new customers. Although a few people remained at the bar, most of them were employees. Grider testified that Dale Earnhardt, Jr., was in the bar that night and that he was \u201changing out\u201d with Mr. Earnhardt when an employee informed Grider that two police officers were in the back alley. Grider walked outside behind the bar to talk to the officers. Grider asked the officers whether everything was okay, and the officers responded that the back door to the bar was ajar. Grider responded that he knew about the problem and that no one had broken in.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Plaintiff Grider then said that Mr. Earnhardt was in the bar and that some people might be drinking. Grider clarified that the bar was no longer serving alcohol. Officer Carver then said either \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s about to happen to you\u201d or \u2018You know what\u2019s about to happen to you.\u201d Grider responded that the officers were welcome to go into the bar to check that no one was being served alcohol. However, Grider asked the officers to wait to come in so \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be insinuated that [Grider] ... brought the police in.\u201d Nevertheless, Grider told the officers, \u201cIt would be great if you didn\u2019t go in.\u201d Grider then walked back into the bar. Grider denied putting any money on the ground and denied promising the officers anything. Grider first learned about the bribery accusation at the preliminary hearing on the bribery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">During the defense case-in-chief, Officer Carver testified about what happened at the preliminary hearing before the state magistrate judge on the warrant for Gri-der\u2019s arrest. Officer Carver\u2019s understanding was that the state magistrate judge dismissed the charge for lack of probable cause because he and Officer Crook \u201cdidn\u2019t articulate observing a specific alcohol violation, meaning [they] didn\u2019t articulate it at the preliminary hearing that [they] saw somebody at the Skybar sell, serve or provide alcohol, that there was no violation and, therefore, no underlying offense for the bribery to have influenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The magistrate judge\u2019s written order\u2014 which was admitted at the beginning of trial without objection \u2014 states: \u201cThere DOES NOT exist probable cause to believe that [Grider] committed the offense as charged in the Complaint,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and as such, the Complaint is DISMISSED, and [Gri-der] is DISCHARGED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Before resting, Officer Carver moved for admission into evidence of a portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>transcript from the preliminary hearing before the state magistrate judge. According to the transcript, the state magistrate judge stated that there was probable cause to believe that Grider bribed a police officer \u201cto prevent an investigation of an alcohol offense\u201d but there was no probable cause to believe that Grider bribed an officer \u201cso he would not enforce an [alcohol] ordinance\u201d as there was no evidence Skybar was committing that alcohol violation that night.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Grider objected to the admission of the transcript on several grounds, and the district court sustained Grider\u2019s objection and refused to admit the transcript. The district court noted that the transcript was irrelevant because the jury \u201cshould be assessing the issue of probable cause ... not based on whether the State found it or didn\u2019t find it, but based on what the evidence showed in this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">At the charge conference, Plaintiff Gri-der argued that the state magistrate judge had dismissed the charge for lack of probable cause as to bribery and thus the burden of proof shifted to Officer Carver to prove that he had probable cause to charge Grider with bribery. Grider requested the following Alabama Pattern Jury Instruction for both his state and federal malicious prosecution claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">Where the Plaintiff is discharged by a Court of law for lack of probable cause, such fact is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of lack of probable cause for instituting the prosecution by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">This presumption of the lack of probable cause places the burden of proof on Defendant Carver to reasonably satisfy you from the evidence that he had probable cause for instituting the prosecution against Mr. Grider.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Declining to give the requested Alabama instruction as to the state-law claim, the district court reasoned, <em>inter alia, </em>that the state magistrate judge never reached \u201cthe issue of bribery.\u201d The district court also found that the Alabama instruction would not apply to the federal malicious prosecution claim for similar reasons and for the additional reason that the court could find no similar instruction requiring shifting the burden of proof under federal law. Grider objected that the Alabama instruction should be given on both the federal and state malicious prosecution claims and argued that Grider never stipulated as to \u201cwhy probable cause was determined not to exist.\u201d The district court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Accordingly, the district court instructed the jury without giving Plaintiff Grider\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>requested burden-shifting jury instruction. The district court instructed the jury that Grider had the burden of proof on each element of his malicious prosecution claims. Additionally, the court noted, \u201cThe fact that the state court may or may not have found probable cause is not determinative. You, the jury, must independently decide that issue from the evidence presented in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The jury returned a verdict for Officer Carver and against Grider on both the state and the federal malicious prosecution claims. The district court entered judgment for Officer Carver in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, and Grider timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On appeal, Plaintiff Grider argues that the district court erred in failing to give the burden-shifting jury instruction because the instruction accurately stated Alabama law on his state-law claim for malicious prosecution. Grider argues that he suffered prejudice because the district court\u2019s instructions placed the burden of proof on the wrong party and, if properly instructed, the jury could have found Officer Carver liable for malicious prosecution. Regarding the federal malicious prosecution claim, Grider argues that this Court should adopt the Alabama burden-shifting framework \u201cas an accurate statement of federal common law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cWe review jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the party who objects to them.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008). However, \u201cthe standard is deferential, [and][a]s long as the instructions accurately reflect the law, the district court is afforded wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., </em>551 F.3d 1233, 1283 (11th Cir.2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u201cWe examine the challenged instructions as part of the entire charge, in view of the allegations of the complaint, the evidence presented, and the arguments of counsel, to determine whether the jury was misled and whether the jury understood the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and quotation marks omitted). If the instructions, \u201ctaken together, properly express the law applicable to the case, there is no error even though an isolated clause may be inaccurate, ambiguous, incomplete or otherwise subject to criticism.\u201d <em>Somer v. Johnson, </em>704 F.2d 1473, 1477-78 (11th Cir.1983) (quotation marks omitted). We reverse only if \u201cleft with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1478 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">After review of the record, we conclude that Grider has not shown reversible error in the district court\u2019s declining to give his particular requested burden-shifting instruction. Although Grider\u2019s requested instruction was an accurate statement of Alabama law in the abstract, Grider failed to establish that the requested instruction was applicable to the factual circumstances of his case. Although the district court did not admit the transcript for the jury to review, the district court was entitled to consider the transcript in deciding the basis for the state magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal and thus how to charge the jury as to the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The transcript showed that the state magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal focused on the lack of evidence that Grider actually violated the city alcohol ordinance and not on whether Grider actually placed the $150 on the ground in an attempt to bribe Officers Carver and Crook. In fact, the state magistrate judge stated that he thought there was probable cause to believe that Grider bribed an officer \u201cto prevent an investigation of an alcohol offense.\u201d Given the state magistrate judge\u2019s narrow reason for dismissing the complaint and its statement that there was probable cause for the bribery (albeit for a different motive on Grider\u2019s part), we conclude that Grider did not sufficiently establish that the district court was required to give Grider\u2019s burden-shifting instruction on the malicious prosecution claim under Alabama law. In other words, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in how it read the state magistrate judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">As to Plaintiff Grider\u2019s argument that we should adopt the Alabama burden-shifting framework as federal common law, we decline to address the issue because, as stated above, we conclude that the requested instruction was inapplicable in light of the factual circumstances of this case. Grider had the burden of proof on each element of his malicious prosecution claims, and the district court correctly instructed the jury to determine the existence of probable cause based on the trial evidence, which included the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal order as well as testimony of all the witnesses to the alleged bribery. In fact, the district court aided Gri-der\u2019s case by sustaining his objection to the jury\u2019s seeing the transcript of the state magistrate judge\u2019s explanation of the more complete basis for the dismissal. The jury charge, as a whole, correctly framed the issue as a swearing match between Grider and the police officers, and we find no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. Plaintiff Grider's brother, Daniel Grider, and The Fourth Quarter \u2014 a company owned by the Griders \u2014 were also plaintiffs in the district court. However, Daniel Grider and The Fourth Quarter were voluntarily dismissed as appellants in this second appeal. Patrick Grider remains the sole appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">. Although we also rejected Officer Carver\u2019s and Officer Jason Crook\u2019s claims to immunity on Grider's tortious interference claims under state law, the parties subsequently agreed to dismiss the tortious interference claims. Thus, these claims are not before us in this second appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-15\">.Officer Carver's affidavit, which was admitted into evidence without objection at the beginning of trial, incorrectly states that the events occurred on September 19, 2005, instead of September 29, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. Section 13A-10-61(a)(l) of the Alabama Code states a person commits bribery if \u2018\u2018[h]e offers, confers or agrees to confer any thing of value upon a public servant with the intent that the public servant\u2019s vote, opinion, judgment, exercise of discretion or other action in his official capacity will thereby be corruptly influenced....\" The arrest warrant appears on the same page, but below Officer Carver\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\">.

The complaint states that [Grider] was charged with bribing a public official so he would not enforce an [alcohol] ordinance which there\u2019s no evidence he was committing. So as the case is before this Court, at this time, I don't see where I have any choice but to say there's no probable cause to believe this offense, as described in the complaint, has been committed. And that will be the Court\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AB0\">.
