Before us in this appeal is Count IX of an amended complaint against the City and David L. Moore (\u201cMoore\u201d), in his capacity as Director of the SWFWMD; the EPA and its Administrators have been dismissed by stipulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The gravamen of Count IX is that the City\u2019s \u201cNPDES MS4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> discharges into the Clam Bayou estuary are ... violating the CWA [Clean Water Act] by continuing to cause and contribute to the ongoing violations of the water quality standards of D.O, Nutrients, Mercury, and Acute Toxicity (stormwater sediment contamination)\u201d and that Moore is the ... government official with the responsibility to have SWFWMD\u2019s stormwater discharges to Clam Bayou as a co-permittee of the City\u2019s MS4 permit comply with the limitations of the NPDES MS4 permit for the stormwa-ter discharges to Clam Bayou. The SWFWMD\u2019s MS4 discharges into the Clam Bayou estuary are ... violating the CWA by causing and contributing to the ongoing violations of the water quality standards of D.O, Nutrients, Mercury, and Acute Toxicity (stormwater sediment contamination). Amend. Comp, at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The district court granted the City\u2019s and Moore\u2019s respective motions to dismiss Count IX pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Appellants appeal those rulings and the district court\u2019s denial of their motions to alter and amend judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss because Appellants \u201cfailed to show the City\u2019s discharge of storm water exceeded the amount authorized by its [NPDES] permit; therefore, [Appellants] failed to meet the standing requirement of the Clean Water Act.\u201d Order, July 19, 2010 at 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its order denying Appellants\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion, the court adhered to this holding and added this, as an additional basis for granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss: \u201cThis Court finds no merit in the [Appellant\u2019s] \u2018water quality standard\u2019 argument because [Appellants] fail to demonstrate any convincing facts or law to reverse the Court\u2019s apprehension of the effluent limitations of the [M]S4 permit. Therefore, the Court did not err in granting the City\u2019s Motion to Dismiss as the [Appellant\u2019s] lack of standing.\u201d Order, November 18, 2010. We find no error in the district court\u2019s July 19 order, or an abuse of discretion in its November 18 order.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajfx\">The district court granted Moore\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the relief Appellants sought was retrospective and therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that the <em>Ex Parte Young </em>doctrine did not apply. Order, July 19, 2010. In ruling on Appellants\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion, the court recognized that the doctrine applied to Appellants\u2019 claim for prospective relief but denied the motion because Appellants \u201cdo not have a claim under the Clean Water Act.\u201d Order, February 22, 2011 at 11. That is, Appellants \u201cfail[ed] to allege that ... Moore and the City have actually violated the permit conditions of the NPDES MS4 permit ... to explicitly state what permit conditions [the City and Moore] are exactly violating.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AE5\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\">. Appellants\u2019 amended complaint substituted Moore in his official capacity for defendant SWFWMD. Counts X and XI are state law claims against the City and Moore based on continuing trespass and nuisance. After dismissing Appellant's federal claim, Count IX, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Counts X and XI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">. NPDES is an acronym for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. MS4 standards for Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems. \"Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators [e.g., municipalities] must obtain a NPDES permit and develop a stormwa-ter management program.\u201d U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/munic. cfm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AkQ\">. Appellants failed to show that the discharge exceeded the amount authorized because they only alleged that the \"City discharges 98% of the permitted discharges into Clam Bayou.\u201d Order, July 19, 2010 at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ASI\">. In his brief in Appeal No. 11-11137, Moore represented that he, meaning SWFWMD, is not a co-permitee with the City. He said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfS\">In a futile attempt to support a claim against Mr. Moore for \"Violation of NPDES MS4 Permit Limitation\u201d (Count IX of the amended complaint), the Davises assert in their initial brief that Mr. Moore is \"a co-permittee of the [City's] MS4 permit,\u201d citing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(l)(b) for this assertion. However, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(I)(b) defines a \"co-permittee\u201d as \"a permittee to a NPDES permit that is only responsible for permit conditions relating to the discharge for which it is the operator.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Mr. Moore is clearly not a per-mittee to the City's NPDES MS4 permit <em>(see </em>Dist.App. 1 (MS4 Permit issued solely to the City)), and he is not a co-permittee as defined by section 122.26(1 )(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6b\">The district court, in denying Appellants' Rule 59(e) motion, apparently assumed for sake of argument that Moore, i.e., SWFWMD, was a co-permittee with the City.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
