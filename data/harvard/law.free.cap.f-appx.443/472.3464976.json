On appeal, Murillo argues that: (1) the government failed to establish that a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(1) was defrauded or otherwise affected by her conduct; and (2) her prosecution was barred by the 5-year statute of limitations applicable to wire fraud cases. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2011). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations <em>de novo. United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">First, we are unpersuaded by Mu-rillos\u2019 argument that the government failed to establish that a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d was defrauded. In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor. <em>Friske, </em>640 F.3d at 1290-91. A jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>dence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. The evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial. <em>Id. </em>When the government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences, not mere speculation, must support the conviction. <em>Id. </em>Any arguments not \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d briefed are deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">To sustain a conviction for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, the government must establish: (i) intentional participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud another of money or property, and (ii) use of wires for the purpose of executing the scheme or artifice. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2007). The mail and wire fraud statutes criminalize unexe-cuted as well as executed schemes, so proof that the victim actually relied on the misrepresentation or omission is not necessarily required. <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1239 (11th Cir.2011). Where a trial judge instructs a jury, without objection, that a certain element is required to convict, that element becomes necessary for a conviction under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine. <em>United States v. Spletzer, </em>535 F.2d 950, 954 (5th Cir.1976). A person convicted of violating \u00a7 1343 may be imprisoned up to 20 years, unless the violation \u201caffects a financial institution,\u201d in which case the offender may be imprisoned up to 30 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. \u201cFinancial institution\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201can insured depository institution (as defined in [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(c)(2) ]).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(1). \u201cInsured depository institution\u201d is defined as \u201cany bank or savings association the deposits of which are insured by the [FDIC].\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(c)(2). In the context of another criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657, we have recognized that depleting the assets of a wholly-owned subsidiary reduces the value of its stock, and thus diminishes the parent\u2019s assets. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>632 F.2d 1290, 1292 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Here, the indictment charged Murillo with \u201cWire Fraud Affecting a Financial Institution,\u201d and the district court instructed the jury that one of the elements of the crime was that \u201cthe scheme affected a financial institution.\u201d Accordingly, in order to convict Murillo, the government was required to prove that the fraudulent scheme in which she engaged affected a financial institution. <em>See Spletzer, </em>535 F.2d at 954. A reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that Murillo\u2019s fraud affected a financial institution. The government elicited testimony that, as part of her loan application, Murillo acknowledged that the loan would be sold to a financial institution. The loan was later sold to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Inc., a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, which is FDIC-insured. Murillo defaulted on her loan, and a foreclosure action was instituted. The government also elicited testimony that late mortgage payments to a subsidiary such as Wells Fargo Home Mortgage have an effect on the parent financial institution, <em>ie., </em>Wells Fargo Bank, and that Murillo\u2019s arrears were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>owed to Wells Fargo Bank. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it denied Murillo\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We also reject Murillo\u2019s claim that her prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348, if the offense \u201caffects a financial institution,\u201d is 10 years after the commission of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3293(2). All other violations of \u00a7 1343 are subject to a 5-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">For the reasons discussed above, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Murillo\u2019s fraud affected a financial institution. She was indicted less than 8 years after she committed the fraud, and well within the applicable 10-year statute of limitations. She has not cited any authority in support of her suggestion that an actual loss must have been suffered for the 10-year statute of limitations to apply, and neither \u00a7 1343 nor \u00a7 3293 contain any such requirement. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 3293(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-5\">. In <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent all decisions issued by the Fifth Circuit before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">. In addition, Murillo has elaborated no arguments in support of her conclusory assertion that the government was required to prove that she \"defrauded\u201d a \"financial institution.\u201d Therefore, this argument is deemed abandoned. <em>See Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1283 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
