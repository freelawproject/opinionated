Smith contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of two witnesses regarding their reactions after hearing from federal agents about the threats that Smith had made against them. Smith also contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In March 2009 Smith was convicted after a jury trial of being a felon in possession of ammunition. Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Bordenkircher served as lead prosecutor for Smith\u2019s case, and United States District Judge William Steele presided over the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in jail awaiting sentencing for his conviction, Smith made multiple threats on the lives of Judge Steele and AUSA Bordenkircher in the presence of his cellmate, Paul Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Albert, who was scheduled to be released from prison about a week before Smith\u2019s sentence hearing, informed law enforcement authorities of the threats, and the next day a federal agent equipped him with a recording device. That device recorded two conversations between Albert and Smith in which Smith discussed in detail his plans to hire a \u201chit man\u201d through Albert to kill Judge Steele, Bordenkircher, and a few other individuals who were involved in his case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, in discussing how the murders were to be carried out Smith stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">They need to never be able to fuckin\u2019 find a hair, a splatter, or fuckin\u2019 bullet in the wall, fuckin\u2019 nothing. They need to be wiped off the face of the earth. They need to go fuckin\u2019 look in fuckin\u2019 Kathmandu, fucking kingdom fuckin\u2019 come, where the fuck in Africa, Peru, Brazil, the fuckin\u2019 Himalayans, [sic] whereever [sic] they fuckin\u2019 look, and look, and look, and look, and look, and look, and look, they don\u2019t find any fuckin\u2019, needs to be no fuckin\u2019 heads. Needs to be no fuckin\u2019 skulls. No fuckin\u2019 teeth. No bones. They need to be, we\u2019re not pay-in\u2019 for them just to fuckin\u2019 be killed. We\u2019re paying for a perfect fuckin\u2019 erasing. The only one left is gonna be Cur-ran. Understand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">When Albert questioned Smith about whether Smith would actually pay for the hit, Smith replied: \u201cYeah. Positive. Absolutely one hundred and ten percent sure. The only way, the only way that they\u2019re not fuckin\u2019 get [sic] paid is if I fuckin\u2019, it didn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 happen or I fuckin\u2019 die.\u201d And when Albert warned Smith of the consequences of not paying, Smith said: \u201cYeah, I understand it\u2019s my life. I understand. You don\u2019t think I understand the seriousness of this? Come on now.... I completely understand the seriousness .... \u201d Smith also asked Albert if he was wearing a wire to which Albert replied: \u201cNo. Are you crazy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Additionally, when Albert warned Smith of the breadth of the investigation that would result from killing a federal judge and a federal prosecutor, Smith replied: \u201cI already knew that. That\u2019s why I said fuckin\u2019 Steele don\u2019t need to be killed. He needs to have a fuckin\u2019 stroke. Borden-kireher needs to fuckin\u2019 disappear.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>And the only one they need to have a body for is fuckin\u2019 Curran.\u201d When Albert asked Smith if he was sure he wanted Judge Steele and Bordenkircher killed, Smith stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">It\u2019s got to be done perfect and we\u2019re, we\u2019re losin\u2019 fuckin\u2019 time. When them motherfuckers sentence me on the fuc-kin\u2019 seventeenth, fuckin\u2019 that judge denies all of my attorney\u2019s fuckin\u2019 motions and sends my ass to fuckin\u2019 federal prison, the game\u2019s up. I\u2019m, I\u2019m left in the fuckin\u2019 hands of some motherfuckers in Atlanta that have got fuckin\u2019 political connections with these same son of a bitches here. Come on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In addition to making those threats and several other similar threatening statements, Smith discussed the assets he would use to pay for the murders, such as a Rolex watch, a used car, and Pancho Villa\u2019s sword, which Smith claimed were valued at over $1 million and all of which were verified by federal agents as existing assets Smith owned or had access to. Smith also discussed his plan to implicate Judge Steele, Bordenkircher, and the other individuals he planned to have killed in a criminal conspiracy to frame him through several phony emails and letters he had prepared. The emails were to be planted on the victims\u2019 computers, and the letters, which Albert was going to sneak out of prison in his cane, were to be placed at the murder scenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">After his conversations with Albert, Smith met with an undercover police officer posing as an associate of Albert and inquired about obtaining a cell phone, which Smith needed to shore up the final details of his murderous plot and successfully orchestrate it from jail. Smith was later interviewed by federal agents and denied ever making \u201cany comments about wanting to injure or harm Judge Steele or ... Bordenkircher.\u201d Federal agents informed Judge Steele and Bordenkircher of the threats, but it is not clear from the record what the federal agents told them. After receiving that information, both Judge Steele and Bordenkircher took additional security measures to protect themselves and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Smith was indicted on two counts of retaliation against federal officials by threat, two counts of solicitation to commit murder, and one count of making false statements to federal agents. At trial, the government introduced testimony from federal agents and other law enforcement officials involved in the undercover investigation of Smith. The government also played for the jury the audio recordings of Smith\u2019s conversations with Albert and his conversation with the undercover police officer posing as Albert\u2019s associate. Over the objection of Smith, the government also introduced testimony from Borden-kircher and Judge Steele regarding the security measures they took after hearing from federal agents about Smith\u2019s threats. Smith also took the stand and testified that he did not intend to follow through on his threats. He testified that he was merely going along with Albert and putting on a show because he was fearful of Albert and his ties to a Latin gang. After a two-and-a-half day trial, the jury found Smith guilty on all five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Smith\u2019s guidelines range for all five counts was a combined adjusted offense level of 44, which was adjusted down to a total offense level of 43. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, cmt. n. 2. With a criminal history category of V, the advisory sentencing guidelines recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. After hearing arguments from both sides and considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed consecutive statutory maximum sentences for each count resulting in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>total sentence of 780 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Smith contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of Judge Steele and Bordenkircher regarding their reactions after being informed of the threats Smith had made and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">We review a district court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wetherald, </em>636 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2011). Errors in evi-dentiary rulings, however, \u201cdo not constitute grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that they affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; where an error had no substantial influence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict, reversal is not warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). In other words, we will not reverse a conviction when the district court abuses its discretion in admitting evidence if we determine that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Phalmikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1109-11 (11th Cir.2010). For that determination, \u201cwe view the entire record\u201d and \u201c[t]he government bears the burden of establishing that an error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. \u201cOverwhelming evidence of guilt is one factor that may be considered in finding harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Smith\u2019s alleged errors focus on the admission of the testimony regarding the reactions of Judge Steele and Borden-kircher after federal officers informed them of Smith\u2019s threat on their lives. But even if we assume that testimony should not have been admitted, there is no reasonable likelihood that its admission, given the other unchallenged evidence, had a substantial influence on the outcome. The federal agent in charge of the investigation testified that she put a wire on Albert after receiving information that Smith was threatening the lives of federal officials, that she found the letters Smith had written to be planted on the murder victims rolled up in Albert\u2019s cane, and that she had verified the existence of the assets Smith had said he would put up as payment for the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The' jury heard audio recordings of Smith\u2019s conversations with Albert in which he planned and prepared to have the judge and the prosecutor killed. Additionally, Smith testified at trial that he had no intention of following through with his murder-for-hire scheme. The jury by finding him guilty necessarily disbelieved his testimony, and that disbelief may be considered as substantive evidence against him. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 315 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201c[WJhen a defendant chooses to testify, he runs the risk that if disbelieved the jury might conclude the opposite of his testimony is true.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). There was ample unchallenged evidence for the jury to find Smith guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, making the alleged evidentiary errors harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Smith also contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He argues that the district court\u2019s explanation of his sentence was inadequate, rendering the sentence procedurally unreasonable. Smith also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the statutory minimum sentence for his convictions \u2014 180 months imprisonment \u2014 would have been adequate to deter him and protect the public from future harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We review the reasonableness of a sentence only for an abuse of discretion, using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court \u201clisten[s] to the evidence and arguments and [is] aware of the various factors [a] defendant put forward for a lesser sentence\u201d while stating it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it does not procedurally err by failing to give a detailed explanation of the sentence. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, considering \u201cthe totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. We will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The district court\u2019s explanation for Smith\u2019s sentence was adequate. The court listened to extensive arguments from Smith\u2019s counsel and from Smith himself. The court also stated that it had reviewed the relevant portions of the record, that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines, and that the sentence reflected \u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d and met the statutory goals of punishment and general and specific deterrence. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1194-95. Smith has not shown that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">He has also failed to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He argues that the statutory minimum of 180 months imprisonment would have been adequate to deter him and to protect the public, even though the sentencing guidelines recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. The district court expressed concern about the seriousness of the offense and the need for just punishment and deterrence. Given the guidelines recommendation, the seriousness of the offense, the need to deter others from threatening the lives of federal officials, and the district court\u2019s careful weighing of those factors, Smith has not left us with a definite and firm conviction that the court committed a clear error of judgment by imposing a 780-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. Judge Steele had also presided over a 2007 civil case in which a default judgment was entered against Smith for over $1 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AES\">. Smith also planned to have three others killed as part of his scheme \u2014 a local sheriff\u2019s deputy, a former business partner, and a newspaper reporter named Eddie Curran.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
