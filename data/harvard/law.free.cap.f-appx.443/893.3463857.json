He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); that he returned to the United States to take care of his wife\u2019s twin sons while their infant daughter was in the hospital; that his wife has decided to relocate to Mexico when he is released from prison; that the 16-level increase to his offense level was greater than necessary because his prior robbery offense was not violent; and that the guidelines overstated the seriousness of his prior illegal reentry offense. Ramirez-Guerra raised the above arguments for a lesser sentence in the district court and, therefore, he preserved for appeal his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">Ramirez-Guerra further contends that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to the sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacked an empirical basis and double-counted his criminal history, because the \u201cfast track\u201d program results in unwarranted sentencing disparities, and because his illegal reentry was merely a trespass offense. Because he did not raise these arguments in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">The 46-month within-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is substantively reasonable. After considering the Presentence Report and Ramirez-Guerra\u2019s arguments, the district court made an individualized sentencing decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>based on the facts of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We have previously rejected the arguments concerning double-counting and that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Ramirez-Guerra concedes that his arguments concerning the lack of an empirical basis and the fast track program are also foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). Ramirez-Guerra\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
