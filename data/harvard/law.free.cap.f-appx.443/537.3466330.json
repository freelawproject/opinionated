Knight contends that the district court clearly erred in not granting him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Knight was arrested after a Drug Enforcement Administration informant arranged to purchase cocaine from someone else through Knight. After being advised of his Miranda rights, Knight admitted that he had done \u201cat least a hundred\u201d similar deals over a period of five years. Knight was indicted for conspiracy to distribute, and possess with intent to distribute, 500 or more grams of cocaine. While Knight did not concede guilt at trial, he presented no defense and generally contested only the amount of drugs. A jury was unable to determine whether he was responsible for that amount of cocaine, and he was convicted of a lesser included offense. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The presentence investigation report assigned Knight a base offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(6) and did not apply a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. Knight objected to the base offense level calculation and to the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. At the sentence hearing, the district court agreed that the PSR incorrectly calculated the amount of drugs involved and reduced the base offense level to 26 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Also at the sentence hearing, Knight stated, \u201cI wasn\u2019t that picture they painted of me being a drug dealer. I was just a drug user.\u201d He also suggested a recording of his statement \u201cwould have made a big difference,\u201d because the DEA was \u201cbasically telling a lie.\u201d The district court denied the acceptance of responsibility reduction. It explained that Knight\u2019s statements were inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility because he still denied being a drug dealer. Knight\u2019s offense level of 26 and his criminal history category of VI resulted in a guidelines range of 120 to 150 months, and the court sentenced him to 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">\u201cWe review a denial of a reduction of sentence for an acceptance of responsibility for clear error, and that finding is entitled to great deference on review and should not be disturbed unless it is -without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). The district court denied the \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction based on Knight\u2019s own statements at the sentence hearing. In light of those statements, we cannot say the court erred, much less clearly erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
