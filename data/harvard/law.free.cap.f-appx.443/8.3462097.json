Buie, Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Dallas, TX, Mattie Nell Peterson Compton, Esq., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-17\">Angelee Bazemore, Ivins, UT, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b30-19\">Before GARZA, SOUTHWICK, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-21\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b30-22\">Vincent John Bazemore, Jr., federal prisoner # 37160-177, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was sentenced to imprisonment, supervised release, and restitution. His wife, Angelee Bazemore (Angelee) moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in her appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of her motions to intervene and for the return of property pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-23\">By moving for IFP status here, Angelee is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Angelee asserts that she is entitled to the return of her property pursuant to Rule 41(g) because (1) the affidavit in support of the seizure contained false statements; (2) the search warrant did not recite sufficient probable cause; (3) the seizures violated Bazemore\u2019s proffer agreement with the Government; and (4) the restitution order is illegal. However, she did not raise any of these arguments in the district court. We do not consider these new issues for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-24\">Angelee also states that she is entitled to intervene and is entitled to the return of property under Rule 41(g) because she is the \u201cowner\u201d of the property and/or because the property is her \u201csole management community property.\u201d However, Angelee has not adequately briefed this issue, and thus she has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, she has not shown that her appeal involves \u201clegal points argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>able on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Angelee\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and her appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b30-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
