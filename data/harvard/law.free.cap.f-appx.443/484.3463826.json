No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">In his motion to compel, Ford sought disclosure of grand jury testimony related to his second superseding indictment. Ford argued that he needed the records\u2014 in pertinent part, the testimony of Detective Richard Mills, Jr., from the third grand jury proceeding \u2014 to aid him in pursuing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate and sought disclosure \u201cto prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d On appeal, Ford argues that the government violated the Jencks Act by failing to provide him with the testimony and also argues that Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) authorized disclosure of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to disclose grand jury materials is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d 1327, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). In addition, we construe liberally pro se pleadings. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). After review, we conclude that Ford has shown no basis for disclosure of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">The Jencks Act requires the government to disclose certain statements of its trial witnesses \u2014 including statements by the witness to a grand jury \u2014 following their direct examination. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b), (e)(3). But disclosure under the Act must occur during trial to allow defendant to obtain information to use in cross-examining the government\u2019s witness. The remedy for the government\u2019s failure to comply is for the testimony of the witness to be stricken from the record. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(d). Because Ford\u2019s convictions are final, these remedies are unavailable; and the Jencks Act provides Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>with no post-conviction basis to seek disclosure of the disputed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Rule 6(e) \u2014 under which Ford also seeks relief \u2014 codifies the expectation of secrecy of grand jury proceedings, except in limited circumstances. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3). And here, Ford\u2019s motion to compel does not fit within the relevant exception to Rule 6(e)(3). Ford did not seek disclosure \u201cpreliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i). For a request to be \u201cin connection with\u201d a judicial proceeding, a proceeding must already be pending. <em>United States v. Baggot, </em>463 U.S. 476, 103 S.Ct. 3164, 3166-67, 77 L.Ed.2d 785 (1983). Ford\u2019s criminal conviction already is final, and he has not yet filed a section 2255 motion to vacate. And Ford failed to identify any actual use of the grand jury transcripts to support anticipated litigation: not preliminary to a judicial proceeding. <em>See Baggot, </em>103 S.Ct. at 3167.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Because Ford\u2019s motion did not meet the relevant exception of Rule 6(e)(3), the district court had inherent authority to consider the merits of his request only if there were \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d at 1347. But the record shows that the government met its obligation pursuant to the Jencks Act on the third day of trial when it provided Ford\u2019s lawyer with copies of Mills\u2019s testimony from the third grand jury proceedings. So, given that Ford earlier received the disputed transcripts from the government, his request did not constitute exceptional circumstances to trigger the district court\u2019s inherent authority to disclose the testimony. And the court abused no discretion in denying Ford\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The district court also abused no discretion in denying Ford\u2019s motion for reconsideration because the motion repeated arguments raised in his motion to compel. He identified no factual or legal error underlying the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. <em>See Richardson v. Johnson, </em>598 F.3d 734, 740 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that a motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
