Arroyo-Gomez contends that the district court erred by applying a two-level enhancement for his role in the offense as \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). He argues that the government presented no evidence at his sentence hearing to support a finding that he acted in a supervisory or managerial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-24\">A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is subject to a \u00a7 3B1.1 role enhancement is a finding of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). The sentencing guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in the criminal activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). In assessing the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the court should consider factors such as the exercise of decision-making authority, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning and organizing, and the degree of control or authority exercised over others. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the present case Special Agent Alex Ascencio testified at the sentence hearing that recorded phone calls established that Arroyo-Gomez instructed co-conspirator Aaron Cruz to facilitate drug deals and help get customers. Also, Cruz called Arroyo-Gomez to get materials to \u201ccut the drugs.\u201d In one particular call, Cruz asked Arroyo-Gomez whether he had a supply of drugs available for him. Arroyo-Gomez responded that he needed to cut the drugs, and he told Cruz to wait at his current location. Agent Ascencio testified about another conversation in which Arroyo-Gomez instructed Cruz to show a buyer a quarter kilogram of cocaine, emphasizing that the group \u201cneeded to get something out of it.\u201d Cruz\u2019s dependence on Arroyo-Gomez for a supply of drugs, materials to cut them, and instructions about selling them establishes Arroyo-Gomez\u2019s control or leadership over him, and \u201c[t]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Perry, </em>340 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2003) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The district court also heard testimony that Arroyo-Gomez made other arrangements for drug deals and negotiated prices, including setting the terms of a five-pound methamphetamine deal. That evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement was applicable. <em>See United States v. Stanley, </em>24 F.3d 1314, 1323 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that evidence that the defendant negotiated the price of the drugs and made arrangements for the drug transaction was enough to establish that he had acted in a managerial capacity); <em>see also United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1249 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201c[i]n a drug distribution case ... the management enhancement is appropriate for a defendant who arranges drug transactions, negotiates sales with others, and hires others to work for the conspiracy\u2019). The district court did not clearly err by finding that the two-level enhancement applied to Arroyo-Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
