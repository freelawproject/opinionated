If tho Surrogate is satisfied that such executor is in default, the same section directs that he \u201cmust make an order requiring the delinquent to return the inventory.\u201d Section 15 of parts, ch. 6, tit. 3, of the Revised Statutes requires that such inventory shall be returned to the Surrogate within three months from the date of letters testamentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Section 3514 of the Code declares that, in construing the provisions of the 18th chapter, \u201cthe following rules must be observed, except where a contrary intent is expressly declared in the provisions to be construed, or is plainly apparent from the context thereof. . . . . . The word <em>debts </em>includes every claim and demand upon which a judgment for a sum of money, or directing the payment of money, could be recovered in an action; and the word <em>creditor </em>includes every person having such a claim or demand..... Where a provision of this chapter prescribes that a person interested . . . may apply for an inventory, an account,\u201d etc., \u201c an allegation of his interest, duly verified, suffices, although his interest is disputed, unless he has been excluded by a judgment, decree, or other final determination, and no appeal therefrom is pending.\u201d This provision, however, has manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>no application to creditors, because, in the very subdivision of \u00a7 2514 in which it appears, the term, \u201cperson interested\u201d is defined as including \u201cevery person entitled absolutely or contingently to share in the estate, etc., <em>except as a creditor</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ady\">In the present case, the allegation in reference to the petitioner\u2019s claim was, as first presented, in these words: c 5 that such estate is indebted to your petitioner to the amount of $100,000, and upwards, no part of which has been paid.\u201d In the absence of any denial, I should have deemed that allegation sufficient to justify granting the petition (Wever v. Marvin, <em>14 Barb., 376). </em>But I should not have felt at liberty to grant it in the face of the answer which was interposed, without some statement of the facts upon which the applicant based his claim to be a creditor of the estate (Burwell v. Shaw, <em>2 Bradf., 322). </em>Such a statement has been supplied since the oral argument. The moving party has presented affidavits whose allegations disclose the nature of his demand, and would suffice if undisputed to establish its validity. To these affidavits the counter-affidavit of the executrix has been interposed. An issue is thus raised which cannot be determined in this court. But I hold, as I have always held under similar circumstances, that the petitioner is entitled to the relief for which he applies (see Thomson v. Thomson, <em>1 Bradf., 24; </em>Cotterell v. Brock, <em>1 Bradf., 148).</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
