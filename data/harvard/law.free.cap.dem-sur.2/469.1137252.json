Stevens is a nonresident executor of this decedent\u2019s estate. In October, 1878, he filed a bond as such executor, with Mr. Charles W. Griswold as surety. Mr. Griswold has since died, and because of his death the petitioner, who is \u201c interested in the estate,\u201d asks that the executor be required to file a bond with new sureties. Section 2597 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the Surrogate may require a new bond to be given by an executor when it appears that a surety is \u201cinsufficient,\u201d or that he \u201chas removed or is about to remove from the State,\u201d or that \u201c the bond is inadequate in amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">I have discovered no provision of statute requiring that, upon the death of a surety on an executor\u2019s bond, another bond shall be filed in the place of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Counsel for petitioner' claims that death should be deemed a \u201c removal from the State \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2597. If such be the true interpretation of that section, the Legislature was surely somewhat infelicitous in its choice of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I should be more disposed to accept the petitioner\u2019s view if I were not of the opinion that, despite Mr. Gris-wold\u2019s death, the parties interested in this estate continue to have the same security which they have hitherto enjoyed, against the possible misconduct of the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The death of one who is a surety upon an official bond, such as that of this respondent, does not relieve his estate of liability for the principal\u2019s after-management of his trust (Mundorrf v. Wangler, 44 N. <em>Y. Sup'r Ct.,495; </em>Voris v. State, <em>Ind., 345 ; </em>Wood v. Leland, <em>1 Met., 387 ; </em>Moore v.
