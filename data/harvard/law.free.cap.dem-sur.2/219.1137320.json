S., 87, \u00a7 38), it would be palpably unjust to allow the issuance of an execution for the face of the judgment, without a disclosure of the amount of the other claims upon the estate. The \u201cjust proportion\u201d which the creditor is entitled to collect, must be determined by an inquiry implied in Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 1836.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">Application by Annie E.

For it does not appear, by the papers before me, whether the assets of the estate are sufficient to pay the entire amount of the applicant\u2019s debt without injuriously affecting the rights of others entitled to equality of payment with herself. The fact that she has recovered judgment.against the administratrix does not give her claim against this estate any .priority over other claims on which no actions have yet been commenced (see <em>'2 </em>R. S., 87, \u00a7 <em>28; 3 </em>Banks, <em>7th ed., 2299; </em>Schmitz v. Langhaar, <em>88 N. Y., 503).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">As the extent'of such other claims is not fully disclosed, it would be palpably unjust to allow issuance of execution for the full sum claimed by the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Section 1826 of the Code provides that, where it appears that the assets, after payment of all sums chargeable against them for expenses, and for.claims entitled to priority as against the applicant for an execution, are not, or will not be sufficient to pay all the debts, legacies or other claims of the class to which the claim of sxich applicant belongs, the sum directed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>collected <em>hy the </em>execution shall <em>not </em>exceed such applicant\u2019s just proportion of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">To ascertain that \u201cjust proportion,\u201d in the present case, further inquiry is necessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
