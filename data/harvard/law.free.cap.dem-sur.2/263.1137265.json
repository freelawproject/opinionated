The administrator named filed an affidavit stating that decedent, at the time of his death, owed to affiant more than $4,000; that, with the assent of the next of kin, before his appointment, affiant sold the fixtures, stock in trade and lease of saloon late of decedent, for $2,850, and, with the assent of said next of kin, applied this sum upon said indebtedness.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-10\">A.

In the decision to the contrary, upon which respondent\u2019s counsel relies (Matter of Robbins, <em>4 Redf., 144), </em>the late Surrogate seems to have overlooked the case of Butler\u2019s Estate <em>(38 N.
