My attention has since been called to the fact that the present accounting would very properly and naturally have been made at this time, even though the petitioner had no wish or purpose to resign. TMs fact justifies the relaxation of the severity of the rule that denies, to a trustee retiring from office for Ms own convenience, any allowance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>defray the expense of the proceeding. I can only allow the petitioner, however, the costs strictly pertinent to the <em>accounting, </em>and I must be furnished with an affidavit as to the number of days necessarily occupied <em>therewith.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
