Whore an executor, administrator, guardian, or testamentary trustee dies, the Surrogate\u2019s court has the same jurisdiction, upon the petition of his successor, or of a surviving executor, administrator or guardian, or of a creditor, or person interested in the estate, or of a guardian\u2019s ward, to compel the executor or administrator of the decedent to account, which it would have against the decedent, if his letters <em>ham </em>been revoked <em>by a Surrogate\u2019s decree. With respect to the liability of the sureties in, and forihe purpose of maintaining an action upon the decedents official bond, a decree against his executor or administrator, rendered upon such an accounting, has the seme effect as if an execution issued 'upon a Surrogate's decree against the property of decedent had been returned unsatisfied during decedent\u2019s lifetime. So far as concerns the executor or administrator of decedent, such a decree is not within the provisions of section two thousand five hundred and fifty-two of this act. The Surrogate\u2019s court has also jurisdiction to compel the executor or administi'ator at any time to deliver over any of the trust property which has come to his possession or is under his control, andifthe same is delivered aver after a decree, the court must allow such credit upon the decree, as justice requires.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-6\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"AM-\">Abraham Maze died in 1875, leaving a will whereby he appointed Washington Brockener and William E. Lawrence his executors. In 1880, they accounted as such, and a decree was entered whereby they were adjudged to have in their hands property of the estate amounting to $1,873.68, and were directed to distribute the same according to the provisions of decedent\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Both executors have since died without making such distribution. This petitioner now holds letters of administration, with the will annexed, upon the estate of Abraham Maze, and he asks, after alleging, upon information and belief, that the said property was in the custody and under the control of his predecessor, Lawrence, at the time of his death, that the executors of Lawrence account for said property, and deliver the same to him the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The petition does not aver that any of the assets of the estate of Abraham Maze have come to the possession of the respondents or are under their control. It does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>not, therefore, allege the facts necessary to authorize the granting of the relief asked under \u00a7 3606. It is not <em>all </em>trust property, in the hands of an executor at the time he dies, for which such executor\u2019s personal representatives can be called to- account by such executor\u2019s successor and which he may be compelled to deliver to him; it is such property only as has come to the possession or under the control of such representative himself. The petitioner, in his capacity of administrator, may as a creditor of the estate of William E. Lawrence, cite his executors to an accounting, but that is not what he seeks to do by this proceeding. Aside from any other considerations growing out of the facts presented on the motion papers, this petition must therefore be denied (Dakin v. Demining, <em>6 Paige, 95 </em>; Montross v. Wheeler, <em>4 Lans., 99).</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
