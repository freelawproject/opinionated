The testatrix specifically bequeathed a piano, certain articles of furniture, a certain portrait and a picture to persons named in her will. She then proceeded to bequeath certain \u201cpersonal property <em>and </em>furniture\u201d specifically to Mrs. Pinckney, among which -were mantel ornaments and a portrait of her late husband, and. also all her household furniture and effects in the house \u201c not hereinbefore specifically bequeathed. \u2019 \u2019 She had, therefore, specifically' bequeathed to others, as well as to Mrs Pinckney, articles which were mostly <em>ejusdem generis </em>with those covered by the objection. Her use of the phrase \u201cpersonal property and. fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>niture \u201d indicates that she distinguished between the two kinds o\u00a3 property, and I think she intended to maintain this distinction when she used the other phrase \u201chousehold furniture and effects therein,\u201d and that, consequently, Mrs. Pinckney was entitled to all of the articles delivered to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The other objections raised have not been discussed, and I, therefore, regard them as abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
