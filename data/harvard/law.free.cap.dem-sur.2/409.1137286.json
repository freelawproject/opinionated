It is further provided by the constitution that every application shall specify the person to whom the applicant desires Ms death benefit to be paid. The beneficiary may be changed as the member may thereafter direct, and such change is required to be noted in the -certificate. If a member surrenders his certificate and forwards it, together with a fee of fifty cents, by the reporter of Ms lodge under seal to the Supreme Reporter, the latter must thereupon cancel the old certificate, and issue a new one in lieu thereof to such member, payable as he shall have directed; said surrender and direction to be made on the back of the benefit certificate surrendered, signed by the member, and attested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>by the reporter under seal of the lodge. The decedent, as a member of the Herrman Lodge of this society, was empowered to designate by proper application the person who in the event of Ms death should become entitled to the sum of two thousand dollars. It is admitted that, in accordance with the constitution and bylaws of the society, he designated his wife as such pen son, and the proper benefit certificate was thereupon issued. It was never surrendered, nor was any new certificate issued in its place. The decedent executed a will near the end of his life, and, being then at odds with his wife, he sought to divert to others the $2,000, of which he had made her the beneficiary. The effort to accomplish this object by the dispositions of his will was clearly ineffectual. (Hellenberg v. Order of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, <em>94 N. Y., 580). </em>It is claimed, however, that, by an instrument bearing the same date as the will, witnessed by certain officers of the lodge and served upon them, the decedent succeeded in defeating his wife\u2019s claim to the $2,000. That instrument is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201c <em>To the Herrman </em>Lodge, <em>Ho. H3Jh KnigMs of </em>Honor, <em>Officers and Members:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">Please take notice that I do hereby revoke the direction given in my benefit certificate in reference as to whom the money should, after my death, be paid, and I do hereby order and direct that the money be divided as directed by me in my last will and testament, executed by me on the 17th day of October, 1882.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">GeobGt Meyeb.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">I do not think that this instrument extinguished Mrs. Meyer\u2019s right to receive $2,000 from the lodge upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>death of her husband. A case is here presented which is in some particulars unlike that above cited, but, nevertheless, it must be held, within the doctrine of that case, that the decedent, failing to comply with the rules of the society, accomplished nothing by the execution of the paper above quoted. Besides, I think that the respondent in this proceeding is correct in claiming that, even if that paper can be deemed a valid transfer of the right to the $2,000, the transferee has acquired his title <em>by virtue of that paper and not under the will; </em>so that the $2,000 formed no part of the estate of this decedent at his death. I must accordingly dismiss this proceeding, which is brought by the executor to discover property alleged to be withheld by the officers of Herrman Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
