The second clause of the will was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Second. I give and bequeath to my children, John O. Stevens, George Stevens and Mary Louisa Miller, an equal and undivided one third portion, each, of all my real estate at Fleetwood, and, after the death of my wife, andrher and my funeral expenses have been paid, I give and bequeath to my children aforesaid, John O. Stevens, George Stevens and Mary L. Miller, each, one third' portion of the estate left to my wife during her life. If my son John Oscar Stevens shall die, leaving a widow, the interest of the estate or money, left by me to him alone, shall be used by said widow, the principal to go to his children after the death of Ms said widow. If my son George Stevens shall marry and die, leaving a widow, the interest of the estate or money, left by me to him alone, shall be used by Ms widow, the principal to go to Ms said heirs after the death of Ms said widow.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\">At the time of the maMng of the will, John O. Stevens had a wife, and he and she were still living, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>had children. George Stevens had married since the date of the will, and before the testator\u2019s death, and he and his wife were living, but had as yet no children. The wife of the testator died before he did. Both parcels of real estate had been sold in this proceeding, for a sum more than sufficient to pay the debts therein established, and the costs and expenses of the proceeding, and the court was asked to dispose of the surplus.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-4\">Joseph S. Wood, <em>for petitioner.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-5\">John O. Stevens, <em>in person.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b615-6\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"AMqG\">The question here to be determined is who is entitled to the surplus money, or what disposition is to be made, of it, under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">I think the absolute devise, contained in the first provision of the second clause, to testator\u2019s sons is modified by the subsequent provisions of the same clause. It would seem that the testator only intended to give a life estate to the sons; then a like estate to their respective widows, with remainder to their heirs at law. But the second intended life estates (to the respective widows) appear to be void, for the reason that the widow which either son might leave could be a person not in being at the death of the testator; and the limitation over upon their death dependent thereon would also be void, and the testator will have died intestate as to the two thirds, and the same will, therefore, descend to his hens at law, whoever they may be, at the death of each life tenant (Schettler v. Smith, <em>41 N. Y., 328).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">As no control over the real estate, or the proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>thereof, is given to the executors by the will, the fund must, after paying Mrs. Miller her share, remain in the hands of the county treasurer, to be invested in pursuance of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3792 and 2796 of the Code, for the benefit of the sons for life, and, at their death, to be paid to the heirs at law of the testator. Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
