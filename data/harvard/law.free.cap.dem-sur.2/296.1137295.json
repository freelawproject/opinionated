Pro., \u00a73706, which provides for a proceeding by an executor, etc., to discover property of the estate withheld from him, does not limit the Surrogate\u2019s authority to cases where petitioner swears that such property is in the possession or under the control of respondent. If the Surrogate is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the inquiry, a citation must issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">Application by Lawrence Mead and Patrick Brady, executors of decedent\u2019s will, for an order to examine Caroline Sommers, under Code Civ.

The statute does not, as respondent\u2019s counsel argues, limit the Surrogate\u2019s authority, under \u00a7 2706, to cases in which the petitioning executor or administrator distinctly swears that property belonging to his decedent\u2019s estate <em>is in the possession or under the control </em>of the party sought tobe cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The citation must be issued if the Surrogate is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the inquiry; and, to establish the- existence of such reasonable grounds, the petition need only set forth, upon knowledge or information and belief, any facts <em>tending to show </em>that money or other personal property which ought to be delivered, etc., is in the possession or under the control of the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
