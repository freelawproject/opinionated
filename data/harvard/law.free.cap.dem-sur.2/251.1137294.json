To this petition was attached that of Eliza Murphy, one of the decedent\u2019s next of kin, praying that the administrator be compelled to give a new bond. These two petitions were together made the basis for an order to show cause why Bick\u2019s co-surety should not appear before the court and justify as to Ms sufficiency, and why the petitioning surety should not be released, and why the administrator should not give a new bond, or in default thereof be removed from his office, and why the petitioning next of kin should not be thereafter granted letters of' administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Section 2597 of the Code of Civil Procedure establishes the practice whereby any person interested in an estate may take steps to compel an administrator to give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>new bond, or, in default thereof, be removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Section 2800 prescribes the procedure whereby a surety on a bond may procure his release from respon- . sibility on account of a future breach. In the one case, the Code provides that the Surrogate shall issue a citation, if it appears that there is reason to believe the allegations of the petition are true; in the other case, citation issues as of course. It is entirely irregular to combine these applications as they are combined in the present proceeding, which must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The steps which have been taken by the respondent for substituting a new bond are also irregular, and all that has been done in that regard will be held for naught.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
