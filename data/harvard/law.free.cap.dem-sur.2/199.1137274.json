The widow died before G. became of full age.\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b215-7\"><em>Held, </em>that the trustees, authority to make such additions to G.\u2019s income \u25a0 ceased with the widow\u2019s death.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-8\">Construction of decedent\u2019s will upon judicial settlement of account of Rosa Imhof and others, trustees thereunder; to which objections were filed by Josephine Diebold, a legatee and <em>cestui que trust. </em>The facts appear sufficiently in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-9\">Chas.

The latter position seems to me to be correct, upon careful consideration of the whole will.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The provision for Gustav, although by one clause of the instrument apparently designed to continue during his minority, was, I think, intended by the testator to come to an end upon the death of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The income was then to \"be \u201cimmediately\u201d distributed, and upon that distribution there would no longer, be any need of any special provision for the education and maintenance of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">I hold, therefore, that the income of the estate since the death of the mother, should be distributed equally among the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
