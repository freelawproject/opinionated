At the time of the taking of the inventory, they were charged with the following property :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">One U. S. 7.30 bond of.....$1,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">One first mortgage on real estate, - 800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">In Utica pavings Bank, at 6 per cent., - - 600</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">One promissory note,......32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">Cash, ----- 364</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-13\">Total,.....$2,796</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">This fund came to their hands in admirable shape. The executors have converted all of these securities into \u25a0cash, as empowered by the will, but their subsequent investments were not at all in conformity to the trust accepted by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">They lent to one Williams $1200, and for a long time took no security therefor, but in 1878 received a second mortgage on about 140 acres of farming land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>which it is conceded are worth only $20 per acre, and which were and are now encumbered by another mortgage of about the same amount as the one taken by them in their trust capacity. The proof also shows that the mortgagor is so involved that his indebtedness at least equals his assets. Clearly, such an investment as this was not contemplated by the testator when he cautiously empowered his trustees to make a safe investment of his carefully husbanded fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The other investments made by the executors are no better than the one mentioned. One of the executors has $700, and the other $200, and in neither case is there a tittle of security for the amounts thus held by them. There are also two promissory notes, held by them as executors, against different parties, one of which was given to secure the payment of $200 and the other of $250. So that the executors, instead of heeding the cautious direction of the testator, and investing the property he had entrusted to them safely and securely, have placed it in jeopardyi and where it is liable to be dissipated long before the residuary legatees will be entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">On the question of the authority of a Surrogate to approve or withhold his approval from investments made by executors or testamentary trustees, an examination of the statutes and authorities convinces me that a power of this kind'is within the scope and province of a Surrogate\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The general language of the statute empowering the Surrogate \u201cto direct and control the conduct of executors,\u201d etc., and \u201c to administer justice in all matters relating to the affairs of deceased persons,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>has been held applicable to a variety of cases by the courts, until the tendency is to enlarge instead of abridging the jurisdiction of a Surrogate in his control over those entrusted with the management of estates of such persons (Bliss v. Sheldon, <em>7 Barb., 152; </em>Wood v. Brown, <em>34 N. Y., </em>337; Seaman v. Duryea, <em>11 N. Y., 327). </em>Such being my comprehension of the law, and believing that these investments are not made in accordance with the wishes of the testator, as expressed in Ms last will\u2014that they are not \u201c safe investments,\u201d I disapprove of each and every of them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
