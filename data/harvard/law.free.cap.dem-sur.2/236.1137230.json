No legal technicalities can compel the Surrogate to adjudge \u201cjust and reasonable \u201d what he knows to be otherwise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b252-11\">Three executors, upon their accounting, credited themselves with $1,675 and $5,000, expended by one of them for legal services rendered in the administration of the estate. The services to which the former sum related were described in the account and vouchers, with a degree of detail. As to the latter, the bill described the services, for which the charge was made, in broad and sweeping terms; its lack of particularity was not supplied by the testimony; neither the executor nor his counsel, on their examination, exhibited any accurate notion of the nature and extent of the services; and two of objectors\u2019 witnesses estimated their value at about $2,500. The principal found<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ation. for this charge was conferences had between the expending executor, who was himself a lawyer, and his counsel, covering a period of nineteen months, the frequency, dates, duration, etc., of which were not disclosed.

This amount, as it appears in the account, is made up of two items\u2014one of $775, and the other of $5,900. The larger item is vouched by a bill which describes, with some detail, certain legal services for which, in the aggregate, there is charged the sum of $900, but which states only in the most general terms the services to which the payment of the remaining $5,000 relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The contestants unsuccessfully urged before the referee that this charge for counsel fees should be in part disallowed. They now renew their contention before the Surrogate. The authority of that officer to sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tion credits, claimed by an accounting executor or administrator for sums expended as counsel fees, is derived from chapter 362 of the Laws of 1863.' The eighth section of that act provides that there may be paid from the funds of an estate, for defraying the expenses of its administration, <em>e\u2018 </em>such sums as are just and reasonable.\u201d There can be little doubt, I take it, that the justice and reasonableness of a claim, such as is here brought in question, must be established to the satisfaction of the Surrogate, before such claim can properly receive his approval. Of course, the bare fact that an executor has actually expended for legal services the sum for which he asks to be reimbursed does not, of itself, entitle him to reimbursement. Nor, indeed, does he become entitled simply by showing, in addition, that he has acted honestly, and in good faith. If objection is interposed, it must also be made to appear that, when the services were rendered, they were demanded, or seemed to be demanded, by the best interests of the estate, and merited the compensation by which they were rewarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Now, in the present case, the account shows that, in addition to the $5,000, considerable sums of money were paid to the executor\u2019s counsel, for certain legal services connected with the administration of this estate, and covering the same period, substantially, as that wherein the $5,000 is claimed to have been earned. It has already been stated that the sums thus expended aggregate $1,675. The services to which they relate are described in the account and vouchers, and the executor\u2019s claim to be credited in the full amount is not disputed by the contestants. Each of five of the items, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>which together make up this $1,675, is for $100 as \u201cretainer and counsel fee\u201d in certain specified cases. There is an item also of $150 for a similar charge, and. another of $250 for \u201cretainer in a suit for the construction of certain provisions of the will.\u201d The nature of the service specified by the remaining items is stated with equal definiteness and precision. How, if any other legal assistance was rendered, which was so definite and tangible in its character that it could be similarly set forth, it is hard to resist the conclusion that it would have been specified in like detail. But, in point of fact, there is no such specification. The bill for $5,000 presented to the executor, and now appearing as a voucher, describes in very broad and sweeping terms the services for which the charge is made, and its lack of particularity has not been supplied by the testimony before the referee. Heitherthe executor nor his counsel, both of whom were examined at the reference, seemed to have any accurate notion of the nature and extent of such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">For all that appears in the evidence, the executor, who is himself a lawyer, and who is experienced, as his testimony shows, in the management of estates, might well have conducted this administration with little legal assistance, in respect to matters not specified in the bills for $900 and for $775.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Two witnesses were examined in behalf of the contestants, touching the value of the services in dispute. One of them said that, in his judgment, $2,000 to $2,500 would be sufficient compensation. The other gave similar testimony, qualified, however, by his declaration that a lawyer was the best judge of the value of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>own work, and that it was difficult for anybody else than himself to measure it with accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In holding that the executors should be allowed in full the sum which they claim, the referee lays great stress upon certain facts which he justly regards as having an important bearing upon the controversy, but which have not, to my mind, the decisive significance he seems to attribute to them. It does not follow that, because the executor and his counsel have acted in good faith, and are themselves honestly agreed in the opinion that $5,000, in addition to the sums charged in the itemized bills, is but fair compensation for the services in dispute, their conclusions as to the reasonableness of this charge must be adopted, in the absence of opposing evidence. On the contrary, there should be affirmative proof, and better proof than is here furnished, of the facts upon which those conclusions are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">It is urged, in behalf of the executors, that the burden of proof is upon the contestants, to impeach the accuracy of this account, and that\u2014so far as concerns, for example, the items now under consideration \u2014it must be presumed to be correct, unless satisfactory evidence has established the contrary. This contention seems to me to be erroneous. Where an executor credits himself in his account with a sum paid by him ;as counsel fees, and files the proper voucher therefor, it is perhaps true that, in the utter absence of evidence supporting an objection to the item, the <em>propriety </em>of the payment, as well as <em>i\\\\afact </em>of payment, must be taken for granted by the Surrogate. And, yet, it may well be doubted. It would be very easy to state a case, in which the gross injustice of a charge for legal services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>would be apparent upon the very face of the account. Surely, under such circumstances, no legal technicalities as to presumption or burden of proof could compel the Surrogate to adjudicate as \u201cjust and reasonable \u201d what he knew to be unreasonable and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">After all, however, it matters little, in the present case, in whose favor the presumption lies, or whether it lies in favor of either. It is by consideration of all the evidence bearing upon this issue that the court must determine whether sufficient service has been rendered to make the claim of $5,000 \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The principal foundation for this charge, according to the testimony of the executor and that of his counsel, is the fact that the two held repeated conferences, in reference to the affairs of the estate, during the period of nineteen months. These conferences are claimed to have taken place nearly every week, and sometimes several times a week. Neither party thereto kept any account or memoranda in relation to the dates of their occurrence, or is able to testify, with any approach to exactness, how frequently they took place. Their duration is not disclosed, nor does it appear how many of them related to matters not covered by the itemized bills, nor what ratio the number of such conferences bore to the entire number. Indeed, the testimony in this regard is so very indefinite and vague that I should send the case to the referee for further inquiry, if it seemed likely that any additional facts would thus be elicited. As it is, I am compelled to reach a conclusion from such light as the evidence now affords, and that conclusion is that, in addition to the $900 and the $775, the executors may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>credit themselves with $1,250 as a just and reasonable \u2022 compensation for such legal services as are included in the voucher for $5,900.-Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
