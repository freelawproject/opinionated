Upon the latter\u2019s application, under Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2717, to compel payment of his legacy, it was conceded that G. then had ten children,\u2014 how many of whom were in being when petitioner attained majority not being disclosed.\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b246-11\"><em>Held, </em>that, even assuming that petitioner was the \u201c.youngest child\u201d within the meaning of the will, the petition must be dismissed for non-joinder of the children, if any, born between testatrix\u2019s death and petitioner\u2019s arrival at full age, who were entitled to an opportunity to be heard as to their right to share in the distribution.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">Petition by William Neaves to compel George W.

Durant <em>(88 N. Y., 121), </em>and Fiester v. Shepard <em>(92 id., 251), </em>to necessitate a dismissal of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Even apart from this jurisdictional obstacle, there is another which would, of .itself, be fatal to the present application. It seems to be conceded that, when the testatrix died, in 1848, her brother George had but two children, of whom the petitioner was the younger; that he came of age more than twelve years since; that his father has now ten children, of whom the youngest is only ten months old. How many of these were living when the petitioner attained his majority is not disclosed. But if any of them were then in being, there is another question whose determination must precede distribution of the $7,000, besides the question whether the petitioner is the person whom the testatrix intended to indicate by the term \u201cyoungest child.\u201d The children who were born after the death of the testatrix, and before the petitioner came of age, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>be allowed opportunity, if they desire, to present their claims to a share of the fund in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Petition dismissed (Riggs v. Cragg, <em>89 N. Y., 479).</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
