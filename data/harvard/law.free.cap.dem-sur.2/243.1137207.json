Stipulations herein-before made in favor of my wife are intended to be in lieu of all her dower rights, and other claims whats\u00f3- \u25a0 ever, she may have against me or my estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>By virtue of the foregoing provisions of the testator\u2019s will, it seems to me that, under the decisions of the - courts of this State, the executors, upon then qualification as such, became trustees of an express trust, in whom the whole estate vested at once, so to remain until the youngest child should become of age, or. should die, being yet in his minority (see Morse v. Morse, <em>85 N. Y., 53; </em>Vernon v. Vernon, <em>53 N. Y., 351; </em>Thomson v. Thomson, <em>55 How. Pr., 494; </em>Leggett v. Perkins, <em>2 N. Y., 297; </em>Tobias v. Ketchum, <em>32 N. </em>Y., <em>319).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">At the death of this testator, in 1872, he left a widow and five children, of whom Caroline the youngest was a babe. Caroline died in 1878. The trust estate then became extinguished (Burke v. Valentine, <em>52 Barb., </em>Muller v. Struppman, <em>6 Abb. N. C., 350; </em>Butler Butler, <em>3 Barb. Ch., 310).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">What became of Caroline\u2019s interest? Bid it pass to her legal representatives, or to her surviving brothers and sisters as a class, or can it be justly claimed, as is contended by one of the counsel in this proceeding, that the widow is now, by virtue of the statutes of descent, entitled to a portion thereof as realty ?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">1st. I hold, with the referee, that the five children of the testator became seized at his death of a vested remainder in his estate, and that, accordingly, Caroline\u2019s brothers and sisters take <em>under the will </em>no larger share in that estate by reason of her death (Livingston v. Greene, <em>52 N. Y., 118; </em>Lyons v. Mahan, <em>1 Dem., </em>180, and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">2nd. Is any part of Caroline\u2019s interest distributable as realty?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>As I read the will, it was the testator\u2019s purpose that the executors should sell his real estate upon the death or coming of age of Caroline, and should make immediate division of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The power of sale, though not positively and explicitly conferred, is nevertheless inferentially conferred by those provisions of the will which have been already quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The real estate consists of a single tenement house, and probably could not be partitioned without seriotis impairment of its value. This may well have occurred to the mind of the testator, and, as his language may be fairly construed as conferring the power of sale, it should, in view of the circumstances, be accorded that interpretation (Hetzel v. Barber, <em>6 </em>Hun, <em>540</em>; Morse v. Morse, <em>85 N. Y., 59).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">For the purposes of distribution, this power of sale must be deemed to have been already exercised, and to have resulted in converting the whole estate into money.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">3rd. It follows, therefore, that, after setting apart for the testator\u2019s widow one third of the proceeds, for yielding her a life income, one fifth of the remaining two thirds, (together with certain sums which have been erroneously paid by the executors to Caroline\u2019s surviving brothers and sisters) must be paid to her personal representative, for distribution under the statute, and the remaining eight fifteenths (less the sums so erroneously paid) to the four surviving children of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">4th. The referee\u2019s report is confirmed, with the modifications above indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
