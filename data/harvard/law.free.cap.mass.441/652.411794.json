See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 11, 15A; G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 36. The plaintiff owner, Sandra K. Golden, filed an action to discharge the defendant\u2019s hen pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A <em>(b) </em>and <em>(c). </em>The defendant, General Builders Supply LLC (General Builders), sought to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien by way of a counterclaim filed four weeks after the deadline set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, asking that it \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of Golden\u2019s complaint, which had occurred a few days prior to that deadline. The plaintiff\u2019s request for an order discharging the lien was allowed on various grounds, including failure to commence a timely action for enforcement, and General Builders\u2019s counterclaim for enforcement of the lien was dismissed. General Builders appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the following reasons, we conclude that a civil action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien may be brought as a counterclaim, but that the relation back provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 36, do not apply to such a counterclaim. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>In the fall of 2000, Golden and her husband hired a contractor to construct an addition on their home in Quincy. Over the course of the project, General Builders delivered supplies and materials to the site pursuant to an alleged written subcontract with the contractor, but received only partial payment from the contractor. On April 25, 2001, General Builders recorded a notice of contract with the Norfolk County registry of deeds, see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, and on May 29, 2001, General Builders recorded a document entitled \u201cStatement of Lien,\u201d claiming that it was owed $15,220.59 for the materials furnished to Golden\u2019s property, see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unable to resolve General Builders\u2019s claim, Golden filed a complaint in the Superior Court on August 24, 2001, alleging various defects in General Builders\u2019s ostensible mechanic\u2019s hen, and seeking to discharge that hen pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A <em>(b) </em>and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The deadhne for General Builders to commence an action to enforce its hen was August 27, 2001 (ninety days from the May 29, 2001, recording of the statement of account). G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11. No enforcement action was filed prior to the expiration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that deadline. However, on September 24, 2001, General Builders filed its answer to Golden\u2019s complaint, including in that answer a \u201ccounterclaim to enforce mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d The next day, the judge held a hearing on Golden\u2019s request for an order discharging the lien. At that time, Golden submitted a memorandum contending that, in addition to the lien defects alleged in her original complaint, the lien was now dissolved due to General Builders\u2019s failure to commence a timely action to enforce the Hen. See <em>id. </em>On October 9, 2001, the judge granted Golden\u2019s request for discharge of the lien \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s Memorandum.\u201d Judgment was entered ordering the discharge of the lien and dismissing General Builders\u2019s counterclaim. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Counterclaim to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. </em>Golden contends that an action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s Hen may only be brought by way of an original complaint, not by means of a counterclaim. She relies on the statute\u2019s requirements that the \u201cplaintiff shall bring his action\u201d to enforce the Hen, that the Hen be dissolved \u201cunless a civil action to enforce it is commenced,\u201d and that a copy of \u201cthe complaint\u201d be recorded in the registry of deeds \u201cwithin thirty days of the commencement of the action,\u201d contending that those words in the mechanic\u2019s Hen statute must be literally interpreted to preclude a lien enforcement action by way of any procedural device other than an action \u201ccommenced\u201d by original complaint brought by the contractor as plaintiff. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5. See also G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11; Mass. R. Civ. R 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982) (\u201ccivil action is commenced\u201d by mailing or fihng \u201ccomplaint and an entry fee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Because a mechanic\u2019s Hen is purely a creation of statute, we have consistently required exact comphance with the statute in order to create, perfect, and enforce such a Hen. See <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 642, 644 (2002); <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., </em>430 Mass. 663, 666 (2000); <em>East Coast Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ciolfi, </em>417 Mass. 602, 605 (1994); <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 752 (1989). \u201cThe [mechanic\u2019s Hen] statute is strictly construed against the party claiming the Hen.\u201d <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, supra </em>at 644, citing <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>However, our adherence to these principles of strict statutory construction, and our insistence on precise compliance with those statutory terms, does not mean that the rules of civil procedure are inapplicable to proceedings concerning mechanic\u2019s liens. Nothing in the statute suggests that proceedings to enforce a lien under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, or proceedings to discharge a lien under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A, will not be governed by ordinary procedural rules. Absent some incompatibility between a specific procedural rule and the provisions of the statute, we will apply and enforce both. See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 670-672 (relation back provisions of Mass. R. Civ. R 15 [c], 365 Mass. 761 [1974], applied to amendment of mechanic\u2019s lien enforcement complaint to add as party current owner of property).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The rules liberally allow a party to \u201cstate as a counterclaim <em>any claim </em>against an opposing party\u201d (emphasis added). Mass. R. Civ. P. 13 (b), 365 Mass. 758 (1974). An action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5, is a form of \u201cclaim\u201d that the contractor has against the owner of the property encumbered by the lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 666-670. Straightforward application of rule 13 (b) indicates that such an action may, like any other \u201cclaim,\u201d be brought as a counterclaim in any action that the property owner has brought against the lienholder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Notwithstanding that straightforward conclusion under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>wording of rule 13 (b), we also consider whether allowing a hen enforcement action to be brought as a counterclaim would undermine any aspect of the mechanic\u2019s hen statute. See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 669-670 (considering whether allowing contractor to amend complaint to add current owner as defendant would impair reliability of recording system with respect to mechanic\u2019s hens). We fail to see how allowing hen enforcement actions to be brought by way of counterclaim would be incompatible with the statutory system governing mechanic\u2019s hens. Beyond the requirement of timeliness (which we address below), the only other requirements for such an action are that the \u201ccomplaint\u201d must \u201ccontain a brief description of the property sufficient to identify it, and a statement of the amount due,\u201d and that an attested copy of the \u201ccomplaint\u201d be filed and recorded in the registry of deeds \u201cwithin thirty days of the commencement of the action.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5. Those requirements can all be met by a pleading (customarily an answer) asserting a counterclaim against the property owner \u2014 the counterclaim itself must include the necessary description of the property and statement of amount due, and an attested copy of that pleading must be filed and recorded with the registry of deeds within thirty days of its filing with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Nor would the filing of a contractor\u2019s or subcontractor\u2019s counterclaim prevent the prompt determination of the owner\u2019s claim of entitlement to discharge of the hen. By definition, the lien cannot be enforced if it is invalid or defective, and the judge would presumably rule on those claimed defects \u201cexpeditiously,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A, before proceeding with any enforcement of the lien pursuant to the counterclaim. The types of defects that can result in an order \u201csummarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>discharging\u201d the lien under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A, are normally amenable to immediate determination on undisputed documents and matters of public record. A lien can be \u201csummarily\u201d discharged under that section if \u201cit appears from the notice of contract or a statement of account that the claimant has no valid lien by reason of the character of, or the contract for, the labor or materials or rental equipment, appliances or tools furnished and for which a lien is claimed,\u201d if the requisite notices and statements have not been timely filed and recorded, if there has been any other failure to comply with the statute that would invalidate the lien, or if the lien rights \u201care foreclosed by judgment or release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, summary discharge of the hen can only be obtained for defects that will customarily appear of record or be readily ascertainable by reference to undisputed documents \u2014 defects in the notice of contract or statement of account, failure to timely record the notice or statement, or a judgment or release that would preclude the lien. That the counterclaim might raise issues of greater complexity and factual dispute (e.g., the amount the contractor was owed under the contract) would not prevent the judge from prompt consideration whether the undisputed documents and public records entitle the plaintiff to discharge of the hen (and, by definition, dismissal of any counterclaim for enforcement). The pendency of a counterclaim to enforce the hen will not delay resolution of the threshold issues affecting the hen\u2019s validity or otherwise compromise the objective of expedited rulings on the issues set forth in \u00a7 15A. In the event the hen is <em>not </em>discharge-able for any of the reasons articulated in \u00a7 15A, the parties\u2019 contentions on other issues concerning the enforceabihty of the hen may proceed as part of the same action, sparing the parties and the court from the needless duplication of effort and procedural clutter that rule 13 is designed to avoid. The economies and consistency that rule 13 provides would be beneficial in actions concerning mechanic\u2019s hens, just as they are in other actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We thus see no conflict between rule 13 (b) and the mechanic\u2019s hen statute that would convince us to suspend the operation of rule 13 (b) for proceedings involving mechanic\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>liens.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 666-670, the procedural rule and the mechanic\u2019s lien statute may peaceably coexist, and we will therefore apply the rule in such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">b. <em>Relation back. </em>Because General Builders\u2019s counterclaim seeking to enforce its lien was not filed until after the expiration of the ninety-day time period in which to bring such an enforcement action, see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, General Builders invokes the doctrine of \u201crelation back\u201d articulated in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 36,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and argues that the timeliness of its action is to be computed as if it had been filed on the date that Golden\u2019s complaint was filed. Golden\u2019s complaint was filed prior to the expiration of the ninety-day period that would apply to General Builders\u2019s enforcement action and, argues General Builders, its later-filed counterclaim must therefore be deemed timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Application of the relation back doctrine to salvage untimely filed counterclaims for lien enforcement would be contrary to the terms of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute and would seriously undermine its operation. The statute does not simply set a limitations period for the filing of lien enforcement actions, but specifies the consequence of failing to bring an action within that time frame: \u201cThe lien <em>shall be dissolved </em>unless a civil action to enforce it is commenced within ninety days after the filing of the statement [of account]\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 254, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u00a7 11. Thus, as of the ninety-first day following the filing of General Builders\u2019s statement of account, there was no longer any lien left to enforce. It had, in the words of the statute, been \u201cdissolved\u201d by operation of law. The mechanic\u2019s lien statute does not permit the resurrection of a lien, or the creation of a new lien, once the lien has been extinguished by a failure to comply with the statute. See <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 755-757 (1989). See also <em>Tremont Tower Condominium, LLC </em>v. <em>George B.H. Macomber Co., </em>436 Mass. 677, 684 &amp; n.3 (2002). The mechanic\u2019s lien statute must be strictly construed against the party asserting the hen, <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, supra </em>at 644, and interpreting the statute in a manner allowing for reinstatement of a dissolved hen by later filing of a counterclaim \u201cwould effectively give the contractor a \u2018period greater\u2019 than that intended by the Legislature\u201d in which to enforce the hen. <em>Tremont Tower Condominium, LLC </em>v. <em>George B.H. Macomber Co., supra </em>at 684, quoting <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, supra </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Once the August 27 deadhne had come and gone with no action filed by General Builders, Golden was automatically entitled to the rehef she sought in her complaint. At that juncture, it required no further action on Golden\u2019s part (or even any action by the court) to \u201cdischarge\u201d the hen, as the hen had already \u201cdissolved.\u201d It would be perverse to tell Golden that she could now be denied the rehef to which she was previously entitled because, before the judge ruled on her request for rehef, the very pendency of her request gave General Builders an opportunity to resurrect its hen by filing a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Allowing resurrection of the hen by the filing of a counterclaim after expiration of the ninety-day period would also wreak havoc with one of the statute\u2019s important purposes, namely, the provision of \u201can accurate system for recording and identifying encumbrances secured under the mechanic\u2019s hen statute.\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 669. The statute is intended to ensure \u201cthat an enforcement action may readily be identified through routine title searching procedures,\u201d <em>id., </em>and it accomplishes that objective by requiring that an attested copy of the enforcement complaint be recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>within thirty days of its filing with the court. G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, if a title examiner finds recorded a notice of contract and a statement of account, but finds- no complaint recorded within 120 days of the recorded statement, the examiner can conclude with certainty that the former mechanic\u2019s lien no longer encumbers the property. If, however, that lien could later be revived by way of a counterclaim relating back to a plaintiff\u2019s earlier filing, the examiner could no longer rely on the registry title search.* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, given the court\u2019s broad discretion to allow extensions of time in which to file responsive pleadings (see Mass. R. Civ. R 6 [b], 365 Mass. 747 [1974]), and the liberality of the role governing amended and supplemental pleadings (Mass. R. Civ. P. 15, 365 Mass. 761 [1974]), it is possible for a counterclaim to be filed long after the plaintiff\u2019s commencement of the original action. The relation back doctrine, if applicable to lien enforcement claims, could thus operate to revive liens that, according to the record title, were long since dissolved. The certainty of the recording system as a means to confirm the status of mechanic\u2019s lien encumbrances would be greatly undermined by any such relation back.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Where, as here, application of the otherwise customary roles of relation back would compromise one of the objectives of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>statutory scheme, relation back is not allowed. See, e.g., <em>Tindol </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., 396 </em>Mass. 515, 518-519 (1986), quoting <em>James Ferrera &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 170, 173 (1985) (rule 15 [c] could not be applied to amended pleading adding claim barred by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, statute of repose, as relation back \u201cwould have the effect of reactivating a cause of action that the Legislature obviously intended to eliminate\u201d); <em>Bernstein </em>v. <em>Gramercy Mills, Inc., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 407-410 (1983), and cases cited (counterclaim to vacate arbitration award did not relate back to plaintiffs filing of action to enforce award; allowing relation back provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 36, to enable late filing of action to vacate award would frustrate G. L. c. 251, which \u201caims to flush out objections to awards with dispatch\u201d). The complex scheme of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, and its carefully crafted provisions to protect the integrity and reliability of the recording system, would be sorely disrupted if we were to allow enforcement counterclaims to relate back to the date of filing of the property owner\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We therefore decline to apply G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 36, to General Builders\u2019s counterclaim, and will instead require that any counterclaims to enforce mechanic\u2019s liens be filed with the court and recorded at the registry of deeds within the time frames mandated by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 11. Because General Builders failed to file its counterclaim within the ninety-day period prescribed by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11, its hen was dissolved. As such, the judge properly ordered the lien discharged and dismissed General Builders\u2019s counterclaim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The statute requires the contractor or subcontractor claiming a lien to file and record \u201ca statement, giving a just and true account of the amount due or to become due him, with all just credits, a brief description of the property, and the names of the owners set forth in the notice of contract.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8. Such a statement is customarily referred to as a \u201cstatement of account,\u201d see G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A <em>(b); Tremont Tower Condominium, LLC </em>v. <em>George B.H. Macomber Co., </em>436 Mass. 677, 680, 681 (2002); <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 642, 643 (2002), but we attach no significance to the use of a slight variation in nomenclature on this statement of account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The lien itself may only be enforced against the property by way of sale, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 18, but an action to enforce the lien is nevertheless \u201ccommenced and prosecuted against\u201d the owner. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Although the issue is not before us in the present appeal, it may well be that a mechanic\u2019s lien enforcement action would qualify as a compulsory counterclaim that must be asserted in the property owner\u2019s action seeking to discharge that same lien. See Mass. R. Civ. R 13 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1405 (1996) (\u201cpleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim for relief the court has power to give which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim\u201d). A claim to enforce the lien would arise out of the same \u201ctransaction or occurrence\u201d as the property owner\u2019s claim to discharge the lien, and the same courts are authorized to hear both claims. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 15A (both lien enforcement action and action to discharge lien to be brought in \u201cthe superior court for the county where such land lies or in the district court in the judicial district where such land lies\u201d). In a different context, the Appeals Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>held that the compulsory counterclaim requirements of rule 13 (a) apply to actions concerning mechanic\u2019s hens. See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Canton Inst. for Sav., 56 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2002) (material supplier barred from bringing action concerning priority of mechanic\u2019s lien when it failed to bring claim as counterclaim in bank\u2019s postforeclosure interpleader action). Because the present appeal challenges whether counterclaims to enforce mechanic\u2019s liens may be brought at all, we consider only whether they are at least permissive counterclaims under Mass. R. Civ. P. 13 (b), 365 Mass. 758 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\">By comparison, we found such a conflict between the statute governing summary process actions and the rules of procedure that would otherwise have given commercial tenants the right to bring counterclaims against their landlords. <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc., </em>439 Mass. 512, 514-517 (2003). There, the statute itself addressed the issue of counterclaims, specifying that they could be brought by defendant tenants in actions seeking \u201cto recover possession of any premises rented or leased <em>for dwelling purposes\u201d </em>(emphasis added). G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A. Where the Legislature had expressly provided for counterclaims by residential tenants, but had included no comparable, provision for counterclaims by tenants occupying commercial premises, the clear implication was that the Legislature did not intend to allow counterclaims by commercial tenants in summary process proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 515. Here, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute is silent on the subject of counterclaims, and contains no suggestion of a legislative intent to preclude counterclaims or to preclude them in certain types of mechanic\u2019s lien proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe provisions of law relative to limitations of actions shall apply to a counterclaim by the defendant. The time of such limitation shall be computed as if an action had been commenced therefor at the time the plaintiff\u2019s action commenced.\u201d G.

As such, there would be nothing on record to alert a title examiner to the fact that a property owner\u2019s own suit might have opened the door to a later counterclaim to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\">By comparison, in <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., </em>430 Mass. 663, 671 (2000), this court determined that allowing relation back with respect to the addition of the new owner as a defendant in a mechanic\u2019s lien enforcement action would not impair the reliability of the recording system. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). The recording of the original enforcement complaint would, by itself, be adequate to alert examiners to the present status of the mechanic\u2019s lien, and the later addition of a party would not impair an examiner\u2019s ability-to confirm the presence or absence of that lien. <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Le Francois Constr. Corp., </em>supra at 669-670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Because our ruling on the relation back issue renders the lien enforcement counterclaim untimely, it is not necessary for us to address any of the other grounds on which Golden sought to have the lien discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
