R. Civ. R 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996): \u201cUnder G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>c. 136, [\u00a7] 6 (50),[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and G. L. c. 151, [\u00a7] 1A,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] may a Massachusetts employer offset or credit a Sunday premium payment it provides to an employee in any week toward overtime pay it provides to that employee under G. L. c. 151, [\u00a7] 1A, for working in excess of forty hours in that week?\u201d The question arose when two employees, Joseph Swift and Edward Cove, filed a complaint against their employer, AutoZone, Inc. (AutoZone), an auto parts retailer, challenging its system of \u201ccrediting\u201d premium rate payments due for Sunday work to wages due for overtime work.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In April, 2001, AutoZone informed its Massachusetts employees<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that it was changing its policy regarding the compensation of employees who work both on Sunday and for more than forty hours in any week. Because of what AutoZone termed a \u201ccalculations error,\u201d Massachusetts employees had been paid \u201ctime-and-a-half pay\u201d for work on Sunday (or paid holiday), in addition to any overtime hours. This overpayment, AutoZone said, was not \u201cin line\u201d with other Massachusetts employers, and the \u201ccalculations error\u201d would be \u201ccorrected.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On February 5, 2002, the plaintiffs, who are hourly, nonex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>empt employees who work in two of AutoZone\u2019s retail stores, filed a class action complaint in the Superior Court seeking a judgment declaring that AutoZone\u2019s new policy violated G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, injunctive relief, treble damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied the defendant\u2019s motion, determining that neither of the two statutes at issue permitted such crediting. The judge reported the aforementioned question to the Appeals Court. We granted the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Four months after summary judgment entered for the plaintiffs, and before briefing had concluded in this appeal, the Legislature enacted emergency legislation to take immediate effect. Statute 2003, c. 140, \u00a7 37, an amendment to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, expressly permits crediting: \u201cIn any work week in which an employee of a retail business is employed on a Sunday or certain holidays at a rate of one and one-half times the regular rate of compensation at which he is employed ... the hours so worked . . . shall be excluded from the calculation of overtime pay as required by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We conclude that, even prior to the 2003 amendment, neither G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, nor G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 6 (50), prohibited employers from crediting Sunday premium rate payments toward overtime payments. We vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and remand the matter to the Superior Court where judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the plain language of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, before it was amended in 2003, did not permit crediting. They point out that G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, unlike its Federal counterpart, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (2000),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did not previously contain express language permitting crediting, and that the recent amendment to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, expressly permitting crediting is evidence that the practice was previously unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Turning first to the statutes themselves, <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982), an employer who credits premium rate payments for Sunday hours against overtime wages in fact satisfies the express language of both statutes, as illustrated by the following example. An employee who works for forty-eight hours, eight hours each day, Sunday through Friday, is paid at the regular rate of pay for forty hours, and one and one-half times for eight hours worked on Sunday. The employer has compensated the employee for work \u201cin excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate,\u201d G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, because the employee has been paid one and one-half times for eight hours of work. The employer has also compensated the employee for \u201cthe work performed on Sunday ... at a rate not less than one and one-half times the employee\u2019s regular rate,\u201d because the employee has been paid one and one-half times for eight hours worked on Sunday. If two statutes require an employer to do the same thing, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>no rule of statutory construction that compels the employer to do so twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The respective legislative histories of the two statutes confirm that, even before the 2003 amendment, the Legislature did not intend to grant any employee <em>double </em>one and one-half times payments, both for overtime and for Sunday work. The overtime provision of the minimum wage law, G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, inserted by St. 1960, c. 813, was expressly intended to provide comparable overtime compensation \u201cfor all workers not now covered by Federal law.\u201d 1960 Senate Doc. No. 1, at 22. Because the overtime provisions under State law were intended to be \u201cessentially identical\u201d to Federal law, <em>Valerio </em>v. <em>Putnam Assocs. Inc., </em>173 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 1999), the history concerning \u201ccrediting\u201d under the cognate Federal statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a), is relevant to understanding the intent of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1960. We briefly describe that legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Following the FLSA\u2019s enactment in 1938, employers generally credited contractually based overtime pay (including premium rate pay for work on weekends and holidays) against their statutory overtime obligation under the FLSA. See S. Rep. No. 402, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (1949), reprinted in 1949 U.S.C. C.A.N. 1617, 1619-1620. Then, in 1943, the administrator of the wage and hour division (administrator) advised the war shipping administration that the FLSA did <em>not </em>permit employers to credit contractually-based overtime premiums against statutory overtime. <em>Id. </em>at 1620-1621. However, other government agencies disagreed with the administrator\u2019s interpretation. As a result, the administrator refrained from taking any action on his decision, and crediting continued. <em>Id. </em>at 1621. Thereafter, however, employees in the shipping industry began filing suits challenging the practice of crediting, and in 1948, the Supreme Court declared the practice invalid. <em>Bay Ridge Operating Co. </em>v. <em>Aaron, </em>334 U.S. 446 (1948). Congress responded quickly, and within months of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, amended the FLSA expressly to permit crediting. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(e)(6), (h). See S. Rep. No. 402, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (1949), reprinted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1949 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1617.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8The amendment defined \u201c \u2018regular rate\u2019 of pay,\u201d and stated that \u201cextra compensation provided by . . . premium rates\u201d was creditable toward statutory overtime obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 1617-1618, 1627-1628.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Two years <em>before </em>the 1949 amendment to the FLSA, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the minimum wage law, G. L. c. 151, inserted by St. 1947, c. 432, \u00a7 1, in order \u201cto correct inequities and to create a floor below which no employer may go in payment of wages to his employees.\u201d 1959 House Doc. No. 2666, at 6. The statute contained no provision for overtime compensation, so the issue of \u201ccrediting\u201d did not arise. Only in 1958, did the Legislature begin to consider mandatory overtime compensation. See 1958 House Doc. No. 3018 (resolve providing for investigation and study relative to overtime pay). Notwithstanding a recommendation by the Department of Labor and Industries to the contrary,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in his 1960 annual address, the Governor urged the Legislature to enact a \u201cState Fair Labor Standards Law\u201d to provide overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>compensation for those Massachusetts workers <em>not </em>covered by Federal law. 1960 Senate Doc. No. 1, at 22. The Legislature responded affirmatively, and St. 1960, c. 813, providing for overtime compensation, was enacted later that year. G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The Massachusetts overtime legislation was substantially similar to its Federal counterpart, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a), but unlike the FLSA, which (as described above) had been amended in 1949, did not expressly address \u201ccrediting.\u201d See St. 1960, c. 813. The plaintiffs argue that this omission in the 1960 Massachusetts legislation is evidence of a legislative intent to <em>prohibit </em>crediting. It is more likely, however, that, in 1960, the Legislature deemed unnecessary an express provision to permit crediting. The Legislature was likely aware that Congress intended the original FLSA to permit crediting, and that the Federal statute had been amended only after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled otherwise, <em>Bay Ridge Operating Co. </em>v. <em>Aaron, supra. </em>There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the Massachusetts Legislature intended to provide more generous overtime or premium rate compensation than Federal law, see 1960 Senate Doc. No. 1, at 22 (extending statutory overtime compensation to employees not covered by FLSA), and in light of Congress\u2019s response to the ruling of the Supreme Court, the Massachusetts Legislature would have no reason to believe that any Massachusetts court would rule against crediting.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Lest there be any doubt as to legislative intent in 1960, the 2003 amendment to <em>permit </em>crediting was swift legislative action in the wake of the Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling to the contrary in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That action is strongly suggestive of the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1960. See <em>Fitz-Inn Auto Parks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>350 Mass. 39, 42 (1965) (logical to interpret recent statutory amendment as \u201cclarification of an ambiguity and a legislative interpretation of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>act\u201d). See also note 7, <em>supra. </em>It is also consistent with the actions of other State Legislatures confronted with court decisions prohibiting crediting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We address one final point raised by the plaintiffs. In October, 2001, the division of occupational safety of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the agency charged with the administration of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, issued an opinion letter to the effect that crediting violated G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. \u201cIn general, we grant substantial deference to an interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 345-346 (1992). But where the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201ccontrary to plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose,\u201d no deference is warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court where judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">General Laws c. 136, \u00a7 6 (50), the premium rate payment provision of the so-called \u201cSunday\u201d law, states in relevant part: \u201cAny store or shop which qualifies for exemption under this clause. . . and which employs more than a total of seven persons . . . shall compensate all employees engaged in the work performed on Sunday . . . at a rate not less than one and one-half times the employee\u2019s regular rate.\u201d Pursuant to G.
