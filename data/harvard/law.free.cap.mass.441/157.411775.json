L. c. 123A permits the release of a person on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>probationary conditions after a judge has found probable cause to believe that the person is sexually dangerous and the Commonwealth has petitioned for a trial. We conclude that the statutory scheme requires that such a person be confined in a secure facility until the conclusion of trial, and that such a requirement does not violate the due process protections of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Background. </em>The respondent, William Knapp, has twice been convicted of sexual offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was scheduled to be released from custody on April 14, 2001. On March 19, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (b), alleging him to be a sexually dangerous person who should be committed under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>After an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge found \u201ccredible evidence . . . to establish probable cause to find that Knapp is a sexually dangerous person,\u201d and committed him to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) for a sixty-day period of examination. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>At the conclusion of the examination period, the Commonwealth moved that Knapp be further committed pending the trial on its petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 22, 2001, the judge denied the motion and ruled that Knapp could be released pending trial to in-house confinement once proper electronic monitoring was secured. He eventually was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>released.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth appealed from this order to a single justice of the Appeals Court, who declined to grant relief. Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, the Commonwealth then petitioned for review by a single justice of this court, contending that, after a judge has found probable cause and the Commonwealth has petitioned for trial, a respondent must be confined to a secure facility until (and throughout) his commitment trial. Knapp opposed the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, asserting that G. L. c. 123A could be interpreted to permit his release and that automatic pretrial detention would violate his due process rights. The single justice reserved and reported the issue to the full court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Finding \u201cthe danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders . . . to be grave and that the protection of the public from these sex offenders is of paramount interest to the government,\u201d the Legislature in 1999 enacted a mechanism, codified at G. L. c. 123A, to provide for the civil commitment of individuals convicted of sexual offenses who are found to be sexually dangerous persons. St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The preamble to the legislation proclaimed that \u201c[t]he deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to protect forthwith the vulnerable members of our communities,\u201d and therefore \u201cdeclared [it] to be an emergency law.\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">General Laws c. 123A sets forth strict procedures that courts and the Commonwealth must follow with regard to the civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons. Section 12 (a) requires facilities holding persons convicted of sexual offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to notify the office of the appropriate district attorney and the Attorney General six months before their scheduled release. Section 12 <em>(b) </em>instructs that if either determines that the person to be released is likely to be sexually dangerous, they may file a petition supported by sufficient facts alleging as much. On the filing of such a petition, \u00a7 12 (c) directs the court to hold a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person is sexually dangerous. If, after the probable cause hearing, the judge finds that there is sufficient admissible evidence on each element such that a jury could find that the person is sexually dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt (probable cause), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>438 Mass. 519, 524 (2003), \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>provides that the judge \u201cshall\u201d commit the person to the treatment center for up to sixty days for examination and diagnosis by two qualified examiners. Those examiners must file a written report within forty-five days, and within fourteen days thereafter (or within sixty days of the commitment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 831 [2003]), the Commonwealth must then decide whether to move for trial. If it does, \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>directs that the person \u201cshall be confined to a secure facility for the duration of the trial,\u201d and that the trial must occur within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The language that the Legislature has employed and the procedures that it has set forth demonstrate its clear \u201cconcern with protecting the public from harm by persons . . . who are likely to be sexually dangerous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 504 (2000). The statute\u2019s strict timetables and express recitations of respondents\u2019 rights throughout the process also demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s simultaneous concern for individuals\u2019 liberty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We interpret the legislation in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Reading the statute as a cohesive whole, as we must, <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Mansfield, </em>320 Mass. 140, 142 (1946), we conclude that it establishes a scheme that allocates discretion by the level of scrutiny that has been applied to the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation that a person is sexually dangerous. Section 12 of the statute sets out the procedure to be followed up through the probable cause hearing. In this context, \u00a7 12 (e) provides that \u201c[i]f the person... is scheduled to be released [from prison]. . . prior to the court\u2019s probable cause determination, the court. . . <em>may </em>temporarily commit such person to the treatment center pending disposition of the petition,\u201d and that a person so committed \u201cmay move the court for relief from such temporary commitment <em>at any time prior to the probable cause </em>determination\u201d (emphases added). We have interpreted \u00a7 12 (&lt;?) to mean that, before a finding of probable cause to support the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation (while any potential danger has yet to be fully demonstrated or examined), a judge is permitted to either release or temporarily commit the respondent (if his prison sentence has expired) depending on the adequacy of the Commonwealth\u2019s showing of evidence of sexual dangerousness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 510-511 (showing necessary to warrant temporary commitment under \u00a7 12 <em>[e] </em>must be equivalent of \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d and include some expert evidence).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">After a finding of probable cause, however, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14 of the statute operate to deprive the judge of discretion with respect to whether the person will be committed. At this point, \u201cthe prisoner . . . <em>shall </em>be committed to the treatment center. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>for the purpose of examination\u201d (emphasis added). \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>If, after examination, the Commonwealth petitions for a trial, \u201cthe court shall notify the person . . . that a trial by jury will be held within [sixty] days,\u201d and \u201c[t]he person . . . <em>shall </em>be confined to a secure facility for the duration of the trial\u201d (emphasis added). \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>The use of this language leaves no doubt that the Legislature intended confinement at the treatment center or another secure facility to be mandatory after a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Knapp argues, however, that \u00a7 14 (e) recognizes judicial discretion to consider relief from confinement even after a probable cause finding, as the circumstances in each case may require. He points particularly to language in \u00a7 14 (&lt;?) that, on its face, seems to parallel the language of \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>His reading of \u00a7 14 <em>(e) </em>is too broad. Although it provides that \u201c[i]f the person named in the petition is scheduled to be released from [custody] at any time prior to the final judgment, the court <em>may </em>temporarily commit such person to the treatment center pending disposition of the petition\u201d (emphasis added), this language is preceded by language within the same section of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>making secure confinement mandatory after a probable cause finding and the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial. See \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>Section 12 contains no such limiting predicate language. To the contrary, it contains language \u2014 notably absent from \u00a7 14 \u2014 affording the respondent an avenue to obtain relief from temporary confinement at the treatment center prior to his probable cause hearing. See \u00a7 12 (&lt;?). Thus, in the context of \u00a7 14, of which it is a part, we interpret \u00a7 14 <em>(e) </em>as intending only to authorize the transfer of a respondent from prison to the treatment center if his sentence is scheduled to expire after the probable cause hearing but before the final disposition of the commitment petition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 287-289 (2002). We do not interpret it to grant a judge the authority or discretion to release any such person from secure confinement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Knapp further argues that the language in \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>directing the confinement of persons \u201cfor the duration of the trial\u201d applies only to the period of actual court proceedings, and does not apply to the period between the finding of probable cause and the beginning of the trial itself. This makes little sense. The Legislature\u2019s stated purpose is to protect the public from harm by persons likely to be sexually dangerous. A sexually dangerous person would not pose a greater risk to the public during the court proceedings than before, and we find it implausible that the Legislature would require confinement only during proceedings simply to reduce the risk of flight during that limited period. Once a judge has found that probable cause exists to believe that a person is sexually dangerous and the Commonwealth has petitioned for trial (as it must to set the trial process in motion), the clear intent and requirement of the statute is that the person be confined in a secure facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Our analysis does not conclude with interpreting the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>language. While commitment proceedings under G. L. c. 123A are civil in nature, \u201cthe potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to [them] \u2018mandates that due process protections apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bruno, 432 Mass. 489, 502 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[S]ubstantive due process\u201d prevents the government from engaging in conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), or interferes with rights \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325-326 (1937).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987).\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993). If the government\u2019s action impairs a fundamental right, that action must be \u201cnarrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling governmental interest\u201d in order to survive substantive due process review. <em>Id. </em>Procedural due process, the second part of our constitutional analysis, \u201crequires that a statute or governmental action that has survived substantive due process scrutiny be implemented in a fair manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The right of an individual to be free from physical restraint is a paradigmatic fundamental right. \u201c[F]reedom from physical restraint \u2018has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997), quoting <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992). Confinement, therefore, must be narrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling governmental interest. As expressed in the preamble to the 1999 emergency legislation, the legislative interest at stake is the protection of the public from harm by persons likely to be sexually dangerous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 504. We already have held that interest to be both legitimate and compelling. <em>Id. </em>We now consider whether the confinement of a convicted sexual offender alleged by the Commonwealth to be sexually dangerous, after a judge has found that probable cause exists to believe that the person is sexually dangerous, and after the Commonwealth has petitioned for trial, is narrowly tailored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to furthering this interest. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra, </em>we held that the temporary commitment of a person to a treatment center prior to the probable cause determination, as allowed by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e), </em>is narrowly tailored to the Legislature\u2019s expressed interest and does not violate substantive due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 504. In so holding, we noted that the Commonwealth may petition for a probable cause hearing only when it can show by \u201csufficient facts\u201d that it is \u201clikely\u201d that a person is sexually dangerous, that the Commonwealth may not seek temporary commitment under \u00a7 12 (e) unless it satisfies the probable cause to arrest standard with a \u201csufficient showing\u201d based on \u201cevidence before the court\u201d that the person is likely to commit future harm, that temporary commitment is in a treatment center rather than a correctional facility, and that the temporarily committed person may seek relief at any time before the probable cause determination. <em>Id. </em>at 503-504, 507-508. We evaluate the nondiscretionary commitment mandated by \u00a7 14 (a) in light of our previous analysis of the temporary commitment allowed by \u00a7 12(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Although the confinement described in \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>is automatic and nondiscretionary, it does not occur in a vacuum. Before a person may be temporarily confined pending the outcome of his commitment trial under \u00a7 14 (a), he must be a convicted sexual offender, serving a prison sentence at the time the Commonwealth petitions for his commitment, whose sentence is scheduled to expire before that final outcome is obtained. A judge must also have concluded, after a probable cause hearing (including expert testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 513), with significant procedural protections provided to the respondent, that there is sufficient admissible evidence on each element of proof necessary to satisfy a jury that the person is sexually dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>438 Mass. 519, 524 (2003). In addition, the Commonwealth must have petitioned for trial after the respondent has been evaluated by at least two qualified examiners at the treatment center. Finally, the statute requires that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>absent merited delay, the trial must be held within sixty days.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In these circumstances, we conclude that the confinement of such a person is narrowly tailored to the Legislature\u2019s expressed interest in protecting the public from harm by persons convicted of sexual offenses who are likely to be sexually dangerous. Cf. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 131 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004) (holding bail revocation following charge of crime committed while on release to be \u201cnarrowly tailored to further the Commonwealth\u2019s legitimate and compelling interests in assuring compliance with its laws[] and in preserving the integrity of the judicial process\u201d); <em>Querubin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 108, 116 (2003) (holding denial of bail to defendant posing flight risk to be \u201cnarrowly tailored to the State\u2019s legitimate and compelling interest in assuring the defendant\u2019s presence at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We proceed to determine whether such confinement is implemented in a fair manner under the statute and therefore satisfies the requirements of procedural due process. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Where, as here, the government interferes with an individual\u2019s protected liberty interest, we must balance the interest of the individual affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of its affairs. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 131. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976); <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 675 (1993). As we have recognized, \u201c[t]he requirements of procedural due process are pragmatic and flexible, not rigid or hypertechnical. . . . \u2018[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the particular situation demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 427 (2001), quoting <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739 (1987), and <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>Knapp argues that a determination of \u201cprobable cause\u201d using the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>438 Mass. 519, 522 (2003), is constitutionally inadequate to justify his confinement pending final judgment, and that the Commonwealth must instead prove by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that there are no conditions of release that may reasonably assure the safety of the public.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, supra, </em>and <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>do not require such a standard in this circumstance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accord <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>29 Cal. 4th 228, 252 (2002) (approving confinement of person until commitment trial once judge determines at probable cause hearing that <em>\u201creasonable person could entertain a strong </em>suspicion\u201d that person is sexually violent [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a judge may deny bail \u201c[w]hen the Government proves by clear and convincing evidence that an arrestee presents an identified and articulable threat to an individual or the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751. In <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 675, 682, we struck down a Massachusetts statute that permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ted \u201cjudicial officer[s] to set bail in an amount so that an arrestee perceived to be dangerous will not be able to gain his or her liberty pending trial\u201d as an unconstitutional \u201cscattershot attempt\u201d at incapacitation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These cases, reviewing the constitutionality of statutes permitting the denial of bail on general grounds of dangerousness in criminal prosecutions, are inapposite to our consideration here of a statute providing for the confinement of a person awaiting a civil commitment trial, after sufficient evidence has been found to exist for a determination of sexual dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Unlike the holding of suspects denied bail, confinement of alleged sexually dangerous persons after their release from prison and pending a commitment trial under G. L. c. 123A is civil, not criminal, in nature. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361-363 (1997) (proceedings under statute that, like G. L. c. 123A, required secure confinement after judge found probable cause to believe that person was sexually violent predator are civil, not criminal). Those confined are held in the treatment center (a secure mental health facility), not a correctional facility. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 13 (a), 14 (a); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>808 F.2d 871, 879 (1st Cir. 1986) (distinguishing between confinement in jail and in treatment facility). And confinement may continue only for a relatively short period of time. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a). See also <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, 783 &amp; n.5 (1996) (noting constitutional significance of term of confinement); <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>346 F. Supp. 1265, 1268 (D. Conn. 1972), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>411 U.S. 911 (1973) (holding forty-five day commitment to hospital for mental illness on physician\u2019s finding of dangerousness not to violate due process because of availability of judicial review after forty-five days).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Further, the combination of an adversary probable cause hearing (including expert testimony), the standard for finding prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>able cause (see note 13, <em>supra), </em>and the follow-on examination by at least two qualified examiners, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13, creates a constitutionally adequate mechanism for eliminating the danger of erroneous confinement beyond a period justified by the demonstrated risk. The confinement required by \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>occurs in a setting that respects the balance that procedural due process requires.</p>\n<p id=\"Akt\">Therefore, in response to the question reported to us by the single justice, we hold that G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>does not permit a judge to release a respondent pending trial, on probationary conditions, after a finding of probable cause on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for his commitment as a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the single justice for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A_mc\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The respondent does not make a separate argument under the due process provisions of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Knapp was convicted in 1978 of assault with intent to rape, and in 1988 of assault with intent to murder, assault with intent to rape, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and indecent assault and battery on a person who has attained age fourteen (there is some discrepancy in the defendant\u2019s brief and in parts of the record; nonetheless, it appears certain that the victim of the indecent assault and battery had attained age fourteen).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Instead of petitioning for a trial within fourteen days of the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 report, as G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>envisions, the Commonwealth included its petition for a trial within its initial petition alleging that Knapp is a sexually dangerous person. Knapp moved to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for commitment on this basis. After a hearing, the Superior Court judge denied the motion, holding that the Commonwealth\u2019s combined filing fulfilled \u201cthe spirit and letter of the statute.\u201d Knapp argues here that the Commonwealth\u2019s combined filing makes its petition invalid and therefore would render his own commitment illegal. The question whether the Commonwealth may file its \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>petition concurrently with its \u00a7 12 (b) petition was not reserved and reported by the single justice; therefore, we do not address it.

See <em>id. </em>at 167 n.4. Its instruction to trial judges that they may consider imposing conditions of supervised probation in lieu of a temporary commitment to the treatment center is therefore consistent with our interpretation of \u00a7 12 (e), but not applicable after a finding of probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Massachusetts is not the only State to require confinement after a judge determines that probable cause exists to believe that a person is sexually dangerous.

While these circumstances are not presented here, our reasoning with respect to the limited meaning of \u00a7 14 <em>(e) </em>would apply as equally to the mandatory language of \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>as it does to that of \u00a7 14 (\u00ab).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">If the relevant agencies and the Commonwealth act promptly, as they should, commitment proceedings may even conclude before the date on which a person is scheduled to be released from custody.

Second, she must be satisfied that the evidence on each of the elements is not so incredible, insubstantial, or otherwise of such a quality that no reasonable person could rely on it to conclude that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blanchette, </em>54 Mass.
