L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, seeks to vacate the award of an arbitrator, who found that the permanent involuntary transfer of a longtime Superior Court stenographer from Brockton to Dedham violated the collective bargaining agreement between the Chief Justice for Administration and Management of the Trial Court (CJAM) and the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 6, AFL-CIO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>(union). The arbitrator ordered that the court reporter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> be allowed to return to Brockton. He also awarded her mileage reimbursement for each day she worked in Dedham, starting February 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The CJAM filed a petition under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, to vacate the award, claiming the arbitrator exceeded his authority by interfering with the orderly administration of the functions of the Superior Court department and the statutory authority of the Justices of the Superior Court to assign court reporters to perform services in any county. See G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82. The union filed a counterclaim to confirm the award. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. After a hearing, the Superior Court judge recused herself and requested that a judge from another Trial Court Department be specially assigned to hear the matter. The parties then filed a joint motion for reconsideration and to reserve and report the case to the Appeals Court, whereupon the judge reported the case without decision. See Mass. R. Civ. R 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996). We transferred the case on our own motion. Because we conclude the arbitrator did not exceed his authority, we confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The parties agreed to a joint statement of the material facts, which they stipulated are all that are needed for resolution of this case. However, to clarify certain points, we include undisputed facts from the arbitrator\u2019s opinion. See <em>School Comm, of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 754 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The CJAM is the employer for all employees of the Trial Court, including court reporters. By statutory authority, the CJAM has the power to establish \u201csystem wide personnel policies and hiring practices\u201d and to act as collective bargaining agent on behalf of the Trial Court. See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (iv). See also G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The union is the exclusive collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>live bargaining representative of a unit of administrative and clerical employees of the Trial Court, including court reporters. The CJAM and the union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that was in full force and effect at all times relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">In June, 1993, Kathleen Lindelof was appointed as a permanent court reporter to the Plymouth Superior Court in Brockton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By early 2000, she was one of two senior court reporters working in Brockton. For approximately ten days between the middle of January and February 4, 2000, Lindelof was temporarily assigned to court houses in Fall River and Dedham.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 5, 2000, Lindelof was permanently reassigned to the Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nine days later she filed a grievance, claiming that both the temporary and permanent transfers violated art. XXII of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Section 22.01 of art. XXII of the agreement provides: \u201cWhen the qualifications, such as training, skill, ability, and other relevant qualities are considered relatively equal by the Employer, the Employer shall transfer or make shift assignments in accordance with the following procedure: 1. The Employer shall ask for volunteers first. 2. If more than one employee volunteers, the employee having the most seniority shall be chosen. 3. If there are no volunteers, the Employer shall make work assignments according to seniority with the junior employee being subject to transfer or shift assignment.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Lindelof\u2019s grievance was denied at all levels of the agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>meat\u2019s grievance procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The union then filed a demand to arbitrate the grievance. On September 14, 2001, a mutually selected arbitrator issued an opinion and award, finding that \u201cthe Employer\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not violate the agreement by temporarily transferring Lindelof from Brockton to Dedham.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The arbitrator found that her permanent reassignment to Dedham, however, did violate the contract. As previously noted, he ordered that Lindelof be allowed to return to Brockton at the commencement of the next assignment period. Deeming the time she spent in Dedham to be a \u201ctemporary\u201d assignment, the arbitrator also awarded Lindelof mileage reimbursement (as provided by art. XII of the agreement) for each day she commuted to Dedham.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pending the litigation, Lindelof remained in Dedham and received no mileage reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Although the parties agreed to four issues in this case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> they can be reduced to a single question: Did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>arbitrator exceed his authority in ruling that the permanent reassignment of court reporters is subject to the procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding the statutory powers of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and the CJAM to transfer such employees as needed? See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3) (requiring arbitration award be vacated if arbitrator exceeded powers). The power and authority of the Superior Court, its Chief Justice, and the CJAM derive from G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, and from G. L. c. 21 IB. We begin our discussion by setting forth the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">General Laws c. 221, \u00a7 82, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe justices of the superior court shall appoint from time to time such official stenographers ... for the several counties as the business of the court may require. Official . . . stenographers shall be sworn officers of the court, removable at the pleasure of the justices, may be appointed for more than one county, and shall perform such services in the county or counties for which they are appointed or in any other county, as may be assigned them by the justices or by their authority.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (i), the Chief Justice of a Trial Court (in this case, the Superior Court) has \u201c[t]he power to appoint, discipline, evaluate, <em>transfer </em>and define the duties of all nonjudicial personnel within his department including . . . court reporters\u201d (emphasis added). Section 10 (i) goes on to provide that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any decision of a chief justice under this paragraph may appeal such decision to the [CJAM].\u201d Section 10 (v) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201c[The Chief Justice] notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, when necessary to ensure the proper administration of justice, [may] transfer employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of his department to serve where needed . . . provided, however, that said chief justice may, upon reasonable notice, <em>temporarily </em>transfer nonjudicial personnel within his department, divisions and places for holding court, and in no event shall any such transfer be more than a reasonable distance from the place where such personnel is employed unless the employee so transferred shall consent thereto; provided, further, that such transfer of the employee shall not be for more than ninety days, but such transfer may be extended for three consecutive ninety-day periods, provided that notice is given to the house and senate committees on ways and means upon each extension, including the employee\u2019s position, duties, and reason for the transfer, but such transfer shall not exceed three hundred and sixty consecutive days\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Finally, G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxii), provides that the CJAM, like a Trial Court Chief Justice, also may \u201ctransfer employees of the trial court to serve where needed,\u201d subject to the same proviso, quoted above, that applies to a Chief Justice of the Trial Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>the so-called \u201cconflicts\u201d section of the public employee labor relations statute, provides that, if a collective bargaining agreement conflicts with any one of several enumerated statutory provisions, then the terms of the agreement prevail.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[Statutes not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 7 <em>(d) </em>will prevail over contrary terms in collective bargaining agreements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Mass. 124, 126 (1989), citing <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations </em>Comm\u2019n, 390 Mass. 157, 163 (1983). See <em>School Comm, of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Natick, </em>423 Mass. 34, 39 (1996). Among the statutory sections <em>not </em>listed in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>are G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, and G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10. The provisions of these sections, therefore, override any conflicting provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court, </em>380 Mass. 128, 131 (1980). See also <em>Berkshire Hills Regional Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Berkshire Hills Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 522, 527 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">This language appears purposely omitted from G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>Section 7 <em>(d) </em>does include G. L. c. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 69-73, 75, 80, and 89 (applicable to court officers, deputy sheriffs, constables, and clerical assistants), but it passes directly over \u00a7 82, which pertains to court reporters. As for G. L. c. 211B, only \u00a7 8, which establishes an advisory committee on personnel standards, is listed in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7. Section 8 requires the CJAM to \u201cestablish and promulgate standards for the appointment, performance, promotion, continuing education and removal of all personnel within the trial court, except judges, clerks and registers of probate,\u201d and requires that appointments comply with those promulgated standards. It says nothing about the transfer, temporary or otherwise, of such personnel, and therefore is immaterial to that aspect of the authority of either the CJAM or the Chief Justice of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The union argues that the CJAM negotiated and entered into a valid three-year agreement that binds the employer into a seniority-based procedure for transferring court reporters. See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u25a0 9 (iv). The CJAM, however, contends that he had no authority to bargain away the power vested in the Superior Court by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, to appoint and assign stenographers. See <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, 357 </em>Mass. 492, 502 (1970). The union counters that to the extent G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, which was enacted in 1927 (St. 1927, c. 332, \u00a7 1), conflicts with G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10, enacted in 1978 (St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110), the more recent (and more specific) statute prevails. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215 (1997) (new provision is more recent expression of Legislature\u2019s intent). Moreover, because G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>entitles an employee aggrieved by a transfer decision by the Chief Justice to appeal from the decision to the CJAM, the union asserts that \u201cany perceived power to transfer court reporters under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, gives way to the power of the CJAM to oversee and bind under a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\u201cAll the statutes must be construed, where capable, so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose disclosed in the new act. Such purpose is to be gleaned from the reasons, where ascertainable, leading to the legislation, from the nature of the subject matter, from the supposed evil to be corrected, and from the objective sought to be attained.\u201d <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, supra </em>at 499, quoting <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>335 Mass. 610, 614-615 (1957). Chapter 211B, part of the Court Reorganization Act of 1978, created a \u201ctrial court of the commonwealth,\u201d of which the \u201cchief administrative justice\u201d (now called the CJAM) became the \u201cadministrative head.\u201d St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110. See <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court, supra </em>at 130.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cA major feature of the Court Reorganization Act, in order \u2018to promote the orderly and effective administration of the judicial system of the commonwealth,\u2019 was \u2018an administrative consolidation of the several courts of trial jurisdiction, so as to encourage a broader availability of personnel and other resources for the hearing of all causes on an equitable basis by the several justices of the trial court, so-called.\u2019 . . . What were previously separate trial courts became \u2018departments\u2019 and \u2018divisions\u2019 of departments. General Laws c. 211B, \u00a7 9, provides for the assignment of a justice in one department to sit in any other department. <em>Vital to the scheme is the further provision of \u00a7 9 for the assignment of nonjudicial personnel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>among the various departments, divisions or places for holding court. If transfers of judges are to accomplish their purpose, it seems obvious that essential supporting personnel must be made available\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 129-130. See <em>Clerk of the Superior Court for the County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>386 Mass. 517, 522 (1982) (\u201cThe thrust of the statute is toward consolidation, not separation; toward conformity, not diversity\u201d). Although arcane by comparison, G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, states that stenographers shall be appointed \u201cas the business of the court may require,\u201d and further that they \u201cshall perform such services in the county or counties for which they are appointed <em>or in any other county, </em>as may be assigned them by the justices <em>or by their </em>authority\u201d (emphasis added). Of course, \u00a7 82 must be construed consistently with G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (iv) and 10 (i) and (v); indeed, any power vested in the Superior Court is subject to the higher authority of the CJAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Read together, we think these statutes evidence a longstanding legislative intent to commit to the court or its authority, i.e., the Chief Justices and the CJAM, an exclusive managerial prerogative over the assignment and transfer of court reporters. See <em>Berkshire Hills Regional Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Berkshire Hills Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 525-527. This managerial prerogative, however, is not unfettered. See <em>School Comm, of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 760-761 (2003). General Laws c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 10 (v) and 9 (xxii), make it clear that the Chief Justices may only \u201ctemporarily transfer\u201d such employees, subject to several specific conditions and requirements, e.g., such transfer may not exceed 360 consecutive days.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>listed under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, they would prevail over any contrary term in the agreement. No provision of the agreement, however, conflicts with that authority; on the contrary, \u00a7 22.02 of the agreement states that \u201c[transfers subject to G. L. c. 211B [i.e., temporary transfers] will continue to be administered in accordance with that statute.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">As to the permanent transfer of court reporters, however, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10 of G. L. c. 211B are silent. Under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2, public employees have the right \u201cto form, join, or assist any employee organization for the purpose of bargaining collectively through representatives of their own choosing on questions of wages, hours, <em>and other terms and conditions of employment'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6 (collective bargaining agreement may cover \u201cwages, hours, standards or productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment\u201d). If the bargained-for terms and conditions conflict with a statute, the agreement must yield if that statute is not listed under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>See <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 793 &amp; n.9 (1977). As previously noted, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 are not listed under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>However, we discern no \u201cmaterial conflict\u201d between the employer\u2019s statutory power temporarily to transfer employees, and terms of the agreement as to the procedure for making permanent transfers. See <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 124-125 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Although the CJAM may not surrender his authority to transfer employees, \u201cthere is no reason why [the CJAM] may not bind [himself] to follow certain procedures precedent to the making of any such decision.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 113 (1977). See <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, supra </em>at 795-796. If we accept the CJAM\u2019s argument that he lacked authority so to bargain, it would mean that Chief Justices (including the CJAM) could temporarily transfer court reporters subject to the restrictions set out in \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, but that under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82, Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Court justices could permanently reassign court reporters \u2014 a decision that has a much greater impact than a temporary transfer \u2014 without restrictions. We doubt this is the intent of the Legislature. The broad powers of the CJAM under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 9, absorb the power to the justices of the Superior Court granted by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">There is no claim that the arbitrator\u2019s decision violated public policy. See <em>School Comm, of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>369 Mass. 683, 685 (1976). On the contrary, this Commonwealth has a \u201cstrong public policy favoring collective bargaining between the public employers and employees over the conditions and terms of employment.\u201d <em>School Comm, of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, supra </em>at 761-762. We conclude that the procedure for involuntarily transferring employees permanently was a proper subject for collective bargaining and thus governed by the binding arbitration provisions of the agreement. See <em>id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The arbitrator did not exceed his authority in finding that the CJAM violated the terms of the agreement. His decision that Lindelof be allowed to return to the Superior Court in Brockton and be reimbursed for her mileage is an appropriate remedy, given that the involuntary permanent transfer took place without observance of the procedures prescribed by the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>School Comm, of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, supra </em>at 793. As there is no indication that Lindelof submitted vouchers or other evidence of a sum owed that was wrongfully denied, thereby constituting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cbreach,\u201d see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, she is not entitled to interest on her award.

L. c. 221, \u00a7 82), was \u201cto afford assistance to the court and the counsel in conducting the trial, and in drawing up reports and bills of exceptions; not that a complete record of all that took place in the court below, whether material or immaterial to the understanding of the questions of law reserved, should be transmitted to this court.\u201d <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>115 Mass. 310, 314 (1874).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In this case, the CJAM did not actually transfer Lindelof but rather permitted it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Before G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, took effect in 1974, St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 7, any part or provision of a collective bargaining agreement that conflicted with any law, ordinance, or bylaw was invalid under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1781. See <em>School Comm, of Braintree </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>369 Mass. 686, 688-689 (1976), citing <em>Chief of Police of Westford </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>365 Mass. 526, 528 n.l (1974). A Legislative Research Council Report Relative to Collective Bargaining and Local Government Employees, 1969 House Doc. No. 4746, noted that this was an area \u201cof deep concern\u201d to labor, and one that engendered \u201cfrustration and bitterness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 37. According to the report, labor \u201cwould like to make the agreements valid, regardless of previous statutes,\u201d such that \u201cbargaining agreements should supersede all statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 38. The inclusion in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, of certain statutes that yield to conflicting terms in collective bargaining agreements seems to reflect an attempt by the Legislature to compromise on this issue. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Belmont, 7 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 214, 217-218 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The union also argues that because under G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9 (iv), the CJAM has the responsibility \u201cconsistent with\u201d G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 8, to provide personnel management, and \u00a7 8 is listed under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, the authority of the CJAM is therefore subordinate to the collective bargaining agreement. In light of our conclusion, we need not decide the issue. We note, however, that the specific statutory authority of the CJAM for transferring employees under G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxii), does not track \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Indeed, the legislative history of St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 79, which rewrote G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, indicates that the Senate opposed granting the chief justices power to make permanent transfers. The Senate rejected a proposed amendment to the bill, 1992 House Doc. No. 6232 (incorporating the text of 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1783), which would have provided that if the transfer of a court employee by either the CJAM or a trial court chief justice was effective for more than thirty days, \u201csuch employee\u2019s position shall be deemed transferred,\u201d with notice to be given to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means. See 1992 Senate J. 1580.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In addition, \u00a7 5.04 of the collective bargaining agreement states: \u201cThe arbitrator shall have no power to . . . issue any decision or award inconsistent with applicable law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\">While we agree that the contractual procedures for involuntary permanent transfer were not followed here, we reject the arbitrator\u2019s view as expressed in his order and challenged by the CJAM that in the absence of a volunteer transferee, \u201cthe least senior reporter statewide\u201d must be transferred to Dedham. The critically important management prerogative of deciding which courts are understaffed and which have available resources that could be used to staff them has not been relinquished in the collective bargaining agreement. Once the Chief Justice determined that a reporter could be spared from Brock-ton on a permanent basis for use in Dedham, the pool to which the collective bargaining agreement applied were those reporters in Brockton. In the absence of a volunteer from that court, the least senior reporter there would be transferred to' Dedham.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We are constrained to address an extraneous comment in the arbitrator\u2019s decision which, while not necessary to his decision, may nevertheless have an impact on current practice or future collective bargaining agreements. The comment is as follows: \u201cWhat should have happened at the end of January was that the established assignment procedure should have been followed. The three permanent reporters in Brockton should have been allowed to exercise their seniority rights in choosing from among the three remaining sessions.\u201d The arbitrator is referring to a procedure known as \u201cbanking\u201d (a term that does not appear in the record), whereby court reporters choose a court session based on seniority with the expectation that the chosen session will likely produce the need for a transcript for appellate purposes. Court reporters with the most seniority build up a backlog of such work and consequently an increased opportunity for greater income. This practice frequently causes delays in the preparation of transcripts. Inordinate delays in the appellate process may interfere with the due process rights of a criminal defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichel, </em>403 Mass. 103, 108-109 (1988), and cases cited, as well as the constitutional duty of the appellate courts. While, by contrast, seniority has a place in the assignment of court reporters to court locations, it has no place in their assignment to court sessions. There is no provision in the collective bargaining agreement covering choice of session, and the need for the <em>prompt </em>preparation of trial transcripts, especially in criminal cases, must take precedence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
