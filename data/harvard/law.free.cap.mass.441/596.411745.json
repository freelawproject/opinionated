L. c. 79, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutional because, as applied to this plaintiff, the rate that it prescribes is so low as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>confiscatory pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (owner entitled to \u201cjust compensation\u201d when property taken for public use) and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (owner entitled to \u201creasonable compensation\u201d). The plaintiffs request for utilization of a rate of interest higher than that provided by statute was first made in a motion pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 60 (a) and (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), filed almost thirteen months after the entry of judgment. The Appeals Court held that the plaintiff had waived its constitutional claim to higher interest when it failed to present evidence on the issue at trial. <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 669 (2003). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the following reasons, we conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s rule 60 motion raising the issue, and we therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>By order of taking dated December 13, 1993, and recorded on December 30, 1993, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) effected a taking of real property owned by the plaintiff M.B. Claff, Inc. (Claff). Dissatisfied with the MBTA\u2019s pro tanto payment of $80,000, Claff filed an action for compensation on February 14, 1996. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 14. Claff s complaint did not contain any allegation that the rate of interest set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, was confiscatory.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor did Claff raise this issue at any time prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>or during trial. On June 16, 1999, the jury returned a special verdict finding damages in the amount of $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On June 24, 1999, the parties filed a stipulation that the MBTA had paid Claff $80,000 as a pro tanto payment back in December, 1993. Neither party submitted anything on the subject of what interest rate was to be applied. On July 7, 1999, judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $620,000 \u201cwith interest thereon from 2-14-96 in the sum of $252,552.32 as provided by law.\u201d It was apparent from the face of the judgment that the assistant clerk had made two errors in calculating that amount of interest. First, contrary to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, the assistant clerk had calculated interest as accruing only from the date of the filing of the suit rather than from the date of the taking. Second, the clerk had calculated interest at the rate of twelve per cent per year rather than the rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, which, for a taking occurring in December, 1993, would have been 3.61 per cent per year. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>On August 4, 1999, the MBTA filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. Claff did not file notice of any cross appeal. The MBTA\u2019s appeal was never entered in the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On July 28, 2000, Claff filed a motion to dismiss the MBTA\u2019s appeal and a motion for relief from judgment seeking to assess interest on the judgment at the rate of seven per cent per annum from the date of taking or, in the alternative, at the rate of 3.61 per cent set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. Claff\u2019s motion for relief was submitted as a motion pursuant to rule 60 (a) and (b) (6). The MBTA assented to that portion of Claff\u2019s motion seeking recalculation of the interest rate at 3.61 per cent per year from the date of the taking, but objected to ClafFs attempt to impose an interest rate higher than that provided by statute.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 8, 2000, the judge denied Claff\u2019s request that the interest rate be increased to seven per cent, allowed Claff\u2019s alternative request that the statutory interest rate of 3.61 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>cent be calculated running from the date of the taking,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and dismissed the MBTA\u2019s appeal as moot. An amended judgment, reflecting the recalculated interest, then entered. Claff appealed from that portion of the judge\u2019s order that denied its request for interest at the rate of seven per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Appeals Court observed that the statutory interest rate does not necessarily equate to constitutionally adequate compensation in all eminent domain cases, but held that Claff had waived its claim for additional interest by failing to raise it in a timely manner. <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 669, 673-674, 677-678 (2003). Specifically, the Appeals Court ruled that a claim for a higher rate of interest had to be raised prior to trial to give \u201cadequate notice to the defendant that there will be a contest on the issue,\u201d and that, absent stipulation or resolution by way of motion for summary judgment, the interest claim would present an issue of fact to be determined by the fact finder at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 675-677. \u201c[Ejvidence of what that [reasonable] rate should be must be presented at trial as part of the plaintiff\u2019s proof of just compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675. Where Claff had neither given prior notice of its intent to pursue this aspect of a claim for compensation nor presented any evidence on the issue at trial, the Appeals Court treated the claim as waived. <em>Id. </em>at 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">While Claff (and the Attorney General as amicus curiae) protest that requiring a party to present an interest claim at trial is impractical and needlessly burdensome (there being no issue as to interest unless and until there is a determination that the owner is entitled to compensation above and beyond the pro tanto payment), the Appeals Court\u2019s analysis is conceptually sound. The basis for a court\u2019s award of an interest rate higher than that set by statute is the theory that interest is part of the \u201cjust compensation\u201d to which the property owner is entitled, and the determination of what amount would be \u201cjust compensation\u201d in a given case is therefore a factual issue to be decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>by a court, not an issue that can be conclusively decided by legislation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship, </em>543 F.2d 1272, 1274-1275 (9th Cir. 1976). Thus, the issue of interest is simply part of the claim for \u201cjust compensation\u201d that must be raised and proved by the property owner if the owner contends that a statutory interest rate fails to satisfy the constitutional requirement of \u201cjust compensation.\u201d Like any other claim, a claim that the statutory rate of interest is unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff is one that needs to be proved, and a proper articulation in a timely pleading followed by proof at trial is the customary method for establishing a party\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Relying on <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 633 (1985), Claff contends that a constitutional challenge to the statutory interest rate may be raised after trial of an eminent domain damages case. During the pendency of the action in <em>Verrochi, </em>the Legislature had amended the statute to increase the interest rate applicable to takings of land from six per cent to ten per cent per year. <em>Id. </em>at 633-635. The issue on appeal was one of statutory interpretation, namely, whether the new, higher interest rate was to be applied retroactively to the date of taking, or whether that rate should only be applied as of the date of the statute\u2019s amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 635-636. The court did not rule on the issue as a constitutional claim, but considered constitutional arguments for the sole purpose of \u201cproper construction of the legislative intent in enacting the . . . amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. Specifically, the court observed that the Legislature had increased the interest rate in response to numerous Federal court decisions holding that a fixed rate of six per cent (which had also been set by statute for Federal eminent domain cases) did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of just compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 639-641, and cases cited. That constitutional analysis, along with other indicia of the Legislature\u2019s intent, convinced the court that the amended statute was intended to have retroactive application. <em>Id. </em>at 641-642.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Claff correctly notes that the plaintiffs in <em>Verrochi </em>filed their motion seeking the higher interest rate after the jury returned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>verdict.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 635. See also <em>Salem Country Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peabody Redevelopment Auth., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 437-438 (1986) (where <em>Verrochi </em>decision issued while defendant\u2019s appeal still pending, single justice properly allowed plaintiff to file late appeal challenging calculation of interest, noting that correct computation of statutory interest pursuant to <em>Verrochi </em>\u201cwas a ministerial act and properly a subject for relief in this court\u201d). However, the issue whether the amendment increasing the interest rate should be interpreted to apply retroactively was a question of law, whereas Claff is contending that, on constitutional grounds, an interest rate higher than the one now provided by statute must be applied, a contention that raises a question of fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We note that other jurisdictions have taken the position that claims concerning the proper rate of interest must be raised and proved at the trial determining just compensation for the taking. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>100 Acres of Land, </em>468 F.2d 1261, 1269-1270 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 822, 864 (1973); <em>King </em>v. <em>State Rds. Comm\u2019n, </em>298 Md. 80, 93-94 (1983). However, we also note that challenges to statutory interest rates in eminent domain proceedings have been raised and resolved in various ways separate and apart from the trial on damages. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship, </em>543 F.2d 1272, 1274 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>97.19 Acres, </em>511 F. Supp. 565 (D. Md. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>319.46 Acres of Land, </em>508 F. Supp. 288 (W.D. Okla. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jim Lupient Oldsmobile Co., </em>509 N.W.2d 361, 362-363 (Minn. 1993); <em>Matter of the City of N.Y., </em>58 N.Y.2d 532, 535-536 (1983); <em>In re Washington Heights-Highbridge Park Community Development Area, </em>82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Misc. 2d 557 (N.Y. Sup. 1975). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>329.73 Acres of Land, </em>695 F.2d 922, 925 (5th Cir. 1983) (suggesting that constitutional challenge to statutory interest rate could be raised by motion to amend judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. R 59 [e]). But see <em>Adventurers Whitestone Corp. </em>v. <em>City of N.Y., </em>65 N.Y.2d 83, 89-91, appeal dismissed, 474 U.S. 935 (1985) (owner could not pursue claim to higher interest in separate proceeding after final judgment in condemnation proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">For purposes of resolving the present appeal, we find it unnecessary to specify precisely when and by what means a plaintiff must make a constitutionally based claim for an interest rate higher than that provided by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. Assuming (without deciding) that Claff should be allowed to raise this issue for the first time posttrial, it could not be raised by way of a motion under either rule 60 (a) or rule 60 (b) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Rule 60 (a) allows the court to correct \u201c[cjlerical mistakes in judgments,\u201d on either its own initiative or on a party\u2019s motion, \u201cat any time.\u201d However, Claff\u2019s motion contending that the interest rate set by \u00a7 37 was unconstitutional, and that a rate of seven per cent was necessary to satisfy the constitutional mandate of \u201creasonable\u201d compensation, did not ask to correct a mere \u201c[cjlerical mistake[].\u201d It raised a substantive issue of disputed fact, not a simple arithmetical or computational error by the clerk. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Worcester Redevelopment Auth., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 459-460 (2001). While rule 60 (a) has been identified as an appropriate avenue of relief to correct errors in the calculation of interest, the errors at issue in those cases involved the clerk\u2019s adding interest to the judgment where no interest was awarded as a matter of law (see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Ctr., </em>423 Mass. 584, 589 [1966]; <em>Worsnop </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 1005, 1006 [1982]; <em>Dins-dale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 926, 927-928 [1995]), or the clerk\u2019s failure to calculate and include obviously applicable statutory interest (see <em>OMalley </em>v. <em>OMalley, </em>419 Mass. 377, 379-381 [1995]). Here, consistent with those cases, correction of the clerk\u2019s apparent error in failing to calculate interest under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, was properly obtained by way of rule 60 (a). However, a rule 60 (a) motion is not an appropriate device to address substantive disputes concerning the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>interest, see <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>430 Mass. 305, 313-314 (1999), and a substantive claim that the statutory interest rate was confiscatory could not be resolved on a rule 60 (a) motion. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Worcester Redevelopment Auth., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Claff alternatively styled its motion as a motion pursuant to rule 60 (b) (6), which allows the court to grant relief for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Relief under that \u201ccatchall provision\u201d is only to be awarded in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Sahin </em>v. <em>Sahin, </em>435 Mass. 396, 406 (2001), and cases cited. A judge does not abuse his discretion in denying rule 60 (b) (6) relief to a claimant advancing an entirely new legal argument that was apparently overlooked during the course of the litigation. See <em>Fox of Boylston St. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>418 Mass. 816, 819 (1994). See also <em>Freitas </em>v. <em>Freitas, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 197-199 (1988) (rule 60 [b] [6] could not be used to add claim for legal fees and costs to divorce judgment). Where Claff\u2019s rule 60 (b) (6) motion seeking additional interest identified no extraordinary circumstance justifying relief, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying that motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>329.73 Acres of Land, </em>695 F.2d 922, 925-926 (5th Cir. 1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>(claim for interest above statutory rate could not be raised by motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. R 60 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Because Claff\u2019s rule 60 (a) motion was not an appropriate avenue to raise its claim that the G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, interest rate was unconstitutional as applied, and because the motion under rule 60 (b) articulated no extraordinary circumstance justifying relief, we need not address the merits of Claff\u2019s contention that the statutory rate was confiscatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\">General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 37, provides in relevant part: \u201cDamages under this chapter shall bear interest at the rate calculated pursuant to the provisions of this section from the date as of which they are assessed until paid ....

For a taking in December, 1993, the statutory formula prescribed a rate of 3.61 per cent per annum. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (2000) (providing table of interest rates on fifty-two week Treasury bills as determined by United States Secretary of Treasury). That rate (and the fact that rates had increased thereafter) was readily ascertainable from published sources at the time the complaint was filed. <em>Id. </em>(Because the same interest rate was applicable to civil judgments in Federal courts, see Pub. L. 97-164, Title HI, \u00a7 302[a][l], [2], 95 Stat. 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>[1982], a table of those rates also appeared in Massachusetts Lawyers Diary and Manual.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) also confirmed that the miscalculation of the interest rate in the original judgment was the only issue it intended to raise on appeal, indicating that it would withdraw the appeal if that calculation were corrected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Because the MBTA\u2019s appeal had not been entered in the Appeals Court, the judge still retained authority to rule on Claff s motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (a) and (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). See J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 60.3, at 471 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2004). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crank, </em>396 Mass. 194, 197 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The same, is true with respect to two other cases relied on by Claff, both of which raised the same issue and were decided the same day as <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 633 (1985). See <em>Hargrove </em>v. <em>Minuteman Regional Vocational Tech. Sch. Dist., </em>394 Mass. 1010 (1985); <em>Holyhood Cemetery Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>394 Mass. 1011 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Moreover, while Claff relies heavily on <em>Verrochi </em>as the paradigm for raising this issue posttrial, Claff did not follow the procedure used in that case. The plaintiffs in <em>Verrochi </em>immediately filed their motion with respect to the calculation of interest on the day the jury verdict was returned. <em>Id. </em>at 635. See <em>Holyhood Cemetery Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>(same). Here, during the three weeks that elapsed between the jury\u2019s verdict and the entry of judgment, Claff raised no issue with respect to the calculation of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">When an error affecting the calculation of interest goes beyond a clerical error covered by rule 60 (a), relief may be obtained by way of motion pursuant to Mass.

Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.15, at 454 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2004). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>329.73 Acres of Land, </em>695 F.2d 922, 925 (5th Cir. 1983). However, a rule 59 (e) motion must be filed within ten days after the entry of judgment. Gaff\u2019s motion, filed over one year after the entry of judgment, could not be entertained as a rule 59 (e) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A motion under rule 60 (b) (6) also must be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Although Gaff\u2019s motion as filed did not articulate any reason for the protracted delay in its filing (almost thirteen months after entry of judgment), Claff now relies on the fact that the judgment as originally entered awarded an amount of interest that was acceptable and constitutionally adequate. By using a rate of twelve per cent a year but calculating interest only from the date the action was filed, the clerk fortuitously calculated an amount of interest that was in fact slightly higher than the interest figure that would result from using the seven per cent figure (now proposed by Claff) calculated from the date of the taking. Claff thus contends that it was under no obligation to seek relief until it realized the MBTA\u2019s appeal intended to challenge the clerk\u2019s obvious failure to calculate interest in accordance with G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. Because we are of the view that denial of the rule 60 (b) (6) motion on its merits would not constitute an abuse of discretion, we need not address whether Gaff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>justification for the delay in filing would qualify as \u201creasonable.\u201d We are, however, troubled by Claff\u2019s reliance on the theory that the clerk \u201cdid the right thing for the wrong reason,\u201d where the clerk\u2019s error was so obvious and the record contained no basis on which to do what Claff now claims was the \u201cright thing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
