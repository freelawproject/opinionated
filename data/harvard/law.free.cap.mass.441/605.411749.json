Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., ante </em>596 (2004), the present appeal contends that the Superior Court judge erred in utilizing the statutory interest rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, to calculate the interest to be awarded as part of an eminent domain damages case. The landowner, Liberty Square Development Trust (Liberty), filed a motion on the day of trial asking the judge to determine the interest rate based on a \u201cprudent investor\u201d standard rather than on the statutory standard. The judge ruled that interest was to be calculated at the statutory rate. After entry of judgment reflecting that rate, Liberty appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the following reasons, we conclude that Liberty did not make a sufficient showing that the statutory rate, as applied to the land taking in question, failed to provide reasonable compensation, and we therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 7, 1995, the city of Worcester (city) effected a taking of two parcels of land owned by Liberty, located on Commercial and Central Streets. The city offered a nominal sum as compensation, which Liberty rejected. Liberty filed an action for its damages on May 6, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On June 19, 2002, immediately prior to the start of trial, Liberty filed a \u201cmotion to determine and assess a proper rate of interest.\u201d In that motion, Liberty contended that the interest rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, was inadequate to provide it with just compensation. Specifically, whereas the statutory formula would provide a rate of 5.88 per cent per year (that rate being based on the auction price of one-year United States Treasury bills immediately prior to the date of taking), Liberty contended that \u201c[a] prudent investor, investing in a mix of low to moderate risk securities of varying maturity, would have realized an annual return of 6.5% to 7.5% depending upon the mix in the portfolio.\u201d The motion recited the rates earned on various forms of investments during the years 1994 through the first quarter of 1999 (Moody\u2019s AAA rated corporate bonds, thirty-year Treasury bonds, five-year Treasury notes, six-month bankers acceptances, and the prime rate), advising the court that \u201c[ejvidence of the rates quoted shall be provided post-verdict, pre-judgment by affidavit or testimony\u201d and that it was \u201cprepared to offer testimony and/or affidavit as to the prudent investor standard in real estate.\u201d No action was taken on the motion prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>On June 26, 2002, after a one-week trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Liberty in the amount of $743,549. The following day, the judge ruled on Liberty\u2019s motion, specifying that interest was to be calculated at the statutory rate, which the judge mistakenly identified as 5.66 per cent per year. Judgment was entered on July 2, 2002, with simple interest from the date of taking calculated at that rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On July 17, Liberty filed a motion to amend the judgment, asking to adjust the interest rate from the 5.66 per cent rate referenced in the judge\u2019s ruling to \u201cthe correct rate\u201d of 5.88 per cent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Liberty\u2019s motion explained that G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, set the interest rate by reference to the \u201clast auction of 52-week United States Treasury bills settled immediately before the date of taking,\u201d and that the last such auction prior to the June 7, 1995, taking was the auction held on May 25, 1995. The figures reflecting those auction rates were set forth in Federal publications, which specified a rate of 5.88 per cent for the May 25, 1995, auction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Liberty\u2019s motion suggested that the clerk had probably obtained the 5.66 per cent rate by consulting an unofficial table of interest rates that contained that error. The motion said nothing about any higher or other rate of interest, and made no reference to Liberty\u2019s prior request to have the judge determine interest based on a \u201cprudent investor\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">On July 25, the city also filed a motion to amend the judgment. The city\u2019s motion asked the judge to reduce the interest award on account of Liberty\u2019s dilatory conduct during discovery, which had allegedly caused considerable delay in reaching trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">On August 16, prior to any ruling on either party\u2019s motion to amend the judgment, Liberty filed a motion for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s ruling on its earlier motion to determine a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>rate of interest, along with an \u201camended motion to determine and assess a proper rate of interest.\u201d That \u201camended\u201d motion, like the original motion, asked the judge to apply a rate of interest that would have been earned by a \u201cprudent investor\u201d in lieu of the statutory rate. However, the \u201camended\u201d motion submitted different figures based on a larger assortment of investment measures than those referenced in the original motion, along with an affidavit from an investment expert and an affidavit from the trustee of Liberty. Whereas the original motion had asked for an interest rate in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, Liberty\u2019s \u201camended\u201d motion now sought an interest rate of 11.12 per cent (according to the expert) or 12 per cent (according to the trustee).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On August 23, the city tendered a check in the amount of $1,059,132.88 to Liberty\u2019s counsel \u201cin full satisfaction\u201d of the judgment. On August 26, Liberty\u2019s counsel replied that, in light of the unresolved issues concerning the interest award, Liberty was not willing to accept the tendered check \u201cin full satisfaction\u201d of the judgment, but would only be willing to accept it as payment on account.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">It appears that the judge held a hearing on the outstanding motions on August 28. At that hearing, he denied the city\u2019s motion to amend the judgment (thereby rejecting the city\u2019s contention that Liberty\u2019s pretrial delay warranted a reduction in the interest award) and allowed Liberty\u2019s motion to amend the judgment, correcting the rate from 5.66 per cent to the 5.88 per cent rate provided by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. During the course of the hearing, Liberty also asked (for the first time) that the interest be calculated as compound interest, and raised a concern as to whether the city\u2019s tender of its check on August 23 operated to stop the accrual of postjudgment interest as of July 31.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After each side submitted further memoranda on those remaining two points, the judge ordered that judgment be entered with simple interest, and that postjudgment interest would not accrue past July 31. Ultimately, the total amount of the judgment (including prejudgment interest) was calculated at $1,052,654.21, plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>costs of $9,564.40 (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>with postjudgment interest through July 31 of $4,951.68. Meanwhile, on September 9, 2002, Liberty had accepted the city\u2019s check \u201con account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The principal issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in denying Liberty\u2019s request to calculate interest based on a \u201cprudent investor\u201d standard rather than at the rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before reaching the merits of that issue, we must first address the city\u2019s arguments that the issue was not timely or properly raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">a. <em>Waiver. </em>As we discussed in <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., ante </em>596, 599-601 (2004), there is some merit to requiring a party to plead and then prove at trial a claim that \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the taking in question requires application of an interest rate higher than that provided by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. Here, Liberty did not raise this issue until literally the morning of trial, normally viewed as a time that is too late to insert a new, substantive claim into the case. Moreover, it did not introduce any evidence on the point at trial, but instead sought leave to produce affidavits or testimony after trial, to the extent that such evidence was deemed necessary to verify the various figures submitted in its motion. However, as we also noted, procedures for determining interest rates in eminent domain cases are not uniform, and property owners have been allowed to challenge the adequacy of statutory interest rates after trial on damages. <em>Id. </em>at 600-601, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Here, it does not appear that the city objected to Liberty\u2019s motion on grounds of untimeliness,* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or that the city objected to the proposal that the judge decide the matter after trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>judge apparently took the motion under advisement, and then ruled on its merits immediately after the verdict was returned. While we have concerns about the late hour at which this issue was inserted into the case, the judge did not abuse his discretion in agreeing to entertain the request, particularly where the city voiced no procedural objection at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The city next argues that, when Liberty did file a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 59 (e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), it waived its claim to any interest rate higher than the statutory rate because it asked that the judgment be amended to reflect the \u201ccorrect interest rate\u201d of 5.88 per cent pursuant to the statute. We do not think that that motion operated to waive the issue. Liberty had already requested, by written motion, that the judge set interest at the rate that a \u201cprudent investor\u201d would have earned, rather than at the statutory rate. That motion had effectively been denied with the judge\u2019s determination that the statutory rate should be utilized. When the interest calculation in the subsequent judgment mistakenly utilized a figure even lower than the statutory rate, Liberty could ask that that technical mistake be corrected without thereby waiving its right to claim that the judge\u2019s earlier substantive decision on the issue was erroneous. When a party\u2019s rights on a prior ruling have already been preserved, that party is not required to raise the same issue again in a rule 59 (e) motion. Where, as here, there is another, independent ground for a rule 59 (e) motion, that motion can assert that other ground without waiving prior issues that have already been raised and decided.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We do agree with the city that Liberty\u2019s later \u201camended\u201d motion for determination of the interest rate, and Liberty\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>companion motion for \u201creconsideration,\u201d were untimely.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They were not filed until some seven weeks after the original motion had been acted on, and six weeks after judgment had been entered. The judge was not required to entertain Liberty\u2019s belated efforts to improve on its original motion. The \u201camended\u201d motion did not identify any reason why its new figures, and its expanded factual basis, could not have been presented as part of the original motion. There is no error in the denial of a motion that merely seeks, as this one did, a \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d Thus, we consider only whether the judge, in denying the original motion as filed, committed error. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">b. <em>Challenge to the statutory interest rate. </em>Under State and Federal constitutional principles, an owner whose property is taken by eminent domain is entitled to \u201cjust\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d compensation, under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cjust compensation\u201d) and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201creasonable compensation\u201d). Where, as here, there is delay between the time of the taking and the time the owner receives compensation, an award of interest to compensate the owner for that delay is itself part of the \u201cjust compensation\u201d to which the owner is entitled. See <em>Seaboard Air Line Ry. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>261 U.S. 299, 306 (1923); <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 633, 636-637 (1985); <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 229, 231-233 (1967). Because it is a component of the compensation mandated as a matter of constitutional law, the ultimate determination as to what interest rate will provide adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>compensation for delay in payment is a judicial function. <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 638, citing <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>620 F.2d 812, 837 (Ct. Cl. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">However, the Legislature may address the issue of the interest to be paid on damage awards in land taking cases, and any interest rate set by statute enjoys a rebuttable presumption that it is a reasonable rate that would satisfy constitutional requirements. See <em>Tucson Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Freilich, </em>136 Ariz. 280, 284 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jim Lupient Oldsmobile Co., </em>509 N.W.2d 361, 364 (Minn. 1993); <em>Adventurers Whitestone Corp. </em>v. <em>City of N.Y., </em>65 N.Y.2d 83, 87-88, appeal dismissed, 474 U.S. 935 (1985). A claimant seeking compensation above the statutory interest rate may overcome that presumption by showing that the statutory rate is so low that it fails to meet the constitutional standard of reasonableness. See <em>Tucson Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Freilich, </em>supra; <em>Adventurers Whitestone Corp. </em>v. <em>City of N.Y., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><em>A </em>claimant does not meet that burden merely by demonstrating some alternate measurements for an interest rate that might also qualify as \u201creasonable.\u201d See <em>Tucson Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Freilich, supra </em>at 283 (finding that twelve per cent was \u201creasonable rate\u201d did not mean statutory rate of ten per cent was \u201cunreasonable\u201d); <em>Matter of the City of N.Y., </em>58 N.Y.2d 532, 537-538 (1983), and cases cited (\u201cslight variations\u201d between statutory rate and prevailing rates do not make statutory rate so \u201cunreasonably low\u201d as to be unconstitutional). The concept of a \u201creasonable\u201d interest rate to compensate for delay in payment connotes a range of figures, not one precise figure. See <em>Tuscon Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Freilich, supra. </em>Thus, as the first step to proving entitlement to a rate other than the statutory rate, a claimant must demonstrate that the statutory rate is significantly or substantially lower than what would meet the constitutional minimum. See <em>id. </em>at 284 (statutory rate constitutional unless market rates \u201cfar in excess\u201d); <em>Redevelopment Agency of Burbank </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>38 Cal. 3d 790, 806 n.19 (1985) (statutory rate provides just compensation if not \u201csubstantially below\u201d what prudent investor would have earned); <em>Matter of S. Bronx Neighborhood Dev. Plan, </em>110 Misc. 2d 571, 572-573 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1981), aff\u2019d, 58 N.Y.2d 532 (1983) (statutory rate unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tutional when all interest rates during relevant period \u201cconsistently and substantially greater\u201d). If that showing is made, the statutory rate is no longer applicable, and it is then up to the judge to determine what interest figure to apply. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>50.50 Acres of Land, </em>931 F.2d 1349, 1355 (9th Cir. 1991), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship, </em>543 F.2d 1272, 1274 (9th Cir. 1976). In that second step, selection of an appropriate figure is customarily based on the \u201cprudent investor\u201d standard, a standard that awards the claimant an interest rate comparable to what would have been earned by a \u201cprudent investor\u201d over the same period of time. <em>Id. </em>at 1355-1356. While the same evidence will ordinarily be submitted to prove both the alleged unreasonableness of the statutory rate and what a \u201cprudent investor\u201d would have earned (i.e., evidence of rates of return on reasonably safe investments over the same time period), the inquiry itself remains a two-step process that asks two separate questions: (1) Is the discrepancy between the statutory rate and the rates earned by prudent investors sufficiently large to render the statutory rate unreasonable? (2) If (and only if) so, what rate will represent just and reasonable compensation for the delay in payment? See <em>United States </em>v. <em>50.50 Acres of Land, supra </em>at 1356 (remanded for further findings when judge imposed rate higher than statutory rate without first determining that statutory rate was unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We therefore look at Liberty\u2019s motion, as originally filed, to assess whether Liberty made that initial, threshold showing of unreasonableness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Liberty\u2019s motion asserted that a prudent investor would have earned 6.5 per cent per year to 7.5 per cent per year during the relevant time period. In other words, on Liberty\u2019s own calculation, a rate as low as 6.5 per cent would satisfy constitutional requirements. The rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, would set a rate of 5.88 per cent for this particular taking, or only 0.62 percentage points below what Liberty concedes would be constitutionally adequate. Liberty cites no precedent suggesting that a discrepancy that small suffices to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that the statutory rate is substantially or significantly below constitutional requirements. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>319.46 Acres of Land, </em>508 F. Supp. 288, 290 (W.D. Okla. 1981) (average rate of \u201ccomposite\u201d securities 2.5 percentage points above statutory rate); <em>Redevelopment Agency of Burbank </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra </em>at <em>195 Sc </em>n.4 (all rate measures at least three percentage points higher than statutory rate); <em>Matter of the City of N.Y., supra </em>at 538 (six per cent rate unconstitutional when average rates on \u201cstable investments\u201d and public securities ranged between 8.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Moreover, while Liberty\u2019s motion did not set forth how it weighed the investment figures presented to reach its ostensible pmdent investor range of 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, it is apparent from the face of the motion that Liberty\u2019s calculation included higher rates from a time period that was totally irrelevant. Specifically, in each of the investment categories listed, Liberty included rates prevailing in 1994, and in every one of those categories, the rates in 1994 were higher than in any of the subsequent years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the taking in this case did not occur until June, 1995 \u2014 prevailing rates in 1994 have no bearing on what Liberty might have earned had it been paid and then prudently invested the proceeds in June, 1995. Presumably, if those higher 1994 figures are removed from the calculation (as they must be due to their irrelevance), the over-all range itself would be at least somewhat lower.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, on a purely numerical basis, the judge would have been warranted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>concluding that Liberty had failed to establish that the 5.88 per cent rate set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, was so far below a reasonable rate as to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The judge\u2019s assessment of the reasonableness of the statutory rate could also consider the method by which that rate was set. Much of the jurisprudence concerning the inadequacy of statutory rates concerns statutes that set a single, flat rate to be applied to every taking, without regard to any rate being set by the marketplace. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship, supra </em>at 1276; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>620 F.2d 812, 837-840 (Ct. Cl. 1980); <em>Redevelopment Agency of Burbank </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra </em>at 795; <em>Matter of the City of N.Y., supra </em>at 538. By their nature, such fixed rates have a degree of arbitrariness, reflecting a Legislature\u2019s attempt to set its own price for the taking of property without regard to the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">More recently, however, statutes setting interest rates for eminent domain cases have shifted (as has G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37) to specification of a formula or methodology that is itself tied to some market rate. See, e.g., 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 258e-l (2000) (recodified at 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3116); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 117.195 (1997); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 549.09 (2000). Such fluctuating statutory rates respond to the marketplace and are thus driven by forces that are outside the control of the Legislature (or the taking authority). While an owner remains free to challenge such a rate (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>50.50 Acres of Land, supra </em>at 1355-1356), courts have been inclined to show greater deference to statutory rates that rise and fall in accordance with market forces on the theory that it is \u201creasonable\u201d to use a market-driven measure as a fair means of determining just compensation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Certain Land Situated in Detroit, </em>286 F. Supp. 2d 865, 871 (E.D. Mich. 2003); <em>Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>59 Fed. Cl. 246, 266 (2003). See also <em>Redevelopment Agency of Burbank </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra </em>at 807 n.21 (court would show deference to legislative adoption of \u201cprevailing-rate formula\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>long as \u201cgeneral requirements of \u2018just compensation\u2019 \u201d satisfied).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">For these purposes, a legislative selection of an extremely safe form of investment as the yardstick for the interest rate in eminent domain cases is a reasonable choice of measure \u2014 judgments in eminent domain cases, after all, are virtually certain of being paid, and the rate of return on a conservative investment with a comparable degree of safety fairly compensates the owner for the delay in payment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jim Lupient Oldsmobile Co., </em>509 N.W.2d 361, 364 (Minn. 1993) (comparing statutory rate to rate on investments that \u201cguarantees safety of principal\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship, supra </em>at 1276; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Certain Land Situated in Detroit, supra; Matter of S. Bronx Neighborhood Dev. Plan, </em>110 Misc. 2d 571, 573 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1981) (medium term public securities provide basis for calculating proper rate). But see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 839; <em>United States </em>v. <em>429.59 Acres of Land, </em>612 F.2d 459, 464-465 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Redevelopment Agency of Burbank </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra </em>at 804-805. Put differently, the constitutional standard of \u201cjust compensation\u201d does not require that someone who is guaranteed a return of principal (which is effectively the position of a landowner awaiting payment for a governmental taking) nevertheless be allowed to recoup a rate of return that could only be achieved by placing that principal at greater risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Since 1993, G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, has employed a fluctuating market rate to determine the interest payable on eminent domain damages awards. See St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 137. The statute employs an interest rate based on the auction price of one-year Treasury bills, a very conservative investment vehicle that appropriately reflects the essentially nonexistent risk that the landowner faces with respect to ultimate payment of the principal owed. See <em>Pettro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>47 Fed. Cl. 136, 155 (2000) (one-year Treasury bills represent reasonable rate for eminent domain cases because they \u201caccount for inflation while avoiding a reward for risks which the plaintiff did not undertake\u201d). Liberty has not identified anything unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>about utilizing that particular market-driven measure. All it has done is to point to other market-driven measures and demonstrate that they yield rates slightly higher.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The fact that various conservative investments do not yield precisely identical rates does not make it \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the Legislature to have chosen the particular conservative investment of the one-year Treasury bill as the measuring rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We recognize that the rate set by \u00a7 37 could, despite the fact that it is set by a market measure, result in a rate that would be unreasonable in a particular case. Specifically, \u00a7 37 sets the rate as of the date of taking (by reference to the last auction prior to the taking), and that rate then remains fixed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Obviously, if rates rose significantly between the date of taking and the date of payment, the rate prevailing at the very beginning of the period would be an artificially low measure of the over-all rate during that entire period. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>620 F.2d 812, 838 (Ct. Cl. 1980). However, that did not happen in this case. To the contrary, just as other market rates fell in the years subsequent to this particular taking, the rate for one-year Treasury bills also fell. In fact, the May 25, 1995, auction that set the rate for this case at 5.88 per cent was one of the highest for that particular security over the years in question. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Cf. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Worcester Redevelopment Auth., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 457 n.4 (2001) (during four years following taking, rates for one-year Treasury bills averaged almost two percentage points higher than rate as of date of taking). Thus, as applied to this case, the market-driven interest measure specified in \u00a7 37 did not have the effect of setting an unreasonable interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We thus conclude that there was no error in denying Liberty\u2019s request for an alternative computation of interest, as Liberty did not meet its burden of demonstrating that the statutory rate of 5.88 per cent was so unreasonably low as to deprive it of just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>compensation for the delay in payment of its damages. Where Liberty failed to make that threshold showing, the judge was not required to assess what other market rates might also have been reasonable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">However, we note with some urgency that other developments now render G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, obsolete, as the interest rate defined in that section is premised on the issuance of a form of United States Treasury security that no longer exists. The statute sets the interest rate at the \u201cannual rate equal to the coupon issue yield equivalent, as determined by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of 52-week United States Treasury bills settled immediately before the date of taking.\u201d G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37. However, the fifty-two week United States Treasury bill was discontinued in 2001, with the final auction of that security occurring on February 27, 2001.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A literal reading of \u00a7 37 would thus provide that the rate of interest for a taking occurring today would be based on a rate defined by a sale of Treasury securities that occurred over three years ago \u2014 that February 27, 2001, auction would technically qualify (and will indefinitely continue to qualify) as the \u201clast auction of 52-week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>United States Treasury bills settled immediately before the date of taking.\u201d See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">It was the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent in \u00a7 37 that the interest rate for eminent domain takings be set by reference to a specific market rate that prevailed immediately prior to the date of taking. Now, however, the statute has the effect of setting a permanently fixed rate that does not, even as of the date of taking, reflect market reality by any measure. It has been suggested that the problem of allegedly confiscatory interest rates can be better dealt with by a legislative solution (i.e., the adoption of a market-driven method for calculating interest that would, at least in most cases, satisfy the constitutional requirement of just and reasonable compensation) than by judicial determination on a case-by-case basis, an approach that leads to uncertainty and inconsistency. See <em>Pettro </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 47 Fed. Cl. 136, 154 (2000) (favoring \u201cuniform interest rates in order to avoid discrimination among litigants\u201d); <em>Tucson Airport Auth. </em>v. <em>Freilich, </em>136 Ariz. 280, 283 (1983). However, if the statute does not utilize a reasonable method for determining an interest rate, constitutional requirements will necessitate judicial determination, and the resulting uncertainty and inconsistency will be unavoidable. Although G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, operated to set a rate that met constitutional requirements for this particular taking back in 1995, the statute is now outdated, no longer serves the purpose the Legislature originally intended, and may fail to satisfy constitutional requirements in future. We thus commend this issue to the Legislature\u2019s immediate attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The motion also asked that the judgment be amended to reflect the addition of costs in the amount of $9,564.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">In the course of pretrial discovery motions, the city had raised objections to the delay and had asked that, as a result of that delay, no interest be awarded as part of any judgment ultimately rendered in favor of Liberty.

Liberty\u2019s claim that the city violated its civil rights, that G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, violates equal protection guarantees, and that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees were not raised below, and therefore cannot be raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\">The city\u2019s brief on appeal, submitted prior to the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 669 (2003), suggested the precise opposite, namely, that Liberty\u2019s motion regarding interest was premature because the issue could only be raised by way of a motion to amend the judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 59 (e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974). See <em>Shawmut Community Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Zagami, </em>419 Mass. 220, 223 (1994); J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.15, at 454 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2004). In <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., ante </em>596, 603 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>n.7 (2004), we noted that a rule 59 (e) motion has been suggested as an appropriate method by which to challenge the statutory rate of interest, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>329.73 Acres of Land, </em>695 F.2d 922, 925 (5th Cir. 1983), but there is no basis for suggesting that a rule 59 (e) motion would be the only appropriate method.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\">The mere fact that Liberty\u2019s motion used the term \u201ccorrect interest rate\u201d when referring to the statutory rate of 5.88 per cent does not change this analysis. In context, the motion was simply (and accurately) noting that the 5.66 per cent rate used by the clerk was based on an error in an unofficial source, with 5.88 per cent being the \u201ccorrect\u201d rate under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We also agree with the city that Liberty\u2019s request for compound interest was untimely. That request was not made in Liberty\u2019s original motion, in its rule 59 (e) motion, or in its \u201camended\u201d motion, and was raised for the first time at a hearing more than two months after trial. We therefore do not address the question whether the constitutional requirement of just and reasonable compensation mandates the compounding of interest in eminent domain cases. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>429.59 Acres of Land, 612 </em>F.2d 459, 465 (9th Cir. 1980) (upholding award of compound interest), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>319.46 Acres of Land, </em>508 F. Supp. 288, 290-291 (W.D. Okla. 1981) (awarding compound interest), with <em>Washington Metro. Transit Auth. </em>v. <em>One Parcel of Land, </em>706 F.2d 1312, 1322 n.22 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 893 (1983) (declining to award compound interest), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>97.19 Acres, </em>511 F. Supp. 565, 569-570 (D. Md. 1981) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">While Liberty\u2019s motion ostensibly asked leave to submit evidence on the issue after trial, the motion as filed referenced the sources and figures it intended to present and verify (if need be). We thus take those figures as given and assume their accuracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">For example, Liberty\u2019s motion referenced that Moody\u2019s AAA bonds had averaged a return of 7.96 per cent in 1994, but had fallen to 6.53 per cent in 1998. Thirty-year Treasury bonds, also referenced in Liberty\u2019s motion, were at 7.37 per cent in 1994, but had fallen to 5.69 per cent (a rate slightly below the statutory rate) in 1998. Five-year Treasury notes (which covered a time period \u201cclosest in duration to the delay in payment in this case\u201d) averaged 6.69 per cent in 1994, but had fallen to 5.15 per cent (a figure well below the statutory rate) by 1998. For reasons that are unclear, Liberty\u2019s motion, although filed in June, 2002, also failed to include any reference to prevailing rates for any time period later than 1998 or the first quarter of 1999. In its later amended motion, some of those figures were updated, and those updates confirmed that rates had continued at lower levels than the 1994 fates utilized in Liberty\u2019s original calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">It also appears that Liberty\u2019s calculation paid no heed to the rates for fifty-two week Treasury bills, the measuring rate for the statute itself and a security that ought to be considered. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>50.50 Acres of Land, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>931 F.2d 1349, 1356 (9th Cir. 1991). Those rates were lower than some of the other investments identified in Liberty\u2019s motion, and they fell even lower in the years subsequent to the taking. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (2000). Inclusion of those lower rates in the over-all assessment presumably would have reduced the proposed \u201creasonable\u201d range of rates even further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Indeed, Liberty has cited no example of a market-driven statutory rate being found inadequate to provide just compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In its \u201camended\u201d motion, Liberty pointed to some rates of return that were considerably higher, but the investments referenced went far beyond the low-risk investments that are properly used for these purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">By comparison, when payment for a Federal taking is delayed by more than one year, the Federal statute now computes the interest rate separately for each year according to that year\u2019s market formula. 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3116. The Federal statute also compounds the interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Our affirmance of the judge\u2019s order on the issue of prejudgment interest also resolves Liberty\u2019s claim for one more month of postjudgment interest. The check tendered by the city in August, 2002, was in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment and all accrued postjudgment interest \u2014 in fact, due to a slight arithmetic error, it was slightly more than the amount owed \u2014 and the city therefore cannot be held liable for any additional postjudgment interest. We understand that Liberty initially balked at the provision that that check was \u201cin full satisfaction\u201d of the judgment, but when that check has turned out to be sufficient to satisfy the entire judgment, we see no basis on which the city could be required to pay an additional month\u2019s worth of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The interest rate on Federal takings, and on money judgments in civil cases in Federal court, was also tied to the auction price of fifty-two week United States Treasury bills.

In anticipation of the United States Treasury Department\u2019s decision to cease issuing fifty-two week Treasury bills, Congress amended various statutory provisions that had calculated interest based on that security, substituting instead \u201cthe weekly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\u201d See Pub.
