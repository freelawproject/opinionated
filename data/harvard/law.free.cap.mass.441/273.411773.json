Among those charges are six indictments charging incest in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17 (incest statute).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved to dismiss the incest charges, arguing that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>because he was neither the natural nor adoptive father of his stepdaughter, and had no \u201cblood-kin\u201d relationship with her, the necessary element of consanguinity under the incest statute was absent. A Superior Court judge, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979), reported the following question to the Appeals Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cAre G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, and G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 422 (2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The proceedings were stayed. We allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that \u201cconsanguinity\u201d is a necessary element of the crime of incest, and that the incest statute makes criminal only relationships between persons related by blood or adoption,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> not other relationships prohibited by the marriage statute, G.

Some of the prohibited relationships are relationships by blood,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while others are relationships by marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The meaning of the term \u201cconsanguinity\u201d is uncontroverted: it is defined as a \u201crelationship by blood.\u201d 2 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 242 (15th ed. 1994). See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 753 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201ccondition of being of the same blood; relationship by descent from a common ancestor; blood-relationship [Opposed to <em>affinity, </em>i.e., relationship by marriage]\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 299 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201crelationship of persons of the same blood or origin\u201d). The meaning of \u201cconsanguinity\u201d is distinguished from \u201caffinity:\u201d consanguinity is a blood relationship, while affinity is a non- , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>blood relationship acquired through marriage. See 3 Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">There can be no doubt that the Legislature is and has been fully acquainted with the difference between relationships defined by consanguinity and those defined by affinity. The term \u201cconsanguinity\u201d appears throughout the General Laws. In almost every context, the Legislature uses \u201cconsanguinity\u201d in conjunction with \u201caffinity,\u201d making it readily apparent that the Legislature views the terms as distinct and mutually exclusive. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4 (providing defense to prosecution for accessory after fact for defendant who is \u201cby consanguinity, affinity or adoption, the parent or grandparent, child or grandchild, brother or sister of the offender\u201d); G. L. c. 19D, \u00a7 1 (defining assisted living residence as location that, among other things, provides assistance to \u201cthree or more adult residents who are not related by consanguinity or affinity to their care provider\u201d); G. L. c. 40D, \u00a7 1 (w) (defining \u201c[cjontinuing [cjare [fjacility,\u201d for purpose of urban development, as \u201cfacility at which there is furnished to individuals, other than an individual related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing such care [enumerated services]\u201d); G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 18 <em>(h) </em>(15) (ii) (permitting candidate for public office to dispose of residual , campaign funds by donation to charitable organization or scholarship fund, provided that neither candidate nor any official of candidate\u2019s political committee \u201cbe related by consanguinity or affinity to any trustee, officer, principal or beneficiary of said entity\u201d); G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 76 <em>(a) </em>(defining \u201c[cjontinuing care\u201d for purpose of determining whether entity is nursing home as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cfurnishing to an individual, other than an individual related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing such care, of [enumerated services]\u201d); G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 5 (g) (3) (permitting exception to rule that high-level public officials must disclose names of their creditors \u201cif the creditor is a relative of the reporting person within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In other contexts, the Legislature uses \u201cconsanguinity\u201d without \u201caffinity,\u201d but nonetheless includes language that specifically refers to relationships by marriage <em>separately. </em>See, e.g., G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 43 (requiring executive and legislative agents to submit statements of expenditures, \u201cexcept that the executive or legislative agent shall not be required to report such expenditures . . . made for or on behalf of ... a relative within the third degree of consanguinity of the executive or legislative agent or of his spouse or the spouse of any such relative ... an executive or legislative agent shall not be prohibited from offering or giving to a public official or public employee who is a member of his immediate family or a relative within the third degree of consanguinity or of such agent\u2019s spouse or the spouse of any such relative any such gift or meal, beverage or other item to be consumed\u201d); G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 1 <em>(g) </em>(excluding from definition of \u201cgift\u201d in context of financial disclosures by public employees gifts received from \u201crelative within the third degree of consanguinity of the reporting person or of the reporting person\u2019s spouse or from the spouse of any such relative\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In sum, in every other statute, the Legislature supplements its use of \u201cconsanguinity\u201d with other language encompassing relationships by marriage, and plainly understands \u201cconsanguinity\u201d as relationship by blood alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">By its plain language, therefore, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, selects for criminal punishment those relationships listed in the marriage statute, that are relationships of consanguinity (blood), leaving out by its silence relationships of affinity (marriage). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>is the limiting language of \u00a717 itself \u2014 \u201cwithin degrees of consanguinity\u201d \u2014 that defines and limits the set of G. L. c. 207 relationships to which \u00a7 17 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">To interpret \u00a7 17 to include both relationships by consanguinity and by affinity would give no meaning to the phrase \u201cwithin degrees of consanguinity.\u201d See <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946) (\u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous . . .\u201d). Had the Legislature intended \u00a7 17 to criminalize marriage or sexual conduct within <em>all </em>of the relationships listed in \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, it could easily have avoided the term \u201cconsanguinity\u201d (i.e., \u201c[p]ersons between whom marriages would be declared by law to be incestuous and void . . .\u201d), or it could have used the phrase \u201cconsanguinity or affinity\u201d that it has employed in other contexts. The Legislature\u2019s choice to include only \u201cconsanguinity\u201d cannot be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">While a court must normally follow the plain language of a statute, it need not adhere strictly to the statutory words if to do so would lead to an absurd result or contravene the clear intent of the Legislature. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). Far from creating an \u201cabsurd\u201d result, interpreting the Massachusetts incest statute in accord with the plain meaning of its words would place Massachusetts in the mainstream of the law nationally, and there is no basis from which to conclude that this would contravene the clear intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Of the forty-nine States other than Massachusetts, twenty do not punish any form of affinai incest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, seven states punish affinai incest only if the victim is a child or if the sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>contact was nonconsensual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Massachusetts is therefore not alone in providing no criminal punishment for consensual adult sexual contact within affinai relationships.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the Massachusetts statute would by no means be anomalous in barring more classes of relationships from civil marriage than it punishes under its criminal incest statute. It is common for other jurisdictions to have criminal incest provisions that are less restrictive than their counterpart civil marriage restrictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In addition, the criminalization of affinity relationships as incestuous is explicitly rejected by the Model Penal Code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Code criminalizes marriage, cohabitation, or sexual intercourse with \u201can ancestor or descendant, a brother or sister of the whole or half blood [or an uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of the whole blood],\u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 230.2 (1980),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and it adds, \u201cThe relationships referred to herein include blood relationships without regard to legitimacy, and relationship of parent and child by adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commentaries to the Model Penal Code make clear that the drafters carefully considered and rejected affinity-based incest (with the exception of the adoptive parent-child relationship):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201c[T]he relationship between stepparent and stepchild may achieve a decidedly different character. Particularly when the natural parent remarries after the child has reached maturity, the stepparent may not be a parent in any real sense. In such cases, there may develop a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>relationship that is neither illicit nor exploitative, as, for example, where a grown man marries his stepmother, who may be his own age, after his father\u2019s death. . . . Because there are situations where persons related by affinity should be permitted to marry, it therefore follows that they should not be included within the incest prohibition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 230.2 comment 3(b), at 413-415.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Massachusetts Legislature could well have considered the same policy concerns as the drafters of the Model Penal Code did decades later and reached an identical conclusion, which is reflected in a plain reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">2. <em>Legislative history. </em>\u201cWhen the use of the ordinary meaning of a term yields a workable result, there is no need to resort to extrinsic aids such as legislative history.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). Accord <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 345-346 (1995); <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984). Nonetheless, even assuming that there is room within the word \u201cconsanguinity\u201d for an interpretation including relationships by affinity, the history of amendments to the incest prohibition suggests that the Legislature understood \u201cconsanguinity\u201d as relationship by blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The Province Laws of 1695-1696 was the first codification of the incest prohibition in Colonial Massachusetts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, St. 1695-1696, c. 2, \u00a7 1, enumerated a list of degrees, including both relationships by blood and relationship by marriage, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>which marriage was prohibited,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u00a7 2 provided for punishment for men or women who marry or \u201ccarnally know each other, being within any of the degrees before recited in this act.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Unambiguously, \u00a7 2 reached <em>all </em>of the relationships listed in \u00a7 1, those of both consanguinity and affinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Shortly after independence, the General Court enacted \u201cAn Act for regulating marriage and divorce,\u201d St. 1785, c. 69. That act similarly set out a list of relationships (some by blood, others by marriage) for which marriage was prohibited, St. 1785, c. 69, \u00a7 1, and required that persons engaged in prohibited marriages must divorce. Once \u201cdivorced for the cause either of affinity or consanguinity,\u201d they were subject to criminal penalties if they lived together. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6. This act marks the first appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>anee of the term \u201cconsanguinity\u201d in the incest statute, and, by pairing its use with \u201caffinity,\u201d the General Court clearly recognized that there was a difference between them and understood that the list of prohibited relationships contained both types.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">It was the next change to the incest statute that created what is essentially the modem criminal prohibition. The Revised Statutes of 1836 included a list of prohibited marriages in the chapter on marriage,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, in R.S. (1836), c. 130, \u00a7 13, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cAll persons, being within the degrees of consanguinity, within which marriages are prohibited, or declared by law to be incestuous and void, who shall intermarry with each other, or who shall commit adultery or fornication with each other, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than twenty years, or in the county jail, not more than three years.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This section has undergone no relevant subsequent modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Why the Legislature inserted \u201cconsanguinity\u201d and chose not to add \u201caffinity\u201d to R.S. (1836), c. 130, \u00a7 13, is not specifically documented in its legislative history. Nonetheless, by consulting \u201csources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors,\u201d including dictionary definitions from that time, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977), we can be reasonably certain that it was not because of a misunderstanding about the distinctly different relationships they encompassed. Noah Webster\u2019s 1828 dictionary defines \u201cconsanguinity\u201d in sharp contrast with affinity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cThe relation of persons by blood; the relation or connection of person descended from the same stock or common ancestor, in distinction from affinity or relation by marriage. It is lineal or collateral.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">1 An American Dictionary of the English Language 46 (1st ed. 1828). Thus the only existing history concerning the insertion of \u201cconsanguinity\u201d into the criminal prohibition on incest also supports hmiting the prohibited relationships to relationships by blood.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">3. <em>Our dictum in </em>Commonwealth v. Smith. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417 (2000), we stated that the prohibitions of \u00a7 17 extend to \u201ccertain affinai kin as well as stepparents.\u201d This statement is clearly dictum, and we give it little weight. We have long held that we are not bound by \u201clanguage which was unnecessary\u201d in an earlier decision \u201cand which passed upon an issue not really presented.\u201d <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>346 Mass. 667, 676 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Chief Justice John Marshall explained the primary reason for the dicta-holding distinction in 1821:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201cThe question actually before the Court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\"><em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399-400 (1821). When a court decides an issue that has not been argued by any party, it makes its decision without the benefit of the vigorous advocacy on which the adversary process relies. See <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 84 (1988), quoting Kaufman, Does the Judge Have a Right to Qualified Counsel?, 61 A.B.A. J. 569, 569 (1975) (\u201cThe paramount importance of vigorous representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>follows from the nature of our adversarial system of justice. This system is premised on the well-tested principle that truth \u2014 as well as fairness \u2014 is \u2018best discovered by powerful statements on both sides of the question\u2019 \u201d). The question whether \u00a7 17 extended to affinai relationships was not briefed or argued by either party in the <em>Smith </em>case; and neither party had an interest in the outcome of that question, because the defendant was accused of incest based on conduct with his biological daughter, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 417. Because the <em>Smith </em>court did not have the benefit of <em>any </em>advocacy concerning whether \u00a7 17 reached affinai relationships, its dictum on the subject was almost certainly incompletely investigated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant was charged with having sexual conduct, but not penile-vaginal sexual intercourse, with his daughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 418. The defendant argued that he could not be prosecuted under \u00a7 17 because, at the time, it criminalized only \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d not other sexual activities. <em>Id. </em>This argument was based in part on his contention that the incest prohibition was designed to prevent genetic abnormalities, and the prohibition did not therefore extend to types of sexual contact that could not lead to pregnancy. <em>Id. </em>at 421. In rejecting this argument, we stated, without analysis or explanation, that the prohibitions in \u00a7 17 extended to \u201caffinai\u201d relationships, thus indicating that the purpose of the incest prohibition is broader than simply eugenics. <em>Id. </em>at 421-422. Ultimately, however, we concluded that no matter what the purpose of the statute, its language did not extend to prohibit sexual activities other than penile-vaginal intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 425. Plainly, the determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>language of \u00a7 17 did not extend beyond penile-vaginal intercourse rendered the statement in <em>Smith </em>\u201clanguage which was unnecessary\u201d to the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In addition, <em>Smith </em>did not even address other language (also dicta) in previous decisions of this court and the Appeals Court suggesting that consanguinity \u2014 meaning a blood relationship \u2014 is a necessary element of incest. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533 (1978), a case, like this one, involving allegations that the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter, we noted that the \u201ccharge of incest was the subject of a nolle prosequi because the necessary element of consanguinity was absent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 298-299 n.2 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>247 Mass. 16, 20 (1923) (noting \u201cthat courts in which the question has arisen generally construe statutes defining incest to require a blood relationship [and] it has been held that an \u2018essential element\u2019 of incest is \u2018consanguinity.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>This is no doubt a difficult case in the sense that construing the statute in accord with the plain meaning of its words will result in the dismissal of six indictments alleging that the defendant committed incest by having sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter when she was fifteen and sixteen years old.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But the underlying conduct alleged is violative of a number of other criminal statutes under which the defendant is also charged. While the idea that this form of \u201cincest\u201d may not be criminal may be repugnant to many,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cthe words of [a] statute cannot be stretched beyond their fair meaning in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>relieve against what may appear to be a hard case.\u201d <em>Grove Hall Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>284 Mass. 92, 96 (1933). The interpretation that the Commonwealth urges on us sweeps up and criminalizes not only the repugnant conduct alleged in this case, but a wide assortment of relationships between consenting adults.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The reported question is answered as explicated above. We leave it to the Legislature to expand the incest prohibition if it so chooses.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-13\">The defendant was also indicted on charges of posing or exhibiting a child in a state of sexual conduct, charges of wiretapping, and charges of rape and abuse of a child under the age of sixteen years. None of these charges is before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">That \u201cconsanguinity\u201d is a necessary element of the crime of incest is not inconsistent with the prosecution of incest between a parent and an adopted child. Although the issue is not presented in this case, we note that statutory language in the adoption statute, G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 6, specifically demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent that adoptive children be treated as consanguineous for the purpose of the criminal incest prohibition.

The court reasons that the term \u201cconsanguinity,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17 (incest statute), cannot be read together with G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (marriage prohibition statutes), with the startling result that the defendant cannot be prosecuted for having sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter. Despite the self-definition in the incest statute by means of express reference to, and incorporation of, the marriage prohibition statutes, the court strives to examine a plethora of sources to support its conclusion. The court\u2019s analysis is faulty, both in law and policy, for the reasons now described that persuade me that the defendant\u2019s sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter can be prosecuted as incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">1. It is self-evident, as mentioned above, that the incest statute creates the definition of the crime within its own terms by expressly referring to, and incorporating, the marriage prohibition statutes. This alone should end the inquiry. But any doubt on the matter is settled by the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">(a) In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417 (2000), we concluded that the words \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute were limited to penile-vaginal penetration but did not cover unnatural sexual intercourse. In construing the statute, we stated that \u201c \u2018[pjersons within the degrees of consanguinity\u2019 to whom the [incest] statute\u2019s prohibitions of intermarriage and sexual intercourse apply are not limited to blood relations, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>include also certain affinai kin as well as stepparents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. We carefully explained why this is, and should be, so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cThe Legislature\u2019s purpose in criminalizing incestuous conduct must thus extend beyond the prevention of genetic defects, as this goal would clearly not be advanced by criminalizing marriage itself, without more, between blood relations, and still less by prohibiting coitus between affinal kin who do not share a common bloodline. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 230.2 comment 2(b), at 403; comment 3(b), at 412-413 (1980). Indeed, the scope of the incest statute, as it relates to both conduct and persons, strongly suggests that its framers valued and sought to promote the sanctity and integrity of familial relationships, as well as to protect children within the family from sexual impositions by their elders. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 230.2, comment 2(c)-(e), at 405-407, and authorities cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fouse, </em>417 Pa. Super. 534, 538 (1992).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Two years after the <em>Smith </em>decision, the Legislature rewrote the incest statute to broaden the sexual conduct prohibited to include unnatural sexual intercourse. See St. 2002, c. 13. The amendment was in direct response to the <em>Smith </em>decision. No change was made in the definition of incest contained in the statute. It is obvious from this that the Legislature accepted the definition stated in the <em>Smith </em>case, and expressed agreement with the language therein explaining the purpose of the statute. Far from being dicta, the quoted language is a critical part of the court\u2019s analysis and is to be accepted for its substantive content.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">(b)(i) The court refers to the legislative history of the incest statute in an effort to support its conclusion. <em>Ante </em>at 281-284. But, ultimately, the court concedes, as it must, that there is nothing there because the Legislature\u2019s reason for not inserting the word \u201caffinity\u201d in R.S. (1836), c. 130, \u00a7 13, is unknown. <em>Ante </em>at 283-284. It can be said, from the language of that statute, that doing so was unnecessary in light of the statute\u2019s language, applying to \u201cpersons, being within the degrees of consanguinity, within which marriages are prohibited,\u201d and to \u201cpersons\u201d whose marriages otherwise are \u201cdeclared by law to be incestuous and void.\u201d R.S. (1836), c. 130, \u00a7 13. Further, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>completely ignores the historical character of the statute, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashey, </em>248 Mass. 259, 260 (1924), which ultimately enforced \u201cthe Levitical decrees,\u201d that applied the prohibition against incest to relationships of affinity. See 2 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 242 (15th ed. 1994) (explaining that doctrine of affinity grew out of canonical maxim that husband and wife are one); Metteer, Some \u201cIncest\u201d is Harmless Incest: Determining the Fundamental Right to Marry of Adults Related by Affinity Without Resorting to State Incest Statutes, 10 Kan. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 262, 273 (2000) (explaining that incest prohibition under law of Leviticus extended to relationships by affinity).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">(ii) The court also cites to various statutes to argue that the Legislature views the terms \u201cconsanguinity\u201d and \u201caffinity\u201d as distinct. <em>Ante </em>at 276-277. Thus, the court reasons that, by employing the term \u201cconsanguinity\u201d in the incest statute, the Legislature intended to limit the statute\u2019s reach to relationships of consanguinity only. <em>Ante </em>at 277-278. The use of the terms \u201cconsanguinity\u201d and \u201caffinity\u201d in other statutes does not resolve the present issue concerning the interplay of the specific statutes with which we are concerned. If the Legislature had intended to limit the incest statute\u2019s reach only to relationships of consanguinity, it could have done so by leaving out any reference to the marriage prohibition statutes, instead of choosing, as it did, to supplement the incest statute by expressly incorporating the marriage prohibition statutes into that statute\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">(iii) The court\u2019s references to the laws of other States shed no light on the answer to the reported question. The main point, of course, is what our statute actually does, but it is worth noting that Massachusetts is by no means alone in punishing affinai incest because of the crime\u2019s destructive impact on the familial relationship. Twenty-eight States punish affinai sexual intercourse or sexual conduct of some kind.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">(c) The court places great emphasis on the Model Penal Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>which does not make affinai incest criminal. We have not adopted the Model Penal Code, although from time to time, we express agreement with principles expressed therein. That is precisely what was done in the <em>Smith </em>case, where the Code was cited as persuasive in stating that \u201csexual relations between stepparent and stepchild may have the same disorganizing impact on the family unit and the same destructive effect on the growth of the child\u2019s personality as would incest between natural parent and child.\u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 230.2 comment 3(b), at 412-413 (1980). Indeed, as the Code candidly recognizes, \u201c[t]here are valid reasons for prohibiting sexual relationships between stepparent and stepchild.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">2. The court\u2019s authority for its conclusions does not withstand rigorous examination, and it is wrong to use that authority to declare an act of the Legislature futile and meaningless in significant part. In the last analysis, the text of the incest statute, combined with the <em>Smith </em>decision, leaves no room to doubt the statute\u2019s purpose and application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court leaves us with a situation where this defendant will avoid prosecution for incest, and (unless the statute is changed) a stepfather can have consensual sexual intercourse with his sixteen year old stepdaughter without fear of criminal sanction. (But, he will not be able to marry her.) As a result of the court\u2019s decision, we are left with an unfortunate state of affairs that frustrates legislative intent and undermines the value and stability of the family as the core unit of society.
