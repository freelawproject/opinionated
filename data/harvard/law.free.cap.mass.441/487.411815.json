L. c. 208, \u00a7 5, may, nevertheless, satisfy the alternative jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 5, by asserting domicil after a brief period of residence and claiming that the \u201ccause\u201d for the divorce, namely \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB, occurred in Massachusetts. Brian E. Caffyn (husband) appeals from an order of the Probate and Family Court denying his motion to dismiss a complaint for divorce filed by Leslie A. Caffyn (wife) based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>a single justice of the Appeals Court entered an order granting the husband leave to file an interlocutory appeal \u201cas to the issue of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d we transferred the case on our own motion. Because we conclude that a plaintiff domiciled in Massachusetts may satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 5 by making a subjective determination that the marriage became irretrievably broken (pursuant to \u00a7 IB) within the Commonwealth, we affirm the Probate and Family Court\u2019s denial of the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The parties were married in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 30, 1987. After the marriage, the parties resided in Stamford, Connecticut, for approximately one year. Between 1988 and 1990, the husband and the wife lived in Massachusetts for approximately one and one-half years. The parties then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where they resided for approximately six years and where their two children were bom. Thereafter, the family relocated to San Diego, California, where they lived for approximately one and one-half years. In approximately 1996 or 1997, the parties and their children moved to Italy, where they resided as a family through the end of June, 2002, when the wife moved to Massachusetts with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Throughout the marriage, the husband and the wife maintained a joint bank account in Massachusetts. The parties also retained pediatricians for their children and came to Massachusetts twice a year for the children to be seen by \u201ctheir\u201d doctors. The wife alleges (and the husband does not dispute) that each year, the family spent Christmas holidays and a portion of summer vacations in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Before leaving Italy, the wife arranged for the family\u2019s personal belongings to be shipped to Massachusetts, discharged hired help, canceled the children\u2019s tutors and therapist, and caused the children\u2019s educational records to be sent to Massachusetts. After moving to Massachusetts in June of 2002, the wife opened a bank account in her own name. In late August of 2002, the wife and the husband purchased a residence in Wellesley, with title taken jointly in both their names. They jointly investigated private schools in Massachusetts for the children. The husband purchased, and the wife registered, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>vehicle in Massachusetts for the use of the wife and the children. The husband also visited the children in Norwood, where they resided temporarily with their mother and grandparents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\n<em>Procedural background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The wife filed a complaint for divorce in the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court on June 28, 2002. Due to procedural flaws, however, that complaint was dismissed. The wife filed a second, essentially identical, complaint on October 15, 2002, in which she sought, inter alia, a dissolution of the marriage pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and alleged that \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d occurred on or about June 26, 2002, within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The husband\u2019s counsel filed a special appearance and a motion, pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 12 (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to dismiss the wife\u2019s complaint for divorce due to lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The husband also submitted an affidavit disputing the validity of service of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>process, which was countered by the process server\u2019s affidavit. The wife filed an opposition to the motion. A judge in the Probate and Family Court issued a memorandum of decision and order denying the husband\u2019s motion. The husband filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., requesting leave to take an interlocutory appeal from the denial. A single justice of the Appeals Court entered an order granting the husband leave to file an interlocutory appeal \u201cas to the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The focus of appellate review of an interlocutory matter is \u201cwhether the trial court abused its discretion \u2014 that is, whether the court applied proper legal standards and whether the record discloses reasonable support for its evaluation of factual questions.\u201d <em>Edwin R. Sage Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 25 (1981). The judge\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">2. <em>Subject matter jurisdiction under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 5. </em>This case presents us with the question of the meaning of \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (the so-called \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce provisions under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and 1B<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) as a \u201ccause\u201d for divorce in the context of interpreting G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 5, one of the statutes conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the Probate and Family Court Department.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201cIf the plaintiff has lived in this commonwealth for one year last preceding the commencement of the action if the cause occurred without the commonwealth, or if the plaintiff is domiciled within the commonwealth at the time of the commencement of the action and the cause occurred within the commonwealth, a divorce may be adjudged for any cause allowed by law, unless it appears that the plaintiff has removed into this commonwealth for the purpose of obtaining a divorce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Specifically, we must decide whether a spouse who has not complied with a statutory one-year residency requirement may satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 5 by asserting domicil after a brief period of residence and claiming that the \u201ccause\u201d for the divorce, namely \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage,\u201d \u201coccurred within\u201d Massachusetts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">a. <em>Burden of proof </em>Because the husband filed a motion to dismiss due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. R 12 (b) (1), the burden fell on the wife to prove jurisdictional facts. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>436 Mass. 574, 577 n.2 (2002), and cases cited. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Tobyne, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 897 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">At the time she filed the complaint for divorce, the wife had not yet satisfied the one-year residency requirement, and thus could not establish jurisdiction on that prong of \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, to establish subject matter jurisdiction under the alternative prong of \u00a7 5, the wife had to prove that she was domiciled in Massachusetts when she filed the complaint, that the \u201ccause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>for divorce \u201coccurred within\u201d Massachusetts, and that she had not \u201cremoved into\u201d Massachusetts to obtain a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">b. <em>Domicil. </em>Domicil has been defined as \u201cthe place of one\u2019s actual residence with intention to remain permanently or for an indefinite time and without any certain purpose to return to a former place of abode.\u201d <em>Fiorentino </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>365 Mass. 13, 17 n.7 (1974), quoting <em>Tuells </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>283 Mass. 106, 109 (1933). Whether a person has established a domicil in a State is a question of fact for the trial judge. See <em>id. </em>at 21-22. The judge can make \u201ca reasonably accurate determination\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of Massachusetts domicil based on numerous factors, including, without limitation, whether the plaintiff has \u201ca Massachusetts driver\u2019s license and automobile registration; whether he or she has purchased a home or has leased an apartment in the Commonwealth; . . . whether any children have been brought to live in Massachusetts; whether personal property, including household goods, has been brought here; . . . whether there is evidence of abandonment of previous domicil, e.g., cancellation of bank accounts, leases, memberships, and so forth, sale of property, and issuance of change of address notices.\u201d <em>Fiorentino </em>v. <em>Probate Court, supra </em>at 22 &amp; n.12.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The length of residence in the State is \u201cone, but only one, relevant consideration\u201d in determining domicil. <em>Id. </em>at 22. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>308 Mass. 431, 434-435 (1941) (domicil established in Massachusetts where person intended to remain permanently but died in hospital one week after arriving in Massachusetts from Florida); <em>Winans </em>v. <em>Winans, </em>205 Mass. 388, 391-392 (1910) (domicil established in Massachusetts even though person had stayed in Massachusetts for less than two weeks living in hotel while looking for more permanent accommodations).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The facts of this case amply support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the wife established domicil in the Commonwealth. The husband\u2019s actions, such as joining in the purchase of a residence in Massachusetts, paying for the children\u2019s private schooling in the Commonwealth, purchasing a motor vehicle for the wife\u2019s use and registering the vehicle in Massachusetts, strengthen, rather than contradict, the wife\u2019s allegations of domicil. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the evidence supports the judge\u2019s finding that the wife had not \u201cremoved into\u201d Massachusetts for the purpose of obtaining a divorce. See <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Lycurgus, </em>356 Mass. 538, 540-541 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">c. <em>\u201cAn irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d as \u201ccause\u201d for divorce under \u00a7 5. </em>The subject matter jurisdiction statutes were enacted long before the no-fault divorce statutes, and the term \u201ccause\u201d referred, at first, only to the fault grounds that had to be proved to obtain a divorce.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In 1975, the Legislature added \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d as a ground for divorce. St. 1975, c. 698, amending G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1, and inserting G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB, effective January 1, 1976. It never saw fit, however, to rewrite the statute to accommodate the new concept of \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d within the jurisdictional scheme that was premised on being able to determine, with a reasonable degree of certainty, where the \u201ccause\u201d for divorce occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We now examine the language of \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 5 does not distinguish between fault and no-fault grounds for divorce. It provides that \u201ca divorce may be adjudged for any cause al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>lowed by law,\u201d which logically includes \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d under the no-fault provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB. See C.P. Kindregan, Jr. &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 27:3 n.6 (3d ed. 2002) (grounds for divorce are set forth in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 1A, IB, and 2). Neither \u00a7 1A nor \u00a7 IB contains a requirement that a spouse plead or enumerate any objective factors that would lead a court to the conclusion that a marriage is irretrievably broken.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of the foregoing, we reject the husband\u2019s contention that \u00a7 5, properly interpreted in the context of \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB, requires \u201cthe occurrence of an objective factual event in Massachusetts which gives rise to the cause of the divorce.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As a \u201ccause\u201d for divorce, \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d is inherently subjective and, contrary to the husband\u2019s contention, need not be \u201cobjectively documented, tested and proven.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The decision that a marriage is irretrievably broken need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>based on any identifiable objective fact; it is sufficient that a party or parties subjectively decide that their marriage is over and there is no hope of reconciliation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In adopting no-fault divorce, the Legislature implicitly recognized that the parties to a marriage should be able to make personal and unavoidably subjective \u201cdecisions about marriage and divorce free from overwhelming state control.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See Developments in the Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u2014 The Law of Marriage and Family, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2075, 2089 (2003), quoting E.S. Scott &amp; R.E. Scott, A Contract Theory of Marriage, in The Fall and Rise of Freedom of Contract 201, 204 (F.H. Buckley ed., 1999) (no-fault divorce \u201cis the hallmark of the law\u2019s retreat from regulating marriage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The husband argues that the wife\u2019s claim that the marriage suffered \u201can irretrievable breakdown in Massachusetts\u201d is based entirely on an \u201cethereal\u201d event. We disagree. There is support for the wife\u2019s assertion that the marriage became irretrievably broken in Massachusetts. In his memorandum of law in support of the motion to dismiss the wife\u2019s divorce action, the husband admitted that the parties attempted reconciliation in Massachusetts during the summer of 2002.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> By September of 2002, however, the parties\u2019 reconciliation attempts failed. The reconciliation having failed, the \u201cirretrievable breakdown\u201d that the wife alleged occurred on or about July 26, 2002, continued as set forth by the wife in her second complaint for divorce.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In addition, contrary to the husband\u2019s argument, subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 5 would not be based solely on a spouse\u2019s subjective determination of when and where his or her marriage suffered \u201can irretrievable breakdown.\u201d The Legislature has set forth additional safeguards designed to prevent the Commonwealth from becoming a \u201cdivorce mill for unhappy spouses,\u201d <em>Sosna </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 407 (1975): the requirements that a plaintiff establish domicil in the State (an objective determination, discussed <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and convince the court that he or she had not \u201cremoved into\u201d Massachusetts solely to obtain a divorce, and a six-month waiting period before a hearing on a divorce complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 IB can be obtained.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Legislature easily could have limited the invocation of \u00a7 5 to parties filing for divorce on fault grounds, or imposed a mandatory residency requirement on all spouses alleging \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage,\u201d but it did not do so. That the Legislature did not impose any additional restrictions on plaintiffs seeking no-fault divorces lends support to our conclusion that it considered existing safeguards sufficient to prevent potential forum shopping abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the wife satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 5, so as to survive the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the Probate and Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Court\u2019s denial of the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss the wife\u2019s complaint for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The wife was bom in Massachusetts.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 1A, comprise the two Massachusetts \u201cno fault\u201d divorce statutes. Section 1A permits both parties jointly to petition the court for a divorce on the ground of \u201can irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\u201d; a judgment of divorce nisi is entered thirty days after the hearing. The judgment of divorce absolute is entered ninety days after that. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 21 (\u201cJudgments of divorce shall in the first instance be judgments nisi, and shall become absolute after the expiration of ninety days from the entry thereof . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Section IB permits a party to file a complaint for divorce. It further provides that \u201c[n]o earlier than six months after the filing of the complaint, there shall be a hearing and the court may enter a judgment of divorce nisi if the court finds that there has existed, for the period following the filing of the complaint and up to the date of the hearing, a continuing irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.\u201d G.

Rather, the term \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d is \u201cdescriptive of the frame of mind of the spouses in a marriage which is no longer viable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting The Report of the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, in J. of the Cal. Assembly at 8057 (Aug. 8, 1969). To satisfy the \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d test, it is sufficient if only one spouse feels \u201cthat the marriage cannot be salvaged.\u201d Comment, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The California no-fault divorce statute does not explicitly state whether a \u201cpetitioner\u2019s self-serving testimony about his or her state of mind\u201d is sufficient evidence to establish irreconcilable differences, or whether it must be \u201ccorroborated by evidence of actual facts and occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320. Reading the statutory provisions regarding \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d together with the provisions generally prohibiting receipt of fault evidence in divorce cases brought on no-fault grounds, it becomes clear that \u201cdemonstrative evidence is not required to corroborate state-of-mind testimony\u201d and \u201cthe prima facie case for dissolution should be satisfied by the declaration of petitioner that he or she sincerely believes that the marriage has irreparably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>broken down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321, 1322. See <em>id. </em>at 1324 (irreconcilable differences is \u201cproved solely with reference to petitioner\u2019s state of mind\u201d). Similar to the California no-fault divorce statute, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, also prohibits a judge \u201cfrom inquiring into or considering any evidence of individual marital fault of the parties\u201d in determining whether the parties\u2019 separation agreement in \u00a7 1A divorces is fair and reasonable.

See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Walton, </em>28 Cal. App. 3d 108, 117 (1972), quoting <em>In re Marriage of McKim, </em>6 Cal. 3d 673, 680 (1971) (in deciding whether evidence supports findings \u201cthat irreconcilable differences do exist and that the marriage has broken down irremediably and should be dissolved,\u201d the court must necessarily \u201cdepend to a considerable extent upon the subjective state of mind of the parties\u201d); <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>178 Conn. 254, 255 (1979) (there need not be \u201cobjective guidelines\u201d for determination that marriage is irretrievably broken); <em>Mattson </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>376 A.2d 473, 475 (Me. 1977) (\u201cThe term \u2018irreconcilable marital differences\u2019 is one that necessarily lacks precision and should not be circumscribed by a strict definition\u201d); <em>Matter of the Marriage of Dunn, </em>13 Or.

Rev. 79, 83-91 (1991). A \u201creview of legal literature advocating or discussing the adoption of no-fault divorce grounds in the 1960s and 1970s,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 91, revealed that one of the major arguments in favor of adopting no-fault divorce grounds was that basic notions of marriage and divorce had changed, and \u201cno-fault divorce more accurately reflected modem conceptions of terminating marital relations than did the prior laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95. Specifically, the advocates of no-fault divorce asserted that \u201cdivorce was a private matter that the state had no legitimate interest to restrict when the marriage was irretrievably broken and the parties to the marriage had agreed to terminate the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. The main thrust of this privacy argument was to protect the parties from \u201cunnecessary distress and embarrassing public disclosures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The proponents of no-fault divorce claimed that requiring the parties to disclose \u201c \u2018the most intimate and often embarrassing details of marital life\u2019 [was] \u2018abhorrent to the community,\u2019 violated the spirit of family privacy, and worked only to \u2018demean the marriage relationship, humiliate the parties, and damage the residual family relationships.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, quoting Goldstein, On Abolition of Grounds for Divorce: A Model Statute and Commentary, 3 Fam. L.Q. 75, 82-83 (1969). The shift to the no-fault divorce was, thus, prompted in part by the belief that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s interest in protecting marriages did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>justify requiring disclosure of the marriage\u2019s failings if it was undisputed by the parties that the marriage was irretrievably broken.\u201d Wardle, <em>supra </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">No-fault divorce laws represent a \u201ccultural rise of individual liberty within the family\u201d and \u201callow the parties involved to assess the viability of the marriage.\u201d Note, Who Pays for Guilt?: Recent Fault-Based Divorce Reform Proposals, Cultural Stereotypes and Economic Consequences, 40 B.C. L. Rev. 611, 614 (1999).

In specific reliance on [the wife\u2019s] overtures with, respect to reconciliation, and in an effort to save the marriage, [the husband] agreed to assist [the wife] with the purchase of a home in Wellesley in late August/early September, 2002.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The fact that the wife moved to Massachusetts, while the husband remained in Italy, does not, by itself, establish that the parties\u2019 marriage had already become irretrievably broken in Italy.
