Shantigar claims that the trial judge erroneously refused to permit the jury, when comparing liability pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, to consider the negligence of a second tortfeasor with whom Shantigar had settled prior to trial. Shantigar also claims error in the admission of evidence concerning its decision not to install a sprinkler system in the bam. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On the evening of January 26, 2000, a fire destroyed a Nineteenth Century bam owned by the Shantigar Foundation in Rowe. Shantigar, an organization founded by playwright Jean-Claude van Itallie, was in the process of renovating the bam for use as a spiritual learning center where students and visitors could attend workshops and classes. The renovation, which had been ongoing for some two and one-half years at a cost to Shantigar of just under $1 million, was substantially completed at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Shantigar had contracted with Bear Mountain to perform some of the renovation work. Bear Mountain, a sole proprietorship ran by Joseph Kayan, had one employee who worked on the project, Brandon Boucias. Kayan also subcontracted work to Cove Building Company (Cove), a sole proprietorship ran by Jeffrey Stone. At the time of the fire, Stone had two employees, including Richard Moran.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">Approximately one year before the fire, Shantigar began contracting directly with Cove. Kayan had decided to spend less time at the project site, although Boucias still worked there. Kayan appeared on the site every ten to fourteen days. Van Ital-lie, as head of Shantigar, was also present and actively involved in the direction and details of the project, but relied on Kayan to supervise construction. The building permit applications for the project listed Kayan as the construction supervisor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-23\">Van Itallie testified that he and the professionals hired to work on the bam discussed the fire safety measures mandated by law. He recognized the fact that the bam was a fibre hazard because it was old and \u201cdried out.\u201d He further testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>although he did not \u201clike the look of a sprinkler system in an old bam,\u201d he would have installed one had the law required it. The project\u2019s architect testified that, in his opinion, the barn was \u201ca tinderbox,\u201d and he recommended installing a sprinkler system, but because it was not legally required, van Itallie opted not to install one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Heat detectors and smoke detectors, which were required by law, were to be installed throughout the bam, but at the time of the fire not all of them were in place, and the system was not functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">During the renovation van Itallie requested that the contractors use \u201cnatural\u201d products, and provided Kayan with a catalogue that advertised BioShield, a linseed oil based product, to be applied to wood surfaces such as floors and stairs. Van Itallie testified that he assumed the product would be applied with rags. He further testified he was familiar with the concept of spontaneous combustion, and knew that \u201coily rags left around do cause a fire.\u201d Kayan and the project\u2019s architect recommended using polyurethane on the floors, but van Itallie wanted to use BioShield.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In August, 1999, workers discovered smoke curling from a pile of rags that had been used to apply the linseed oil. The rags were \u201cwarm to the touch\u201d and in an initial stage of combustion. The workers talked about the incident on their coffee breaks for some time afterward, and recognized the danger of fire from the use of linseed oil. After the incident, Kayan discussed the hazard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>with Stone and the workers, and instructed them how to dispose of rags safely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As the project neared completion, the crew prepared a \u201cpunch list\u201d of tasks still to be performed. Stone had the responsibility of oiling and buffing the floors in the bam. At approximately 10 a.m. on January 26, 2000, Boucias applied oil to a small test patch of the floor in the main room using a rag. He then left the rag in an oil pan and departed for a meeting, leaving Stone and Moran to oil the rest of the floor, which covered approximately 2,500 square feet. Between noon and 1 p.m., Boucias returned and buffed a six-by-six-foot area of the floor. Boucias testified he oiled and buffed these small areas mainly because he was \u201cjust excited to see what the floor would look like.\u201d Afterward, he and Kayan went across the street for a meeting at van Ital-lie\u2019s garage and stayed there until 4 p.m. Boucias then walked back to the bam to retrieve his jacket and left for the day, having done no further work at the bam.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Stone testified that he used a lamb\u2019s wool mop to apply the 011 to the floor that day, as well as paint bmshes to apply it to the edges. He also used two rags, one in his back pocket to wipe his hands, and another he left lying on the floor outside the main room so that he could step on it. He testified he did not use the rags to apply the oil to the floor, and that they had \u201cvery little\u201d oil on them. After applying the oil, Stone buffed the floor, finishing his work by approximately 3:30 p.m. Before departing, Stone left the mop wrapped in a plastic bag on the second floor of the barn, and hung the rags over a \u201ccow stanchion\u201d in the hallway on the first floor. He removed the buffer pad and placed it on top of the buffer, which was left in the first floor hallway as well. He did not testify to soaking any of the items in water after using them.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Shantigar\u2019s expert testified that the fire started that evening in the hallway where Stone had left the oily rags. He determined the cause to be spontaneous combustion of the linseed oil, rags, and other materials in the hallway. On cross-examination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>expert testified it was possible that fires could have ignited simultaneously on different floors of the bam.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Shantigar filed suit against both Bear Mountain and Cove for negligence and breach of contract. In December, 2001, Shantigar settled with Cove for $300,000. Cove then filed an unopposed motion to dismiss Bear Mountain\u2019s cross claim for contribution, and for entry of separate and final judgment, which was allowed. The claims against Bear Mountain proceeded to trial before a jury in May, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The jury found that Bear Mountain did not breach its contract with Shantigar, and was not negligent in the performance of its work on the project. The jury did find that Bear Mountain was negligent \u201cin the supervision of others on the project,\u201d and that its negligence proximately caused the damage to the bam. The jury also found that Shantigar was negligent and that its negligence was a proximate cause of the fire. Having made such a finding, the jurors were instructed to allocate percentages of fault to Shantigar and Bear Mountain that would total one hundred per cent. As previously noted, the jury found Shantigar sixty per cent at fault and Bear Mountain forty per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The judge therefore ordered judgment for Bear Mountain. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shantigar then filed a motion to amend the judgment, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial. The judge denied the motion, and Shantigar appealed from both the judgment and the denial of the motion. We granted Shantigar\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">2. <em>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85. </em>We first address Bear Mountain\u2019s claim that Shantigar did not preserve the issue of comparative liability for appellate review. After the judge charged the jurors, but before they retired to deliberate, the following exchange took place at sidebar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cThat means Cove should be listed on the comparative negligence slip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">The judge: \u201cCove what?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cOn the negligence. Because if they are going to consider all the negligence \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">The judge: \u201cI specifically took Cove off because the jury \u2014 it would so mislead the jury when I tell them they are only to consider those \u2014. So your objection is noted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Bear Mountain claims that the above statements by counsel fail to comport with Mass. R. Civ. P. 51 (b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), because he did not make a formal objection to a jury instruction, and did not state the reason underlying his purported objection. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>416 Mass. 62, 66 (1993). More applicable perhaps is Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), which governs special verdicts. To preserve rights under rule 49 (a), \u201ca party must lodge an objection to the omission of any issue in the special questions before the jury retires.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 852 (1983), citing <em>Cote </em>v. <em>Estate of Butler, </em>518 F.2d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 1975). In our view, however, the requirements of either rule were met. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel clearly took issue with the proposed verdict slip and was attempting to explain why he thought Cove should be included. The judge acknowledged an understanding of the issue but nevertheless declined counsel\u2019s request. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., supra. </em>Moreover, he expressly stated to counsel, \u201c[Yjour objection is noted.\u201d See <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748, 752 (2000). The matter therefore is properly before us. We now turn to the question whether G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, compelled the inclusion of Cove in the jury\u2019s apportionment of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Shantigar advances several reasons why the Massachusetts comparative negligence statute requires apportionment of negligence for settling defendants. First, it argues the mandatory language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. It also asserts that the jury\u2019s apportionment of negligence was incompatible with their factual finding. It claims that excluding Cove from the jury verdict slip contravenes the legislative intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>statute. Finally, Shantigar contends that reversing the judge\u2019s ruling will promote the public policy of encouraging settlements among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The comparative negligence statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cContributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any action ... to recover damages for negligence ... if such negligence was not greater than the total amount of negligence attributable to the person or persons <em>against whom recovery is sought, </em>but any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whose injury, damage or death recovery is made. In determining by what amount the plaintiff\u2019s damages shall be diminished in such a case, the negligence of each plaintiff shall be compared to the total negligence of all persons <em>against whom recovery is sought. </em>The combined total of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence taken together with all of the negligence of all <em>defendants </em>shall equal one hundred per cent\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis added). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85. In the more than thirty years since the Legislature rewrote the statute in 1973, St. 1973, c. 1123, \u00a7 1, no Massachusetts case has squarely resolved the question whether a tortfeasor who has settled should be included as a \u201cdefendant\u201d under \u00a7 85 for purposes of apportioning percentages of liability. See <em>Woods </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 768, <em>777 </em>n.13 (2002), quoting <em>Laveck </em>v. <em>Pascoe Pizza, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 938 n.6 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Shantigar argues that the judge failed to comply with the clear mandate of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, because its negligence was not compared with the negligence of both parties against whom recovery was sought. Bear Mountain contends that the statute requires comparison only with that of active participants at trial, i.e., \u201cpersons against whom recovery <em>is </em>sought\u201d or \u201cdefendants\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>We think that the plain language of \u00a7 85 supports the latter interpretation. The statute does not direct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>jury to apportion negligence among all tortfeasors who may have caused the injury, only those against whom recovery \u201cis\u201d sought. See Glannon, Liability of Multiple Tortfeasors in Massachusetts: The Related Doctrines of Joint and Several Liability, 85 Mass. L. Rev. 50, 60 (2000) (Glannon) (\u201conly a licentious reading of [\u00a7 85] would assess negligence to all tortfeasors who may have contributed to the injury\u201d). Having settled its claim against Cove, Shantigar was not seeking recovery against Cove at the time the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Shantigar alternatively argues that omitting Cove from the verdict slip produced an artificial result that is inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding of fact, as well as the plain meaning of the statute. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 85, mandates that the \u201ccombined total of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence taken together with all of the negligence of all <em>defendants </em>shall equal one hundred per cent\u201d (emphasis added). Shantigar claims that the jury implicitly found Cove negligent, and therefore the combined total of the negligence of Shantigar, Bear Mountain, <em>and Cove </em>exceeded one hundred per cent. This argument assumes, first, that the jury were referring to Cove when they found Bear Mountain negligent in its supervision of \u201cothers.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if we accept this proposition, the argument also assumes that Cove \u2014 which Shantigar had discharged from liability some five months before trial \u2014 was still a \u201cdefendant\u201d for purposes of the statute. The clause on which Shantigar relies, however, must be read in conjunction with the clause that directs a comparison of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence to that of \u201call persons against whom recovery is sought.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), quoting <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946) (\u201cenactment considered as a whole shall constitute a consistent and harmonious statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>provision\u201d). At the time the case was submitted to the jury, Cove was no longer a defendant against whom recovery \u201cis sought.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-572h(b) (2003) (specifying that \u201cpersons against whom recovery is sought\u201d includes \u201csettled or released persons\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Last, Shantigar asserts that if Cove had been included on the verdict slip, the change in the apportionment calculus would have resulted in a verdict in which Shantigar\u2019s negligence fell below the total amount of negligence attributable to the negligence of Cove and Bear Mountain, enabling Shantigar to recover damages from Bear Mountain (minus the $300,000 settlement amount with Cove). Not only does Shantigar\u2019s proposal run afoul of the plain language of the statute, it also calls for speculation. \u201cWe do not know how the jury might have allocated negligence had they been instructed to allocate negligence\u201d among Shantigar, Bear Mountain, <em>and </em>Cove. See <em>Laveck </em>v. <em>Pascoe Pizza, Inc., supra </em>at 936. Given the evidence at trial, we do not assume that including Cove on the verdict slip would have reduced Shantigar\u2019s apportioned liability. Moreover, allocating negligence to someone who was not actually litigating the question at trial does not provide a sound basis to make such an allocation. See <em>Composto </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 479 n.4 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Shantigar next claims that excluding from the jury slip a defendant who has settled with the plaintiff contravenes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Legislature\u2019s intent. Shantigar contends that when interpreting a statute, we must consider \u201cthe cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated,\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934), and that \u201c[t]he purpose of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, was to ameliorate the harsh result of the contributory negligence role and \u2018permit recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence was not greater than the negligence of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, </em>395 Mass. 76, 79 (1985), quoting <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 n.5 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Shantigar relies on <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342 (1983), and <em>Graci </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>376 Mass. 931 (1978), to assert that the court \u201crecognized that the goal of the comparative negligence statute is effectuated by requiring the negligence of the plaintiff be \u2018compared with the total negligence of all defendants\u2019 rather than with each individual defendant.\u201d Allowing the jury to compare Shantigar\u2019s negligence only to that of Bear Mountain, Shantigar argues, was the same comparison rejected in <em>Graci </em>v. <em>Damon, supra. </em>However, that case did not consider whether to include a settling defendant in the apportionment of liability, see <em>Graci </em>v. <em>Damon, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 160, 161-163, <em>S.C., </em>376 Mass. 931 (1978), thus Shantigar\u2019s reliance is misplaced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 350-352, the court held that a negligent employer who is immune from suit by virtue of having paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the death of injured employee may not be included in the jury\u2019s negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>calculus under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85. See <em>id. </em>at 350 (noting workers\u2019 compensation statute \u201cwithdraw[s] from the pool of available defendants and contributors any employer who pays compensation benefits\u201d). See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Chance Mfg. Co., </em>873 F.2d 465, 467 (1st Cir. 1989), citing <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 346-352 (under \u00a7 85, \u201ca jury must apportion negligence between only the plaintiff and the defendant; the fault of non-parties ... is not to be taken into account\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Bear Mountain asserts, and we agree, that the removal of absent tortfeasors from the jury\u2019s consideration comports with the Legislature\u2019s intent and is consistent with the Massachusetts statutory schemes of joint and several liability, and contribution. Under our current system of joint and several liability, a plaintiff injured by more than one tortfeasor may sue any or all of them for her full damages. See <em>Kabatchnick </em>v. <em>Hanover-Elm Bldg. Corp., </em>331 Mass. 366, 368 (1954); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Koch Enters., Inc., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 280 (1995). See also Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 51. The purpose of having the fact finder assign liability percentages is merely \u201cto ascertain the negligence percentage of the plaintiff, so that her award of damages can be reduced to reflect her negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. Tortfeasors who pay more than their \u201cpro rata\u201d (equal) share of damages may then seek partial reimbursement, or contribution, from other joint tortfeasors, see G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 1; Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 62, although tortfeasors who settle with the plaintiff prior to entry of judgment are insulated from claims for contribution from the remaining defendants (who are then entitled to a setoff in the judgment equal to the settlement amount). See G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 4. See also Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">By contrast, in jurisdictions that impose several liability, tortfeasors pay according to their percentage of fault. See Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 52 n.12. Such jurisdictions are more likely to include at least some absent tortfeasors in the negligence calculus. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Marin, </em>623 So. 2d 1182, 1185 (Fla. 1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Tallahassee Memorial Regional Med. Ctr., Inc., 659 </em>So. 2d 249 (Fla. 1995) (construing Florida comparative negligence statute to allocate fault to all participants to action, based on State Legislature\u2019s curtailment of joint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>several liability). See also Note, Apportioning Responsibility to Immune Nonparties: An Argument Based on Comparative Responsibility and the Proposed Restatement (Third) of Torts, 82 Iowa L. Rev. 1293, 1305 (1997) (\u201cA majority of states with a pure or modified form of several liability that have addressed the issue allow evidence of nonparty fault generally to be introduced into the distribution calculus\u201d [footnote omitted]). Significantly, Massachusetts has declined previous opportunities to eliminate joint and several liability (a system, we note, that favors plaintiffs because it places the risk of insolvent defendants on codefendants rather than on the injured party) in favor of imposing fault-based liability on all parties. See <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, supra </em>at 81; <em>Graci </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 168-170 (1978). Moreover, our \u201cmodified\u201d comparative negligence rule theoretically could allow a plaintiff who is as much as fifty per cent at fault to recover from a codefendant who is no more than one per cent at fault. See Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 54. Although the omission of a settling tortfeasor from the jury\u2019s consideration might work unfavorably for a plaintiff, as it did in this case, it does not violate the principles of joint and several liability, contribution, or comparative negligence, and is indeed consistent with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally, Shantigar argues that' omitting a settling defendant from the verdict slip may discourage plaintiffs from settling with any defendant, because the jury\u2019s allocation may not fairly reflect the plaintiff\u2019s proportionate fault. See Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 60. Just because the system is imperfect does not mean it is unjust. Indeed, it is no less rational than our previous contributory negligence rule, and it is certainly much less harsh on plaintiffs. See <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, supra. </em>Plaintiffs who wish to avoid the potential pitfalls of settling with one tortfeasor need not settle with any. They may always proceed to trial against all tortfeasors not immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We recognize that the Uniform Comparative Fault Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and numerous States, including some with comparative negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>statutes that use language similar to ours, require apportionment of negligence to absent tortfeasors. See, e.g., <em>Inland/Riggle Oil Co., 925 </em>P.2d 1083, 1086 (Colo. 1996); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co., </em>214 Wis. 519, 535-536 (1934). Interpreting \u00a7 85 in lockstep with those jurisdictions, however, without consideration of the unique statutory schemes of each State could undermine the balance of equities \u2014 some favoring plaintiffs and others favoring defendants \u2014 that is achieved by our own system.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 52 (\u201cThe [Massachusetts] liability regime as a whole involves the interaction of common law joint and several liability with two statutory schemes \u2014 comparative negligence and contribution\u201d). By requiring the fact finder to apportion one hundred per cent of the negligence among only those who participate in the trial, the parties equally shoulder the burden of persuading the fact finder as to how to allocate fault. Although some commentators have opined that including absent tortfeasors in the negligence calculus results in a more accurate apportionment of liability, see, e.g., Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 60, \u201cwe are precluded from \u2018making any decision in the name of equity which would undercut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the legislative scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, supra </em>at 83, quoting <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 349 (1983). See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, in light of our previous interpretations of the Massachusetts statutory schemes governing liability of multiple tortfeasors, persuades us that the statute applies only to named parties who participate in the trial.

Shantigar had filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all such evidence at trial. After hearing argument, the judge deferred ruling on the matter. The judge later overruled Shantigar\u2019s objection to the offer of such evidence during the cross-examination of van Itallie.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Massachusetts law recognizes that in the absence of a statutory duty to install sprinklers or other specialized fire apparatus, a jury could find such a duty when the owner knows of a \u201cparticular danger of fire.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Marblehead Real Estate Co., </em>301 Mass. 156, 161 (1938). See <em>Cigna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>OY Saunatec, Ltd., </em>241 F.3d 1, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2001). Shantigar argues it had no knowledge of a particular danger of fire which would have triggered a duty to install a sprinkler system. However, van Itallie acknowledged the ancient wooden bam was a fire hazard, and that his architect had advised him to install sprinklers because the barn was, in his words, a \u201ctinderbox.\u201d The jury reasonably could conclude that van Itallie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>was aware of a particular danger of fire. There was no error in the admission of evidence concerning his decision not to install a fire suppression system.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-27\">The plaintiffs expert witness testified that, under the State building code, the contractor whose license appears on the building permit is responsible for construction safety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The relevant portion of the transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Q.: \u201cDid you have any conversations with Mr. Van Itallie relative to the use of sprinklers at this facility?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">A.: \u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Q.: \u201cWhat were those?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">A.: \u201cWe recommended it.

Stone, Cove\u2019s owner, even testified that van Itallie was the \u201cBoss\u201d and that he, Stone, was not acting under Kayan\u2019s supervision or control at the time of the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We further note that the exclusion of Cove from the jury verdict slip was consistent with Superior Court practice.

This is because Wisconsin requires comparison of a plaintiff\u2019s negligence to each individual defendant\u2019s rattier than the combined negligence of multiple defendants, see <em>id., </em>an approach that, as previously noted, Massachusetts has expressly rejected.
