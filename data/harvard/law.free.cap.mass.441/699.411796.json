Callahan\u2019s employment as an interim pastor of the First Congregational Church of Haverhill (Church) and the suspension of his privilege to be a minister by the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ (conference). The defendants moved to dismiss, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), claiming the court has no subject matter jurisdiction over this purely ecclesiastical matter. A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion. Based on our decision in <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505 (2002), however, she later reconsidered her denial. The judge concluded that the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra, </em>largely because the defendant Church has a congregational rather than a hierarchical organization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that this court \u201chas not yet explicitly outlined the scope and breadth of the congregational/hierarchical distinction in respect to church disputes not involving property issues,\u201d the judge again refused to dismiss the complaint. The defendants sought relief from a single justice of the Appeals Court, who treated the petition as a request for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal, and authorized such appeal. We transferred the case here on our motion. See <em>CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 539, 540-541 (1980). Today we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>constitutional rights of religious freedom apply equally to congregational and hierarchical churches. These rights prohibit the court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the claims at issue, with the single exception of the defamation count against Robert Clark. We therefore vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the allegations of the complaint as amended, supplemented by undisputed facts set forth in the exhibits submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In January, 1997, Callahan contracted with the defendant Church to serve as its \u201cinterim pastor\u201d until the Church hired a permanent or \u201csettled\u201d pastor. An interim pastor is a specialized minister who leads the church during a transition period between settled pastors. Callahan previously had served as an interim pastor at a number of churches throughout New England during much of his thirty-five year career. According to Callahan, the first year of his tenure with the Church passed successfully. In 1998, however, a series of events transpired that he claims ultimately led to his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">After Callahan expressed concerns about the Church\u2019s alleged \u201cfinancial recordkeeping, lack of a recent audit, and apparent discrepancies and conflicts of interest,\u201d the \u201cChurch Council\u201d responded by treating him with hostility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Callahan alleges the hostility escalated in April, 1998, when he expressed concerns about certain actions taken by the search committee that was reviewing candidates for the settled pastor\u2019s position. Specifically, Callahan complained to the committee that it had failed to interview a white candidate who was married to an African-American woman, and that it had interviewed but failed to hire a woman that the committee allegedly \u201cperceived to be a lesbian.\u201d In an interim pastor\u2019s report, Callahan had advocated adopting an \u201c[o]pen and [ajffirming\u201d policy toward gay and lesbian candidates for the ministry, and against homophobia. Also in April, 1998, according to the complaint, Callahan experienced a \u201ctoxic reaction\u201d to monosodium glutamate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>(MSG), which \u201ctemporarily disabled him.\u201d As a result of the allegedly hostile treatment he received after these occurrences, Callahan tendered his resignation from the Church on April 26, 1998, to be effective June 30, 1998. He applied for interim ministries at other, unspecified churches thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">According to the amended complaint, in July, 1998, Robert Clark, the assistant to the Church moderator, had a conversation with Jean Roshon, a forum leader of the Church. Clark told Roshon \u201cthat he would do everything he could to ensure that Callahan never practiced ministry again.\u201d During that same conversation, Clark accused Callahan of having an \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a seminarian, which Roshon interpreted to mean a homosexual relationship with a person who was under Callahan\u2019s tutelage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clark also told Roshon of Callahan\u2019s \u201cbizarre behavior,\u201d including slamming a child\u2019s bicycle against a wall, and said that Callahan had breached a confidence involving a moderator and a seminarian.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On or about August 18, 1998, Robert Clark, Robert Coppola, Richard Smith, and Susan Staples Smith, along with other Church officers, submitted a complaint<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against Callahan to the conference, the body from which Callahan derived the authority to practice ministry. The ecclesiastical complaint accused Callahan of \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d behavior at council meetings, of interfering with the relationship between Roshon and the Church, of breaching an unspecified confidence, and of \u201cflfying] into a rage.\u201d It further alleged that Callahan picked up a child\u2019s bicycle, laid it down, and fled when he saw a member of the Church approaching, \u201csuggesting some kind of wrongdoing.\u201d Finally, the ecclesiastical complaint accused Callahan of misconduct with respect to the Church\u2019s pledge cards, of mailing a stuffed rat to the Church treasurer, and of calling the congregation \u201cevil.\u201d The above-named defendants repeated these remarks in subsequent meetings with a \u201cResponse Team\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>assembled by the conference to investigate the ecclesiastical complaint against Callahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On August 31, 1998, according to Callahan\u2019s complaint, Charles H. Harper, the area minister of the Metropolitan Boston Area office of the United Church of Christ, \u201ccontacted prospective employers of Rev. Callahan, and informed others, without a need to know, that \u2018charges\u2019 had been filed against Rev. Callahan.\u201d Harper also demanded that Callahan inform other churches to which he had applied that \u201ccharges\u201d had been filed against him. Under the auspices of the conference, Harper initiated a \u201cdisciplinary process\u201d in response to the ecclesiastical complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">A committee on the ministry established by the conference held a series of disciplinary sessions against Callahan on April 28, May 5, and May 12, 1999. The committee heard testimony regarding Callahan\u2019s concerns that the Church\u2019s search committee was excluding homosexuals and lesbian ministers, and that it had declined to interview a white minister who was in an interracial marriage. The committee also heard testimony from Clark, Coppola, Smith, and Staples Smith as to the allegations in their complaint against Callahan. Harper also appeared at the hearing and \u201cwas instrumental in influencing\u201d the committee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On May 18, 1999, the committee issued its four-page decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The committee determined that Callahan had violated his duty \u201cto work cooperatively and collegially with those whom he had been called to serve\u201d by improperly disparaging the leaders and other members of the Church, and by failing to keep confidential an administrative discussion with a lay leader after having agreed to do so. The committee also found that Callahan had interfered with the search process of the Church. By a vote of eleven to zero with three abstentions, the committee suspended Callahan\u2019s standing as a minister in the Metropolitan Boston Association indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Callahan could apply for reinstatement on completion and report to the committee of a \u201ccomplete physiological examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tian with a particular emphasis on neurological issues, including full medical testing for Alzheimer\u2019s [disease],\u201d as well as a complete psychological examination. Callahan also had to authorize representatives of the committee \u201cto communicate their concerns to the health care providers before the examinations, to examine fully all records of the examinations, and to discuss the results of the examinations with the health care providers.\u201d The decision provided that Callahan could file a written appeal with the registrar of the Metropolitan Boston Association of the conference within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Callahan appealed from the decision to the review panel of the conference, which affirmed the suspension on September 17, 1999. Callahan then filed a complaint, alleging discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation and disability, with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). The MCAD dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (5) (\u201cnothing herein shall be construed to bar any religious or denominational institution or organization . . . from taking any action with respect to matters of employment, discipline, faith, internal organization, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law which are calculated by such organization to promote the religious principles for which it is established or maintained\u201d). After Callahan appealed, the MCAD affirmed its dismissal on May 2, 2001. On June 29, 2001, Callahan filed the civil action now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">2. <em>Congregational versus hierarchical. </em>In denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and to reconsider the denial, the judge determined that \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court of the United States and the [Supreme Judicial Court] have distinguished between the level of First Amendment protection afforded to hierarchical and congregational church structures,\u201d citing <em>Maryland &amp; Va. Eldership of the Churches of God </em>v. <em>Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>396 U.S. 367, 368 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 679, 722 (1871); and <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, </em>383 Mass. 854, 860-862 (1981). The rationale for this perceived distinction appears .to lie in the establishment by hierarchical churches of rules and regulations for internal discipline and government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and in the creation of tribunals for resolving disputes on these matters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 861, and cases cited. \u201cIn a hierarchical church structure, a local church is but an integral and subordinate member of a larger, general church organization.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 58, 62 n.2, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 899 (1979). A congregational church, by contrast, \u201cis self-governing . . . \u2018strictly independent of other ecclesiastical associations, and so far as church government is concerned, owes no fealty or obligation to any higher authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 860, quoting <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, supra. </em>The motion judge interpreted the differentiation enunciated in these cases as according less deference to congregational churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We do not read either of the United States Supreme Court cases cited by the judge, however, as supporting judicial intrusion into matters of religious doctrine involving congregational churches. <em>Maryland &amp; Va. Eldership of the Churches of God </em>v. <em>Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., supra </em>at 367, involved a church property dispute. The Court\u2019s brief per curiam opinion dismissed the appeal as lacking a substantial Federal question, because the State court\u2019s resolution of the dispute \u201cinvolved no inquiry into religious doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in that case, moreover, strongly cautioned courts <em>against </em>resolving doctrinal controversies when deciding church property disputes, whether the church polity is hierarchi-</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>cal or congregational. See <em>id. </em>at 368-370 (Brennan, J., concurring). <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 724-727, which likewise concerned a conflict over the use of church property, set out approaches for enforcing property disputes depending on the organizational structure of the church.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Maryland &amp; Va. Eldership of the Churches of God </em>v. <em>Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., supra </em>at 368-370 (Brennan, J., concurring). Indeed, we relied on both of these cases when we held in <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 860, that \u201c[i]f a church is deemed congregational, the First Amendment [to the United States Constitution] does not bar a civil court from giving effect to an authoritative resolution by the governing church body <em>of a church property or related dispute </em>as long as the governing body followed its own rules in reaching that resolution\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The controversy in <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 855, \u201cbegan as an action to recover property\u201d but grew to encompass a variety of other issues, including who was the true pastor and president of the plaintiff corporation (Antioch), and who could control and use the property that was in Antioch\u2019s name. The parties agreed to submit the issues to a master, whose report was confirmed by the Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>at 858. On ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>peal, the aggrieved party claimed that Antioch was a hierarchical church whose ecclesiastical court had already ruled on the issues, foreclosing consideration by the secular courts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In determining the existence of jurisdiction over the case, this court acknowledged the limits that the First Amendment places on judicial resolution of church property disputes. <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 859-860. It noted that \u201cboth this court and the United States Supreme Court have distinguished between hierarchical and congregational church structures,\u201d and that the role of the court may differ accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 860. However, \u201cin either case the courts, in effect, will honor the decision of the governing body chosen by the church members themselves before the dispute arose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After examining the corporate documents of both Antioch and the national church organization it once belonged to, this court concluded that Antioch was a congregational church and that the Superior Court had properly exercised jurisdiction over the dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 863-864.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The court, however, went on to analyze whether, in acting to remove the aggrieved party as pastor and to resign from the national organization, Antioch\u2019s board of directors \u201cfollowed the by-laws to which its members, including [the aggrieved party] subjected themselves,\u201d citing <em>Maryland &amp; Va. Eldership of the Churches of God </em>v. <em>Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., supra, </em>and <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>as authority for such an inquiry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 864-865. The court ultimately affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, determining that it \u201cdoes no more than honor the decisions of the governing body of a congregational church.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Other courts have declined to distinguish between congregational and hierarchical churches when determining whether they may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over disputes arising from the termination or discipline of a minister or church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>member. See, e.g., <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>810 A.2d 871, 879 n.4 (D.C. 2002) (\u201c[A] congregational church\u2019s internal organization provides no nuance that would change its standing under the First Amendment or that would require a different constitutional analysis from that afforded to a hierarchical church\u201d); <em>Guinn </em>v. <em>Church of Christ of Collinsville, </em>775 P.2d 766, 772 n.18 (Okla. 1989) (\u201cDisciplinary decisions made by churches within this [congregational] form of government are no less fair or deserving of judicial deference than decisions made by churches structured in a hierarchical fashion\u201d). See also <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Union Baptist Ass\u2019n, </em>55 P.3d 1012, 1014 (Okla. 2001) (\u201ccongregational churches . . . are no more subject to judicial oversight than are ones with a hierarchical form of government\u201d). At least one legal commentator also has criticized the making of such distinctions in this context. See Laycock, Towards a General Theory of the Religion Clauses: The Case of Church Labor Relations and the Right to Church Autonomy, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 1373, 1414 (1981) (\u201cRegulation for congregational churches and autonomy for hierarchical churches would deny free exercise to the former and arguably tend to establish the latter\u201d). The judicial distinction between congregational and hierarchical churches, while perhaps convenient for ascertaining organizational authority, see Laycock, <em>supra </em>at 1413, does not justify secular intrusion into disputes involving matters of church governance. \u201c[T]he First Amendment prohibits judicial encroachment into church decisions where those decisions turn on church policy or on religious doctrine or practice. . . . [T]his prohibition includes church decisions concerning the employment of ministers because selection and termination of clergy is a core matter of ecclesiastical self-governance not subject to interference by a [S]tote.\u201d <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Today we hold that congregational as well as hierarchical churches are entitled to autonomy \u201cover church disputes touching on matters of doctrine, canon law, polity, discipline, and ministerial relationships.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>436 Mass. 574, 579 (2002). See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 72, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985) (\u201cthe First Amendment prohibits civil courts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>intervening in disputes concerning religious doctrine, discipline, faith, or internal organization\u201d). To conclude otherwise would violate fundamental precepts of the First Amendment and the Massachusetts Constitution, including art. 46, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments, guaranteeing free exercise of religion, and art. 11 of the Amendments, which provides: \u201c[A]ll religious sects and denominations, demeaning themselves peaceably, and as good citizens of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law; and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another shall ever be established by law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Any language suggesting the contrary in <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra, </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">3. <em>Treatment of Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) motion. </em>Callahan\u2019s complaint as amended, asserts three claims against all of the defendants: defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation and on disability, and retaliation for statements in support of rights of others). In addition, Callahan asserts claims against Harper and the conference for breach of contract; against Coppola, Clark, Smith, Staples Smith, and Harper for tortious interference with prospective advantageous relationships; and against the conference for violation of (and \u201cinducing a violation of\u201d) his right to privacy. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (1), arguing all six claims arise from ecclesiastical proceedings over which the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review as a matter of First Amendment law. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Before proceeding to the merits of the defendants\u2019 argument, we must first resolve how the court should treat such a motion in these circumstances. \u201c[A] motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) . . . that is unsupported by affidavit presents a \u2018facial attack\u2019 based solely on the allegations of the complaint, taken as true for purposes of resolving the complaint.\u201d <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505, 516 n.13 (2002), citing <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>46 F.3d 1000, 1002 (10th Cir. 1995). By contrast, a rule 12 (b) (1) motion supported by affidavits places the burden on the plaintiff to prove jurisdictional facts. See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 515-516. See also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 577 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Here, the defendants attached seven exhibits to their motion, including the \u201cInterim Senior Pastor Covenant Contract\u201d between Callahan and the Church<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the committee on the ministry\u2019s decision suspending Callahan, to enable the court to make a factual determination on the merits of Callahan\u2019s claim of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the defendants submitted no affidavits, however, the judge accepted Callahan\u2019s factual allegations as true for purposes of evaluating the motion. See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 516 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">We think the judge construed <em>Hiles </em>too narrowly. Other decisions make it clear that a judge may consider documents and other materials outside the pleadings that are not affidavits when ruling on a rule 12 (b) (1) motion. See, e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 575 (in addition to affidavits, judge considered \u201cdocuments submitted by the parties\u201d); <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 106, 108-109 (1995) (court\u2019s consideration of \u201cmaterials outside the pleadings\u201d did not mandate conversion of rule 12 [b] [1] motion into motion for summary judgment).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 477 (2000) (exhibits attached to complaint may be taken into account when evaluating motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 [b] [6], 365 Mass. 754 [1974]). By supporting the motion with such extra-pleadings material, the defendants contest the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>curacy (rather than the sufficiency) of the jurisdictional facts pleaded by the plaintiff. See <em>Valentin </em>v. <em>Hospital Bella Vista, </em>254 F.3d 358, 363 (1st Cir. 2001). Such a \u201cfactual challenge\u201d to subject matter jurisdiction gives no presumptive weight to the averments in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and requires the court to address the merits of the jurisdictional claim by resolving the factual disputes between the plaintiff and the defendants. See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 516, quoting <em>Valentin </em>v. <em>Hospital Bella Vista, supra. </em>See also <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1003. The judge\u2019s memorandum of decision on the original motion indicates that she considered at least some of the exhibits submitted by the defendants, i.e., documents pertaining to Callahan\u2019s MCAD claim and the written decision of the committee on the ministry. Callahan thus bears the burden of proving jurisdictional facts to support each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">However, even if we were to disregard the exhibits submitted and simply accepted the factual allegations of Callahan\u2019s complaint as true, most of the claims would still fail on constitutional grounds. The complaint makes evident that the events forming the basis of Callahan\u2019s claims, except the defamation claim against Clark, arose from the \u201cdisciplinary review process\u201d initiated, pursued, or conducted by the various defendants against Callahan. \u201cThe First Amendment states that \u2018Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u2019 The principle that this language precludes jurisdiction of civil courts over Church disputes touching on matters of doctrine, canon law, polity, discipline, and ministerial relationships is firmly established in Massachusetts case law\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 579. We examine each claim individually in light of that principle.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">a. <em>G. L. c. 151B. </em>Our decision in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra, </em>disposes of Callahan\u2019s G. L. c. 151B claim against all the defendants. There we held that \u201callowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>jurisdiction of employment discrimination claims [between a minister and his Church] would result in governmental intrusion into an area of religious freedom forbidden by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, citing <em>McClure </em>v. <em>Salvation Army, </em>460 F.2d 553, 560 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 896 (1972). Callahan attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Williams </em>on three grounds. First, he argues that his claim \u201cdo[es] not implicate either [Church] or [conference] policy.\u201d This argument completely overlooks the constitutional basis on which the <em>Williams </em>holding rests. \u201cIt is hard to conceive . . . how a court could inquire into the r\u00e9asons for the defendants\u2019 decisions regarding [Callahan\u2019s] ministry without intruding into matters of the internal management of [the Church and the conference]. Irrespective of whether the defendants\u2019 treatment of [Callahan] and [his] ministry was based on legitimate or illegitimate grounds, [Callahan\u2019s] claims, by their very nature, implicate the defendants\u2019 First Amendment rights. To argue otherwise diminishes the importance of the constitutional separation of church and State.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Callahan further contends that the alleged discrimination and retaliation by lay defendants Coppola, Clark, Smith, and Staples Smith \u201coccurred after he had left the [C]hurch,\u201d thus removing those parties from the realm of First Amendment protection. However, it is not the timing of the defendants\u2019 actions but the ecclesiastical context in which they were taken that controls. See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 514. \u201cIf adjudication of [Callahan\u2019s] claims would implicate matters of ecclesiastical relationships, the courts should not intrude.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra. </em>Finally, Callahan points out that he \u201cis not asking the courts to interpret canonical law or polity of a hierarchical church.\u201d In light of our discussion in Part 2, <em>supra, </em>this argument is unavailing as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">b. <em>Breach of contract. </em>The <em>Williams </em>case also disposes of the breach of contract claim against Harper and the conference. As previously noted, this claim arises not from any purported violation of the written contract between Callahan and the Church, but from the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to follow their own written procedures in carrying out the investigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>disciplinary proceedings against Callahan. The procedures are purportedly set forth in a variety of documents (which Callahan dubs the \u201cMinistry Contract Documents\u201d) identified as the Manual on Ministry, \u201cPastoral Misconduct,\u201d \u201cReviewing Authorized Ministries,\u201d and \u201cGuidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Without addressing whether these publications actually establish a contractual relationship between Callahan and Harper or the conference, \u201c[w]e decline to venture into the realm of interpreting internal guidelines and procedures that have been adopted by the [United Church of Christ]. As discussed above, a church must be free to decide for itself what its obligations to its ministers are, without being subject to court interference.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 581, citing <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Society of St. Columbans, </em>861 F.2d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1988). See <em>Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for the U.S. &amp; Can. </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 713 (1976) (prohibiting inquiry into whether church judicatory followed requisite ecclesiastical procedures in removing bishop).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">c. <em>Tortious interference with potential advantageous relationships. </em>Callahan alleges that Harper, Clark, Coppola, Smith, and Staples Smith knowingly sought to interfere with his attempt to obtain another interim pastor position, and that their interference \u201cwas motivated by a spiteful, malignant purpose unrelated to any legitimate interest of theirs.\u201d Although Callahan does not specify how the defendants allegedly committed this tort, we infer it was by reporting the ecclesiastical complaint to the conference, and in communicating the existence of these \u201ccharges\u201d against Callahan to his potential employers. As Callahan does not identify any prospective employers in his complaint, he failed to meet his burden to prove that such employers were outside the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. We may infer that the prospective employers were other churches within the conference. Publication of the ecclesiastical complaint against Callahan therefore was \u201cinextricably part of the . . . disciplinary process.\u201d <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 514. Alternatively, evaluation of the allegedly malicious interference would \u201crequire the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>court to inquire into the motives of these defendants to determine whether the Church\u2019s disciplinary procedures were properly invoked,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 516, and is thus prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">d. <em>Intentional infliction of emotional distress. </em>Callahan claims (without citing any specific acts) that the conduct of all defendants except the church was \u201cextreme and outrageous and it was foreseeable that such conduct would cause and did in fact cause severe emotional distress.\u201d Consistent with his burden under Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (1), Callahan has made no showing that the defendants were \u201cacting outside the purview of the. . . disciplinary procedures\u201d when they allegedly so acted. See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 518. Accordingly this count must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">e. <em>Violation of right to privacy. </em>Callahan\u2019s complaint includes a count against the conference for \u201cviolation and inducing a violation of [his] right to privacy.\u201d Callahan alleges that the decision by the conference\u2019s committee on the ministry, \u201cwithout any medical or other basis to do so, requires Rev. Callahan, as a condition of future employment, to relinquish all rights of privacy in his communications with, and the findings of, his health care providers.\u201d He further alleges that the conference demanded \u201cfull disclosure of his medical records and publication of same to all prospective employers as a condition of his right to practice ministry.\u201d Callahan claims that these requirements constitute an \u201cunreasonable, substantial and serious\u201d invasion of his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The written decision by the committee states that Callahan may apply for reinstatement of his standing on completing and reporting to the committee the results of complete physiological and psychological examinations. Another condition for reinstatement required Callahan to authorize the Committee to \u201cexamine fully all records of the examinations,\u201d and to discuss them with the health care providers. Once Callahan complied with these conditions, \u201cthe [committee] shall review the results of the examinations and re-evaluate [Callahan\u2019s] readiness to resume the practice of ordained ministry.\u201d The decision also provides that Callahan \u201cshall further authorize that this report may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>disseminated to prospective employers.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We assume that \u201cthis report\u201d refers to the written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985), on which Callahan relies. There we held that the First Amendment would not bar judicial inquiry into an invasion of privacy claim by a minister against clerical superiors who wrongfully induced the plaintiff\u2019s psychiatrist to divulge confidential medical information. See <em>id. </em>at 72-73. Our holding was grounded on the fact that the case did <em>not </em>involve the plaintiffs qualifications to serve as a minister. <em>Id. </em>at 73. In the case at bar, the committee on the ministry was trying to ascertain Callahan\u2019s fitness to continue as a minister, and the court has no jurisdiction to determine what type of information a church may require in order to determine a minister\u2019s fitness. \u201cIt is clear that the assessment of an individual\u2019s qualifications to be a minister, and the appointment and retirement of ministers, are ecclesiastical matters entitled to constitutional protection against judicial or other State interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72-73, citing <em>Kedroff </em>v. <em>St. Nicholas Cathedral, </em>344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 510. The court therefore must dismiss this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">f. <em>Defamation. </em>The defendants originally sought dismissal of the defamation claim pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), because Callahan failed to set out the allegedly defamatory statements verbatim, and to allege the dates of publication and identities of specific defendants. Callahan then amended his complaint to name the defendants and allege their specific instances of defamation, most of which arise from the ecclesiastical complaint, investigation, and committee decision regarding Callahan. Because these allegations derive solely from actions that are \u201cinextricably part of the Church disciplinary process,\u201d <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 514, the claims against Coppola, Clark, Smith, and Staples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Smith collectively, and against the conference, lie outside the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A conversation between Clark and Roshon in or about early July, 1998, however, merits discussion. As previously noted, Callahan alleges that Clark told Roshon \u201che would do everything he could to ensure that Callahan never practiced ministry again.\u201d We do not view this statement as reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Publ. Co., </em>404 Mass. 9, 11 (1989). However, during that same conversation, according to the amended complaint, \u201cClark accused Callahan of having \u2018an inappropriate relationship\u2019 with a seminarian, which Ms. Roshon understood to signify that Callahan, a minister, was engaged in a homosexual relationship with a seminarian under his tutelage.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Clark also told Roshon (although it is unclear when) that Callahan had engaged in \u201cbizarre behavior,\u201d including \u201cslamming a child\u2019s bicycle against a wall,\u201d and that \u201che had breached a confidence involving a moderator and a seminarian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Roshon served as a \u201cforum leader\u201d in the church. Although the complaint does not explain what this position entails, the parties do not assert that Roshon played any role in the disciplinary procedure against Callahan. Moreover, the above-mentioned conversation between Clark and Roshon took place, according to Callahan, \u201cabout a month\u201d before Clark and the other defendants forwarded their ecclesiastical complaint against Callahan to the conference. Cf. <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 513 n.12. At least on the present record, it remains possible that some of Clark\u2019s alleged statements to Roshon fall outside the church disciplinary process. \u201cThe absolute First Amendment protection for statements made by a Church member in an internal church disciplinary proceeding would not apply to statements made or repeated outside that context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Accepting as true the allegation that Clark told Roshon that Callahan had an \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a seminarian, we cannot say Callahan fails to state a claim on which relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>can be granted as against Clark individually.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Compare <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 726-727 (1985). Moreover, the statements that Callahan engaged in bizarre behavior, threw a child\u2019s bicycle against a wall, and breached another\u2019s confidence arguably impute an unfitness for employment as a minister and may be slanderous per se. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Journal Newspaper Co., </em>219 Mass. 486, 487-488 (1914). The judge did not err in refusing to dismiss Callahan\u2019s claim against Clark as to these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court is vacated and the case is remanded for an order of dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as to the claims alleging violation of G. L. c. 15IB, breach of contract, tortious interference with prospective advantageous relationships, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and the claims of defamation against the defendants Robert Coppola, Richard Smith, Susan Staples Smith, and the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ. The defamation claim as to the defendant Robert Clark\u2019s statement that \u201che would do everything he could to ensure that [the plaintiff] never practiced ministry again\u201d also must be dismissed. The order as to the claim of defamation against the defendant Clark based on his other alleged statements to Jean Roshon is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">The judge cited two other reasons for distinguishing the instant case from <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505 (2002): the absence of affidavits from the defendants to support the motion to dismiss, cf. <em>id. </em>at 507, and the fact that \u201cthe events giving rise to Callahan\u2019s claims in this case took place after he resigned as Interim Pastor of [the Church].\u201d Cf. <em>id. </em>at 507-510.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">See Part 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The complaint does not identify what the \u201cChurch Council\u201d is, nor does it specify the \u201chostile treatment\u201d that Callahan allegedly received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Callahan claims other, \u201cyet to be identified\u201d defendants \u201csimilarly have accused Callahan of a homosexual relationship,\u201d and that the chairman of the pastoral search committee (who is not named as a defendant) also told Roshon that Callahan was involved in a \u201cgay relationship\u201d with a seminarian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We will refer to this as the \u201cecclesiastical\u201d complaint, to distinguish it from the civil complaint that Callahan filed against the defendants.

Differentiating between hierarchical and congregational churches was a useful way for the Supreme Court to identify which ecclesiastical authority was entitled to deference. See <em>id. </em>The highest ecclesiastical authority of a hierarchical polity can be identified without resort to a \u201csearching. . . inquiry\u201d to identify whoever is responsible for a particular issue. See <em>id. </em>\u201cIn congregational churches, the highest authority is not so easy to identify. Unavoidably, secular courts are authorized to determine who, under the rules of the church, is entitled to bind it.

But it would be a vain consent and would lead to the total subversion of such religious bodies, if any one aggrieved by one of their decisions could appeal to the secular courts and have them reversed.
