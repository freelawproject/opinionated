A DCPC is, essentially, a land use planning device that in this case was used to establish a rate of development in a Cape Cod municipality in order to preserve certain resources pursuant to a complex legislatively authorized regulatory scheme that we shall describe shortly. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the Barnstable DCPC was invalid under the Act, ordered the entry of a declaration so stating, and allowed summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The judge simultaneously denied the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We conclude that the plaintiffs did not establish that the Barnstable DCPC is invalid under the Act and direct entry of a judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>The background of the case is drawn from the parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts and evidence. On February 22, 2001, the Barnstable town council (town council) voted nine to one to adopt a resolution supporting the town manager\u2019s nomination of the town as a DCPC under the Act. The nomination was made \u201cto address the rate of residential development\u201d in the town, which, if continued at its present growth rate \u201cwould have serious consequences for municipal infrastructure\u201d and would \u201cmove the town further away from its goal of [providing] [ten per cent] affordable housing stock.\u201d The nomination proposed an \u201c[ajffordable [hjousing [implementation and [g]rowth [m]anagement [district\u201d to \u201cschedule\u201d the rate of development in the town. Suggested guidelines for development in the proposed district included an annual residential building permit cap ordinance with a preference for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>affordable housing, and a general ordinance and board of health regulation \u201climiting nitrogen discharged from new residential subdivisions (e.g. shared denitrifying system requirements).\u201d The nomination was submitted with the following supporting documents: the Barnstable zoning map; the Barnstable local comprehensive plan (LCP) which was adopted by the town council in October, 1997, and approved by the defendant Cape Cod commission (commission) in February, 1998; the Barnstable zoning ordinance; the Barnstable general ordinance; the Barnstable affordable housing plan; the Barnstable capital improvements plan; town wide build-out calculations (updated from the 1996 LCP); and a \u201csection 7 smart growth committee report.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The nomination was forwarded to the commission, and the commission voted to accept the nomination for consideration. On April 26, following a public hearing on the proposed Barn-stable DCPC, the commission voted to forward the designation, together with a proposed county ordinance, to the Barnstable county assembly of delegates (assembly)* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for approval. In its decision to recommend designation, the commission published, as required by the Act, guidelines for development in the Barn-stable DCPC (guidelines). The assembly referred the proposed Barnstable DCPC and ordinance back to the commission for restudy, and requested answers to five questions concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>proposed DCPC. On July 18, the commission forwarded an amendment to the proposed ordinance and responses to the assembly\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On July 19, the town council voted to amend its zoning ordinance to include a building cap mechanism. The amendment was proposed as implementing regulations in the event that the proposed Barnstable DCPC was adopted by the assembly. On September 5, the assembly voted to adopt the ordinance designating the Barnstable DCPC (ordinance 01-19). The ordinance then was approved by the board of county commissioners* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, on September 13, was recorded at the Barn-stable county registry of deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">On September 7, the town submitted to the commission its amendment to its zoning ordinance as its proposed regulations implementing the Barnstable DCPC. Following a public hearing, the commission, on September 20, voted to approve the implementing regulations as consistent with the guidelines, and issued a certificate of consistency to that effect. The town\u2019s implementing regulations became effective the following day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The plaintiffs are the Home Builders Association of Cape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Cod, Inc. (Home Builders), a nonprofit association of Cape Cod home builders whose members are actively involved in the construction trade throughout Barnstable County, and Mogan and Company, Incorporated (Mogan), a home builder doing business on Cape Cod. The plaintiffs commenced suit in the Superior Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The plaintiffs initially sought a preliminary injunction, which was denied. The order denying that relief has not been appealed. This proceeding concerns the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment in connection with the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for two declarations: (1) that the Barnstable DCPC is unlawful, under the Act; and (2) that \u201cno entire [tjown within Barnstable County may be considered appropriate for nomination and/or designation as a DCPC under the terms of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Noting that there is \u201cno precedent for a town-wide DCPC under [the Act],\u201d the judge concluded that a DCPC could not be town wide. He also concluded that the Barnstable DCPC did not maintain or preserve a resource or value protected under \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>of the Act. The judge', interpreting the history of this DCPC, understood it to be designed to protect only economic resources, and he decided that the Act requires the existence of a specific economic resource of critical value to the region. He explained, in support of his decision, that the Barnstable DCPC\u2019s \u201cgeneralized concerns about affordable housing and phased development,\u201d concerns shared by most of the towns on Cape Cod, did not satisfy the requirement. The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and ordered that a declaration enter stating that the Barnstable DCPC \u201cis void as being an act in excess of the authority of the [Act].\u201d He simultaneously denied the defendants\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">2. <em>The statutory and regulatory framework. </em>The Act, amended in ways not relevant here, see St. 1990, c. 2, was enacted as a local option law that was approved at a special county election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>held by all fifteen municipalities of Barnstable county.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 21. The Act created the commission, the \u201cregional planning and land use commission for Cape Cod.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3(a). The commission is denominated \u201can agency within the structure of Barnstable county government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It consists of nineteen members, including a representative from each of the county\u2019s fifteen municipalities, who are appointed by each municipality\u2019s board of selectmen;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> one county commissioner for Barnstable County, who is appointed by the board of county commissioners; one Native American and one minority, each appointed by the board of county commissioners; and one minority who is appointed by the Governor. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3(h). Each member must be a resident and a registered voter of one of the towns of Barnstable County. <em>Id. </em>Each member has one vote, except the Governor\u2019s appointee, who votes only in the case of a tie vote. <em>Id. </em>Unless otherwise required, the commission \u201cmay act upon a vote by a simple majority of the voting members present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3(g). The commission\u2019s staff must include an executive director; a specialist in fair, affordable housing; a chief planner; an economic development officer; and a chief regulatory officer, \u201ceach of whom shall have education and experience in land use planning or regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Section 1 of the Act states its purposes and the purposes of the commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201c(a) The region commonly known as Cape Cod . . . possesses unique natural, coastal, scientific, historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, recreational, and other values; there is a regional, state and national interest in protecting, preserving and enhancing these values; and these values are being threatened and may be irreparably damaged by uncoordinated or inappropriate uses of the region\u2019s land and other resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201c(h) In order to protect these values and promote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>public health, safety and general welfare, to maintain and enhance sound local and regional economies, and to ensure balanced economic development, this act creates the Cape Cod commission as the regional planning and land use commission with authority to prepare and oversee the implementation of a regional land-use policy plan for all of Cape Cod, to recommend for designation specific areas of Cape Cod as districts of critical planning concern [DCPCs], and to review and regulate developments of regional impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201c(c) The purpose of the [commission] shall be to further: the conservation and preservation of natural undeveloped areas, wildlife, flora and habitats for endangered species; the preservation of coastal resources including aquaculture; the protection of groundwater, surface water and ocean water quality, as well as the other natural resources of Cape Cod; balanced economic growth; the provision of adequate capital facilities,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] including transportation, water supply, and solid, sanitary and hazardous waste disposal facilities; the coordination of the provision of adequate capital facilities with the achievement of other goals; the development of an adequate supply of fair affordable housing; and the preservation of historical, cultural, archaeological, architectural, and recreational values.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>The commission shall: anticipate, guide and coordinate the rate and location of development with the capital facilities necessary to support such development; review developments which will have impacts beyond their local community and determine the comparative benefits and detriments of those projects and their consistency with the regional policy plan and local comprehensive plans and goals; identify and protect areas whose characteristics make them particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of development; preserve the social diversity of Cape Cod by promoting fair affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income persons; promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the expansion of employment opportunities; and implement a balanced and sustainable economic development strategy for Cape Cod capable of absorbing the effects of seasonal fluctuations in economic activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The Legislature granted the commission \u201cthose powers necessary [and] convenient to carry out the purposes and provisions of this [A]ct.\u201d St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7 4(a). Among those powers, the Legislature enumerated twenty-seven specific powers, including (\u00a7 4[a][ll]) the power \u201cto promulgate and amend rules and regulations as appropriate to carry out its responsibilities\u201d under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4(a)(l)-(27). Among the regulations required to be promulgated by the commission, pursuant to a process specified in the Act, are \u201cregulations concerning the process of designating districts of critical planning concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Act defines a \u201c[district of critical planning concern,\u201d or DCPC, as \u201ca geographic area of Cape Cod identified by the commission as requiring special protection and designated by the assembly of delegates in accordance with the criteria, procedures and requirements set forth in sections ten and eleven.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2(/'). Section 10(4) provides who may make a DCPC designation. Among those authorized to designate a DCPC are the commission and a municipality\u2019s board of selectmen. <em>Id. </em>See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The criteria of a DCPC are specified under \u00a7 10(a) of the Act. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\u201c(a) The commission may propose the designation of certain areas which are of critical value to Barnstable county as districts of critical planning concern that must be preserved and maintained due to one or more of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">\u201c(1) the presence of significant natural, coastal, scientific, cultural, architectural, archaeological, historic, economic or recreational resources or values of regional, state-wide or national significance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">\u201c(2) the presence of substantial areas of sensitive ecological conditions which render the area unsuitable for development; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\u201c(3) the presence or proposed establishment of a major capital public facility or area of public investment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10(a). The Act further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201c[DCPCs] may cover areas located in more than one municipality. Similar resources in different areas of Barn-stable county should be treated similarly unless the commission makes a written finding that there are valid reasons based upon local differences and characteristics to justify treating them differently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The Act then goes on to explain the procedures for the review of nominations of DCPCs, which, in basic terms, require, after notice to the public and public hearings, the acceptance of the commission,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and approval, in the form of an ordinance, by both the assembly and the board of county commissioners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10(6), (/), (i), (/). See also notes 4 &amp; 5, <em>supra. </em>In its decision approving a DCPC, the commission is required to \u201cspecify guidelines for development in the district based upon its findings relating to the critical concerns in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10(/). After the adoption of an ordinance approving a DCPC\u2019s designation, \u201ca municipality whose boundaries include all or part of that district shall propose implementing regulations which are consistent with the guidelines for the development.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 11(d). Once approved by the commissioner, the implementing regulations \u201cshall be incorporated by the municipality into the official by-laws, regulations and maps of the municipality,\u201d and \u201cshall be administered by the municipality as part of its development by-laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 11(e). Except for certain enumerated exceptions not relevant here, \u201c[n]o municipal agency may grant a development permit for a development in a [DCPC] unless the proposed development is consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>. . . implementing regulations . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 11(g).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> All approved DCPCs are required to be recorded, and notice of the designation must be published in various newspapers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10(0-</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">3. <em>Standing. </em>We conclude, contrary to the commission\u2019s argument, that there is a basis to find standing. In declaratory judgment proceedings, standing requirements should be liberally construed. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977). The plaintiffs have shown that, among other consequences, they, and builders, will incur economic detriment by reason of delay in the issuance of building permits and in construction and other costs. The assembly also recognized that the Barnstable DCPC would have economic impact on the building industry. The merits, thus, are appropriate for review now.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">4. <em>The Barnstable DCPC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">a. <em>Validity under \u00a7 10(a) of the Act. </em>Operating on the assumption that the Barnstable DCPC was predicated solely on the \u201cresource\u201d of remaining developable land and its potential to be developed as affordable housing, the plaintiffs claim that the DCPC is invalid because neither the lack of a sufficient supply of affordable housing, nor the effort to preserve developable land in the town, properly are considered \u201ceconomic\u201d resources under \u00a7 10(a)(1) of the Act. This is an issue of difficulty, especially in view of the rapid development of land on Cape Cod, the exponentially expanding residential growth, and the complicated (and controversial) issues concerning commitments, both on Cape Cod and elsewhere, to provide affordable housing. See generally Regnante, Compelling Reasons Why the Legislature Should Resist the Call to Repeal Chapter 40B, 88 Mass. Law Rev. 77 (2003). However, we conclude that the Barnstable DCPC should be upheld because there is sufficient data and evidence to show that the DCPC preserves or maintains a \u201cnatural\u201d resource covered under \u00a7 10(a)(1) of the Act, namely water resources. Under the Act, only one of the factors under subsections 1, 2, and 3 of \u00a7 10(a) need be shown, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>record plainly supports the \u201cnatural\u201d resource factor. This being the case, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 contentions concerning \u201ceconomic\u201d resources under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The judge incorrectly stated that \u201c[a]ll agree [that the Barn-stable] DCPC was not founded on natural, coastal, scientific . . . resources or values.\u201d In its motion for summary judgment, the commission expressly argued: \u201cThe Barnstable DCPC also preserves and maintains natural, coastal, and recreational resources, consistent with [\u00a7] 10(a)(1) of the Act.\u201d The commission went on to explain that the Barnstable DCPC was nominated and designated to preserve and maintain the sole source aquifer, shared by all of the communities on the Cape, and the town\u2019s coastal embayments, natural resources threatened by development. Even the plaintiffs, in the their reply to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, understood that the issue was a live one: \u201cThe Commission devotes a good portion of its [b]rief to assert that the [t]awn\u2019s ground water is the natural resource the DCPC designation seeks to protect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In addition, in its appellate brief, Home Builders contradicts its statement that the defendants \u201chave essentially dropped the pretense that the DCPC is based upon the presence of one of the natural resources specified in [\u00a7] 10(a)(1),\u201d by its later statement that the defendants, in support of the Barnstable DCPC, \u201ccite natural resources, but their pertinence seems limited to groundwater.\u201d Mogan concedes that the ordinance designating the Barnstable DCPC \u201cdoes proceed lengthily with pronouncements about natural resources,\u201d but argues that the pertinence is \u201cobscure,\u201d and that the <em>nomination </em>failed to mention this resource. As to the former issue, the \u201cpertinence\u201d of the \u201cpronouncements\u201d is hardly relevant to a claim of waiver. As to the latter issue, Mogan reads the nomination form too narrowly, and in isolation from its supporting documents. Although the town\u2019s responses contained in the form could have been more detailed, the form is but one document in a lengthy, open, comprehensive process governed by detailed statutory and regulatory provisions; it is the paper, a simplified form drafted by the commission, by which this comprehensive process commences. See Barnstable County Ordinance 90-15, \u00a7 4. That lengthy process invites scrutiny from other entities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>including the commission, whose members are required by the Act to \u201chave education and experience in land use planning or regulation,\u201d St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7 <em>3(h), </em>the assembly, the board of commissioners, and the public, thereby ensuring evolution from the original form.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">That being said, however, the nomination form clearly states, and the commission members could not have overlooked, the identification of wastewater issues as a specific municipal infrastructure concern and, thus, an important reason for the proposed DCPC. In the nomination form, the town identified an ongoing wastewater management plan as relating to the proposed DCPC, and identified as a guideline for development (of the proposed DCPC) a general ordinance and a board of health regulation \u201climiting nitrogen discharged from new residential subdivisions (e.g. shared denitrifying system requirements).\u201d In addition, in the supporting documents to the nomination form, wastewater issues, as infrastructure improvements needed to protect the water supply and waterways, are thoroughly discussed in the LCP, specifically, in \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.2, 4.4, and 4.5, and in the \u00a7 7 smart growth committee report. The \u00a7 7 smart growth committee was appointed specifically to explore and make recommendations on the town\u2019s wastewater. facilities plan, and in \u201cmanaging growth and control[ling] nitrogen loading in [the town\u2019s] aquifers, [b]ays, and embayments and other waterways.\u201d The committee\u2019s report discusses, among other concerns, \u201cthe need to maintain good water quality,\u201d and the need to remediate \u201cwater quality in [coastal] embayments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the Barnstable DCPC is invalid under the Act. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Edgartown, </em>425 Mass. 117, 124 (1997); <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 233 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973). The burden is a heavy one. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Chilmark, </em>380 Mass. 246, 256 (1980). In this respect the plaintiffs fail fully to appreciate the comprehensive process established by the Legislature for the nomination and designation of a DCPC. Significant in this process is the fact that both the assembly and the board of county commissioners, acting in a <em>legislative </em>capacity, approved the Barnstable DCPC. We do not second guess legislative decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>that have record support unless it is shown, with relative certainty, that the legislative decision is contrary to the Constitution, the enabling act, or a statute. <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>supra; <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn. </em>v. <em>City Council of Cambridge, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 559, 566 (2002); <em>National Amusements, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 305, 309 (1990), and cases cited. This is so because the local legislative body is deemed to understand the local conditions and can exercise its police power to the widest possible extent consistent with the law. See <em>Fitzsimonds </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chatham, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 57 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden. A principal purpose supporting the designation of the Barnstable DCPC is the \u201cpreservation] and maint[enance]\u201d of significant water resources, a \u201cnatural\u201d resource under \u00a7 10(a)(1) of the Act. This finding is entitled to deference, and the further legislative findings pertaining to water resources, too lengthy to be repeated or summarized here, are detailed and comprehensive. They are by no means \u201cconclusory\u201d and lacking in \u201cexplanation,\u201d words used by the plaintiffs to attempt to circumvent their potency.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">What emerges from the findings is that the Barnstable DCPC was designated, among other reasons, to protect the local and regional water supply, the sole source aquifer, from contamination occurring from excessive development (specifically, from associated nitrogen contamination primarily caused by septic systems), and also to protect coastal embayments from nitrogen contamination, which threatens to impact adversely local and regional shellfishing in the embayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">These legislative findings have a foundation in fact and data. United States census figures support the findings concerning the population and growth rate in Barnstable. A \u201cbuildout update\u201d report by the Barnstable planning division sets forth the numbers concerning potentially buildable lots, units, and sanitary systems. As for the issues of protecting the public and regional water supply, and coastal embayments, support for protecting these natural resources can be found in the LCP, the July 3, 2001 updated LCP, the \u00a7 7 smart growth committee report, and the commission\u2019s regional policy plan (RPP). As to the significance of both the sole source aquifer and Barnstable\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>coastal embayments in both Barnstable and the region, the LCP alone makes that significance clear (but the RPP also supports the significance of these resources on the regional level).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">With respect to the water supply and the sole source aquifer, the LCP explains that \u201c[gjroundwater is a vital natural resource \u2014 it is the only source of drinking water. Groundwater flows through layers of saturated sands and gravels to form an extensive \u2018unconfined aquifer\u2019 throughout the Cape. Public wells draw water from wide areas known as Zones of Contribution.\u201d The entire town of Barnstable \u201clies atop a sole source aquifer and approximately 27% of the land area lies within one or more zones of contribution to Barnstable\u2019s 31 public water supply wells.\u201d Thus, \u201c[wjater supply is an issue which crosses town boundaries and should be eventually addressed on a regional basis.\u201d The LCP explains that \u201c[t]here is vulnerability to contamination because of the extensive areas which contribute to public wells, the coarse grained soils which drain rapidly, and because of the low lying nature of the land, with little depth to groundwater.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cWith growth and development, contamination of ground and surface waters becomes of increasing concern.\u201d One of the principal sources of contamination is nitrogen from septic systems, and certain areas in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>town are \u201cexperiencing effects of contamination, probably from nutrients in septic system effluent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Turning to coastal embayments, the LCP explains that \u201c[s]hellfish are abundant in the shallow, sheltered coastal embayments in Barnstable. Clams, both soft-shelled and hard-shelled, scallops and oysters can be found in the saltwater embayments along the shore.- Cotuit oysters have been cultivated since the mid-19th century [and] are internationally renown[ed] delicacies. There are approximately 6,178 acres of shellfish beds. Shellfish resources are the basis of a traditional economic pursuit and a recreational pastime, and are special features of local menus. Shellfish resources require pristine water quality conditions and are the canaries of water quality. In recent years contamination of coastal waters has caused a decline in harvests; in 1991, a total of 1,093 acres of shellfish beds were closed to harvesting because of contamination.\u201d The LCP further explains that \u201c[c]ontamination of . . . salt water embayments will have a devastating impact on the capability of the coastal resources to serve as a spawning ground and nursery for both freshwater and saltwater species.\u201d The LCP explains that measures taken to control nitrogen levels in the public water supplies \u201cmay not be stringent enough to protect water quality in coastal embayments which are extremely sensitive to nitrogen in very low concentrations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Claims made by the plaintiffs that it is extremely doubtful that residential construction will exacerbate existing nitrate loading, and .that- the newer provisions of Title V (regulating septic systems) will prevent new construction from adding excess nitrogen to the groundwater, are points of disagreement naturally expected in the process of legislative deliberation. As to the first point, the commission concluded to the contrary, stating that further development of the area would \u201cexacerbate[] the need for significant infrastructure improvements,\u201d including nitrogen management. As to the second point, the LCP identifies as a problem the fact that \u201cTitle 5 systems do not remove nitrogen that is traveling in groundwater, from the center of the town to the shore.\u201d What is key, and what the plaintiffs overlook, is that there was substantial planning and study behind the nomination of the Barnstable DCPC, and that its purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>protecting a natural resource, water resources, of town and regional significance is supported in the record, rendering the legislative action by the assembly and board of county commissioners consistent with the purposes of the Act. The fact that the DCPC, in its efforts to preserve water quality, also justifiably preserves some land for affordable housing does not negate its validity. Summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">b. <em>Boundaries of a DCPC. </em>The judge\u2019s conclusion that a DCPC, as matter of law, cannot be town wide is erroneous and may not constitute a basis for granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. There is nothing in the Act that states or implies that a DCPC cannot be town wide. The definition of a DCPC speaks to \u201ca geographic area . . . requiring special protection.\u201d St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7 <em>2(f). </em>If a municipality can demonstrate that the land within its boundaries requires that special protection, as the town did here, then a town-wide boundary for a DCPC is appropriate. Section 10(c) of the Act, discussed above, supports this conclusion, recognizing that resources shared by different communities may be treated differently in one area if the commission \u201cmakes a written finding that there are valid reasons based upon local differences and characteristics to justify treating them differently.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision to accept the Barnstable DCPC certainly includes those contemplated findings, explaining that the difference in treatment is due to (in simplified terms) the unique groundwater system and soils in Barnstable; the critical water supply and coastal embayments; and the population density, growth, and the existing and potential residential development in the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">c. <em>Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment. </em>The plaintiffs have conceded that \u201cground water is a natural resource within the meaning of [\u00a7] 10(a)(1)\u201d of the Act. Their position was that there was no basis on this ground of the Barnstable DCPC, to designate the DCPC\u2019s borders town wide. For the reasons explained, there was a supported basis. The commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">5. The order allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and the declaration entered in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, are vacated. The order denying the commission\u2019s motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>mary judgment is reversed. The commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment is allowed.
