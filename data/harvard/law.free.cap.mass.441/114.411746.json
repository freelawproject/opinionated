L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. In affirming the conviction, the Appeals Court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments that there was insufficient evidence of his diminished ability to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>safely, and that he was prejudiced by a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction given to the jury in conjunction with remarks made by the prosecutor in his closing argument that referred to the defendant\u2019s failure to produce the missing witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (2003). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review solely to review the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the missing witness instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"ApJ\">To prove its case, the Commonwealth called three police officers to testify: the arresting officer; the officer who found and seized, during an inventory search of the vehicle the defendant had been operating, an open forty-ounce bottle of beer; and the desk officer who observed the defendant during booking. The basis for the defendant\u2019s arrest, fully supported by the testimony of the arresting officer, is summarized by the Appeals Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM3Q\">\u201cThe defendant, seen speeding through a residential neighborhood in Danvers, did not immediately respond to the blue lights of the pursuing patrol car, but instead continued another 200 yards or so along the road before turning onto an entrance ramp to a limited access highway, veering off the ramp, and finally stopping. The defendant\u2019s eyes were red and watery, his breath carried a strong odor of liquor, and he appeared unsteady as he walked. He failed three sobriety tests \u2014 he was unable to recite the alphabet, could not walk heel to toe in a straight line, and touched the bridge of his nose when asked to touch the tip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEL\"><em>Id. </em>During the defendant\u2019s booking, the desk officer observed that the defendant was unsteady on his feet, swayed from side to side, and had a strong odor of liquor on his breath.</p>\n<p id=\"ARI\">The only factual issue at trial was whether the defendant was operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, that is, whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>[his] <em>ability </em>to operate a motor vehicle safely\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 173 (1985). The defendant testified that before his arrest, he and his friend, Linda Doane, went to the apartment of another friend, Richard Adrien. There, the defendant and Doane shared a twelve-ounce bottle of beer, and then the three walked to a nearby bar. They stayed at the bar a little over one hour, during which the defendant drank two beers and played pool. The three walked back to Adrien\u2019s apartment. The defendant drove Doane home, returned to Adrien\u2019s apartment for a short time, and then left for his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendant testified that he was unaware that a police cruiser was behind him until he was heading up the ramp to the highway. The defendant had difficulty getting out of the vehicle he had been driving (which was very low to the ground) due, he said, to a long-standing back problem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He told the arresting police officer that he had consumed two beers. The defendant claimed that he could not recite the alphabet because he had dropped out of school in the ninth grade and did not know the alphabet. The defendant testified that he believed that he had successfully touched the tip of his nose when asked to do so by the police officer. The defendant indicated that he had \u201calmost [fallen] over\u201d trying to walk heel to toe in a straight line \u201cbecause of [his] back problem.\u201d Because of poor lighting and the flashing blue and red police lights, the defendant also claimed he was unable to see the ground. The defendant stated that he had never seen a forty-ounce bottle of beer that was found in the vehicle and suggested that the bottle belonged to his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Adrien also testified, generally corroborating the defendant\u2019s testimony about his activities, whom the defendant had been with, and what the defendant had to drink before leaving Adrien\u2019s apartment. Adrien stated that \u201csometimes\u201d the defendant\u2019s back would \u201cact[] up,\u201d but that, in the hour or so before the defendant\u2019s arrest, the defendant had had no trouble walking. Adrien testified that they had left the bar at about 9:30 p.m., and that it was approximately 10 or 10:30 p.m. when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the defendant left Adrien\u2019s apartment to go home (after having driven Doane home earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"A9g\">During the defendant\u2019s cross-examination, the defendant testifled that Doane was a \u201cgood friend\u201d whom he had known for six years. When asked by the prosecutor about her whereabouts, the defendant stated that Doane was working and could not \u201cget the time off from work.\u201d After the defense rested, the prosecutor sought a missing witness instruction, arguing that Doane\u2019s absence was not excusable. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aye\">\u201cI had summonsed her, my client tells me that she has a daughter and she had to work today and she was finally off welfare and she just was afraid that, you know, she didn\u2019t want to miss work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2V\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel added that Doane\u2019s testimony would be \u201ccumulative\u201d and \u201cwould not be of any substance.\u201d The prosecutor disagreed and the judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ang\">\u201cThe problem is that he took that stand which he has an absolute right to do, he raised the issue of this other person and there\u2019s a period of time where he was with her that\u2019s missing and the best person to fill that in, in terms of corroborating what his testimony was, was her and she\u2019s not here. There\u2019s been no showing as to why she\u2019s unavailable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAM\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge agreed to give a missing witness instruction. The prosecutor remarked in his closing argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-28\">\u201cNow, there\u2019s also Ms. Doane, Linda Doane, who was actually with the defendant longer than Mr. Adrien was. However she wasn\u2019t here yesterday. She wasn\u2019t here to testify about what she saw. And the judge will tell you what you can do with that information if you want, with the fact that she wasn\u2019t here, okay, so listen to him when he instructs you on everything, but on that in particular.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-30\">The judge gave the jury a missing witness instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-31\">1. The general principles concerning a missing witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>instruction are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 150-151 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cWhere a defendant has knowledge of an available witness whose general disposition toward the defendant is friendly, or at least not hostile, and who could be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the defendant\u2019s case, but the defendant, without explanation, fails to call that witness, the jury may permissibly infer that that witness would have given testimony detrimental to the defendant\u2019s case. . . . The strength of the case against the defendant, whether the defendant would be expected to call the witness if the defendant were innocent, and the importance of the witness\u2019s likely testimony to the defense are important considerations in determining whether an adverse inference based on the defendant\u2019s failure to call a certain witness is appropriate. . . . Where a witness\u2019s testimony would have been merely cumulative or unimportant, there is no basis for such an inference. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cWhether the adverse inference is permissible depends on the facts of each case . . . and whether to give a missing witness instruction is a decision that must be made on a case-by-case basis, in the discretion of the trial judge. That decision will be overturned on appeal only if it was \u2018manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The defendant argues that there was an insufficient foundatian to warrant the instruction. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 802 (2001), the Appeals Court summarized the basis for giving the instruction (as that basis has been formulated by our appellate decisions) in the following terms: \u201cthe judge is to consider four factors: (1) whether the case against the defendant is strong and whether, faced with the evidence, the defendant would be likely to call the missing witness if innocent; (2) whether the evidence to be given by the missing witness is important, central to the case, or just collateral or cumulative; (3) whether the party who fails to call the witness has superior knowledge of the whereabouts of the witness; and (4) whether the party has a \u2018plausible reason\u2019 for not producing the witness\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-23\">The judge properly gave the instruction. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>wealth\u2019s case by itself was strong, and the defendant\u2019s evidence contained elements that strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s case. For instance, the defendant admitted that he had consumed two beers and testified that his back condition had not prevented him from working on the day of arrest on construction, performing work that involved bending and stretching. Adrien testified that the defendant\u2019s back would only \u201csometimes\u201d \u201cact[] up,\u201d and that, in the hour or so before the defendant\u2019s arrest, he observed that the defendant had had no trouble walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The second consideration stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alves, supra, </em>was also met. While some of Doane\u2019s testimony would likely have been cumulative of Adrien\u2019s testimony, the defendant overlooks the significance of her testimony concerning whether he had been drinking in the vehicle (particularly in light of the open forty-ounce bottle of beer), and her observations of the defendant\u2019s condition while he drove her home. While both Adrien and Doane had observed his condition walking to and from the bar, Doane was the only witness who had been with the defendant during the drive to her home, and thus the only witness who could testify concerning his ability to operate a vehicle at that time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. 9, 13 (1986) (concluding that prosecutorial comment on missing witness was permissible in prosecution for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor where witness may have been able to corroborate defendant\u2019s testimony concerning amount of alcohol defendant had consumed). The prospect that Doane\u2019s testimony may have been cumulative of the defendant\u2019s testimony in some respects overlooks the importance of the defendant\u2019s credibility, which he placed squarely at issue by taking the stand. See <em>id. </em>at 12. His assertion that Doane\u2019s testimony would have been discredited because she was his girl friend is not supported. The judge and jury heard only that Doane was the defendant\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d not his girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">With respect to the last two considerations in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alves, supra, </em>the Appeals Court correctly noted that \u201c[t]he fact that the Commonwealth could have called Doane \u2018does not render the adverse inference impermissible, because the defendant was more closely acquainted with [her] and would \u201cbe naturally expected to call\u201d [Doane] in fight of the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra </em>at 912, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 151. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 423, 426 n.4 (1999). While the judge may not have had \u201creason to disbelieve\u201d the excuse articulated by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel for Doane\u2019s absence, he did not have any reason, or corroborative evidence, to believe the excuse either. The judge could properly reject, as he implicitly did, the defendant\u2019s reason for Doane\u2019s nonproduction. We note that the defendant testified, so we do not have a situation where the jury are permitted to reach the inference in the absence of testimony from the defendant. The instruction given by the judge (which was patterned on Instruction 4.04 Model Jury Instructions for use in the District Court [2000]) carefully pointed out to the jury that an inference about a missing witness is permissible, not required, and would be warranted only if they independently found the existence of all four considerations set forth in the <em>Alves </em>case. The judge also appears to have appreciated that \u201c[t]his is a delicate area, requiring caution,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 287 (1990). We emphasize again that judges should be circumspect in allowing requests to give the instruction and should do so only when all foundation requirements are clearly met. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in the instruction, and the prosecutor properly commented (without objection) in closing argument on Doane\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"Afx\">2. Unsupported by authority, the defendant argues that his Federal and State constitutional rights were violated by the instruction and the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. The defendant points out that he had summonsed Doane and claims that requiring him to seek a continuance in order to avoid the instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof and denied him his right to compulsory process. These claims have no merit because, as the Appeals Court explained, \u201c[t]he strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case is also the answer to the defendant\u2019s constitutional concern, for it seems to have been decided at an early date that the right of a defendant to refrain from calling conceivably exculpatory witnesses free from adverse inference \u2018is not within the protection of the Constitution\u2019 where, as here, the Commonwealth has presented a strong case against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra </em>at 913, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finnerty, </em>148 Mass. 162, 167 (1889).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A31\">We consider only the issues raised before the Appeals Court, and do not consider the new issues belatedly raised by the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel in her supplemental brief. In particular, we do not consider whether the missing witness doctrine should be abolished or modified in any respect. The latter issue was not raised in the trial court nor briefed before the Appeals Court. The issue is unpreserved and has been made unavailable for comment by other interested parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The defendant\u2019s medical records documenting a prior back injury were admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The fact that the defendant summonsed Doane carries little weight when he failed to move for a Ending of contempt or for a warrant to compel her appearance when she did not appear to testify. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6; Mass. R. Crim. R 17 (e), 378 Mass. 885 (1979). That no such requests were made undermines the defendant\u2019s objection to the missing witness instruction as well as his claims of constitutional violations. Further, at no time was the defendant \u201crequired]\u201d to seek a continuance, although he certainly could have done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
