L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, proof of which is an essential element of. this felony offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The language has been variously construed by lower courts in the Commonwealth, but not by this court. The question is important because its answer determines the criminal penalties to which the defendant may be subjected. If \u201cthe value of the property so destroyed or injured\u201d is less than $250, the defendant may be convicted of a misdemeanor only, which carries substantially lower penalties than a felony conviction under the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case a jury in the District Court convicted the defendant of the felony of malicious destruction of property on evidence that the defendant had punched a hole the size of a light switch plate in a kitchen wall of a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 93 (2003). The Appeals Court concluded that, to determine the \u201cvalue of the property\u201d damaged, the jury should consider the value of the house, of which the wall was \u201cinextricably integrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Where only a portion of property has been damaged, it is possible to consider three definitions for the \u201cvalue of property\u201d: the fair market value of the whole property (here the house) (as the Commonwealth urges); the fair market value of so much of the property as is destroyed or injured (here the wall) (as the defendant urges); or the pecuniary loss (here measured by the reasonable cost of repair) (as most other States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>do). We conclude, consistent with our duty to construe ambiguous terms in light of the Legislature\u2019s probable intent, that where damage is caused to a portion of the property as a whole and may be replaced or repaired, the value of the property is to be measured by the pecuniary loss, in this case the reasonable cost of repair necessitated by the malicious conduct. Because the Commonwealth presented no evidence on this point, the defendant\u2019s conviction of the felony offense of malicious destruction of property must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 20, 2000, the defendant was tried in Brockton District Court on one count of assault and battery in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, one count of malicious destruction of property over $250 in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127 (felony), and two counts of malicious destruction of property under $250 in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127 (misdemeanor). After a one-day jury trial, at which the Commonwealth presented the testimony of one witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and documentary evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant was acquitted of the assault and battery charge and convicted of the three remaining charges of malicious destruction of property. The defendant appealed from each of those convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Reviewing the record in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), we recite the facts that a reasonable jury could have found. On August 4, 1999, the witness was at her mother\u2019s house with the defendant and their one year old daughter. While the defendant and the witness were sitting outside, the telephone rang. The witness, with the defendant following, walked through the kitchen and into the living room to answer the telephone, which had a caller identification display. The witness spoke for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>some minutes to the caller, a man whom the witness had met previously. During and after the conversation, the defendant asked her to identify the caller. The witness testified that she initially lied to the defendant regarding the caller\u2019s identity, but eventually told him that it was another man.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">An argument ensued. As the exchange became heated, the 1 defendant ripped the kitchen telephone from the wall and broke it. He then punched a hole in the wall.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He picked up a cordless telephone, which was in the living room, and broke it by throwing it on the floor. He ripped a pager from the witness\u2019s shirt, threw it to the ground, and broke it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The witness testified that the kitchen telephone was worth approximately twenty dollars, the living room telephone was worth approximately sixty dollars, and the pager was a gift. The Commonwealth offered no evidence concerning the value of the damaged kitchen wall or of the house itself, or of the cost to repair the damaged wall. The defendant moved unsuccessfully for required findings of not guilty based on insufficient evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Concerning the damage to the wall, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201c[T]he value of the property, not the value of the damage, but the value of the property, was [it] in excess of $250[?] . . . You\u2019re looking at the value of the wall, not the alleged damage, the hole in it, was the item damaged worth over $250[?] If you find the first three elements [of malicious destruction of property] are proven, then you go on to determine whether or not it was over $250 for that particular charge. . . . [T]he allegation that there was damage to a phone, damage to a pager, the allegation [as to those] is under $250, so you don\u2019t have to make a determination with regard to amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth objected to the judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>2. <em>Malicious destruction of property. </em>The element of the offense of malicious destruction of property that distinguishes a misdemeanor from a felony is the \u201cvalue of the property so destroyed or injured.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To convict a defendant of a felony, a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the property damaged exceeds $250. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>434 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2001) (\u201cvalue in excess of $250 must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The statute does not define the term \u201cthe value of the property,\u201d which raises particular problems where, as here, the property is but partially damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As we discuss more fully below, amendments to the statute in 1978 expanded personal property covered by the statute to encompass real property, i.e., \u201cdwelling house\u201d or \u201cbuilding.\u201d See St. 1978, c. 544 (1978 act). The question we must therefore resolve is whether, when the Legislature amended G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, it intended that every \u201cinjury\u201d to a dwelling house or building, no matter how minimal (breaking a small pane of glass, scratching a wall) would support a felony conviction resulting in up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of up to three times the value of the building, when the cost of repair or replacement might be substantially less than $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language ... to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Accord <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 719-720 (2002). Where the statutory language is not conclusive, we may \u201cturn to extrinsic sources, including the legislative history and other statutes, for assistance in our interpretation.\u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 435 (2002), citing <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>433 Mass. 568, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>570-571 &amp; nn.6-8 (2001) (other statutes), and <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>De-Veau, </em>384 Mass. 676, 680 (1981) (legislative history). If it is a criminal statute we interpret, the rule of lenity requires that the defendant be given the benefit of the ambiguity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Before turning to the 1978 act, we examine the legislative history of crimes against property in Massachusetts, paying particular attention to the evolution of the statutory offenses pertaining to buildings. Chapter 266 of the General Laws, \u201ccrimes against property,\u201d contains more than one hundred separate offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 127, is a catchall section concerning the malicious or wanton injury to property not otherwise specified in the statute. The offense codified in \u00a7 127 is one of long standing, appearing first in the Revised Statutes of 1836.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> R.S. (1836), c. 126, \u00a7 39. As initially enacted, the provision covered only personal property and made no distinction between felony and misdemeanor offenses based on the value of that property. <em>Id. </em>The latter distinction first appeared ten years later: a misdemeanor conviction obtained where the \u201cvalue\u201d of personal property destroyed did not \u201cexceed the sum of fifteen dollars.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> St. 1846, c. 52, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In 1862, the Legislature enacted a separate statute prohibiting the \u201cinjury\u201d of a \u201cdwelling-house or other building.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> St. 1862, c. 160. From 1836 until 1978, the felony and misdemeanor crimes of injury to personal property were codified at G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, while the misdemeanor crime of injury to buildings was codified at G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 104. There was no provision for the felony crime of injury to a building: a felony conviction was warranted only if a defendant violated one of the many separate offenses enumerated in G. L. c. 266. That changed in 1978, when the Legislature amended G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, to encompass real property, i.e., \u201cdwelling house\u201d and \u201cbuildings.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> St. 1978, c. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The 1978 act was enacted in the wake of a lengthy report by the Legislative Research Council on the prevention and punishment of vandalism in the Commonwealth. See 1976 House Doc. No. 4951 (report).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The report noted the escalating cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>vandalism in Massachusetts and nationwide.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 8. The report also noted \u201cdissatisfaction with the judicial disposition of cases involving vandalism\u201d in Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 11. It described various efforts to combat vandalism, <em>id. </em>at 9, and canvassed the Massachusetts statutory provisions relating to vandalism and other property damage, noting that G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 104, the broadest of the statutory provisions concerning \u201cmalicious mischief\u201d to buildings, imposed only a relatively minimal penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 48. The report examined in detail the gradation in real property offenses between felonies and misdemeanors found in the Model Penal Code and in numerous State statutes of \u201ccriminal mischief.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 34-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The 1978 act simply extended the scope of the existing statute to encompass real property. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that the Legislature intended that <em>any </em>damage (vandalism) to a building, however minuscule, be prosecuted as a felony. To the contrary, the fact that the Legislature folded \u201cdwelling house[s]\u201d and \u201cbuilding[sj\u201d into the catchall provision of \u00a7 127 suggests the Legislature\u2019s intention that a grading approach be utilized for considering whether to charge a misdemeanor or a felony for damage to real property. This was, after all, the practice across the United States as described in the report of the Legislative Research Council. <em>Id. </em>at 34-47. Thus we are unable to conclude that the 1978 act intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>exclude damage to real property from such grading.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Breznick, </em>134 Vt. 261, 266 (1976) (\u201cFrom the literal wording of the statute [\u2018damage to property of any value not exceeding $250.00\u2019] it is ambiguous whether the word \u2018value\u2019 refers to the property damaged or to the damage itself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">We must therefore construe statutory terms to effectuate the legislative purpose as we determine it. See <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). The report, which appears to have triggered the 1978 act, strongly suggested that Massachusetts was out of step with the majority of other States, which had enacted some type of grading of penalties depending on the seriousness of the \u201cvandalism\u201d to real property that did not amount to total destruction of the property. See report at 34-47. However, nothing in the report suggests that minor property damage should be met with Draconian punishment. Nor is there any indication that the Legislature intended that the most minimal damage to real property, perhaps costing a few dollars to repair, would subject a defendant to a felony conviction with attendant severe punishment of up to ten years or a substantial fine. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, 3 </em>Cush. 558, 559-560 (1849) (malicious destruction statute requires heightened level of malice lest \u201ca person ... be punished criminally, and with great severity,\u201d \u201chowever trifling the injury might be\u201d). In addition, the Legislature clearly was aware, in 1978, that the total value of almost any \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201cdwelling house\u201d then exceeded $250. Had the Legislature meant \u201cvalue\u201d under the 1978 act to include the total value of any real property that suffered even minor damage, it would have said so explicitly, rather than adopting an amendment containing a misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>provision that, as pertains to real property, would be virtually meaningless.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We thus reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the value at issue is the value of the whole property. In this regard we find persuasive the reasoning of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. That court also rejected an interpretation of its malicious destruction statute, a statute similar to ours, that would have interpreted the \u201cvalue\u201d of the property to mean the value of the entire property, damaged and undamaged parts alike.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 A.2d 336, 341 (D.C. 1975), quoting D.C. Code \u00a7 22-403 (1973). There, the defendant was charged with a felony offense of destruction of property for creating a hole in the roof of a liquor store. The court noted that \u201cthe larger whole in this case is the liquor store\u201d and \u201c[w]e readily could take notice of the fact that the \u2018store\u2019 referred to . . . has a value exceeding $200,\u201d the threshold amount for a felony offense. <em>Id. </em>at 341-342. The court rejected that the statute mandated a felony conviction in any instance where the damaged property as a whole is valued at over $200. <em>Id. </em>at 342. The court reasoned, and we agree, that it could not be the legislative intent to \u201ccreate the rule that, for example, causing even fifty cents\u2019 damage to part of an object having an overall value greater than [$250] would constitute a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Here, the defendant argues that the property to be valued is the wall, and not the entire house.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This argument, reducing the property injured to some smaller segment thereof, was also considered and rejected by the District of Columbia court. <em>Id. </em>at 342. \u201cNeither, in our view, would it be logical to interpret the statute as requiring the cataloging in an indictment of each component part which is damaged or destroyed. In this case, for example, such an approach would necessitate placing a value on multiple items such as roofing paper, pieces of wood, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such a segmented approach would undermine the salutary goal of consistency in prosecutions and convictions, especially because in the case of a building, the part of the property to be valued could be described either expansively or narrowly. For example, one might argue that the partially damaged property in this case is the kitchen, and not just a wall of the kitchen. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>7 Allen 577, 578 (1863) (rejecting that injury to panel of omnibus should be considered separately because \u201cthe omnibus is alleged to be injured by the breaking of the panel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">As the District of Columbia court noted, \u201c[a] more sensible approach is wholly consistent with the statute.\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 342. We agree, and conclude that the correct standard in a case such as this is the pecuniary loss: \u201cWhere repairable damage or destruction is caused to a portion or portions of a greater whole, the value of the property damaged or destroyed is to be measured by the reasonable cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the repairs necessitated by the malicious conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Our survey of other jurisdictions confirms our conclusion. Although other States employ a variety of statutory terms to distinguish felony and misdemeanor destruction of property offenses, no jurisdiction determines whether a criminal mischief or destruction of property offense is a misdemeanor or a felony on the basis of the value of the property determined as a whole. Most jurisdictions differentiate the offense level by a discemable monetary amount, such as \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d used in the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 811 (Michie 2001); Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-1-2 (Burns Supp. 2003); Ky. Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Stat.

Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 28.03 (West Supp. 2004); Utah Code Aral. \u00a7 76-6-106 (LexisNexis Supp. 2003), or other statuphrases with essentially the same meaning, see, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-38-204 (Michie 1997) (\u201camount of actual damage\u201d); Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 716.4 (West 2003) (\u201ccost of replacing, repairing, or restoring the property so damaged\u201d); Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 6-301 (LexisNexis 2002) (\u201ccauses damage of at least $500\u201d); Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 609.595 (West Supp. 2004) (reduction in \u201cthe value of the property [as] measured by the cost of repair and replacement\u201d); Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 569.100 (West 1999) (\u201cdamages property to an extent exceeding seven hundred and fifty dollars\u201d); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2909.11 (West 1997) (\u201cproperty value or an amount of physical harm\u201d). Those few jurisdictions that, like Massachusetts, have statutory language referring to the \u201cvalue\u201d of the property in determining whether the offense is a misdemeanor or felony (Mississippi, Vermont, and the District of Columbia) also differentiate between felony and misdemeanor offenses on the basis of repair or replacement costs. Mississippi\u2019s statute, the most similar to ours,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> further defines value as \u201cthe cost of repair or replacement of the property damaged or destroyed.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-17-67 (5) (Supp. 2003). See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17A, \u00a7 805 (West Supp. 2003) (definition in aggravated criminal mischief statute that defendant is guilty if he \u201c[djamages or destroys property of another in an amount exceeding $2,000 in value\u201d refers to \u201cthe cost of repair\u201d of damaged property). Vermont and the District of Columbia, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>have reached the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sion, but through judicial interpretation of the statutory language. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 A.2d 336 (D.C. 1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breznick, </em>134 Vt. 261 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Applying the above statutory interpretation of \u201cvalue\u201d in this case, we reverse the felony conviction of malicious destruction of property, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commonwealth did not introduce any evidence as to the reasonable cost to repair the hole in the wall, and, without such evidence, the Commonwealth has failed to prove an essential element of the felony offense of malicious destruction of property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beale, 434 </em>Mass. 1024, 1025 (2001). Because the element that distinguishes the felony offense of malicious destruction of property from its misdemeanor counterpart is \u201cthe value of the property,\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, and the Commonwealth has proved all other elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>a finding of guilty of the lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property under $250 shall enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">3. <em>The defendant\u2019s prior convictions. </em>Prior to trial, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the introduction at trial, for impeachment purposes, of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions of assault by means of a dangerous weapon and of unlawful possession of \u00e1 firearm.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On appeal the defendant argues that the judge abused her discretion by improperly deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing his motion because the prior offenses were substantially similar to the assault and battery offense for which he was charged, but not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201cGenerally, in order for the prejudicial effect to outweigh the probative value of the prior conviction evidence, the \u2018prior conviction must be substantially similar to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, </em>438 Mass. 1, 12 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 869 (2000). Whether to admit such evidence is appropriately an exercise of discretion by the trial judge. For the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 99 (2003), we conclude that, in this case, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The defendant also argues that, by denying his motion to exclude his prior convictions, the judge denied him his constitutional right to testify in his own defense because those prior convictions could be used to impeach his testimony. As the Appeals Court correctly stated, \u201c[t]he argument is unpersuasive and wrong. The defendant has a right to testify. He does not have a right to testify free of the effects of impeachment by prior conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, supra, </em>citing G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The convictions of the two misdemeanor offenses of malicious destruction of property are affirmed. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment on the defendant\u2019s conviction of malicious destruction of property over $250 is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the case is remanded to the District Court, where a finding of guilty of the lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property under $250 is to enter. The defendant is to be sentenced pursuant to those provisions of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, that pertain to the misdemeanor offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 127, as amended through St. 1994, c. 168, \u00a7 4, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever destroys or injures the personal property, dwelling house or building of another in any manner or by any means not particularly described or mentioned in this chapter shall, if such destruction or injury is wilful and malicious, [be guilty of a felony]; if the value of the property so destroyed or injured is not alleged to exceed two hundred and fifty dollars, [the offender shall be guilty of a misdemeanor].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">A person convicted of the felony of malicious destruction of property under G.

We consider these claims <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The witness did not testify as to the size of the hole in the wall, but a photograph in evidence shows a hole that is slightly larger than the light switch plate next to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The felony offense of malicious destruction of property valued at over $250 has four essential elements, which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: the defendant injured or destroyed the personal property, or dwelling house or building of another; the defendant did so wilfully; the defendant did so with malice; the value of the property so injured or destroyed exceeded $250.

St. 1978, c. 544. Since 1846, the Legislature has twice amended the minimum amount that must be alleged for a felony charge.

The commission\u2019s recommendation, acknowledged and reprinted in the legislative report, was to consolidate the approximately forty-five property destruction statutes into three statutes, each with different offense levels based on the amount of damage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"A6j\">One sentence, inserted by the 1978 act, provides that, \u201cwhere the value of the property so destroyed or injured\u201d is less than $250, the defendant may be sentenced to pay a fine of \u201cthree times the value of the damage or injury to such property.\u201d The judge is instructed, in such cases, to hold a postconviction evidentiary hearing concerning the \u201cvalue of the property so destroyed or injured.\u201d In addition to highlighting ambiguities in the drafting of the 1978 act, these provisions suggest that the Legislature was concerned to ensure that the victim is compensated reasonably (for \u201cdamage\u201d) and does not reap a windfall from the defendant\u2019s misdeeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We find added support for this conclusion from G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127A, establishing penalties for destruction of specific types of buildings, such as churches, synagogues, schools, educational facilities, and community centers. That statute, inserted by St. 1983, c. 165, \u00a7 2, also distinguishes felonies and misdemeanors by a monetary amount, stating that \u201cif the damage to or loss of such property exceeds five thousand dollars\u201d it is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years. Section 127A prohibits \u201cwillful[]\u201d conduct, and not \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct. Under that statute, damage exceeding $5,000 carries a maximum penalty of five years in State prison. It would be illogical for the Legislature to set a lower punishment in a specific statute for offenses against public buildings that are frequent targets of vandalism than is provided by the catchall provision of \u00a7 127 for dwelling houses and buildings in general.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The statute, D.C.

App. Ct. 967, 969 (1988), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lauzier, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 632-633 &amp; n.8 (2002) (valuation issue not raised below and thus waived), to the effect that the cost of the damage was not a proper consideration. The <em>Pybum </em>central holding, that valuation exceeding $250 is not an essential element of the malicious destruction offense, has been overruled. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>434 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2001). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyburn, supra, </em>also incorrectly stated that the judge erred when instructing the jury that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the value of the property damage exceeded one hundred dollars.\u201d We note that neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth sought further appellate review in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">To the extent that the defendant relied on prior case law that we now overrule, we do not consider him to have waived this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Of course, in certain circumstances a seemingly minor type of damage may effectively destroy the value of an entire property, such as a tear in a valuable painting or a chip in an antique cup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The various decisions of the Appeals Court that touch on this question are not inconsistent with our ruling. Where property has been only partially damaged, the Appeals Court has either measured the \u201cvalue\u201d of property by damage or cost of repair, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 512 (1988) (evidence introduced of cost of repair of automobile dented by student protestor, not value of automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 439 (1983) (evidence introduced of cost of repair, not value of automobile), or declined to reach the question, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 389, 394 n.4 (1981) (declining to decide whether value of damage to personal property or value of property itself that must exceed $250); see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 925, 927-928 (1993) (injury confined to automobile windows damaged by shots from BB gun; felony sentences vacated and automobile\u2019s value as whole not considered). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyburn, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 967, 968 (1979), the Appeals Court stated that it was error to admit \u201can itemized bill of an estimate of repairs\u201d because \u201c[ejvidence of the amount of damage to the automobile was immaterial.\u201d The damaged property at issue in that case was an automobile, which the defendant (driving a large payloader with a front bucket) scooped into the air and \u201cplaced roughly\u201d on the ground, damaging the entire structure of the automobile. <em>Id. </em>As the Appeals Court later noted: \u201cWe do not think <em>Pybum </em>is to be so broadly construed as setting a per se rule of total valuation applicable to all cases irrespective of the scope of the damage. Rather a total valuation method was applied in <em>Pybum </em>precisely because the damage [to the automobile] was all encompassing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 96 (2003). As noted, <em>Pybum </em>was overruled in part on different grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>434 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Section 220.3(2) of the Model Penal Code (1985) states, in part, \u201c[criminal mischief is a felony of the third degree if the actor purposely causes pecuniary loss in excess of $5,000 . . ..
