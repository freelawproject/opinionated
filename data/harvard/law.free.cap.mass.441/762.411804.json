We are asked by the Commonwealth to reconsider that ruling in fight of <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 64-65, 75-76 (2000), in which the United States Supreme Court held that a substantively similar remark by a prosecutor did not offend a defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In this appeal, the defendant also claims that the prosecutor\u2019s argument that a witness\u2019s testimony was credible because it was consistent with her prior statement to the police was improper because her statement was not in evidence. Finally, the defendant claims that testimony of the victim\u2019s sister concerning the victim\u2019s injury was irrelevant and prejudicial, and should not have been admitted. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We reaffirm that \u201ca prosecutor may not argue that the jury should draw a negative inference from the fact that the defendant remained silent until he testified,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra </em>at 140, but conclude that there was no violation of the <em>Person </em>prohibition in this case. Because we also reject the defendant\u2019s other claims of error, we now affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>On December 20, 2001, the defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charge arose from an early morning altercation, the denouement of a series of arguments among several individuals throughout the evening of September 10, 2000. Reviewing the record in its fight most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>676-677 (1979), a reasonable jury could have found the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">That evening, the victim, Joseph Dunn, was a patron at a bar where he was friendly with a bartender, JoAnne Sayers. Sayers is the defendant\u2019s former girl friend. Sayers and the defendant had a \u201crocky,\u201d \u201con and off\u201d relationship. Their relationship was \u201coff\u201d on September 10, 2000, and that afternoon, they had an argument. Later, the defendant went to the bar where Sayers worked. When she asked him to leave, he refused to do so. An argument ensued, there was a brief physical confrontation between the two, and the defendant then left. As the evening progressed, the defendant made numerous threatening and harassing telephone calls to Sayers. On one such occasion, Dunn answered Sayers\u2019s telephone for her and told the defendant to leave Sayers alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Cognizant of the defendant\u2019s behavior toward Sayers that night, Dunn and another patron, Kevin Matte, stayed at the bar until it closed, sometime before 2 a.m. on September 11, 2000. They walked with Sayers to her vehicle, where they encountered the defendant sitting on the hood. Sayers said, \u201cGet off my car\u201d and told the defendant that she had \u201cnothing to say\u201d to him. The defendant and Dunn engaged in an argument, the two yelled at each other, and Dunn knocked the defendant\u2019s hat off his head. Sayers then left in her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Matte, who apparently was not involved in the argument, entered his vehicle, a Ford Bronco, and persuaded Dunn to let him drive him home. As they drove away, the defendant followed in his pickup truck. Matte eventually pulled into a parking lot and stopped his vehicle. The defendant followed and drove his pickup truck into the back of the Bronco. Dunn stepped out of the Bronco, again yelling at the defendant. As Matte was getting out of his vehicle, the defendant drove toward Dunn and struck him with his truck. Matte saw Dunn \u201cbouncing off the hood of [the defendant\u2019s] truck and landing on the ground\u201d; he testified that the sound was \u201clike a bat cracking.\u201d A resident of the neighborhood testified that he heard \u201ctires squealing and people screaming\u201d and saw the pickup truck bump Dunn. The truck then backed up, accelerated, and \u201cwent right after [Dunn],\u201d dragging him several feet. The defendant then immediately drove away at high speed. Matte attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>follow him, but soon returned to assist Dunn, who was unconscious and bleeding profusely. Matte telephoned the police and Sayers. A few minutes later Sayers received a telephone call from the defendant, who said to her, \u201cIs that the biggest dude you got, because I just took care of him.\u201d It was later determined that the victim suffered multiple fractures to his skull, and extensive bleeding and swelling in the brain, consistent with \u201cmassive blunt force trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">At the trial, the defendant admitted that his vehicle had hit the Bronco and had hit the victim. He claimed, however, that this was an accident, as he responded to what he said were aggressive, threatening actions by the driver of the Bronco. He also admitted that he had left the scene. His principal theory at trial was that he did not possess the requisite state of mind for the charge of armed assault with intent to murder or assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s opportunity to tailor his testimony to the evidence. </em>The defendant testified at trial. Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>400 Mass. 136, 139 (1987), the defendant argues, for the first time on appeal, that the prosecutor\u2019s statement in his closing argument to the effect that the defendant had been able \u201cto shape\u201d his trial testimony to conform to the evidence against him requires reversal of his conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the claim for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, noting that \u201c[t]he remarks at issue must be judged within the context of the entire argument, the facts of the case and the rationale underlying the <em>Person </em>principle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>401 Mass. 302, 303 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that such comments do not offend a defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional rights to be present at his trial, to confront witnesses, to testify in his own behalf (Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution), or to due process (Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 65, 74-75 (2000). The defendant does not argue that the prosecutor\u2019s statements violated his rights under our State Constitution, so we need not, and do not, consider any such claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant relies solely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra, </em>where a prosecutor\u2019s comments were deemed prejudicial and required reversal, a ruling that was not constitutionally based. <em>Id. </em>at 142 n.7 (\u201cBecause the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial, we do not reach the question whether they are errors of constitutional dimension\u201d). Cf. <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, supra </em>at 73 n.4 (court\u2019s decision is \u201caddressed to whether the comment is permissible as a constitutional matter, and not to whether it is always desirable as a matter of sound trial practice\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 176-177 (2000) (applying <em>Person </em>rule one month after <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, supra, </em>was decided, but finding error did not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>new trial). For the reasons we explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra </em>at 140-142, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>424 Mass. 682, 690-691 (1997), it is impermissible for a prosecutor to argue in closing that the jury should draw a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s opportunity to shape his testimony to conform to the trial evidence unless there is evidence introduced at trial to support that argument. In this case there was such evidence, as we shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">It is a long-standing rule that closing arguments must be \u201c[wjithin the bounds of the evidence and the fair inferences from the evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>399 Mass. 741, 745 (1987). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, supra </em>at 691, we stated that a prosecutor may \u201cimpugn the defendant\u2019s credibility and argue that his story is a fabrication,\u201d but may not \u201celicit evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence, his request for an attorney, or the discussions the defendant had with his attorney to argue that these were evidence that the defendant fabricated his story.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 130-132 (1990) (prosecutor\u2019s \u201cargument focused on the quality of the evidentiary picture the defendant was trying to paint, which is, of course, a proper subject for argument\u201d). As these cases make clear, a prosecutor may, if there is a basis in the evidence introduced at trial, attack the credibility of a defendant on the ground that his testimony has been shaped or changed in response to listening to the testimony of other witnesses. See <em>id. </em>(prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cdid not implicate any of the principles in the <em>Person </em>case\u201d because they \u201cdealt with the differences between the defendant\u2019s pretrial statements to the police and to other witnesses . . . brought out in the evidence at trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, supra </em>at 303, 304 (prosecutor\u2019s comment that defendant \u201clistened to all of the testimony sitting right here before he took that stand\u201d was not error where, \u201cin stark contrast to Person,\u201d prosecutor was attacking \u201cthe defendant\u2019s credibility by making specific references to instances where the defendant changed his account\u201d). As we explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, supra </em>at 130, the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cargument in <em>Person, </em>to the effect that the defendant\u2019s trial testimony was a fabrication, was improper and prejudicial because no <em>evidence </em>existed to support the argument\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>at 304 (\u201cIn <em>Person, </em>the prosecutor baldly stated that, because the defendant had been able to sit in court and listen to all the State\u2019s witnesses, he had fabricated his trial testimony. Yet there was no <em>evidence </em>to support the prosecutor\u2019s assertion\u201d [emphasis in original]). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>148 Vt. 90, 91-92 (1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">There was ample evidence at trial to support the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements the defendant now challenges. During cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned the defendant about statements he had made to the police shortly after the incident, drawing out the differences between those statements and the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, and the differences between the defendant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of other witnesses. This was a perfectly sound line of questioning, properly designed to undermine the defendant\u2019s credibility. The defendant correctly does not suggest that the cross-examination was improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>424 Mass. 682, 690-691 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, supra', Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, supra. </em>He argues only that the prosecutor\u2019s summation was in error. But here, unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra, </em>the prosecutor had a specific evidentiary basis from which to argue to the jury that they could infer that the defendant had been able \u201cto shape\u201d his testimony to conform it to the trial evidence. There was no error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">3. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s reference to defense failure to impeach. </em>In the hours immediately after the incident, JoAnne Sayers gave a statement to the police. She testified at trial; the police report of her pretrial statements was not in evidence. In his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that Sayers was a credible witness because she had not been impeached by the defense with any prior inconsistent statements. Defense counsel objected to this line of argument and also moved for a mistrial at the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, which was denied. The defendant claims both that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant and that the prosecutor improperly relied on facts not in evidence to argue an inference to the jury. We review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201cAs a general matter, a witness\u2019s prior statement that is consistent with his testimony at trial is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 99 (1999). However, a prior consistent statement may be used \u201cto rebut the claim of recent fabrication, not to prove the truth of the matter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 396 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em>370 Mass. 23, 27 (1976) (\u201cUnless admissible on some other ground to prove the truth of the facts asserted, such a prior consistent statement is admissible only to show that the witness\u2019s in-court testimony is not the product of the asserted inducement or bias or is not recently contrived as claimed\u201d); P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.13 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cFor reasons of efficiency, logic and policy, evidence enhancing credibility is generally not admissible to bolster the testimony of a witness who has not been impeached\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">During his cross-examination of Sayers, defense counsel did not suggest that her trial testimony was of recent contrivance. Accordingly, any pretrial statement of Sayers, unless inconsistent with her trial testimony, would not have been admissible at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 396, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, supra </em>at 26. By arguing that the jury could draw an inference that the trial testimony of Sayers was credible because it was consistent with her pretrial statements to the police, the prosecutor improperly sought to bolster her testimony in general and to vouch in particular for her testimony at trial that the defendant had telephoned her immediately after the incident and said, \u201cIs that the biggest dude you got, because I just took care of him.\u201d (That statement was highly probative of the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he injured Dunn.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>prosecutor, in short, attempted to achieve by inference what he could not achieve directly: inform the jury of Sayers\u2019s consistent pretrial statement to the police. This is impermissible; counsel was simply attempting an \u201cend run\u201d around our rules of evidence and their limitations on the use of prior consistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he question wasn\u2019t asked [by defense counsel] because she did tell that [the defendant\u2019s postincident telephone call] to the police,\u201d also implied that he, the prosecutor, knew the contents of the police report. We have held in other contexts that the Commonwealth may not suggest that it \u201chas special knowledge by which it can verify the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989) (use of plea agreements). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 96 (prosecutor \u201cmay not \u2018explicitly or implicitly\u2019 vouch to the jury that she knows the witness\u2019s testimony is true\u201d because of plea agreement). \u201cCounsel may not refer to or suggest their knowledge of matters not in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 30 (1982). The prosecutor\u2019s comments here are akin to those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">While the argument was improper, a careful reading of the evidence leads us to conclude that the error was nonprejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra </em>at 353. The defendant admitted that he hit the victim with his truck, evidence supporting the charge of which he was convicted, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant\u2019s preincident statement to Sayers that he \u201ctook care\u201d of the victim was most relevant to the charge of attempted murder, for which the Commonwealth had to prove specific intent. But the defendant was acquitted of that charge. Moreover, there was overwhelming evidence as to the charges of which the defendant was convicted. In particular, two witnesses testified about the statement of the defendant to Sayers, which the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument sought to bolster.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>this, the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument did not substantially sway the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>4. Testimony of victim\u2019s sister. </em>The judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the victim\u2019s sister to testify concerning the extent of the victim\u2019s injuries or the length of his recovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor was there error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this basis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989). Family members of a victim may testify about relevant issues, as long as the testimony is not offered \u201cfor the sole purpose of creating sympathy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 615 (1999). Here, the judge determined that the testimony was relevant because the victim\u2019s extensive injuries tended to support the prosecution\u2019s theory that the defendant was driving fast and intended to inflict harm on the victim, and to contradict the defendant\u2019s theory that his truck was moving slowly and that the vehicle\u2019s contact with the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>was minor and accidental.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To ensure against any emotional, and potentially prejudicial, testimony, the judge specifically limited the sister\u2019s testimony and instructed the prosecutor to limit himself to narrow, focused questions. These exemplary cautions by the judge, together with his carefully crafted instructions that neither sympathy nor emotions should cloud the jury\u2019s consideration of the facts in evidence, insulated any potential misuse of the testimony by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The jury also convicted the defendant of leaving the scene of an accident after causing personal injury, leaving the scene of an accident after causing property damage, and operating a motor vehicle so as to endanger. Although the defendant took an appeal from \u201call guilty verdicts,\u201d he makes no argument as to why these convictions should be reversed, and we do not consider them. The jury acquitted the defendant of armed assault with intent to murder, and assault and battery on JoAnne Sayers. The defendant was also indicted for numerous other charges that were nolle prossed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">As to his other convictions, see note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The defendant points to the following statements by the prosecutor:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">\u201cNow, you\u2019re going to have to make a determination as to credibility of witnesses, who you\u2019re going to believe in whole or in part, and who you\u2019re not going to believe. On the one hand, you have a hodge-podge of Commonwealth witnesses [who] testified to different aspects of that particular night, who came in here independently and were not watching other people testify. And then you have the other story, the defendant\u2019s story, the story that had the benefit of being able to sit here and watch everybody else testify, the ability to shape his testimony to the contours of what he wanted you to believe people were saying; and if it hurt him, what he didn\u2019t want you to believe people were saying. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">\u201cHe had the opportunity to sit and observe the entire Commonwealth\u2019s case go into evidence before he testified. He had the benefit. And he was able, the Commonwealth submits, to shape his testimony accordingly to provide the best light possible to support his story about what happened.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In the wake of <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61 (2000), several State courts have reconsidered their earlier rulings concerning a prosecutor\u2019s comments on a defendant\u2019s opportunity to tailor his testimony to conform to the evidence, reaching varying conclusions. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>303 Mont. 71, 83-85 (2000), the Supreme Court of Montana declined to consider whether such comments violated a defendant\u2019s State constitutional rights because the issue had been waived. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 296, 300 (2000), the Supreme Court of Connecticut overruled an earlier decision prohibiting such comments, <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, 236 </em>Conn. 112, 127-128, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910 (1996), because the earlier ruling had been based on Federal constitutional grounds. The <em>Alexander </em>court declined to decide whether the State Constitution prohibited such statements, noting that \u201c[t]o the extent\u201d the defendant had briefed a State constitutional claim, the court was \u201cnot persuaded by his argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296 n.9. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>110 Wash. App. 283, 284-285 (2002) <em>(\u201cPortuondo </em>effectively overrules [contrary State court decisions] insofar as they state a different rule\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>400 Mass. 136, 142 (1987), we stated that the error in that case \u201crequire[d]\u201d reversal. To the extent that a prosecutor\u2019s summation does violate the <em>Person </em>prohibition, we would consider such an error under the appropriate standard of review, here a miscarriage of justice because there was no objection at trial. A <em>Person </em>error does not, of course, automatically require reversal of a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The defendant\u2019s statement to Sayers was admitted in evidence through the testimony of Matte and a woman who lived nearby as spontaneous utterances by a \u201cfrantic\u201d and \u201chysterical\u201d Sayers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The judge also emphasized to the jury that prior out-of-court statements by a witness were to be considered only for purposes of credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\">For essentially the same reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s use of rhetorical questions prejudiced the defendant or could have been perceived by the jury as shifting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, 402 </em>Mass. <em>105, 111 </em>(1988) (\u201cAs a general rule, however, rhetorical questions should not be used in closing argument where they could be perceived by the jury as shifting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof to the defendant\u201d). The judge\u2019s instructions clearly and forcefully stated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly mischaracterized the testimony of a police officer who interviewed the defendant. The officer testified that the defendant stated that Matte\u2019s Bronco \u201ctapped\u201d the defendant\u2019s truck, and then hit it again, a \u201cmore significant\u201d hit. When recounting this testimony in his closing argument, the prosecutor omitted the word \u201cmore.\u201d Even if we agreed that this was a misstatement of the evidence, it would not constitute reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>432 Mass. 657, 660 (2000) (minor inaccuracy in prosecutor\u2019s closing does not constitute reversible error in context of entire case). We think it more likely that the jury understood the prosecutor to be arguing that the second \u201chit\u201d was so much greater than the first that the defendant had told the police he feared for his life. This argument conformed to the officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\">His sister testified that the victim was an inpatient in various rehabilitation facilities for approximately six months, and that he has no left peripheral vision, suffers from memory loss, and cannot drive or work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The defendant moved for a mistrial at the close of the testimony of the victim\u2019s sister.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The victim testified at trial that he had no memory concerning the incident from the time he stepped out of the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
