(Macy\u2019s East), may carry forward and deduct, for State corporate excise tax purposes, premerger net operating losses (NOLs), generated by four entities it absorbed in various mergers. The Appellate Tax Board (board) concluded that Macy\u2019s East may not carry forward and deduct these NOLs, and affirmed the Commissioner of Revenue\u2019s (commissioner\u2019s) denial of Macy\u2019s East\u2019s applications for abatement and amended corporate excise tax returns for the taxable period that ended February 1, 1997 (taxable period). We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The board found the following facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13 (\u201cThe decision of the board shall be final as to findings of fact\u201d). During the taxable period, Macy\u2019s East was a corporation organized under Ohio law, and had its headquarters in New York. Macy\u2019s East is engaged in the business of operating retail department stores. During the taxable period, Macy\u2019s East operated eleven retail stores in Massachusetts, which previously had been operated as Jordan Marsh Stores Corporation (Jordan Marsh) retail stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Macy\u2019s East was the surviving corporation after a series of corporate reorganizations occurring between 1986 and 1994. One party to this series of reorganizations, Federated Department Stores, Inc. (Federated), was formed as a holding company by several department stores, including Abraham &amp; Straus (A&amp;S). On May 3, 1988, Campeau Corporation, which owned Jordan Marsh, acquired Federated. On January 15, 1990, Federated and some of its subsidiaries, including Jordan Marsh, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On February 4, 1992, Federated emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Federated continued to conduct its retail business through the operation of its subsidiaries Jordan Marsh and A&amp;S. Jordan Marsh operated retail department stores in Massachusetts, and A&amp;S operated retail department stores primarily in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">On July 15, 1986, R.H. Macy &amp; Company, Inc. (Macy\u2019s), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>then known as Macy Acquiring Corporation, acquired the former R.H. Macy &amp; Company, Inc. (former Macy\u2019s), a retail department corporation, in a leveraged buyout. On January 27, 1992, Macy\u2019s, and some of its subsidiaries, filed petitions in bankruptcy for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Macy\u2019s continued to conduct its retail business through the operation of several subsidiaries, the principal subsidiaries being Macy\u2019s Northeast, Inc. (Macy\u2019s Northeast), and Macy\u2019s South, Inc. (Macy\u2019s South). Both Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South were corporations organized under Delaware law.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On September 8, 1994, a Bankruptcy Court judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved an agreement of merger between Federated and Macy\u2019s, pursuant to which Macy\u2019s would emerge as the surviving corporation of the combined company and would change its name to Federated. As part of the reorganization plan, Macy\u2019s East was created on December 13, 1994. Macy\u2019s East was organized for the purpose of operating the businesses of Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South, which merged into Macy\u2019s East on their emergence from bankruptcy on December 14, 1994. Macy\u2019s East operated under the tax identification number previously used by Macy\u2019s Northeast. Unlike Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South, the new Macy\u2019s East emerged as a corporation organized under Ohio law. Macy\u2019s East operated its business in both the northeastern and the southeastern regions of the country, districts which previously had been operated separately by Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South, respectively. Prior to this merger, Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South had accumulated NOLs during their 1991 through 1995 fiscal years.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On August 26, 1995, Jordan Marsh and A&amp;S were absorbed into Macy\u2019s East. The directors and officers of Macy\u2019s East became the directors and officers of the merged corporation, and each previously issued and outstanding share of A&amp;S and Jordan Marsh common stock were canceled and retired. After the merger, Macy\u2019s East operated the retail stores previously owned by Jordan Marsh and A&amp;S. A&amp;S had not conducted business in Massachusetts. Before the merger, Jordan Marsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>and A&amp;S had accumulated NOLs during their 1991 through 1995 fiscal years.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On May 8, 1998, Macy\u2019s East filed with the commissioner an application for abatement and an amended combined corporate excise tax return for the taxable period showing an overpayment of tax and requesting a refund of the income portion of the corporate excise equal to $1,349,808. Macy\u2019s East attributed the requested refund amount to the use of NOL carryforwards previously incurred by Jordan Marsh during its 1991 through 1995 fiscal years. The commissioner denied the application for abatement on October 27, 1998, on the ground that a regulation, promulgated in 1993, 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.30.2(11) (1993) (quoted in its entirety, <em>infra), </em>prohibits a surviving corporation of a merger to deduct or carry forward the NOLs of a corporation it absorbs. Macy\u2019s East then filed various amended returns for the taxable period seeking to deduct premerger NOLs attributable to A&amp;S, Macy\u2019s Northeast, and Macy\u2019s South.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">After further proceedings that need not be detailed, an evidentiary hearing was held before the board. The board rendered a decision in favor of the commissioner and, subsequent to that decision, issued its written findings and conclusions. The board noted that the Massachusetts corporate excise tax statutory scheme, contrary to the Federal scheme, retains the individual tax attributes of each entity subject to the tax, and concluded that Macy\u2019s East failed to meet its burden of proving that it qualified for the statutory deduction for using the premerger NOLs incurred by other corporations. The board further concluded that its interpretation was supported by the commissioner\u2019s reasonable regulation interpreting the statute, and rejected several constitutional challenges to the regulation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">1. \u201cWe will not reverse a decision of the board \u2018if it is based on substantial evidence and on a correct application of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bill DeLuca Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>431 Mass. 314, 315 (2000), quoting <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993). Macy\u2019s East argues that the board incorrectly determined that the Massachusetts corporate excise tax provisions do not allow it to deduct the premerger NOLs of Jordan Marsh, A&amp;S, Macy\u2019s Northeast, and Macy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>South. The statutory provision at the heart of this dispute is G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a), as appearing in St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 403, and is called, for our purposes, the Massachusetts net operating loss provision or Massachusetts NOL provision. Before defining that provision, a brief overview of the State corporate excise tax scheme is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 14; \u00a7 38; and \u00a7 39, as amended through St. 1990, c. 150, \u00a7 349, impose an excise tax on domestic and foreign corporations. A portion of that tax is based on a corporation\u2019s net income derived from business activities carried on in Massachusetts. \u00a7 38. The starting point for calculating a corporation\u2019s net income involves first calculating a corporation\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d See \u00a7 30 (4), as amended through St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 30 (3), defines \u201c[g]ross income\u201d as that term is \u201cdefined under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code [I.R.C.] as amended and in effect for the taxable year\u201d with some exceptions not relevant here. Following the determination of a corporation\u2019s gross income, its \u201cnet income\u201d must be calculated. \u201cNet income\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 63 as \u201cgross income less the deductions, but not credits, allowable under the provisions of the [I.R.C.] as amended and in effect for the taxable year.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (4). The definition of \u201c[n]et income\u201d also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cDeductions with respect to the following items, however, shall not be allowed:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">(i) dividends received[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">(ii) <em>[IJosses sustained in other taxable years, except for the net operating losses as provided in paragraph five of this section[;]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>(iii) taxes on or measured by income, franchise taxes measured by net income, franchise taxes for the privilege of doing business and capital stock taxes imposed by any state\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><em>Id. </em>See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The relevant portion of the 1992 version of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cFor purposes of this chapter, the Massachusetts net operating loss incurred in a taxable year shall mean the amount by which the deductions allowed under paragraph four, including the dividends-received deduction allowed in section thirty-eight (a) (1) and not including the deductions for net operating losses under this paragraph, exceed gross income for the taxable year as defined in paragraph three of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">There is no dispute that, for Federal tax purposes, the relevant, and then applicable, provisions of the I.R.C. allowed Macy\u2019s East to carry forward and deduct the NOLs at issue. Under the Federal scheme, I.R.C. \u00a7 172 is the basic NOL provision and identifies and allows NOL carryovers and carrybacks. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 172(a) (2000) (\u201cThere shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year an amount equal to the aggregate of [1] the net operating loss carryovers to such year, plus [2] the net operating loss carrybacks to such year\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 381(a) provides for, subject, to certain limitations, the carryover of NOLs (under I.R.C. \u00a7 172) in I.R.C. \u00a7 332 liquidations of subsidiaries (I.R.C. \u00a7 381[a][l]) and in certain tax-free organizations under I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1), specifically, those \u201creorganization[s]\u201d defined in subparagraphs (A), (C), (D), (F), and (G) (I.R.C. \u00a7 381[a][2]). 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 381. Of the qualifying reorganizations for NOL carryforwards under I.R.C. \u00a7 381(a)(2) is a \u201cstatutory merger or consolidation,\u201d or Type A reorganization, see I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A), which Macy\u2019s East states (and no one disputes) is the type of merger that took place with respect to each of the absorbed entities in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>case (Macy\u2019s Northeast, Macy\u2019s South, Jordan Marsh, and A&amp;S).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The issue presented in this case is whether, under the Massachusetts NOL provision, Macy\u2019s East may similarly use (carry forward and deduct) the premerger NOLs of corporations it absorbed. Macy\u2019s East does not argue that the State NOL provision expressly allows a surviving corporation to deduct the premerger NOLs of an absorbed corporation in a statutory merger. (Macy\u2019s East cannot advance such an argument because the Massachusetts NOL provision is silent on the matter.) Rather, Macy\u2019s East argues that there is no language in the Massachusetts NOL provision, or in its legislative history, that supports departure from the Federal NOL tax provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">While the \u201cMassachusetts tax statutes and the [I.R.C.] are inextricably interwoven,\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Franchi, </em>423 Mass. 817, 819 (1996), Massachusetts tax law can and does depart from Federal tax law, particularly in matters authorizing deductions for prior year\u2019s losses, see <em>Bill DeLuca Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 325 (noting that \u201c[t]he Massachusetts Legislature has consistently chosen to treat excess deductions from a previous tax year in a different manner from the I.R.C. . . . These statutes evince a persistent and conscious legislative decision to take a different path from that of the Federal government in ameliorating the transactional inequities that arise from annual taxation\u201d). See also <em>Farrell Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 572 (1999) (noting that \u201cthe Massachusetts statute and regulations regarding combined returns do not follow the Federal regulations regarding the filing of consolidated income tax returns which explicitly permit the NOL carry forwards of all of the members to be aggregated and made available in the calculation of a group\u2019s consolidated income\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also, in this case, the legislative history is inconclusive. Although, as Macy\u2019s East correctly points out, a direct reference to I.R.C. \u00a7 172 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (4) (ii), was deleted in 1992, compare St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 10 (disallowing deductions for \u201closses sustained in other taxable years; provided, however, that net operating losses as defined in [I.R.C. \u00a7 172] as amended and in effect for the taxable year of the losses which are sustained in taxable years ending on or after December [31, 1989], shall be allowed\u201d), with St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 402, 403 (deleting above language quoted above in St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 10, and inserting the language in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 [5], that is at issue in this case), the Massachusetts NOL definition that was adopted by the 1992 legislation, unlike I.R.C. \u00a7 381(a)(2), does not plainly authorize a surviving corporation in a merger to use NOLs generated by the entities it absorbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">As correctly recognized by the board, Macy\u2019s East overlooks the significance of what it is seeking, namely, a deduction. \u201cWe have frequently recognized that an exemption from taxation \u2018is a matter of special favor or grace,\u2019 and that statutes granting exemptions from taxation are therefore to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>418 Mass. 695, 698 (1994), citing <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Blinder, </em>336 Mass. 698, 703 (1958) (\u201can exemption [is] . . . to be recognized only where the property falls clearly and unmistakably within the express words of a legislative command\u201d). \u201cThe burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate entitlement to an exemption claimed.\u201d <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>Where the statute is' silent concerning the deduction Macy\u2019s East is attempting to claim, and the legislative history inconclusive, we agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that Macy\u2019s East \u201cfailed to meet its burden of proving that it qualified [for the deduction] under the terms of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">2. Macy\u2019s East correctly construes the Massachusetts NOL provision as creating an exception to the State disallowance of the Federal NOL deduction. Macy\u2019s East also correctly notes that \u201c[n]owhere in [the Massachusetts NOL provision] does it say that a deduction should or should not be allowed.\u201d However, despite the fact that the commissioner is authorized to promulgate regulations \u201cnecessary to interpret and enforce any statute imposing any tax, excise or fee,\u201d G. L. c. 14, \u00a7 6, Macy\u2019s East contends that the commissioner\u2019s regulation, which unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ously prohibits the carryforward of the type attempted here, is invalid because it \u201cimposes a limitation not authorized by the statute\u201d and because the department has interpreted the regulation in an arbitrary and nonuniform manner. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The commissioner\u2019s regulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201c(a) <em>Mergers. </em>In the event of a merger of two or more corporations, the surviving corporation retains any net operating loss that it separately incurred before the merger, subject to the limitations of 830 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 63.30.2 (11) (b). All of the net operating loss of a corporation absorbed in the merger is lost. The surviving corporation may not deduct or carry over the net operating loss of a corporation it absorbs. In the event of a consolidation of two or more previously existing corporations into a new corporation, the new corporation starts with no net operating loss. All of the net operating loss of the previously existing corporations is lost. The new corporation may not deduct or carry over any net operating loss incurred by any of the previously existing corporations before the consolidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Changes in Ownership. </em>Where a corporation undergoes an ownership change, as defined in [I.R.C.] \u00a7 382 (g), the amount of the corporation\u2019s net income that may be offset by pre-change net operating loss in any taxable year shall not exceed the limitation imposed by [I.R.C.] \u00a7 382, provided that the limitation shall be adjusted for differences between Massachusetts taxable net income and federal taxable income determined without regard to the federal net operating loss deduction. The adjustment shall be made for each taxable year by multiplying the [I.R.C.] \u00a7 382 limitation by Massachusetts taxable net income, determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction, and dividing the resulting amount by federal taxable income, determined without regard to the federal net operating loss deduction. Any amount of net operating loss that cannot be deducted because of the limitation may be carried over as provided in 830 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 63.30.2 (7).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.30.2(11) (1993) (regulation). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>regulation was adopted contemporaneously (specifically, on January 1, 1993) with the enactment of the amendment to the Massachusetts NOL provision that rewrote paragraph 5, see St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 402, 403, and deleted reference to I.R.C. \u00a7 172. So long as consistently interpreted thereafter, the commissioner\u2019s position is entitled to some deference because the Legislature has delegated to the commissioner the responsibility of administering, interpreting, and enforcing the State tax laws, and resolving statutory ambiguity, or silence as in this case. See G. L. c. 14, \u00a7 6; <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 478, 485 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Macy\u2019s East does not argue that the board erred in determining that, under paragraph (a) of the regulation, the creation of Macy\u2019s East by the merger of Macy\u2019s Northeast and Macy\u2019s South constituted \u201ca consolidation of two or more previously existing corporations into a new corporation,\u201d and that the subsequent merger of Jordan Marsh and A&amp;P into Macy\u2019s East constituted \u201ca merger of two or more corporations.\u201d The board correctly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the corresponding statutory provisions, G: L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (4) and \u00a7 30 (5), and that the regulation\u2019s \u201cdenial of the deductions at issue is consistent with the complete body of Massachusetts tax law, namely the statutes and cases interpreting those statutes, which establishes the Commonwealth\u2019s corporate tax structure as adopting an individual-entity approach.\u201d See <em>Farrell Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 572 (1999). Further, due to the differences between \u201cA\u201d and \u201cF\u201d reorganizations as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A) (reorganizations involving \u201ca statutory merger or consolidation\u201d) and I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) (reorganizations involving \u201ca mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation, however effected\u201d), and the specifics surrounding the mergers in this case, the commissioner could reasonably treat, in one of its letter rulings, NOLs from that transaction (an F reorganization) differently. Thus, the commissioner\u2019s different treatment of the NOLs of a particular F reorganization in one set of limited and distinguishable factual circumstances does not render the commissioner\u2019s tax treatment \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cnon-uniform\u201d as Macy\u2019s East contends. Macy\u2019s East\u2019s various arguments concerning the incorporation, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>paragraph (b) of the commissioner\u2019s regulation, of I.R.C. \u00a7 382 limitations, overlook the complexity of the Federal NOL scheme and the considerable discretion afforded to the commissioner to enact regulations interpreting or enforcing the statutes imposing the State corporate excise tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Surely, where Congress has distinguished various forms of reorganizations, permitting NOL carryovers only with respect to certain types of reorganizations, see I.R.C. \u00a7 381(a)(2), and applying the limitations in I.R.C. \u00a7 382,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the case of ownership changes occasioned by an \u201cequity structure shift,\u201d to only some of the types of reorganizations defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 381, see I.R.C. \u00a7 382(g)(3)(A), the commissioner may also rationally treat various types of reorganizations differently. As correctly noted by the board, \u201cthe [regulation\u2019s reference to [I.R.C.] \u00a7 382 does not speak to the deduction of losses sustained in prior years by a <em>different </em>taxpayer\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">A few remaining points should be stated. Macy\u2019s East cites to law in other jurisdictions as support for its position. E.g., <em>Chilivis </em>v. <em>Studebaker Worthington, Inc., </em>137 Ga. App. 337 (1976). Cf. <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>140 N.J. 523 (1995). The law in other jurisdictions, however, cannot serve as a source for interpreting the Massachusetts NOL provision and corresponding regulation. As one commentator explained, \u201cThe [Sjtate NOL rules vary quite markedly. While some [S]tates follow the [F]ederal provisions regarding the carryback and carryforward of NOLs, other [S]tates do not .... The [Sjtate rules regarding utilization of NOLs after a merger or acquisition also vary significantly and can be quite complex.\u201d Lippman, 1200 Tax Management Multistate Tax Portfolios, Income Taxes: State Treatment of Net Operating Losses, at 1200.03.B1 (1999). Along those lines, while we are aware, as noted by Macy\u2019s East\u2019s expert on tax policy matters at the hearing, that the commissioner\u2019s treatment of premerger NOLs in this case \u201cembodies a philosophy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>that has long been rejected at the [Fjederal level\u201d and has been the subject of much criticism, see Joyner, Some State Corporate NOL Carryovers Are Still Governed by Outdated Federal Doctrine, 4 J. Multistate Tax\u2019n 260 (1995), such policy matters are appropriately left for consideration by the Legislature, see <em>Bill DeLuca Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>431 Mass. 314, 325 &amp; n.16 (2000). We find significance in the fact that, since the regulation went into effect in 1993, the Legislature, which is assumed to know of the regulation, see <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 670, 680-681 (1997), has not amended the statute to trump the regulation by expressly permitting a surviving corporation\u2019s use of carryforwards and deductions of premerger NOLs of the corporations it absorbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">3. The board correctly rejected Macy\u2019s East\u2019s constitutional challenges to the regulation. Macy\u2019s East\u2019s claims (that, because the NOLs were an \u201casset\u201d of the bankruptcy estates of each of the debtor corporations, the regulation violates the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution because it \u201cdivests Macy\u2019s East of one of its most significant assets \u2014 the NOLs of the [absorbed] [corporations\u201d) ignores that \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the debtor\u2019s interest in property is determined by applicable non-bankruptcy law,\u201d <em>In re Prudential Lines Inc., </em>928 F.2d 565, 569 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 821 (1991), or State law, see <em>Butner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 48, 54 (1979). Because Macy\u2019s East may not, under State law, carry forward and deduct the NOLs of Macy\u2019s Northeast, Macy\u2019s South, Jordan Marsh, and A&amp;S, those NOLs are not property subject to be included in Macy\u2019s East\u2019s bankruptcy estate. Thus, there is no deprivation of any property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In rejecting Macy\u2019s East\u2019s claims of due process and commerce clause violations under the United States Constitution, the board correctly concluded that Macy\u2019s East failed to produce \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d of extraterritorial taxation when its income was subject to apportionment according to the Legislature\u2019s approved, three-factor statutory formula. See <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 680-681. Macy\u2019s East overlooks that the evidence it offered in support of its claims constituted calculations based on a separate accounting analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>an accounting method that the commissioner was free to reject. See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 786, 787 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Finally, the board correctly concluded that Macy\u2019s East did not satisfy its formidable burden of demonstrating that the commissioner\u2019s distinction between \u201cA\u201d and \u201cF\u201d reorganizations defined under I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1), and as applied to the facts of this case, violated equal protection principles. See <em>Nashoba Communications Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Assessors of Danvers, </em>429 Mass. 126, 128 (1999). As explained by the board, \u201cF\u201d reorganizations typically involve only one business enterprise that emerges essentially unchanged from the reorganization, as opposed to \u201cA\u201d reorganizations, which typically involve multiple corporations with only one surviving corporation and the others no longer existing. That an F reorganization may sometimes \u201coverlap\u201d with other types of reorganizations under I.R.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1) has no bearing on the particular facts of this case. We are satisfied that, in the context of this case, there are meaningful distinctions between the two types of reorganizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">4.
