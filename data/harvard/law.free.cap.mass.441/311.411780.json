Rivera, Jr., stopped the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle on Route 495 in Middleborough. During the course of the stop, Rivera illegally strip searched the plaintiff, Mary Jane Clancy, and made lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and suggestive remarks to her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Five years prior to this incident, internal affairs had launched an investigation into Rivera\u2019s inappropriate and unprofessional conduct with four other female motorists. In 1988, as a result of the investigation, McCabe, who was then Commissioner of Public Safety and superintendent of State police, suspended Rivera without pay for six months and ordered him to report to the department\u2019s \u201cstress unit\u201d following his return to active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s supervisory liability complaint against Mc-Cabe asserts a single count of civil rights violation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). She alleges McCabe acted with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of female motorists by not recommending that Rivera be terminated in 1988. McCabe moved for summary judgment, claiming he was entitled to qualified immunity. McCabe further argued that the plaintiff could not prove that his allegedly negligent supervision of Rivera proximately caused her to be abused by Rivera.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A Superior Court judge determined that there was \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to reach a jury on the question whether McCabe\u2019s discipline of Rivera amounted to deliberate indifference, and denied McCabe\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McCabe filed an interlocutory appeal with the Appeals Court, see <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 30-31 (1987), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988), arguing, inter alla, that there were no material facts in dispute on the issue of qualified immunity. In affirming the order denying summary judgment, the Appeals Court concluded that \u201cit can be reasonably inferred that McCabe\u2019s supervisory response to Rivera\u2019s behavior was grossly inadequate.\u201d <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>58 Mass. App, Ct. 498, 508 (2003). We granted McCabe\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we hold that the disciplinary action taken by McCabe was not deliberately indifferent as a matter of law, and thus he is entitled to qualified immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983, see <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, supra </em>at 31, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The background facts are set out at length in the Appeals Court decision, <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>McCabe, supra </em>at 500-502, and need not be repeated here. We recite only those facts on which the motion judge relied to support his denial of summary judgment on the question of qualified immunity, supplemented by uncontroverted evidence from the record below.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On February 22, 1988, Captain Wayne Harding of the State police internal affairs unit reported the results of the unit\u2019s investigation of Rivera.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The report detailed complaints by four female motorists against Rivera for improper behavior during traffic stops, all of which occurred in 1987.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The allegations ranged from Rivera\u2019s inviting female motorists to join him for a drink, to touching their arms, to detaining them for prolonged periods of time, to threatening them with a citation or arrest if they did not agree to go out with him. In addition to the verified complaints, the report also noted unsubstantiated \u201cstories and rumors\u201d about Rivera\u2019s activities. Opining that Rivera\u2019s actions toward female motorists were \u201ctotally inappropriate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>unprofessional,\u201d Harding recommended that \u201cRivera be de[a]lt with in a manner that will show the victims of these incidents and the general public, that the Massachusetts State police will not tolerate these types of activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Colonel Thomas J. Fitzgerald, then deputy superintendent of the State police, reviewed the report and submitted it to Mc-Cabe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fitzgerald recommended that Rivera be terminated, and McCabe agreed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McCabe instructed Fitzgerald to draft a letter advising Rivera of the contemplated charges against him (i.e., conduct unbecoming an officer), and his options of either resigning or proceeding with a court martial, known as a special trial board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Fitzgerald\u2019s letter also stated Rivera \u201cmay be placed on permanent desk duty.\u201d McCabe testified at his deposition that such desk duty was not a disciplinary measure but a protective measure for the public, the department, and the officer, apparently while the charges were pending.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">McCabe did not have the authority to terminate Rivera directly, only to recommend to the trial board that such action be taken. See <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>McCabe, supra </em>at 501 n.10. The three-member trial board would have decided the accused trooper\u2019s guilt or innocence, and could recommend punishment up to and including discharge. If found guilty and terminated, Rivera could have appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the District Court. G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 9A (see St. 1971, c. 521), repealed by St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Rivera\u2019s attorney contacted McCabe and \u201ca plea bargaining session\u201d ensued. They discussed the fact \u2014 uncovered during a</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>civil rights suit brought by a minority officer against McCabe\u2019s predecessor \u2014 that in the past thirty years, no white person had been discharged from the State police for conduct unbecoming an officer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After a \u201cgreat deal of conversation and consideration,\u201d according to McCabe, the parties agreed that Rivera would be suspended without pay for six months and thereafter report to the State police stress unit for counselling, for a period of time to be determined by the deputy superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">McCabe testified at his deposition that he thought the punishment imposed \u201cwould be in the best interest of the department [and] the public, and give the officer an opportunity to straighten out his life.\u201d He acknowledged that the fact that Rivera was Cape Verdean weighed in his decision not to recommend termination, based on the department\u2019s previous experience with a civil rights suit by a minority officer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrary to the motion judge\u2019s determination, however, McCabe\u2019s deposition testimony indicated that he \u201cwas not ... in fear of any threat of a lawsuit.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> What he feared, according to his testimony, was having an appellate court overturn any decision to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Rivera, resulting in Rivera\u2019s returning to work and \u201cgetting] a big reward of money for not having worked [which] would have had a debilitating effect on the department.\u201d Furthermore, McCabe testified that Rivera\u2019s ethnicity was only one consideration. McCabe also kept in mind that he had \u201can obligation to protect the public ... an obligation to protect the department. And ... an obligation to protect the individual [because Rivera] was one of [McCabe\u2019s] employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Rivera waived his right to a trial board hearing and was suspended from duty from August 1, 1988, through January 31, 1989. The suspension resulted in a loss to Rivera of about $25,000, based on an average trooper\u2019s salary plus overtime, court time and details. After returning to duty, Rivera received counselling, as ordered, from the State police department\u2019s psychological services unit, commonly known as \u201cthe stress unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The stress unit assisted employees with personal problems such as emotional or mental illness, alcohol abuse, or domestic problems. The members of the stress unit, including one who possessed a master\u2019s degree in social work, functioned as a \u201ccrisis intervention team\u201d and provided counselling to State police employees. If the members were unqualified to handle an employee\u2019s particular issue, they referred the employee to outside professionals such as psychologists or psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Following his return to work, Rivera saw Richard Kelly, a member of the stress unit. Kelly possessed a bachelor of science degree in psychology and a master\u2019s degree in counselor education. Kelly estimated he counselled more than 1,200 people during his twelve years working in the stress unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">McCabe acknowledged in his deposition that he believed the stress unit was inadequate to address Rivera\u2019s needs, but he believed the unit had \u201coutsourced\u201d Rivera for appropriate treatment. McCabe, however, did not order the unit to do so. Once McCabe had approved the six-month suspension and the order for Rivera to report to the stress unit, it became the deputy superintendent\u2019s responsibility to see that the punishment was carried out. McCabe himself did not follow up with the stress unit or otherwise monitor Rivera\u2019s behavior after Rivera returned to active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Rivera was reassigned as a \u201croad trooper\u201d after his suspension ended. There were no restrictions placed on his duties. After returning to work in 1989, Rivera did not come before McCabe for any further disciplinary action. McCabe retired from State service in February, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials, in the course of performing discretionary tasks, from liability for civil damages \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). \u201cOn a motion for summary judgment, \u2018the relevant question is whether a reasonable official could have believed his actions were lawful in light of clearly established law and the information the official possessed at the time of his allegedly unlawful conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>FebusRodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, </em>14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 1994), quoting <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir. 1991). First, however, the plaintiff must demonstrate that McCabe violated her federally protected rights under \u00a7 1983. See <em>FebusRodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, supra. </em>We must determine, therefore, whether the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that McCabe violated her constitutional rights, and if so, whether he is otherwise entitled to qualified immunity. See <em>id.; </em>Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">a. <em>Deliberate indifference. </em>To establish her claim of supervisory liability, the plaintiff must show that the relevant law was clearly established, such that McCabe knew or should have known that Rivera\u2019s conduct would violate a constitutional right of a third person. See <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 646-647, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989). In addition, she must also prove that McCabe acted with \u201creckless or callous indifference\u201d to those constitutional rights of third persons. See <em>Febus-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, supra </em>at 92. Finally, \u201cthere must be an \u2018affirmative link\u2019 between the supervisory official\u2019s acts or omissions and his subordinate\u2019s violation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir. 1989), and <em>Lipsett </em>v. <em>University of P .R., </em>864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>McCabe makes no argument that in 1988 the law was not clearly established and thus he did not or should not have known that Rivera\u2019s harassment of female motorists would violate their constitutional rights. In our view, such a position would have been untenable. See <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, supra </em>at 650 (declaring that police supervisors in 1978 could be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for not protecting motorists from abusive officer). We therefore need not discuss that element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and proceed to the question of \u201creckless or callous indifference\u201d (also called \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">A supervisor may be liable under \u00a7 1983 if his \u201cconduct or inaction amounted to a reckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of others.\u201d <em>Barreto-Rivera </em>v. <em>Medina-Vargas, </em>168 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 1999), quoting <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, supra </em>at 562. \u201cAn official displays such reckless or callous indifference when it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>868 F.2d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1989). We note that there is no significant difference between cases that utilize the standard of \u201cgross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference\u201d and those that employ \u201creckless or callous indifference.\u201d See <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, supra. </em>\u201cIndifference that rises to the level of being defiberate, reckless, or callous suffices to establish [supervisory] liability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>FebusRodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, supra </em>at 92 n.4, quoting <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u201cTo demonstrate defiberate indifference a plaintiff must show (1) a grave risk of harm, (2) [McCabe\u2019s] actual or constructive knowledge of that risk, and (3) his failure to take easily available measures to address the risk.\u201d <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1105 (1999), citing <em>Manarite </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>957 F.2d 953, 956 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 837 (1992). \u201c \u2018[Deliberate indifference\u2019 is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a [State] actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">To demonstrate the triability of the defiberate indifference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>element, the plaintiff introduced the affidavit of Lou Reiter, a former Los Angeles deputy police chief with thirty-nine years of police experience, training, and professional involvement in police supervisory, management, and personnel practices. Reiter opined that McCabe \u201cmade a conscious choice to not use reasonable police supervisory techniques to change Rivera\u2019s attitude, behavior and performance deficiencies.\u201d One such technique, according to Reiter, would be committing Rivera involuntarily to professional psychological services. Other practices included evaluating citations to determine the percentage of females versus males stopped by Rivera; contacting females that Rivera stopped and inquiring about his conduct; and putting someone such as an undercover officer \u201cin the field\u201d as a motorist, to be stopped by Rivera so as to evaluate his behavior. Reiter stated that \u201c[t]here is no indication that any of these [techniques] were even considered by the State Police and Commissioner McCabe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">However, even if McCabe\u2019s failure to take these or similar steps could be seen as negligent, it does not rise to the level of callous indifference. \u201cAlthough . . . [McCabe] might have done more, such a rule is not the standard by which we judge [his] conduct.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>13 F.3d 791, 801 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 813, and 513 U.S. 814 (1994). After conferring with Rivera\u2019s attorney and considering the best interests of all those involved, including the State police department, McCabe imposed a six-month suspension, a financially weighty punishment that cost Rivera an estimated $25,000. In addition, McCabe ordered Rivera to receive treatment through the department\u2019s stress unit for what he believed to be Rivera\u2019s emotional problems. We do not view these disciplinary actions as a \u201cfailure to take easily available measures\u201d to address the risk that Rivera would reoffend.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, supra </em>at 7. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>McCabe believed that if he allowed Rivera to return to active duty, the trooper would continue to harass female motorists.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Northern Essex Community College, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 800 (2002) (vacating summary judgment \u201con this record\u201d as to whether college responded reasonably or indifferently to knowledge of coach\u2019s sexual misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In our view, as a matter of law, McCabe \u201csimply did not exhibit the . . . \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to constitutional injuries\u201d required to impose liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>717 F.2d 932, 936 (4th Cir. 1983). See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Little Rock, </em>152 F.3d 790, 800 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that ten-day suspension for prior sexual misconduct of officer accused of rape did not demonstrate \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wellham, </em>104 F.3d 620, 626-627 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that one month unpaid suspension of officer for alleged rape, coupled with transfer to desk duty and order to attend counselling, while perhaps imprudent or even negligent, did not constitute \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d). Cf. <em>Barreto-Rivera </em>v. <em>Medina-Vargas, </em>168 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 1999) (deeming evidence sufficient to show deliberate indifference where officer had been disciplined thirty times, including six incidents leading to recommendations of dismissal; supervisor imposed fifteen-day suspension despite investigator\u2019s recommendation for dismissal, and later reduced another thirty-day suspension to two days). There is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that McCabe had failed to take adequate disciplinary measures against Rivera in prior multiple instances of violation of citizens\u2019 rights. Cf. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, supra </em>at 800. Rather McCabe acted promptly and forcefully in addressing the first report that he received of misconduct by Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Clancy also has failed to show that McCabe\u2019s action or omission was affirmatively linked to her injuries. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, supra </em>at 7 (stating that in addition to showing defendant\u2019s deliberate indifference, plaintiff must demonstrate causation). \u201c[M]ere cause-in-fact does not suffice to establish the required affirmative link. If that were the test, every depredation of this sort would give rise to [supervisory] liability, for every \u00a7 1983 claimant harmed by such employee conduct could \u2018point to something the [supervisor] \u201ccould have done\u201d to prevent the unfortunate incident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wellham, supra </em>at 627, quoting <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 392 (1989). Rather, this affirmative connection requires something more, such as \u201ctacit approval of, acquiescence in, or purposeful disregard of, rights-violating conduct.\u201d <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, supra, </em>citing <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Here, the six-month unpaid suspension, while obviously a lesser punishment than termination, was sufficiently onerous to make clear that the department did not condone Rivera\u2019s conduct. In light of the department\u2019s initial pursuit of termination, it also signified that any further infraction would result in more severe discipline. This is not a case where the sanction imposed was so slight as to communicate the impression that Rivera could continue harassing female motorists without consequence. Cf. <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 563 (1st Cir. 1989) (despite concerns about officer\u2019s behavior and knowledge of numerous civilian complaints against officer, supervisor gave him positive performance evaluations and continued to send him out on active duty; on \u201cone or two occasions\u201d he assigned officer to desk duty, officer demanded to be returned to street and supervisor complied); <em>Lipsett </em>v. <em>University of P.R., </em>864 F.2d 881, 914 (1st. Cir. 1988) (supervisors\u2019 reliance on biased complaints against plaintiff could amount to \u201cencouragement or condonation of or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>acquiescence in\u201d sexually discriminatory behavior of subordinates). While the plaintiff may not have been injured but for McCabe\u2019s decision to keep Rivera on the force, this evidence is insufficient to establish the requisite link.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">b. <em>Qualified immunity. </em>Although we conclude that summary judgment might have been granted solely on the plaintiff\u2019s inability to prove the essential elements of reckless indifference and causation, see <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991), Federal case law suggests the need to inquire into McCabe\u2019s asserted defense of qualified immunity as well. See, e.g., <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, supra </em>at 7 (\u201cThe inquiry into qualified immunity is separate and distinct from the inquiry into the merits [of the plaintiff\u2019s case]. ... In some circumstances, however, these inquiries overlap\u201d). See also <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 502 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As we stated at the outset of our discussion, the relevant inquiry on summary judgment as to the defense of qualified immunity is whether a reasonable official could have believed his actions were lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by the official at the time he acted. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987); <em>FebusRodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, </em>14 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 1994). When so inquiring, we think it important to bear in mind the policy that informs the qualified immunity doctrine, namely \u201cthe need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982), quoting <em>Butz </em>v. <em>Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 506 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra, </em>the Supreme Court removed the subjective aspect, i.e., the actor\u2019s intent, from the qualified immunity standard it had articulated in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 815-818. The \u201cdriving force\u201d behind this reformulation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>doctrine was the Court\u2019s desire \u201cthat \u2018insubstantial claims\u2019 against government officials be resolved prior to discovery and on summary judgment if possible.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 640 n.2, quoting <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 818-819. In short, \u201c[ijmmunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228 (1991), citing <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 527-529 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Denying summary judgment in order to permit inquiries into McCabe\u2019s subjective state of mind contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s intent to restrict the question of qualified immunity to \u201can objective inquiry into the legal reasonableness of the official action.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 645, citing <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 815-820. Thus, although \u201creasonableness\u201d is often a classic question for the finder of fact, in cases such as this the reasonableness of the official\u2019s action should be treated as a question of law. See <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Clancy complains that Rivera reported to the stress unit only a few times on his return and received grossly inadequate treatment and supervision, and furthermore that McCabe failed to monitor Rivera\u2019s treatment or performance once he returned to active duty. Our focus, however, is confined to the reasonableness of McCabe\u2019s order. First, as previously noted, McCabe imposed a lengthy and financially costly suspension on Rivera for behavior that clearly violated existing law. Recognizing that Rivera needed treatment, McCabe also directed him to the stress unit to seek such treatment, and delegated to Fitzgerald, the deputy superintendent, the responsibility of overseeing Rivera\u2019s return. There is no requirement that McCabe, who oversaw the entire Department of Public Safety, including the 1,200 to 1,400 employees of the State police department alone, personally supervise each subordinate over the course of that subordinate\u2019s discipline. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Zapata, </em>175 F.3d 41, 46 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (\u201cFor bureaucratic structures [or any other form of social organization] to function, the ability to delegate responsibility and to trust the judgments of others is essential\u201d). Nor is there any basis for claiming that delegation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>responsibility to Fitzgerald was itself unreasonable. Indeed, Fitzgerald was the one who had recommended firing Rivera after reviewing the results of the internal affairs investigation; there was no reason to believe that Fitzgerald would not see to it that Rivera and the stress unit follow through with an appropriate plan of treatment on Rivera\u2019s return. In sum, a reasonable official could have believed his actions were lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by McCabe at the time he acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We do not wish to minimize the severe trauma and humiliation that Rivera caused the plaintiff to suffer, which she described in graphic detail in a written statement contained in the record. However, as a matter of law, the plaintiff has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue that Mc-Cabe violated her constitutional rights. See <em>Febus-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, supra </em>at 94. Moreover, McCabe \u201cacted reasonably under settled law in the circumstances,\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 228, and thus he was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The order denying summary judgment for McCabe is reversed.

In <em>Dobos, </em>the court determined that four police supervisors were deliberately indifferent largely because they \u201cchose to ignore\u201d the officer\u2019s history of misconduct before disciplining and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>subsequently returning him to highway duty (for the second time) with no monitoring or other probationary conditions. See <em>id. </em>at 656-658. Here, after considering the comprehensive internal affairs report on Rivera, McCabe not only suspended the trooper for six months without pay, but also ordered him to report to the stress unit. McCabe delegated oversight of the latter component of the sanction to Deputy Superintendent Fitzgerald, the supervisor who had recommended that Rivera be terminated. Such delegation was not unreasonable and provides insufficient evidence on which to rest a determination of deliberate indifference. See <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Tunica County, </em>222 F.

I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s opinion, because, in my view, the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to reach a jury on the question whether the defendant\u2019s supervision of Rivera was so insufficient as to amount to deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of female motorists. As the court correctly notes, <em>ante </em>at 318, to prove that a particular supervisor\u2019s actions or inactions amounted to deliberate indifference, the plaintiff must show that (1) there existed a grave risk of harm, (2) the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances that created that risk, and (3) the supervisor failed to take easily available measures to correct the problem. <em>Figueroa-Torres </em>v. <em>Toledo-Davila, </em>232 F.3d 270, 279 (1st Cir. 2000). In addition, the plaintiff must show that the supervisor\u2019s action or inaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>caused the plaintiff\u2019s harm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1105 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On this record, the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that Rivera\u2019s behavior created a grave risk of harm to female motorists. Furthermore, it is undisputed that in 1988 the defendant had actual notice of both a pattern of Rivera\u2019s menacing conduct toward female motorists and the severe sanctions recommended by the internal affairs unit. Specifically, on February 22, 1988, the defendant was presented with a report by the internal affairs unit of its investigation of Rivera\u2019s behavior. The report included detailed descriptions of complaints made by four female motorists against Rivera for inappropriate conduct, and mentioned that Rivera had been warned several times that his conduct could jeopardize his future employment with the State police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Captain Wayne Harding of the internal affairs unit concluded that Rivera was \u201cunfit to carry on the affairs of his office in a professional and creditable manner.\u201d Harding characterized Rivera\u2019s actions \u201cin dealing with the female motoring public [as] totally inappropriate and unprofessional,\u201d and opined that Rivera had \u201cat the very least an unstable, emotional attitude in dealing with female motorists.\u201d Harding concluded the report by recommending that Rivera be dealt with \u201cin a manner that will show the victims of these incidents and the general public, that the Massachusetts State Police will not tolerate these types of activities.\u201d Harding\u2019s opinion, inherent in the report, was that Rivera should not be allowed to continue as a trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The jury also could have concluded that the defendant, possessed of this actual knowledge of Rivera\u2019s improper conduct, failed to take easily available measures to correct the problem. <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 657-658, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989) (finding deliberate indifference where supervisors failed to impose proper safeguards on return to duty of trooper disciplined for prior abusive conduct toward motoring public). See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, supra </em>at 12-14 (supervisor hable where he was on notice of subordinate\u2019s behavior likely to result in violation of citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, but failed to \u201ctake obvious steps within his power to reduce or eliminate that risk\u201d). On receiving the report and discussing it with the deputy superintendent of the State police, who recommended that Rivera be terminated, the defendant initially decided to recommend that Rivera be discharged for \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d However, after negotiations with Rivera\u2019s counsel (as discussed <em>infra), </em>the defendant concluded that Rivera should be suspended without pay for six months and, on his return, be required to report to the State police counselling unit (also known as the \u201cstress unit\u201d or \u201cstress team\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he believed that the stress unit would not be able properly to address Rivera\u2019s needs. Nevertheless, he neither ordered that the stress unit refer Rivera to an outside professional, nor followed up with the stress unit on Rivera\u2019s progress. After returning from suspension, Rivera reported to the stress unit. Rivera testified at his deposition that he could not remember whether he had met with members of the \u201cstress team\u201d more than three times; he claimed he did not even know why he had been referred there. Rivera was reassigned as a road trooper with no restrictions on his road duties, no further discipline, no evaluation of his treatment from the stress unit, and no measures instituted to monitor his behavior.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Contrary to the court\u2019s assertion, <em>ante </em>at 314-316, the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>through the defendant\u2019s own deposition testimony, amply supports the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant agreed not to recommend that Rivera be discharged because Rivera\u2019s counsel threatened to bring a racial discrimination suit against the department of State police on the ground that it had never terminated a white officer for \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d See <em>Simplex Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 196, 197 (1999) (in reviewing summary judgment, appellate court will \u201cresolve all evidentiary inferences in favor\u201d of non-moving party). The threat of a lawsuit does not justify the defendant\u2019s failure to take adequate steps to discipline Rivera and thereby prevent future violations of constitutional rights of female motorists. In addition, to the extent that the defendant\u2019s motivation is an issue of material fact, it cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. Mass. R. Civ. R 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>SeeAugat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Furthermore, there is sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of an affirmative causal link between the defendant\u2019s conduct toward Rivera and Rivera\u2019s subsequent violation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir. 1994) (\u201cA causal link may ... be forged if there exists a known history of [a subordinate\u2019s] widespread abuse sufficient to alert a supervisor to ongoing violations [and] the supervisor . . . fails to take [adequate] corrective action, [such as] by . . . closer oversight . . . \u201d). On this record, a jury could have concluded that, with \u201ceven the minimal amount of proper supervision and discipline,\u201d Rivera would not have been in the position to illegally strip search the plaintiff in November of 1992. See <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 564 (1st Cir. 1989). A jury may have found that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the defendant not been deliberately indifferent to his duties, he would have taken appropriate steps to remedy \u201cthe Rivera problem\u201d well before November of 1992. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Finally, it goes without saying that police work, like teaching and medicine, is a line of work that intersects with many, if not all, sectors of society. The police perform a variety of roles: they serve the community by protecting life and property, preventing crime, enforcing the law, and upholding order for all citizens. One of the most important police functions is to create and maintain a feeling of security in communities. To that end, it is extremely important for the police to gain and preserve the public trust, maintain public confidence in the integrity of police officers, and avoid an abuse of power by law enforcement officials. In the context of this case, motorists, while anticipating the possibility of being stopped by the police for a traffic violation, trust that they will not then be subjected to extreme abuse and humiliation. Although Rivera\u2019s behavior alone betrayed that trust, the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cshow the victims of these incidents and the general public that the Massachusetts State Police will not tolerate these types of activities\u201d undermined that trust even more. Cf. <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 709 (1999) (Ireland, J., concurring, with whom Abrams and Marshall, JJ., joined) (\u201cUnderlying ... the entire relationship between school and family is the parents\u2019 basic assumption that school officials will do all they can to protect the children who they entrust to the school\u2019s care\u201d). In my opinion, police officials should, at the very least, \u201cbe expected to take reasonable measures to protect [the public] when they have advance notice of danger,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 710, especially when that danger comes from their own subordinates.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The third element of a supervisory liability claim, namely the requirement that the relevant law be clearly established so that the supervisor knew or should have known that his actions or inactions would lead to violation of constitutional rights of others, is not in dispute. See <em>ante </em>at 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">While \u201cthe failure of a police department to discipline in a specific instance\u201d has been held insufficient to support a claim of deliberate indifference, <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>891 F.2d 373, 382 (1st Cir. 1989), supervisors have been found liable for failing to take remedial action against subordinates after multiple complaints, especially for use of inadequate disciplinary systems effectively permitting officers to continue to violate citizens\u2019 rights. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>13 F.3d 791, 800 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 813, and 513 U.S. 814 (1994) (supervisor\u2019s inaction in light of three complaints concerning subordinate\u2019s use of excessive force raised genuine issue of material fact whether supervisor acted with deliberate indifference); <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 563-564 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Rivera was never required to acknowledge any wrongdoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Lou Reiter, a retired deputy chief for the Los Angeles police department and an expert consultant and instructor on police practices, stated in his affidavit that any discipline of Rivera short of discharge should have incorporated easily available police supervisory practices and techniques to curb similar misconduct by Rivera in the future. According to Reiter, some of such easily available and reasonable measures that the defendant could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>taken, but did not, included having supervisors (1) evaluate Rivera\u2019s citations, warnings, and recorded stops to determine the percentage of females versus males stopped to identify imbalance and alert the supervisors to possible discriminatory stops; (2) conduct \u201ccall-backs\u201d to females stopped by Rivera to evaluate Rivera\u2019s performance, demeanor, and conduct during these stops; and (3) initiate an \u201cintegrity check\u201d for Rivera by putting an undercover officer or a cooperating citizen in a position to be encountered in the field by Rivera, and evaluating his conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
