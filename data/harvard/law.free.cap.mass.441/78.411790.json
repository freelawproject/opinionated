L. c. 32, the retirement systems and pensions statute, the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC), may define \u201cearned income\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A, to include a distribution of corporate profits to a salaried shareholder-employee. We conclude that PERAC may so define \u201cearned income\u201d and affirm the decision of the Superior Court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. In 1978, the Boston Retirement Board (retirement board) granted accidental disability retirement benefits to Paul Theodos,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had retired from the Boston police department. In 1986, Theodos and his brother started \u201cFour T\u2019s Fuel Stop,\u201d a Subchapter S corporation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which Theodos now owns in equal shares with his son and daughter. Theodos works at \u201cFour T\u2019s\u201d approximately four hours a day and serves as its treasurer and clerk. His gross salary is $250 per week. For the 1997 calendar year, Theodos reported $13,250 in W-2 earnings. He also received what he and his children refer to as a \u201cshareholder distribution\u201d of $38,158 from \u201cFour T\u2019s.\u201d In November, 1998, the retirement board notified Theodos that he was required to refund a portion of the pension he received in 1997, in the amount of $11,497.86.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Theodos objected and requested a hearing before the retirement board. .</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>On December 30, 1998, responding to inquiries from local retirement boards,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> PERAC issued a memorandum clarifying the definition of \u201cearned income\u201d as used in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A, and instructed boards to use this definition in determining whether a disability retiree is \u201cover-earning\u201d under that section.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to this definition, Theodos\u2019s profit distribution from \u201cFour T\u2019s\u201d would constitute \u201cearned income.\u201d However, the retirement board hearing officer who conducted a hearing on Theodos\u2019s case concluded that Theodos\u2019s $38,158 profit distribution was not \u201cearned income\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91 A. The retirement board adopted the officer\u2019s finding and so informed PERAC. PERAC notified the retirement board that its determination was incorrect as a matter of law and directed the retirement board to recover the excess amount of $11,497.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Theodos appealed from PERAC\u2019s determination to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), and the retirement board intervened. An administrative magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) heard the matter, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4), made findings of fact, and reversed PERAC\u2019s decision. PERAC objected to the decision and sought further review from CRAB, which adopted the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, but concluded that PERAC acted properly when it defined \u201cearned income\u201d to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Theodos' s profit distribution. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the retirement board sought judicial review of CRAB's decision. A Superior Court judge affirmed CRAB's decision, and the retirement board appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">2. Discussion. The retirement board's principal claim is that PERAC's memorandum defining \"earned income\" for purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A, is invalid because it conflicts with the statutory language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 91A, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\"Every person pensioned or retired under any general or special law for disability, including accidental disability, shall in each year. . . file with [PERAC] a statement, in such form as [PERAC] shall prescribe, certifying the full amount of his earnings from earned income during the preceding year\" (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 1, which defines \"words and phrases as used in sections one to twenty-eight inclusive,\" defines \"[a]nnual gross earned income\" as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\"income earned by a retired member under aiiy provision of this chapter, and referring to compensation earned for performing personal services actually performed, including wages, salaries, fees, commissions or gratuities, or similar income, during each calendar year.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The retirement board contends that the definition of \"[a]nnual gross earned income\" in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, applies to \"earned income\" in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91A. We disagree. The pthnary source of legislative intent is the piain language of the statute. Hoffman v. Howmedica, Inc., 373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). The Legislature has expressly limited the application of \u00a7 1, and therefore, the definition of \"[a]nnual gross earned income\" therein, to \"sections one to twenty-eight inclusive.\" When the Legislature adopted the definition in \u00a7 1 in 1982, see St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 6, \u00a7 91A referred to \"gainful occupation.\" The term \"earned income\" did not replace \"gainful occupation\" in \u00a7 91A until 1996. See St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 50. Had the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>intended \u00a7 l\u2019s definition to be used in \u00a7 91 A, it presumably would have so stated when it amended G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91 A, in 1996. The fact that the Legislature chose not to employ a term it recently had defined indicates that \u201cearned income,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 91A, and \u201c[a]nnual gross earned income\u201d in \u00a7 1, are not one and the same. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 582-583 (1994) (Legislature presumed to be. aware of existing statutes).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Even if the definition of \u201c[a]nnual gross earned income\u201d in \u00a7 1 applies to \u201cearned income\u201d in \u00a7 91 A, PERAC\u2019s definition would still be a reasonable interpretation. Where an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable, the court should not supplant it with its own judgment. <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375 (2000), and cases cited. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 1, defines \u201c[ajnnual gross earned income\u201d as \u201ccompensation earned for performing personal services actually performed, including wages, salaries, fees, commissions or gratuities, or <em>similar income, </em>during each calendar year\u201d (emphasis added). All the items listed (e.g., wages, salaries) require \u201csome labor, management or supervision.\u201d See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, PERAC\u2019s interpretation is consistent with \u201csimilar income\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">PERAC\u2019s definition of \u201cearned income\u201d is a reasonable interpretation of the statute on its face, thereby suggesting that it is consistent with legislative intent. A characteristic of closely held corporations is that shareholders are actively employed by the corporation in some capacity and receive what would \u201e ordinarily be corporate profits as compensation in their capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>as employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These earnings, regardless of the form in which the shareholder-employee receives them or how they are labeled, are \u201cearned income.\u201d The shareholder works for these earnings, and therefore, they are not what would generally be considered a distribution from a passive investment. Accordingly, PERAC\u2019s definition includes the type of income the Legislature intended to be included as \u201cearnings from earned income\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 91A and is plainly consistent with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We interpret a statute to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986). The purpose of \u00a7 91A is to prevent the overpayment of retirement benefits to individuals who are, by their labor, management, or supervision, earning a significant amount of money while simultaneously receiving a disability allowance. PERAC\u2019s definition furthers this purpose because it prevents disability retirees such as Theodos from circumventing the statute by labeling such earnings as something other than what they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We address the retirement board\u2019s remaining claims in turn. The retirement board argues that PERAC was required to follow the formal rulemaking procedures of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 50, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, when it issued its memorandum. The Administrative Procedure Act defines a \u201cRegulation\u201d as including \u201cthe whole or any part of every rule, regulation, standard or other requirement of general application and future effect.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5). In 1970, the Legislature deleted the words \u201cinterpretation thereof\u201d from the definition of \u201cregulation.\u201d Compare St. 1970, c. 712, \u00a7 2, with St. 1969, c. 808, \u00a7 2. Formal rule making is unnecessary \u201cwhere the agency is intending to fill in the details or clear up an ambiguity of an established policy, rather than to inaugurate a material change of policy.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 705, 707 (1977). See <em>Atlas Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>354 Mass. 408, 414 (1968) (\u201creinterpretation of the reasoning behind the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>existing rules\u201d not rule or regulation under G. L. c. 30A). PERAC\u2019s memorandum is not a \u201cregulation\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5), and therefore did not require formal rule making procedures. PERAC circulated the memorandum after receiving inquiries from local boards concerning the definition of \u201cearned income.\u201d Thus, the memorandum was issued only to clear up an ambiguity and fill in gaps for determining what constitutes \u201cearned, income\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 91A. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The retirement board argues that it would be arbitrary and capricious to apply PERAC\u2019s interpretation retroactively to Theodos\u2019s 1997 earnings. This argument was not raised in the CRAB proceedings and, therefore, was waived. <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 125-126 (1985), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The retirement board challenges PERAC\u2019s authority to reverse its determination regarding Theodos\u2019s excess retirement allowance. PERAC has broad statutory authority to oversee the public employee retirement system. <em>Barnstable County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 341, 345 (1997) (discussing PERAC\u2019s predecessor). See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21 (1) <em>(d) </em>(PERAC \u201cmay review all accidental and ordinary disability pensions . . . granted by the retirement boards\u201d); G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21 (3) (PERAC \u201cshall be the technical advisor of the board of each such system . . . and shall perform such actuarial duties as are required . . . including, but not limited to ... the approval of the amount of allowances under the provisions of said chapters\u201d); G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21 (4) (PERAC \u201cshall promulgate such rules and regulations as . . . necessary from time to time to effectuate the purposes of this chapter\u201d). Furthermore, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21 (4), empowers PERAC to \u201capprove any . . . determinations of any board in order to effectuate\u201d the chapter\u2019s purposes. The power to \u201capprove\u201d determinations of local retirement boards is a \u201cbroad grant of review authority,\u201d <em>Plymouth County Retirement Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Employee Retirement, </em>410 Mass. 307, 312 (1991), and necessarily implies the lesser power to \u201cdisapprove\u201d or \u201creverse\u201d a local retirement board\u2019s determination. Cf. <em>Mello </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019n of Revere, </em>435 Mass. 532, 534-535 (2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>and cases cited. PERAC\u2019s directive reversing the retirement board\u2019s determination and ordering it to recoup Theodos\u2019s excess earnings pursuant to \u00a7 91 A, was a proper exercise of PERAC\u2019s authority pursuant to G. L. c. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Finally, the retirement board claims that the PERAC appointee\u2019s bias or prejudice precluded him from participating in CRAB\u2019s review of the DALA magistrate\u2019s decision. The rule of necessity required the PERAC representative\u2019s participation. CRAB consists of three members: an assistant attorney general, a PERAC representative, and the Governor\u2019s appointee. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4). At the time this matter was reviewed, CRAB consisted of only two members because the Governor had not yet appointed the third member. Pursuant to the rule of necessity, \u201ca member of an administrative board who is biased or prejudiced ... is not required to withdraw from the hearing if no other board can hear and determine the matter, especially if his withdrawal would deprive the board of the number of members required to take a valid affirmative vote.\u201d <em>Moran </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Littleton, </em>317 Mass. 591, 593 (1945), and cases cited. CRAB validly invoked the \u201crule of necessity.\u201d Removing PERAC\u2019s representative from the review process would have left CRAB without a quorum to take valid action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Theodos is not a party to this appeal and, for reasons not apparent in the record, did not seek review of the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">A Subchapter S corporation is a small business corporation that satisfies various criteria of the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement that there be no more than seventy-five shareholders and that the shareholders (with limited exceptions) be individuals.

The language quoted by the retirement board modifies language within the definition (\u201cincome earned\u201d or, conceivably, \u201cretired member\u201d).
