The victims were his children. A divided panel of the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 390 (2002). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The principal issue we consider is whether the motion judge made an adequate determination of privilege under the protocol set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993) <em>(Bishop), </em>when she denied the defendant\u2019s motion for the production of the victims\u2019 Department of Social Services (department) and Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC) counselling records. We conclude that the motion judge erroneously bypassed stage 1 of the <em>Bishop </em>protocol when she made no determination whether a proper privilege had been asserted and applied to the records sought, and instead proceeded to find that the defendant had not met the relevancy requirements applicable to stage 2 of the protocol. We therefore remand the case to the Superior Court for a further hearing to determine whether the records sought were in fact privileged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>The background of this case is described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the Appeals Court opinion. We set forth only those facts relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">At a pretrial motion hearing held on October 30, 1996, the defendant sought production of all records in the custody of the department and MSPCC regarding the two alleged victims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reply to the judge\u2019s inquiry into the privileged status of the records, the Commonwealth stated, \u201cmost of it is going to be social worker privilege,\u201d and then continued to argue, \u201cwhether or not they\u2019re privileged, they don\u2019t make the standard under [Mass. R. Crim. P. 14, 378 Mass. 874 (1979),] for relevancy.\u201d On November 4, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, finding that the defendant had failed sufficiently to establish the relevance of the records as required by <em>Bishop</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>In <em>Bishop, </em>we established a five-stage procedure to follow in the event that a defendant seeks to obtain the production of potentially privileged documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have since modified the relevance threshold that defendants must meet to secure ex\u00e1mination of privileged documents, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996) <em>(Fuller), </em>but have maintained intact the procedures set forth in <em>Bishop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJh\">The purpose of the <em>Bishop </em>protocol is the achievement of a proper balancing of defendants\u2019 constitutional right to examine and present all evidence relevant to their defense and society\u2019s interests (expressed in the form of statutory privileges) in maintaining confidential relationships. See <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 176. Because it is premised on a balancing of these competing interests, <em>Bishop </em>a priori requires the claim and identification of a privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 181. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224-226 (discussing importance of privilege at stake). Without a claim of privilege, the basis for denying a defendant access to records that may contain information relevant to his defense may not exist. We therefore have made clear that a judge cannot bypass the initial privilege analysis on which the <em>Bishop </em>procedure depends, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>438 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>325, 337 (2002) <em>(Oliveira), </em>and must \u201cspecify in a written memorandum which privilege or privileges he or she finds actually apply.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>427 Mass. 427, 430 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In this case, there was no apparent claim of privilege by either the holder of the privilege or any of the providers of the counselling services, and the judge made no finding of what, if any, privilege applied to the records. The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion at the motion hearing that \u201cmost of\u201d the records were probably protected by the social worker privilege as set forth in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B, is inadequate to fill this gap. To begin with, the social worker privilege is not one that the Commonwealth can assert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the statute plainly states, in connection with court proceedings, only a client (or guardian appointed on the client\u2019s behalf) may prevent a social worker from disclosing such communications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 330-332. In the absence of the assertion of this privilege, and a finding by the judge that it applied to the specific records sought, it was erroneous to decide the defendant\u2019s motion under the remainder of the <em>Bishop </em>protocol. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 487 (2003) (\u201cthere is no basis to invoke the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocol\u201d where \u201cno claimed privileges apply\u201d). As we expressed in <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 340, \u201c[i]t is only where a privilege is asserted and found to be applicable\u201d that the review required by <em>Bishop </em>occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Commonwealth argues that a finding that the social worker privilege applied to the records can be inferred in the motion judge\u2019s ruling. This is not supported by the record. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>transcript of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, and the judge\u2019s written decision on it, reflect that scant, if any, attention was paid to whether any or all of the records were privileged. Rather, the judge moved directly to a determination of relevance under <em>Bishop. </em>The judge\u2019s apparent conflating of the first two stages of <em>Bishop </em>suggests that she believed \u201cthat it was unnecessary to reach the privilege question because, in her view, the defendant had failed to satisfy the relevance requirements of <em>Bishop.'\u2019'\u2019 Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 406 (2002) (Brown, J., dissenting). This was error in light of the different and less demanding standard of relevance applicable to the defendant\u2019s right to obtain access to unprivileged records as compared to records for which a privilege has been asserted and found to apply. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, post </em>265, 267-268 (2004) (contrasting lower relevance standard applicable generally with more rigorous requirement under <em>Bishop </em>as augmented by <em>Fuller)', Oliveira, supra </em>at 338 (\u201cThe issue, then, is whether records that are not privileged, or as to which no privilege has been asserted, can be withheld .... [W]e conclude that they cannot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth contends that, regardless of privilege, the defendant\u2019s proffer failed to surmount the relevance threshold necessary for the production of records generally, and that the judge therefore properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion on that ground.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. Such a conclusion is not supported by either the judge\u2019s written decision or by the substance of the defendant\u2019s proffer. The threshold for the production of records generally is whether they would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a \u201crational tendency to prove [or disprove] an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269-270, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989). See Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979); Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (2); <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 339-340. The judge did not apply this standard. She attributed her conclusion that the defendant\u2019s showing of relevance was insufficient due to the \u201cprecepts articulated in <em>[Bishop],\u201d </em>as amplified by <em>Fuller, </em>to the cases that established the more exacting standard required to gain access to records found to be privileged. Moreover, it is apparent that the defendant\u2019s proffer satisfies the standard required for the production of unprivileged material. The credibility of the children\u2019s accusations is the central issue in the case. Whether the accusations were the product of coaching or of repeated leading questions, especially where they arose in the context of an acrimonious marital dissolution, and appeared to change over time, may have a significant bearing on credibility, and the department and MSPCC counselling records that the defendant seeks may have a \u201crational tendency to prove [or disprove]\u201d it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, supra. </em>See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 615 (2000), <em>S.C., </em>438 Mass. 325 (2002) (finding defendant\u2019s proffer that allegations of abuse arose during \u201c \u2018tumultuous time\u2019 in . . . family home\u201d sufficient to justify access to treatment records as records likely relevant to credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Therefore, we remand the case to the Superior Court for a further hearing at which the judge must determine whether a privilege applies to any of the records at issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If so, the judge must make written findings to that effect, and the defendant may, if he wishes, proceed to stage 2. If no privilege is found to apply to some or to any of the records, the judge must allow the defendant access to the unprivileged records, so that he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>consider whether being deprived of them at trial made his trial unfair.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; the Victim Rights Law Center; the Massachusetts Bar Association; the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>National Sexual Violence Resource Center, and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; Jane Doe Inc.; the district attorney for the Middlesex district, the district attorney for the Bristol district, and the Department of Social Services; the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, the Attorney General, and the Massachusetts Office for Victim Assistance.

In the affidavit the attorney asserted that the context in which the children interacted with the Department of Social Services (department) and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC) \u2014 after the defendant and his wife had separated before their divorce, while the children were living with the wife \u2014 indicated that their accusations of sexual abuse might be unreliable, and specifically alleged that the accusations may have been motivated by animosity between the defendant and his wife during their divorce, that they arose \u201cin response to repeated and somewhat leading questions,\u201d and that the department and MSPCC records might therefore contain \u201cevidence of coaching or inconsistent statements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We set forth the judge\u2019s written decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u201cThe defendant here is accused of molesting [the children] and asks this court to order production of [department] and counselling records generated since the children \u2018disclosed\u2019 the alleged abuse. Certain of the children\u2019s confidential psychiatric records have already been provided to defense counsel including the medical records prepared by the psychiatrist to whom the children originally made their disclosures. This prior disclosure of records suggests that concerns as to the confidentiality of the records requested have less urgency than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>confidentiality concerns raised in [Commonwealth] v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 [(1996)]. Moreover, confidentiality was almost certainly not a motivating factor behind any participation in therapy by the children at issue. Nevertheless, this court feels compelled to deny the defendant\u2019s motion based on the precepts articulated in [Commonwealth] v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 [(1993)], as amplified by more recent judicial pronouncements on the general topic. . . . Cf. [Commonwealth] v. <em>Fuller, supra. </em>In short, the motion is denied based on an insufficien[cy] of relevance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">To summarize, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra, </em>requires that, \u201c[i]f the complainant or the keeper of the target records refuses to produce [them] because of a statutory privilege,\u201d the judge shall \u201cdecide whether the records are privileged,\u201d and in so doing \u201cshall reduce his or her decision, and the reasons therefor, to writing, with specific reference to the privilege or privileges claimed and found, if any\u201d (stage 1). <em>Id. </em>at 181. On a finding of privilege, the defendant must demonstrate that the records are \u201clikely to be relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. If the defendant meets this burden, the judge will review the records in camera (stage 2). <em>Id. </em>at 182. The judge must then allow counsel access to the records he or she has determined are relevant for examination (stage 3). <em>Id. </em>at 182. Finally, if after examination of the documents, the defendant makes a sufficient showing of need, the records may be disclosed to the trier of fact (stages 4 and 5). <em>Id. </em>at 182-183.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Citing <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 216, 218 (1995), the Appeals Court suggests that the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to protect privileged records means that it may assert privilege in the first place. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 394 (2002). See <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>This is not correct. There is a substantive difference between protecting records with respect to which a third party already has claimed a privilege and claiming a privilege on behalf of a third party. The ability to do the former neither requires nor suggests the ability to do the latter. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>438 Mass. 325, 337 n.13 (2002) <em>(Oliveira).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Appeals Court cited G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 135A and 135B, in reference to the social worker privilege. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, supra </em>at 395. We note that \u00a7 135A addresses social workers\u2019 general duty of confidentiality; the testimonial privilege that would be considered under the <em>Bishop </em>protocol is that set forth in \u00a7 135B. The social worker testimonial privilege is not self-executing. See <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 330-331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On appeal, the Commonwealth cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wanis, </em>426 Mass. 639, 644-645 (1998), to support its argument that a defendant seeking \u201cprivate but not privileged information [must make] a higher showing than mere relevance.\u201d In that case, we required a defendant seeking certain records from the internal affairs division of a police department to show a \u201cspecific, good faith reason for believing that the information is relevant to a material issue in the criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We predicated this requirement on our recognition that an \u201cinternal affairs division investigation of police misconduct often requires the cooperation of people . . . who may be reluctant to provide information against a police officer,\u201d and that the higher relevance threshold therefore would aid in \u201cpresenting] the integrity of the investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645. The <em>Wanis </em>case does not sweep as broadly as the Commonwealth suggests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">If the judge finds that an applicable privilege has been asserted, she also must determine whether it has been waived through the voluntary disclosure of other similar counselling records \u2014 an issue raised but not decided by the judge at the pretrial hearing and in her written ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion, and disputed by members of the Appeals Court panel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, </em>55 Mass.

App. Ct. 390, 403 (2002), we conclude that these arguments are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b282-5\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2SY\">(concurring, with whom Sosman, J., joins).

However, I adhere, as previously, to the view expressed by Justice Sosman, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>435 Mass. 183, 194 (2001) (Sosman, J., concurring), that the protocol governing access to these types of records is \u201cboth unduly cumbersome and constitutionally flawed.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
