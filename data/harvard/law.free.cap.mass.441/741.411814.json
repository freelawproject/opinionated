L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c). We have previously held that \u201coffenses,\u201d as used in \u00a7 14 (c), means convictions or adjudications, so that the Commonwealth may not introduce reports of nol pressed allegations of sexual assault. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 336 (2002). In this case, we must decide whether a police report concerning a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>sexual offense to which a defendant has pleaded guilty is admissible without redaction, when the same report also contains statements about an uncharged contemporaneous sexual assault. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In November, 2000, the Commonwealth commenced proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16, to commit Edward Given as a sexually dangerous person. After a finding of probable cause, the matter was tried before a jury in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that Given had been convicted in 1984 of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, and that he had pleaded guilty in 1991 to two indictments charging rape of a child, five indictments charging indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, and two indictments charging indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several of the charges to which Given pleaded guilty stemmed from a series of acts on a single day in 1990. One of Given\u2019s victims on that day, whom we shall call Francine, was the twelve year old mentally retarded niece of one of Given\u2019s friends. At trial, over Given\u2019s objection, the Commonwealth introduced an unredacted police report detailing Francine\u2019s allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the report, Given agreed to take Francine to the Roll-On America roller skating rink in Lancaster, but stopped at a house on the way and molested her. After they reached the rink, Given sexually assaulted her again in his locked motor vehicle. Francine reported that a six year old boy was also in the locked vehicle at the time of the assault, and that Given also attempted to molest him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given was never charged with the alleged assault on the six year old boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>At the conclusion of the trial, the jury rendered a special verdict finding that Given was a sexually dangerous person, and the trial judge ordered him committed to the treatment center for an indefinite period, from one day to life. Given appealed, and the Appeals Court reversed the judgment and set aside the jury\u2019s special verdict, reasoning that the portion of the police report concerning the alleged assault on the six year old boy was inadmissible under \u00a7 14 <em>(c), </em>because it did not relate to a prior sexual offense of which Given had been convicted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 394 (2003). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We find no error in the judge\u2019s decision to allow introduction of the unredacted police report and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Scope of admissible reports under \u00a7 14 (c). </em>We first consider whether the police report was admissible under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c). Hearsay that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence is inadmissible in a proceeding under G. L. c. 123A, unless the evidence is made admissible by statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 335; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>376 Mass. 632, 638 &amp; n.10 (1978). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Section 14 (c) enumerates several categories of specifically admissible evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201cJuvenile and adult court probation records, psychiatric and psychological records and reports of the person named in the petition, including the report of any qualified examiner, as defined in section 1, and filed under this chapter, <em>police reports relating to such person\u2019s prior sexual offenses, </em>incident reports arising out of such person\u2019s incarceration or custody, oral or written statements prepared for and to be offered at the trial by the victims of the person who is the subject of the petition and any other evidence tending to show that such person is or is not a sexually dangerous person <em>shall be admissible at the trial </em>if such written information has been provided to opposing counsel reasonably in advance of trial\u201d (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Although we have termed this set of exceptions \u201c \u2018a very radical departure\u2019 from ordinary evidentiary rules,\u201d we have nonetheless acknowledged that the Legislature has expressed a clear policy preference in favor of admitting such evidence in G. L. c. 123A proceedings. <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 473 (1975), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGruder, </em>348 Mass. 712, 715 (1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 972 (1966). The report admitted in evidence in this case is plainly a police report, and both parties concede that the Commonwealth provided the report to Given in advance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The report is also one \u201crelating to [Given\u2019s] prior sexual offenses,\u201d as we have construed the term \u201coffenses\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 336. An accepted guilty plea is a judicial finding of guilt, entered after a judge is satisfied that, among other things, there is a factual basis for the underlying charge. Mass. R. Crim. P. 12 (c) (5) (A), 378 Mass. 866 (1979). Consequently, a charge to which a defendant pleads guilty is an \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c). In this case, Francine\u2019s allegations that Given sexually assaulted her in his automobile at the roller skating rink gave rise to indictments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>to which Given pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The police report that memorializes Francine\u2019s description of what occurred is therefore admissible under \u00a7 14 (c) as a \u201cpolice report relating to [Given\u2019s] prior sexual offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The more difficult issue is whether the portion of the report describing Francine\u2019s statement that Given molested a six year old boy should have been redacted. The language of \u00a7 14 <em>(c) </em>makes clear that the Legislature did not intend to limit the scope of information admissible under \u00a7 14 (c) to the mere fact of conviction or even the facts presented at a plea colloquy; rather, other information in police reports \u2014 including any statements describing the defendant\u2019s conduct and the circumstances attendant to the -offense \u2014 is also admissible. The fact that that information could have, but did not, result in additional criminal charges is irrelevant to its admissibility under \u00a7 14 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Francine\u2019s statement refers to the six year old boy twice, and, in both instances, the references appear as part of her description of her own abuse. According to Francine, the boy was in the automobile while Given sexually assaulted her, and Given \u201cdid the same thing to the little boy.\u201d She and the boy were allegedly molested at the same time, in the same way, by the same person. This statement is unambiguously \u201crelat[ed] to\u201d the circumstances of her abuse in Given\u2019s automobile. Because Given pleaded guilty to charges stemming from this abuse, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>police report, including Francine\u2019s statement about what occurred, related to an offense and was admissible at Given\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">b. <em>Due process. </em>Having determined that the police report was admissible without redaction under \u00a7 14 (c), we must evaluate whether its admission violates the due process provisions of the Massachusetts or the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Given argues that the admission of Francine\u2019s statement (as contained in the police report) without an independent finding that it was reliable violated his right to due process. \u201cWhile commitment proceedings under c. 123A are civil proceedings, the potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to these proceedings \u2018mandates that due process protections apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 502 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977). However, even in proceedings that may result in a deprivation of liberty, \u201cthe due process clause does not place a per se prohibition on the use of hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 115 (1990) (probation revocation hearing). To determine whether the use of hearsay evidence in a civil commitment case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>violates due process, we need look no further than to its reliability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 117. See also <em>Comomonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, ante </em>685, 690 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">\u201cEvidence which would be admissible under standard evidentiary rules is presumptively reliable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 118. However, as we have stated, the admission of hearsay contained in police reports under \u00a7 14 (c) is \u201c \u2018a very radical departure\u2019 from ordinary evidentiary rules.\u201d <em>Andrews, petitioner, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGruder, supra. </em>This statutory departure is justified, however, where the proffered report relates to an offense of which the defendant has been convicted. The fact of conviction is a power<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>fui independent indicator of the reliability of the statements describing the offense on which the conviction rests. In this case, while the fact that Francine, a child suffering from mental retardation, made her statement to police shortly after the traumatic experience of two sexual assaults might cast some doubt on its reliability, Given pleaded guilty to these very assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Insofar as Francine\u2019s statement concerning the six year old boy was part of her detailed description of the circumstances of Given\u2019s sexual assaults on her, its reliability is similarly bolstered by Given\u2019s plea. This is so even though his plea may not have contained an admission to any of the specific facts as described by Francine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without Given\u2019s plea, Francine\u2019s statement would be merely an unproven allegation; with the plea, her statement is part of a set of facts that formed the basis for the charges to which Given pleaded guilty. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>428 Mass. 455, 459-460 (1998) (guilty plea bolstered statement concerning precise factual circumstances of crime, providing sufficient indicia of reliability to justify admitting alleged factual circumstances of crime as modus operandi evidence). To the extent Given desired to challenge any of the details provided by Francine and included in the report, he had both advance notice of them and the power to call Francine or others as witnesses for examination in his case. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c) (police reports admissible only if \u201cprovided to opposing counsel reasonably in advance of trial\u201d). G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(b) </em>(\u201cperson named in the petition shall be entitled to have process issued from the court to compel the attendance of witnesses on his behalf\u201d). The admission of the unredacted police report containing Francine\u2019s statements did not offend due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">c. <em>Additional issues. </em>Given raises several other challenges to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the judgment. As the Appeals Court concluded, the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s examiners was more than sufficient to support a finding that Given was a sexually dangerous person, and Given\u2019s motion for a required finding of not sexually dangerous was properly denied. None of the remainder of Given\u2019s arguments has merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judge committed no error by admitting the unredacted police report containing Francine\u2019s statement concerning Given\u2019s contemporaneous sexual abuse of a six year old boy. The jury\u2019s special verdict is therefore reinstated, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The indictments to which Given pleaded guilty in 1991 alleged assaults on four different children: Given\u2019s stepdaughter, his stepson, the twelve year old mentally retarded niece of a friend, and another eleven year old boy he knew.

L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(b), </em>the police report was also made available to the examiners who evaluated and diagnosed Given prior to trial.

[Francine] mentioned something about the 6-year-old calling his mom and his mom calling his Dad on the cellular phone and that his Dad would be picking him up. The 6-year-old\u2019s Dad arrived and the boy ran over to his Dad\u2019s car and he was crying and had a cut on his hand. [Francine] also said that the boy[\u2019]s father had called the police on his cellular phone in the car. Then the boy and his Dad got in their car.

On the dissent\u2019s theory, everything is \u201cunreliable hearsay\u201d unless it comprises part of an element of a sexual offense for which the defendant has been convicted or pleaded guilty. See <em>post </em>at 751. Of course, experts want those surrounding details that may provide clues, going beyond the mere fact of the commission of a sexual offense, that indicate mental abnormality or future dangerousness (e.g., accompanying acts of violence or what the defendant said during the crime). Those surrounding details may include other offenses (sexual or nonsexual), either against the victim of the sexual assault or against another victim (e.g., victim\u2019s roommate not sexually assaulted, but tied up and forced to watch assault). Section 14 (c) ensures that those details are made available to the experts and fact finder alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We do not consider or decide whether statements in a police report that include information concerning uncharged misconduct completely unrelated in time and circumstance to the underlying sexual offense must be redacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The Appeals Court did not reach the constitutional issues in this case, because it determined that Francine\u2019s statements were inadmissible under \u00a7 14 (c). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass.

See Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right. . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . .\u201d); art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cevery subject shall have a right... to meet the witnesses against him face to face\u201d). \u201c[Proceedings under c. 123A are civil and not penal ....

In articulating the standards for the reliability of hearsay evidence, we adopted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rule that \u201creliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118, citing <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The <em>Roberts </em>case involved a challenge to hearsay evidence not under the due process clause, but under the confrontation clause. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 62-63. Recently, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts, </em>replacing it with a bright-line confrontation clause rule: \u201cWhere testimonial evidence is at issue ... the Sixth Amendment demands . . . unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross examination.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>124 S. Ct. 1354, 1374 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The <em>Crawford </em>case has no direct bearing on this case, because, as we have made clear, the confrontation clause does not apply to civil commitment proceedings. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The dissent nonetheless argues that the reasoning of the <em>Crawford </em>case should guide our due process analysis in this case. <em>Post </em>at 750 n.l. While it is true that the <em>Crawford </em>case includes language criticizing the <em>Roberts </em>reliability test as \u201cunpredictable,\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 1371, the reasoning of the case rests almost exclusively on the historical background of the confrontation clause and the particular concerns motivating its ratification, <em>id. </em>at 1359-1367. The Court summarized its historical analysis by stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">\u201cTo be sure, the [Confrontation] Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. <em>It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: </em>by testing in the crucible of cross-examination\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Unlike the confrontation clause, due process demands that evidence be reliable in substance, not that its reliability be evaluated in \u201ca particular manner.\u201d That the focus on reliability may not accommodate a simple, predictable, bright-line rule does not alter the fact that reliability, not cross-examination, is the \u201cdue process touchstone.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Applying \u201c[p]rinciples similar to collateral estoppel,\u201d the dissent claims that the effect of Given\u2019s guilty plea extended only \u201cto that portion of [Francine\u2019s] statement concerning the facts necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 751. To the contrary, basic concepts of corroboration \u2014 not collateral estoppel \u2014 are what endow Francine\u2019s statement with reliability. Given\u2019s guilty plea confirms the central part of Francine\u2019s statement, therefore lending credibility to the statement as a whole, including the parts of her statement not directly corroborated by his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The hearsay contained in the police report was also not the only evidence admitted against Given at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 118. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The Commonwealth presented evidence of ten convictions of crimes involving sexual assaults on five different children, as well as the testimony of two qualified examiners, both of whom concluded that Given was sexually dangerous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">This includes both the arguments appearing in Given\u2019s separate brief filed without the aid of counsel and those appearing in Given\u2019s main brief but disclaimed by counsel under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>383 Mass. 201, 208 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b767-6\">Ireland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkF\">(dissenting, with whom Spina and Cowin, JJ., join). Because I conclude that the portions of the police report concerning the abuse of Francine that referenced the unidentified, unknown six year old boy were inadmissible under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c), and violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights, and because, in the circumstances of this case, we cannot know for certain that the information did not influence the jury\u2019s decision, I would set aside the special verdict and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">As the court notes, <em>ante </em>at 741, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331 (2002), we held that the phrase \u201cprior sexual offenses\u201d as used in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c), regarding the admissibility of information contained in police reports means a conviction or adjudication. <em>Id. </em>at 336. Because this is a narrow exception to the normal rules of evidence, it should be construed strictly. In this case, Given was not charged with any crime concerning the six year old boy and thus was neither convicted nor had an adjudication concerning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Moreover, even if the statute does not preclude the admission of the evidence about the six year old boy, its admission violates Given\u2019s due process rights because it constitutes unreliable hearsay. The court implicitly acknowledges that the evidence is hearsay that does not fit within any firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, <em>ante </em>at 747 n.9, citing <em>Ohio </em>v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980). In that case, the Supreme Court held that hearsay may be admissible if it is reliable and falls within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule. Unless the hearsay fits within such an exception, however, it must be shown to possess a \u201cparticularized guarantee[] of trustworthiness\u201d before it may be admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The court concludes that Francine\u2019s statement contains the requisite trustworthiness based on the fact that Given pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting her. His guilty plea undoubtedly imbued her statement with reliability, but not all of it. Principles similar to collateral estoppel must apply, for that is the basis underlying the reliability, and hence the admissibility, of those portions of Francine\u2019s statement relating to the offenses committed against her. Here, there is no indication that, in his guilty plea, Given adopted that portion of Francine\u2019s statement that referred to the six year old boy. The record is silent as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>whether the Commonwealth advanced the evidence about the boy at the time of Given\u2019s plea, either as a victim in his own right or as evidence of the manner and means by which Given committed the offense against Francine. As such, the evidence is not related to Given\u2019s guilty plea and is unreliable hearsay. Given\u2019s guilty plea did not transform Francine into a reliable reporter for all purposes. Rather, its effect only went to that portion of her statement concerning the facts necessary to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In the circumstances of this case, the admission of this hearsay was prejudicial to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Not only was the police report itself submitted to the jury, but the jury also saw the two reports prepared by the Commonwealth\u2019s experts, which quoted parts of the police report, including reference to the six year old boy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the <em>Markvart </em>case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cRecitation of facts in that report that, although admissible, turn out not to be admitted during trial (or elicited on cross-examination of the expert) would undermine the balance we struck in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>[398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986)]. In context, the qualified examiner\u2019s report is the equivalent of the direct examination of the expert, and the report as submitted to the jury should therefore be subject to the same constraints. Consistent with the principles articulated in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>[433 Mass. 575, 577-578 (2001)], the qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>examiner\u2019s report must be redacted prior to its submission to the jury to exclude any facts or data that were not presented in evidence or elicited during the cross-examination of the qualified examiner. In short, an expert\u2019s direct examination is not a vehicle for the introduction of facts in evidence (other than those that the expert directly observed), and the qualified examiner\u2019s report should not be transformed into such a vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338-339.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In addition, as detailed in the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, the experts disagreed on several points, including whether Given suffers \u201cfrom a mental abnormality or personality disorder,\u201d the likelihood of Given\u2019s reoffending, and the methodology used to predict that likelihood. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 396 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Furthermore, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts stated that the fact that Given abused Francine in a public place suggested difficulty controlling his impulses, and the other expert stated that the defendant\u2019s behavior escalated over time to include children in the community, demonstrating that Given\u2019s \u201cbehavior [was] being driven.\u201d The evidence regarding the six year old boy undermined a critical portion of the defense, one of whose experts stated that a person who preys on unfamiliar victims is more dangerous than those who molest children they know. Given\u2019s other expert stated, \u201c[Ojne factor that has been shown to actually predict future offenses is the pattern of past offenses. That\u2019s the best predictor. What someone has done in the past is the best predictor of what they\u2019ll do in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Moreover, the judge specifically told the jury, \u201cGiven\u2019s past sexual misconduct need not have led to criminal charges in order for you to consider that in determining the issues' before you. You . . . may also consider any sexual misconduct charges that have been brought to your attention.\u201d As the Appeals Court noted in its decision, \u201cThe only uncharged conduct in evidence was the alleged incident relating to the six year old boy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 395 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We cannot be sure that the error either did not influence or have a slight effect on the jury, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13-14 n.7 (1999), and cases cited; <em>id. </em>at 23 (Greaney, J., concurring), where, as here, at least some of the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>about the boy contained in the police report was submitted to the jury three times, experts testified that Given\u2019s abuse of Francine showed an escalation in his behavior, and the judge told the jury that they could consider uncharged sexual misconduct. There is little doubt as to the potency of such evidence, for the same reasons we discourage its use as impeachment evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 833-834 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 680-682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring) (use of conviction of prior sexual offense to impeach defendant has high potential for unfair prejudice in trial for sexual offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In a recent opinion, the Supreme Court overruled, albeit in the criminal context, the test for reliability outlined in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56 (1980). <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004) (holding that, where wife unavailable to testify, use of her out-of-court statement to police violated confrontation clause of Sixth Amendment to United States Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Court stated that the <em>Roberts </em>test led to unpredictable results, but its \u201cunpardonable vice . . . [is] its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1371. The Court also stated that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation \u201ccommands . . . that reliability [of evidence] be assessed . . . by testing in the crucible of cross-examination . . . [and that the] <em>Roberts </em>test allows a jury to hear evidence . . . based on a mere judicial determination of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Although the holding in the <em>Crawford </em>case is inapplicable here because the proceeding was civil rather than criminal, it is the Court\u2019s <em>reasoning </em>regarding the reliability of out-of-court statements that applies in this context and serves to underscore the nature of my concern about Francine\u2019s statements to police about the six year old boy. Although G. L. c. 123A proceedings are civil, we have noted that the \u201cpotential deprivation of liberty . . . \u2018mandates that due process protections apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 502 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Because I find prejudicial error, I need not address the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard which is more favorable to the defendant. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 160, 161, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Both reports contained the following paragraph, taken directly from the police report:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">\u201c[Francine] was later asked about the blue windbreaker jacket which was in plain view in the rear seat of [the defendant\u2019s] vehicle on the night it was impounded.

[Francine] stated to [the officer] that [the defendant] did the same things to the little boy that he had done to her. (SEE STATEMENT) This jacket was recovered and bagged as evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">In addition, Dr. Tomich\u2019s report mentions, a second time, that Francine \u201cinformed police that there was \u2018a little boy\u2019 in that car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
