Approximately seven months after the rescript issued, Demetrius Ennis filed a motion for an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (d), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). Ennis also filed an affidavit from counsel setting forth counsel\u2019s hourly rate and the number of hours spent working on the appeal. The Commonwealth filed an opposition, arguing that Ennis\u2019s request is untimely because it should have been made in his appellate brief, and because the court no longer has jurisdiction over the case. The Commonwealth also contests the amount of Ennis\u2019s request, arguing that neither counsel\u2019s hourly rate nor the number of hours spent working on the appeal is reasonable. The Commonwealth also claims that Ennis\u2019s request is excessive when compared to other rule 15 (d) awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, ante 9 </em>(2004), we recently addressed the proper timing and procedure of a request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in civil cases, and described a new procedure for the award of such fees and costs. We take this opportunity to do the same for rule 15 (d) cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Rule 15 (d) is silent on when a defendant should file a motion for fees and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 10, we determined that, in civil cases, a party requesting appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs must do so in the appellate brief. See <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989). No such requirement has been imposed on defendants in rule 15 (d) cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goggin, </em>412 Mass. 200, 203 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 425, 429 (1996); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beacon Distribs., Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 576 (1982). Such a requirement would make little sense in rule 15 (d) cases because the award of attorney\u2019s fees to defendants is mandatory and, moreover, the rule entitles a defendant to fees and costs not only when the Commonwealth is granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal, but also when the Commonwealth is denied such leave. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>423 Mass. 1010 (1996). Nevertheless, it is in the interests of the efficient administration of justice for a defendant to file a request for attorney\u2019s fees within a reasonable time after resolution of the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We therefore conclude that, after the date of this opinion, a defendant shall file a rule 15 (d) request within thirty days of either the denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, or the issuance of the rescript from the appellate court that decides the appeal, unless the defendant on motion shows good cause why an enlargement of time should be allowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Here, Ennis filed his rule 15 (d) request approximately seven months after the rescript issued. Ennis provides no explanation for the delay, but the Commonwealth does not claim that it suffered any prejudice. In these circumstances, we conclude that Ennis\u2019s request is not untimely; in the future, defendants shall adhere to the thirty-day rule we announce today.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Ennis\u2019s request because the rescript has already issued. A rule 15 (d) request is not a motion to rehear, alter, or amend the court\u2019s decision on the interlocutory appeal. Cf. <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dartmouth, </em>413 Mass. 641, 642, 643 (1992) (motion for attorney\u2019s fees not untimely, despite plaintiff\u2019s having filed it two months after defendant fulfilled obligation under declaratory judgment, where motion for fees \u201cwas not a motion to alter or amend a judgment\u201d). See <em>Society </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>411 Mass. 754, 756-757 (1992) (where no specific procedural rule of civil procedure regarding timely filing of petition for attorney\u2019s fees, determination of timeliness was \u201cwithin the discretion of this court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Having decided that Ennis\u2019s rule 15 (d) request is properly before us, we turn to the procedure to be used in deciding the request. In <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra, </em>we announced that in civil cases where a party seeks an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, the Justices who heard and decided the appeal, rather than a single justice, shall address the request. The same practice shall apply where, as here, a defendant files a rule 15 (d) motion for fees and costs in connection with an interlocutory appeal filed by the Commonwealth and decided by an appellate court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For those cases where the Commonwealth is denied leave to file an interlocutory appeal, the single justice who denied the application is in the best position to determine rule 15 (d) fees and costs; such requests shall be addressed to that Justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Ennis\u2019s fee request arises from an interlocutory appeal decided by the court, the Justices who heard and decided the appeal now address the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>We begin with the recognition that Ennis has \u201cthe burden of showing that the claimed rate and number of hours are reasonable.\u201d <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 759. See <em>Margolies </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>401 Mass. 88, 93 (1987); <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>398 Mass. 18, 30-31 (1986); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5 (a), 426 Mass. 1315 (1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his affidavit, Ennis\u2019s appellate counsel states only that his hourly rate is $200, that he devoted 64.3 hours to working on the interlocutory appeal, and that he spent $61.19 on commercial copying, for a total of $12,921.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Counsel has failed to provide any basis as to why his $200 rate is reasonable for the services he provided in this case. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, supra; </em>Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5 (a). He filed no affidavit describing his usual billing rate or that of attorneys with similar years of criminal appellate experience who practice in his locale. Contrast <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, 417 </em>Mass. 199, 201-202 &amp; n.3, 203-204 (1994) (parties seeking fees submitted eighteen affidavits, two letters, and survey of market rates for attorneys in Boston area); <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 323-325 &amp; n.12 (1982) (\u201cCalculation of reasonable hourly rates should begin with the average rates in the attorney\u2019s community for similar work by attorneys of the same years\u2019 experience\u201d). As for the 64.3 hours claimed by Ennis, we conclude that the number of hours is unreasonable. Counsel\u2019s opposition to the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal was brief and repeated arguments made in Ennis\u2019s motion to suppress. In addition, the Commonwealth\u2019s claim on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>peal was limited to a single, circumscribed issue \u2014 whether the recording of a telephone conversation violated the Massachusetts wiretap act, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Significantly, Ennis failed to respond to the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition to his rule 15 (d) request. In support of its opposition, the Commonwealth submitted an affidavit presenting the results of an \u201cinformal survey\u201d of the amounts of rule 15(d) awards in fourteen cases from across the Commonwealth over approximately eight years. The Commonwealth represents the highest award in its informal survey to be approximately $13,000, and the lowest award to be $1,536.54. The average of the awards in the survey is $5,746.21; the median is $5,026.99. While we recognize that the survey is not, nor does it purport to be, complete, we accept that the Commonwealth\u2019s affidavit was submitted in a good faith attempt to rebut defense counsel\u2019s claim of reasonableness. Accordingly, in the particular circumstances of this case, where Ennis has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of his request, we use the results of the Commonwealth\u2019s informal, and unopposed, survey as the relevant reference point from which to determine Ennis\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is largely discretionary with the judge, who is in the best position to determine how much time was reasonably spent on a case, and the fair value of the attorney\u2019s services. <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993). See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1982); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 (1979). In light of the limited nature of the legal issue involved in the Commonwealth\u2019s underlying interlocutory appeal, Ennis\u2019s failure to satisfy his burden of showing the reasonableness of his request, and Ennis\u2019s failure to respond to the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition, we conclude, in our discretion, that Ennis is entitled to a rule 15 (d) award less than the average represented in the Commonwealth\u2019s survey. We determine the appropriate amount to be $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Rule 15 (d) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), provides: \u201cIf an appeal or application therefor is taken by the Commonwealth, the appellate court, upon the written motion of the defendant supported by affidavit, shall determine and approve the payment to the defendant of his or her costs of appeal together'with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be paid on the order of the trial court upon the entry of the rescript or the denial of the application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">On occasion, after it has been granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal, the Commonwealth has moved to dismiss its appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>431 Mass. 299 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>430 Mass. 244 (1999). In such \"cases, a defendant shall file a rule 15 (d) request within thirty days of dismissal of the appeal, unless the defendant on motion shows good cause why an enlargement of time should be allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant shall file with the clerk of the court a motion and affidavits detailing and supporting the attorney\u2019s fees and costs sought. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, ante 9, </em>10 (2004). Because rule 15 (d) is mandatory, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>430 Mass. 244, 245-246 (1999), the Justices will determine only the amount of the award. Contrast <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>(Justices decide whether to award appellate fees as well as amount). The Commonwealth shall be afforded thirty days to respond to the defendant\u2019s request, and the court will then enter an appropriate order. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Any party aggrieved by the order may request reconsideration from the court. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The defendant shall file a motion and supporting affidavit with the clerk of the court within thirty days after the denial of leave to file the appeal.
