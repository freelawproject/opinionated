The Appeals Court, in an order and unpublished memorandum pursuant to its rule 1:28, concluded that some of the questioning was improper, but that it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (2003). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review and affirm the convictions because we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s actions were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">At trial, there was testimony that the defendant and Howard Lessman, the victim, had known each other for at least five years: In August, 2000, the defendant employed Lessman in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tree-cutting business for a brief period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant terminated this arrangement when he learned that his insurance company would not provide coverage for Lessman. On September 8, 2000, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Harold Lessman and his girl friend, Kelly Gorman, were walking home on Houghton Street in North Adams, when the defendant approached them in a vehicle. An altercation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The parties agree on very little about the incident. Lessman testified that the defendant nearly hit him and his girl friend as the defendant approached in a Chevrolet Blazer truck; the defendant got out of the truck, threatened to beat up the couple because they were \u201crunning [their] mouths,\u201d and then attempted to get back in the truck so he could run over Lessman. According to Lessman\u2019s testimony, during the incident the defendant removed his belt and used it to strike Lessman before getting back in the truck and driving away. Gorman testified that the defendant said that she was \u201cshooting [her] mouth off about [the defendant\u2019s former wife],\u201d and that his former wife wanted to \u201ckick [Gorman\u2019s] ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The defendant, on the other hand, testified that Lessman forced him to stop the car by standing in the street, and then beating on the hood. The defendant further testified that he was not wearing a belt that day, that he did not threaten or attack Lessman, and that in fact Lessman attacked him. The defendant claimed that Lessman had been harassing his family since August, and so on this occasion he told Lessman to \u201cstay away from my family and leave us alone.\u201d He testified that he was referring to Lessman\u2019s \u201cbothering my eight year old daughter [and] wife.\u201d Neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth offered a detailed explanation as to the underlying cause or causes of the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">Lessman immediately reported the incident to the police and sought hospital treatment. Later that evening, the defendant was arrested at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning his motive for the attack created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the prosecutor lacked an evidentiary basis for his questions and therefore expected the defendant to answer in the negative. By this means, the defendant asserts that the prosecutor was attempting to place before the jury the suggestion of a motive without any evidentiary foundation, and improperly to introduce evidence of unrelated prior bad acts by the defendant toward his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">A prosecutor may not cross-examine a witness \u201cin bad faith or without foundation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 561 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, 367 </em>Mass. 280, 284 (1975). It is therefore an improper tactic for a prosecutor to \u201cattempt to communicate impressions by innuendo through questions which are answered in the negative . . . when the [prosecutor] has no evidence to support the innuendo.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>quoting ABA Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function \u00a7 5.7(d) (Approved Draft 1971). See P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 3.2, at 52 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cIt is improper for the cross-examiner to ask a question that implies the truth of a proposition he knows to be false . . .\u201d). When the prosecutor cross-examines a witness, he must have a basis for asking the question, and be prepared to disclose that reason to the judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 561, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">We most recently discussed this issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra, </em>where the prosecutor asked the defendant a series of questions regarding a conversation. The questions all elicited denials. The prosecutor had some evidence of such a conversation, but never offered the evidence at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 561-563. We concluded that \u201c[i]t was permissible for the judge to permit the prosecutor to ask the defendant one question about [the defendant\u2019s] alleged conversation,\u201d but when the defendant consistently denied having the conversation, the judge should either have curtailed further questioning, ordered a voir dire of the witness to the alleged conversation, or sought assurance from the prosecutor that evidence of the conversation would be forthcoming (i.e., ask the prosecutor to disclose her basis for asking the question). <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The Appeals Court, in its unpublished memorandum, concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to lay a foundation before questioning the defendant about his motive for the attack was itself improper. However, we did not state in the <em>Christian </em>case, nor do our other cases hold, that the prosecutor must lay an evidentiary foundation before asking such questions. The prosecutor is required only to have a basis for the questions, and to be prepared to disclose that basis to the court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 562, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The questioning at issue in the present case was proper only if the prosecutor possessed, and was prepared to disclose, some reasonable basis for knowing that tension between the defendant and his daughters was known to Lessman, and that Lessman\u2019s comments on that subject may have been at the heart of the altercation. We are unable to ascertain whether the prosecutor possessed a reasonable basis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for. asking the questions at issue for he was never requested to make such a basis known. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>defendant only objected to one question, which directly addressed the defendant\u2019s relationship with his daughters. This objection was sustained by the judge. The defendant did not object to the further questioning regarding what Lessman might have said. Gorman\u2019s testimony and the defendant\u2019s own statements suggest some hostility between the defendant\u2019s family on the one hand, and Lessman and Gorman on the other, and that the defendant was upset that Lessman and Gorman were \u201crunning their mouths\u201d on some unspecified subject. In addition, although Lessman testified that he did not know why the defendant might have attacked him, it was the defendant who raised the issue of Lessman\u2019s interaction with and relationship to his family. Thus, it is very likely that the prosecutor had a reasonable basis for his questions which, on request, he could have disclosed. Here, where there were no further objections and the prosecutor was not called on to disclose his basis for the questions, the questioning was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Moreover, although we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 562, that after one question the judge should have curtailed the questioning, conducted a voir dire, or asked the prosecutor to disclose her basis for the questions, the judge cannot be faulted for failing to take such action in this instance. Here, there was one question to which the defendant objected (and the judge sustained that objection), followed by somewhat different questions with no objections.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This may well have been a strategic choice by the defendant, and it is likely that the judge did not wish to interfere with this strategy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The defendant asserts a similar claim regarding a videotape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of his booking. He argues that reference to the videotape was improper and that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury to disregard such reference was prejudicial error. The defendant testified that he could not have hit Lessman with his belt because he was wearing a string instead of a belt to hold up his pants on the day of the altercation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In answer to further questioning, the defendant stated that the police did not remove the string from his pants. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cYou\u2019re telling this jury that the North Adams Police Department, familiar with you, let you go into a cell with a string?\u201d After a few more questions, the prosecutor asked, \u201cSir, would it surprise you to know that the videotape of your booking shows no string on your pants?\u201d The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to this question \u201cin that form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The reference to the booking videotape was not in itself improper. The form of the question was improper, and the judge sustained the objection for that reason.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge also instructed the jury that questions asked during the trial are not evidence. The jury are presumed to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 328 (2000). There was no error and no need to give additional instruction, particularly when there was no further reference to the booking videotape.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The defendant alleges additionally that the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that the police were \u201cfamiliar\u201d with him was improper and prejudicial because it suggested that the police had \u201cundisclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>negative information about him.\u201d There was no objection to the question. Any impropriety was rendered moot by the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment of the defendant with numerous prior convictions, and by a police officer\u2019s earlier testimony that he had known the defendant for about twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b20-13\">The defendant was acquitted of simple assault and battery and intimidation of a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b21-9\">The defendant testified that Lessman worked for him for only one-half day. Lessman testified that the period of his employment was about two days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b22-6\">We recount the relevant colloquy here:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cSir, isn\u2019t it true that you were mad at Mr. Lessman for what he said about the way you treated your two older daughters . . . ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cYou have a bad relationship with those two, don\u2019t you?\u201d Defense counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">The judge: \u201cSustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cWell, Mr. Lessman had voiced his opinion about the way you treated your two older daughters, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">The defendant: \u201cNo, he did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t like that, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-14\">The defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-15\">The prosecutor: \u201cSo when you saw Mr. Lessman on Houghton Street, you were mad at him, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-16\">The defendant: \u201cNo, I was not.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Our cases have used a variety of terms to describe the required basis, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>431 Mass. 535, 539 (2000) (\u201cgood faith basis\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 561 (2000) (\u201cbasis in fact\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 228 (1997) (\u201cgood faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>basis\u201d). We adopt the term \u201creasonable basis,\u201d as \u201creasonable\u201d encompasses \u201cgood faith\u201d while excluding forays based on good faith that are nevertheless unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b24-9\">The present case is therefore distinguished from the consistent flood of improper questions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 561-563 &amp; n.6 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\">To the extent the defendant argues that the question regarding his relationship with his daughters suggested prior bad acts by the defendant, we conclude that there was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 351 (1998), and cases cited. The defendant\u2019s objection to this question was sustained, and the subject matter was not raised again during the trial. Further, the judge instructed the jury that questions asked during the trial are not evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The defendant testified that he rarely wore a belt for job-related safety reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\">It is improper to pose such a question asking whether a witness \u201cwould be surprised\u201d by certain facts. The witness\u2019s state of mind regarding the booking videotape is irrelevant; it has no \u201crational tendency to prove an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 875 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>402 Mass. 78, 83 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b25-9\">To the extent that the defendant complains that there was no basis for inquiring at all about the videotape of the booking, the trial record indicates the existence of the tape: a police officer had already testified that the defendant\u2019s booking was videotaped. There was no allegation that the videotape shows a string on the defendant\u2019s pants. Thus, it appears that the prosecutor had a basis for asking the question. However, even if there had been no reasonable basis for the question, there still would have been no error, because the judge curtailed this colloquy after one question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 563.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
