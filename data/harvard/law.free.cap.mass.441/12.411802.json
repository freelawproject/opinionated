App. \u00a7\u00a7 761 et seq. (2000). The trial judge submitted the plaintiffs\u2019 DOHSA claims to the jury on an advisory basis; after the jury answered special questions in favor of the plaintiffs, the judge decided that there was no right to a jury trial and entered judgment based on her own findings in favor of the defendant. For the following reasons, we conclude that there is a right to a jury trial for a DOHSA claim brought in the Superior Court, and we therefore reverse the judgment and order that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with the jury\u2019s answers to special questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On September 5, 1994, the fishing trawler Italian Gold capsized and sank in the North Atlantic during a storm. The four crew members were lost and presumed drowned. The vessel was located but not recovered, and remains at the bottom of the sea. Prior to its final voyage, the vessel had undergone repair work at the shipyard of the defendant, Rose\u2019s Oil Service, Inc. (Rose\u2019s Oil). Alleging that faulty work by Rose\u2019s Oil had allowed excessive water to enter through the \u201cstuffing box\u201d and thereby caused the vessel to sink, the widows of the four crew members filed actions against Rose\u2019s Oil in the Superior Court seeking recovery under DOHSA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The owner of the vessel, Uncle Sam of \u201876, Inc. (Uncle Sam), also filed an action against Rose\u2019s Oil on theories of negligence, breach of warranty, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, alleging that the loss of its vessel and resulting damages had been caused by faulty workmanship and neglect on the part of Rose\u2019s Oil.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 DOHSA claims and the claims of Uncle Sam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>were consolidated for trial. Immediately prior to trial, Rose\u2019s Oil filed a \u201cmotion to proceed with a bench trial and to bifurcate the trial,\u201d arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 DOHSA claims were admiralty claims that could not be tried to a jury, whereas Uncle Sam had a right to a trial by jury on its negligence and breach of warranty claims. Reserving her ruling on the issue, the judge proceeded to empanel a jury for a consolidated trial and submitted the DOHSA claims to the jury on an advisory basis. Answering special questions, the jury found in favor of the four plaintiffs on their DOHSA claims and in favor of Uncle Sam on its negligence and breach of warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Following trial, the judge ruled that the four plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial on their DOHSA claims, and proceeded to render her own findings of fact and conclusions of law on those claims. The judge agreed with the jury that Rose\u2019s Oil had been negligent, but found that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that that negligence was a proximate cause of the vessel\u2019s sinking. As a result, judgment was entered in favor of Rose\u2019s Oil on the DOHSA claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal followed, and we transferred the cases to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In denying the plaintiffs a jury trial, the judge reasoned that because their DOHSA claims were \u201csolely in admiralty,\u201d and because, lacking diversity of citizenship, any claim they might have filed in Federal court would have been heard in admiralty without a jury, they could not obtain a jury trial in State court. While the judge\u2019s observations are correct \u2014 a DOHSA claim is an \u201cadmiralty claim\u201d and, because of the lack of diversity jurisdiction, these plaintiffs would not have been entitled to a jury trial had their admiralty claim been filed in Federal court \u2014 those facts do not operate to deprive the plaintiffs of their right to a jury trial in State court. Reviewing the history of DOHSA, and its interpretation by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Court, we conclude that the savings clause of DOHSA, 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 767, leaves intact a plaintiff\u2019s right to a jury trial in State court where that State\u2019s own procedures would include a right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Prior to the enactment of DOHSA, Federal maritime law did not recognize any cause of action for wrongful death. See <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 U.S. 199 (1886).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some State wrongful death statutes provided a cause of action for death occurring in that State\u2019s territorial waters, but such statutes normally did not apply to death occurring on the high seas. See <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 393 n.10 (1970). In 1920, Congress enacted DOHSA, creating a cause of action \u201cin admiralty\u201d for death on the high seas (beyond a marine league from the shore of any State) \u201ccaused by wrongful act, neglect, or default,\u201d but limiting the damages recoverable to the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d suffered by the survivors (the spouse, parents, children, or other dependent relatives of the decedent). 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 761, 762. DOHSA now operates as the exclusive basis of recovery for a death occurring on the high seas, preempting all other forms of wrongful death claims under State or general maritime law. See <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., </em>524 U.S. 116, 123 (1998); <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tall-entire, 477 </em>U.S. 207, 221 (1986); <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Higginbotham, </em>436 U.S. 618, 623-625 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Of primary importance to our analysis is the section of DOHSA referred to as its \u201csavings\u201d clause: \u201cThe provisions of any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter.\u201d 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 767. As interpreted by the Supreme Court, this section operates as a \u201cjurisdictional saving clause,\u201d allowing State courts to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims and to \u201capply such state remedies as [are] not inconsistent with substantive federal maritime law.\u201d <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Tallentire, supra </em>at 221, 224.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The DOHSA savings clause is similar to the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which \u201callows state courts to entertain <em>in personam </em>maritime causes of action,\u201d but \u201crequires that the substantive remedies afforded by the States conform to governing federal maritime standards.\u201d <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra </em>at 222-223.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Madruga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>346 U.S. 556, 560-561 (1954) (Federal admiralty jurisdiction is exclusive as to in rem proceedings against vessel, but \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause renders State courts competent to adjudicate admiralty claims against persons). While \u201cremedies\u201d are available in State court, the substantive provisions and limitations pertaining to DOHSA claims (or other maritime claims) may not be modified by State law. <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra </em>at 232-233 (State wrongful death statute could not be invoked to expand recovery beyond pecuniary losses permitted by DOHSA). See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 438, 445 (2001), quoting <em>Red Cross Line </em>v. <em>Atlantic Fruit Co., </em>264 U.S. 109, 123-124 (1924) (\u00a7 1333 [1] \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause does not allow States to make changes in \u201csubstantive admiralty law,\u201d but does save \u201call means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Our State Constitution and our rules of civil procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>recognize a right to trial by jury for the type of claim presented by these plaintiffs. Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides: \u201cIn all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in causes arising on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners\u2019 wages, the legislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.\u201d Without unearthing the history of admiralty practice at the time art. 15 was adopted in 1780, the reference to a jury trial right for \u201ccauses arising on the high seas,\u201d which right was to remain unless and until the Legislature \u201calter[edj\u201d it, suggests that jury trials were then available for claims \u201carising on the high seas.\u201d In the intervening centuries, the Legislature has done nothing to \u201calter\u201d that right to a jury trial for causes of action \u201carising on the high seas,\u201d and the right thus persists for modem day causes of action \u201carising on the high seas.\u201d In the present case, we have a \u201ccontrovers[y] concerning property,\u201d in a \u201csuit[] between two or more persons,\u201d for a Federal claim \u201carising on the high seas,\u201d over which our courts have concurrent jurisdiction. Thus, our Constitution and roles would recognize a right to a jury trial for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and a jury trial was timely claimed by each of the plaintiffs in their complaints. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 800 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The issue, then, is whether the jury trial provided for under our Constitution and roles is among the \u201cremedies\u201d that have been saved by the DOHSA savings clause, 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 767, and, if it is such a remedy, whether utilizing a jury trial for a DOHSA claim would be \u201cinconsistent with substantive federal maritime law.\u201d <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra </em>at 224. If it is a \u201cremed[yj\u201d within the meaning of the DOHSA savings clause, and if allowing the plaintiffs that remedy does not conflict with or undermine some aspect of DOHSA itself or other Federal maritime law, then the plaintiffs are entitled to a jury trial on their DOHSA claims. Applying the standards articulated in <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>pra, </em>we conclude that the right to a jury trial is a saved remedy under the DOHSA savings clause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">A procedural mechanism for adjudicating a claim is a \u201cremed[y]\u201d available for enforcing that claim. Explaining the \u201cfundamental\u201d distinction between \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d for purposes of the similar \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (1), the Supreme Court explained: \u201cA right is a well founded or acknowledged claim; a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., supra </em>at 445, quoting <em>Chelentis </em>v. <em>Luckenbach S.S. Co., </em>247 U.S. 372, 384 (1918). State procedures allowing for jury trials, and establishing the requirements for claiming a jury trial, are part of the \u201cmeans employed\u201d to pursue substantive claims. Those procedures operate to establish who the trier of fact will be \u2014 a jury (if properly and timely claimed) or a judge (if neither party makes a timely claim for jury trial). Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 (b) and (d), 365 Mass. 800 (1974). Indeed, the Supreme Court has identified trial by jury as an \u201cobvious\u201d example of the \u201cremedies\u201d saved under the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause in \u00a7 1333 (1). <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., supra </em>at 454-455. <em>See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 </em>U.S. 355, 359-360 &amp; n.2 (1962) (pursuant to \u00a7 1333 [1], admiralty claims in personam may be brought \u201cin an ordinary civil action,\u201d and when brought in Federal court by reason of diversity of citizenship, parties have right to trial by jury); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Offshore Navigation, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 1063.,. 1065-1066 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 972 (1981) (same); G. Gilmore &amp; C.L. Black, Admiralty \u00a7 6-62 (2d ed. 1975) (plaintiffs who could invoke either diversity or Federal question jurisdiction thereby obtained jury trial on maritime claims). The \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause also operates to preserve the remedy of a jury trial for maritime claims brought in State court. See <em>Ghotra </em>v. <em>Bandila Shipping, Inc., </em>113 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1107 (1998); <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>964 F.2d 1480, 1487 (5th</p>\n<p id=\"AmT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 975 (1992); <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Diamond M. Co., </em>367 So. 2d 1210, 1215-1216 (La. Ct. App. 1978); <em>Kilfoil </em>v. <em>Ullrich, </em>275 A.D.2d 53, 55-56 (N.Y. 2000). See also <em>Red Cross Line </em>v. <em>Atlantic Fruit Co., </em>264 U.S. 109, 123-124 (1924) (State law enforcing arbitration agreement between parties to admiralty dispute was among saved \u201cremedies\u201d under \u00a7 1333 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Use of the remedy of a jury trial does not undermine or conflict with DOHSA or with substantive Federal maritime law. While, as a matter of historical practice, Federal courts did not provide jury trials for admiralty claims, nothing in the United States Constitution, Federal statutes, or the Rules of Federal Procedure \u201cforbid[sj jury trials in maritime cases.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>United States Lines Co., </em>374 U.S. 16, 20 (1963). The legislative history of DOHSA does not suggest any policy against the use of jury trials. See <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 400 n.14 (1970). Utilizing the mechanism of a jury trial does nothing to expand or alter the provisions of DOHSA \u2014 the time within which the claim must be brought, the identification of the surviving beneficiaries who are entitled to recover, the requirement that they demonstrate a \u201cwrongful act, neglect, or default\u201d that caused the death, the limitation of their damages to the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d they sustained, or the reduction of damages for contributory negligence (if any). 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 761, 762, 763a, 766. The defendant points to no conflict between the use of a jury as the trier of fact and any substantive provision of DOHSA or Federal maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We recognize that, because of DOHSA\u2019s reference to a claim in \u201cadmiralty\u201d and the historic lack of jury trials for proceedings in \u201cadmiralty,\u201d some courts have concluded that jury trials are not available for DOHSA claims. See, e.g., <em>Favaloro </em>v. <em>S/S Golden Gate, </em>687 F. Supp. 475, 481 (N.D. Cal. 1987); <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Mitsubishi Aircraft Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>678 F. Supp. 1064, 1065-1066 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), and cases cited. We are not persuaded by that analysis. As discussed above, it has long been recognized that various forms of \u201cadmiralty\u201d claims may be tried to a jury if the Federal court\u2019s jurisdiction has been invoked on the basis of diversity of citizenship. See <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerman Lines, Ltd., supra; Ghotra </em>v. <em>Bandila Shipping, Inc., supra; Powell </em>v. <em>Offshore Navigation, Inc., supra; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>G. Gilmore &amp; C.L. Black, <em>supra. </em>The mere fact that DOHSA claims are in \u201cadmiralty\u201d does not distinguish them from other \u201cadmiralty\u201d claims over which some nonadmiralty court has jurisdiction and accords jury trials. If conducting a jury trial conflicted with some inherent attribute of \u201cadmiralty,\u201d the Court would not have identified it as an \u201cobvious\u201d example of the \u201cremedies\u201d available to suitors bringing maritime claims in other forums. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 438, 454-455 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Rather than posing some conflict with DOHSA or maritime law such that we must forbid jury trials in all DOHSA cases, jury trials are routinely available to DOHSA plaintiffs by way of other procedural devices. Where a DOHSA claim is brought along with some other claim on which there is a right to a jury trial (for example, a claim under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 688 [2000]), a jury will decide the DOHSA claim along with the other claim or claims. See <em>Red Star Towing &amp; Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>\u201cMing Giant,\u201d </em>552 F. Supp. 367, 374-375 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); <em>Gvirtsman </em>v. <em>Western King Co., </em>263 F. Supp. 633, 634-635 (C.D. Cal. 1967). See also <em>Vodusek </em>v. <em>Bayliner Marine Corp., </em>71 F.3d 148, 152-154 (4th Cir. 1995) (where plaintiff brought death claim against one defendant invoking diversity jurisdiction, but invoked only admirality jurisdiction as to second defendant with whom diversity was lacking, claims against both defendants should have been tried before jury).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the use of juries to decide DOHSA claims undermined DOHSA or any other aspect of Federal maritime law, one would expect that Congress would have taken some action to restrict DOHSA plaintiffs to bench trials. Despite the common practice of combining DOHSA claims with Jones Act or other claims (and thereby obtaining a jury trial on DOHSA claims), Congress has done nothing to impose such a restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We thus conclude that trial by jury, as allowed by our law, qualifies as a \u201cremedy\u201d saved to the plaintiffs by the DOHSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>savings clause, and the plaintiffs\u2019 request for trial by jury therefore should have been allowed. On answers to special questions, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs; in accordance with those answers, judgment should have been entered in favor of the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We therefore vacate the judgment entered in favor of the defendant, and remand the matter for entry of judgments in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaints included other claims against Rose\u2019s Oil Service, Inc. (Rose\u2019s Oil), as well as claims against other defendants. By the time of trial, all claims against other parties and all other claims against Rose\u2019s Oil had been dismissed, leaving only the plaintiffs\u2019 Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) claims against Rose\u2019s Oil to be tried. On appeal, the plaintiffs raise no issue with respect to the dismissal of any of those other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Among the damages claimed by Uncle Sam of \u201876, Inc. (Uncle Sam), was the amount it had had to pay to the plaintiffs in settlement of their claims in a related Federal court action. See <em>Complaint of Uncle Sam of \u201876, Inc., </em>928 F. Supp. 64 (D. Mass. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Rose\u2019s Oil moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the claims of Uncle Sam, contending that Uncle Sam had also failed to establish causation. The judge denied that motion. While the judge had disagreed with the jury\u2019s verdict on the issue of the causal connection between Rose\u2019s Oil\u2019s repairs and the sinking, she held that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of causation, and thus refused to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Uncle Sam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Fifty years after the enactment of DOHSA, the Court overruled <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 U.S. 199 (1886).

That contention, standing alone, is correct, but it ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that the DOHSA savings clause \u201cbears a marked similarity\u201d to the savings clause of \u00a7 1333 (1) and has the same affect on a State court\u2019s exercise of concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra </em>at 222-224.

Air L. &amp; Com. 261, 287 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The plaintiffs here argued that consolidation of their DOHSA actions with Uncle Sam\u2019s common-law claims entitled them to submit their DOHSA claims to the jury along with Uncle Sam\u2019s common-law claims. Because of our ruling that parties to DOHSA actions in the Superior Court are entitled to trial by jury, we need not address this alternative theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\">At oral argument, Rose\u2019s Oil indicated that, in the event judgments were to enter for the plaintiffs, it would move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the DOHSA claims, just as it did with respect to the common-law claims of Uncle Sam. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 present appeal has not placed before us any issue other than that of their right to a jury trial, and our order that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs therefore expresses no opinion as to the merits of any motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
