The lessors of the plaintiff were six in number. They deduced title under the will of John Wilkinson, their father, who devised his lands to his seven children, as joint devisees. One of the dev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>isees had conveyed his share to a co-devisee, one of the lessors of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff having exhibited his title, as above stated, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, upon the ground that the title exhibited, showed that the lessors of the plaintiff were tenants in common, who could not make a joint demise. This motion was sustained by the court, and the plaintiff became nonsuit: The question, whether the nonsuit was correctly ordered, was, by agreement, reserved for decision at Columbus. If the decision was correct, judgment of nonsuit to be set aside, and a new trial awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9X\">*Higgins, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abfi\">cited Jackson <em>v. </em>Bradt, 2 Caine, 169, where the courts of New York overruled the English decisions, and settled that tenants in common could join in a joint demise. He argued that the reasons alleged in New York were equally operative in Ohio. The doctrine originated in a technicality, which there was no propriety in adhering to. He also contended that the statute of Ohio had authorized tenants in common to make a joint demise. 22 Ohio Laws, 62, sec. 29.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\">Woods, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqr\">examined the decision in the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>Bradt, relied upon by the plaintiff, contested its correctness, and dispmted its authority. Ho argued, also, that the statute did not authorize a recovery upon a joint demise, by tenants in common. Its intention was merely to declare what the law was,.not to introduce a new rule. The provision that \u201cseparate demises should only be laid in the names of tenants in common,\u201d is inconsistent, upon any other construction, with other provisions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-8\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In the case of the Lessee of Massie\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Long and others, decided at this term, the court have settled that, under our statute, tenants in common may make a joint demise.
