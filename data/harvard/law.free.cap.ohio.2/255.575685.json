It appears that the sheriff, to whom the process was directed, died between the test and the return. The coroner was, therefore; the proper person to execute and return it. The statute does not require the proceedings to be had in any particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>lar township, but gives jurisdiction to any two justices of the county in which the land is situate, leaving them at liberty to try the cause in any township within the county, as may be most convenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The verdict is in these words: \u201c We, the jury, find the defendant guilty in said suit of forcible entry and detainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">The statute directs, that if the jury find the complaint true, \u201c they shall return a general verdict of guilty, or they shall return a special verdict of such parts as they do find true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Perhaps the order in which the jury have placed the words composing their verdict, might be improved, but we think it conforms substantially to the requirements of the statute. It may be taken as a general verdict of guilty, with an unnecessary description of the case in which it is found, or, by transposing a single word, the jury find the defendant in said suit guilty of forcible entry and detainer, or, by rejecting the words <em>\u201cin said suit,\u201d </em>as surplusage, the same result will be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The plaintiff can not avail himself of the fifth error, because there is no law in this state authorizing bystanders to allow or certify bills of exceptions, and if there had been, an allowance by a single bystander, interested in the cause, as was the fact in this case, would not have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">But the first error seems to be a fatal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The complaint before the justices was \u201cfor forcibly entering upon, and detaining possession of, the lower part of a tract of land situate on the bank of the Scioto river, opposite Piketon, the same being patented to the complainant by a patent from the President of the United States, bearing date March 2,1821.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The complaint is in nature of a declaration. It must give a venue, and must describe the premises with such certainty as will apprise the defendant of what is demanded of him, and as will afford a guide to the sheriff in executing the writ of restitution. In this case, it does not appear in what township or county the land is situate, nor how much of the entire tract is demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12-pl-split\">The judgment and writ of restitution must pursue the complaint, and, consequently, the sheriff must be directed to restore to the complainant the lower part of a tract of land on the bank of the Scioto river, opposite Piketon. This description forms no guide to the officer; it does not direct him how to find the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tract, nor what quantity of it he is to restore after it is found. The lower part of a tract, without metes and bounds, or quantity of acres, is too vague *and indefinite. It neither contains certainty, nor the means of arriving at certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Judgment reversed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b241-15\"> NoTE by the Editor \u2014 Justice can not sign or docket bills of exception in forcible entry or detainer, xvi. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">One justice may try in forcible entry and detainer, and in detainer, xli.
