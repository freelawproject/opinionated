Mors, or order, one hundred dollars, by the first day of October next succeeding said date, as by the said note to the court here shown appears. Yet the said Norman, although often requested, hath not paid the amount of said note, or any part thereof; but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>same to pay he hath wholly refused, and still doth refuse, to the plaintiff\u2019s damage of three hundred dollars. Therefore he sues,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5\">J'The defendant demurred generally. The court below sustained the demurrer, and gave judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5y\">The error assigned is, that judgment was rendered for the said Norman, when it ought to have been rendered for the said James.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b8-6\">Douglass, for the plaintiff in error, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">That the note was sufficiently set out in the declaration \u2014 that the defendant was fully apprised of the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u2014 that the declaration gave him all the notice necessary to prepare his defense \u2014 that the special averments of indebtedness, liability, assumption, and request of payment, found in the old precedents, were useless, and increased the cost bill unnecessarily. He 'referred to Kid and Ohitty, and a case decided in Massachusetts, in support of his declaration. He also referred to a case decided in Jackson county, by the Supreme Court, in which a declaration, .taken from the same precedent,, had been sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b8-8\">King, for the defendant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b8-9\">That the practice of Massachusetts was no guide for the courts \u25a0of this state \u2014 that the doctrine in Kid and Chitty could not be \u25a0sustained \u2014 that the mode of declaring on promissory notes, as on specialties, was condemned by the rules and principles of special pleading, and was contrary to the most approved precedents \u2014 that :the only plea in its favor was indolence \u2014 that it would destroy distinctions useful and supported by immemorial usage \u2014 and that he knew of no case in which the question had been settled in the \u2022Supreme Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AM\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b8-11\">If this question were now presented for the first time, we should at least hesitate. The objections to this laconic mode of declaring, are not without their weight, but we consider the point as settled by our predecessors, and do not feel at liberty to disturb it. The judgment, therefore, must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings-<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b8-12-pl-split\">Sote by the Editor. \u2014 Beaffirmed, iii. 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
