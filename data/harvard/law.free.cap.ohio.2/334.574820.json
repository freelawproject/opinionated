The company was duly organized under this charter, and D. J. Marple appointed cashier. Isaac Vanhorn, Jeffrey Price, Samuel Thompson, and John M\u2019lntire, executed with Marple, as securities, a bond in the penalty of twenty thousand dollars. And Marple proceeded to discharge the duties of cashier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">Before January 1, 1818, the legislature passed a law extending the charters of existing incorporated banks, until January 1,1843, upon certain terms and conditions; and with these terms and conditions the Bank of Muskingum complied, and Marple was continued cashier, without either a new appointment or a new bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">In 1815, M\u2019lntire, one of the securities, died. In 1819, Marple became a defaulter to a large amount; and suit was commenced against Marple, Vanhorn, Price, and Thompson, the surviving obligors, and judgment obtained against *them for the amount of the defalcation. At the trial no evidence was given of any default,before January 1, 1818. Thompson, the complainant, having paid one-third of the judgment, brought this bill against the devisees and executors of M\u2019lntire for contribution. The facts were presented by a plea, to which the complainants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-10\">Goddard, for the defendants, in support of the plea, maintained :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-11\">That the securities could not be charged with any defalcation that took place, after the expiration of the first charter, undei which the appointment was made, and the bond given.

He further contended that the judgment at law, against the complainants, did not conclude the defendants, who were not parties to that cause and had no agency in the defense made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-5\">No argument was presented on the other side.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-6\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The authorities adduced by the defendants are conclusive that the securities were not bound for any defalcation that took place after the expiration of the first charter. And we hold them to be in accordance with the soundest principles of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">It is equally clear that the defendants can not be concluded by an adjudication in a case where they were not parties. The bill must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
