It was a bill in chancery to enjoin the defendant from selling certain real estate, of which the complainants \u2022were in possession, upon an execution at law. The facts of the case are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-11\">On October 12,1820, 0. Schultz recovered a judgment against the Cincinnati Bank, for two thousand six hundred and ninety-eight dollars. Execution was sued out November 8, 1820, and levied on real estate, appraised at four thousand four hundred and fifty-eight dollars, and returned not sold.for want of bidders. The same return was made upon several writs of <em>vendi., </em>and on October 7,1822, the valuation was set aside, and a new valuation being made, the property was finally sold, August 16, 1824, for three hundred and \u25a0fifty-two dollars and twenty-six cents. The plaintiff, in October, 1824, sued out a new <em>fi. fa. </em>and caused it to be levied on the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>erty in question, which was owned by the Bank of Cincinnati, at the date of the judgment, and sold by them to the complainants, and conveyed on October 17, 1820. The bill assumed that, by the-proper construction of the statute of Ohio, the defendant, Schultz, had lost his lien upion the lands, and prayed an injunction to prevent the sale. The defendant demurred to the bill, and the cause-came on for hearing upon the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-5\">Stores., in support of the demurrer, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">1. That the court of chancery had no jurisdiction of the case made-in the bill. That it was not a bill to remove a cloud cast upon the complainant\u2019s title, because the defendant sets up no title, adverse or otherwise. \u25a0 He merely asserts a lien, the creature of the law, and until some person purchases under it, no right exists that a court can take cognizance of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">The right asserted by the complainants isa complete legal right,, and can be effectually asserted at law. For if there is a sale effected, the purchaser must, institute legal ^proceedings to obtain* possession, upon which the matter stated in the bill, if available at all as a defense, could be fully used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-8\">A decision upon this bill would not conclude the complainants.. If it were dismissed upon hearing, and a sale made, the complainants could still be heard in their defense at law, against the purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">In Weller <em>v. </em>Smeaton, 1 Cox. 103, it is laid down that bills of this-nature are only sustained in one of two cases: 1. To compel the party to try right. 2. To prevent multiplicity of suits. But where-one party claims, and another denies the right, chancery could not interfere. He cited, to the same point, 1 P. Wm. 672; 3 Johns. 566;. 2 Johns. Ch. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">On principle, however, it is conceived there is no equity in the-complainant\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">They rely, first, on the statute relating to banks and bankers, as-prescribing a course for the creditors of those institutions to pursue, to the exclusion of any other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-12\">To this, it may be briefly and satisfactorily answered, that the-remedy referred to was merely cumulative. That the proceedings on which the judgment referred to was rendered were had in the usual course of law, without reference to any special statute. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the lien was given by the judgment, and did not depend on any process subsequent to its rendition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">They rely, secondly, on the fact that in 1822, a statute was passed, in section 16 of which is contained the following provision : \u201c But if tho plaintiff, in any such judgment, shall not within the time aforesaid, cause the levy and appraisement to be set aside, as herein provided, then and in that case, such judgment shall operate only as a lion on such part of the debtor\u2019s estate as shall have been levied on.\u201d From this section, they draw the conclusion that the lien is not only lost against judgment creditors, but against subsequent purchasers also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">To this we answer, that the complainants are admitted to be purchasers, after the lien was created, by the rendition of the judgment in favor of the defendant. That the statute of 1822 was intended only to refer, and by a fair ^construction of its terms, does only relate to <em>bona fide </em>judgment creditors; that the defendant\u2019s lien was secured to him by the statute in force in 1820, which has no such exceptions as that contended for, as existing in the law of 1822, and being thus vested, can not be destroyed by any subsequent statute on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">On examination, it will be found that every statute which has been in force in Ohio, whether under the territorial or state government, with the exception of that part of section 18 of the law of 1822, which the complainants select as applicable to their case, expressly secure fhe lien given to judgment creditors, a preference, nevertheless, being secured to subsequent <em>bona fide </em>judgment creditors, where the prior creditor, by delay, has forfeited his right. In no case under these statutes, it is believed, was it ever contended that the lien was lost to tho judgment creditors in favor of a subsequent purchaser, unless the lapse of five years rendered tho lien of no avail; and, perhaps, even this last exception is not sustained by the prevailing opinion of the profession; though, it must be confessed, the reason of the law would seem to sanction the observation in its fullest extent. The nature of a lien on real estate presupposes that the entire control of the legal title is transferred to the judgment which binds it. Like a mortgage, it acts at once on the whole estate on which the judgment is a legal charge; the debtor is divested of his power to alien it, and the conscience of every man is affected by the judgment docketed, for \u25a0which he is bound to search. It could not be said that the cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>itor should be confined to a partial lien, when the language o\u00ed the statute gave him a general one; nor, yet, be compelled to take such portions of the debtor\u2019s estate as his security that caprice or interest might offer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">The law of 1822 was enacted under peculiar circumstances. Ureat commercial embarrassment had prevailed, and the dockets of the courts were crowded with judgments. Levies wore made, and creditors were contending for priority. The sheriff had been so frequently required by the debtor to levy on unproductive property, or for small sums on such valuable tracts of land, that no one would purchase *and pay the balance of the appraised value. It was fashionable to estimate real estate at an exorbitant price, and no buyers, of course, were in the market. To prevent some of these inconveniences, and, if possible, to remove them all, we believe, was the object of the statute referred to. In section <em>2 the judgment creditor is required to take out execution within one year from the rendition of judgment, and cause the same to be levied, </em>or it shall not operate as a lien to the prejudice of <em>any other bona fide judgment creditor. </em>This section, it will be seen, is altogether perspective. Section <em>16 </em>commences with a provision which authorizes the judgment creditor to set aside his levy <em>within six months after the taking effect of the act, and the court will award a new execution, which the creditor might levy agreeably to the provisions of that act; </em>and, after such levy, the judgment should not operate as a lien on the residue of the debtor\u2019s estate to the prejudice of any <em>bona fide judgment creditor.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">It then became necessary that some disposition should be made of those judgments where the levy was not set aside, and the section relied on by the complainants then follows. If there is anything in the structure of the sentences in the phrases used, or the apparent object in view on the part of the legislature, it appears clear to us that this second provision merely followed as an appendage to the first, and as no particular mention is made of other judgment creditors, that the intention obviously was so to connect it with the previous sections as to embrace the same persons within the exception that had already been named. To remove all doubt on the subject, it would seem that the subsequent exceptions, in the same section, refer expressly'to judgment creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7-pl-split\">When the complainants purchased the estate levied on, the defendant\u2019s judgment was an existing lien upon it. They were then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>charged with full notice of this incumbrance. This purchase was made in the year 1820. With what propriety can it be said that they are to be helped by the provisions of the law of 1822? By the statute in force at the time they became the owners of the premises, the judgment operated on those premises as a specific charge. *Now, if the law of 1822 should be construed to \u25a0extend in its exceptions to purchasers, it must be those who became such after that law has acted. If, by the neglect of the defendant, his lien was lost on the premises in dispute, it could not -operate to assist a previous purchaser ; more especially, when at the time of the levy on the premises in dispute by the defendant, the law of 1822 was repealed, and a statute similar in its terms to \u2022that under which the judgment was originally recovered was in 'full force. When the debtor aliened the premises to the complainants, his power so to do was controlled by the defendant\u2019s judgment; no valid transfer could be made; and if he acquired a new right by the neglect of the defendant to set aside his levy in 1822, lie must have subsequently transferred it to the complainants to have completed their title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-5\">Fox, for the bank, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">That the court of chancery has jurisdiction of the case, under section 9 of the chancery act of Ohio, 22 Ohio Laws, 77; that under this act, persons having a legal title to and being in possession \u25a0of land, have a right to institute a suit against any other person \u25a0setting up a claim thereto. The only question as to the jurisdiction of the court is, does the defendant set up a <em>claim to </em>the property. There can be no doubt that the defendant thinks he has a \u2022claim, or he would not prosecute his suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">The objection, that the right of complainants is a legal one, and can therefore be decided at law, is not a valid objection. We admit that, by the rules of the English court of chancery, the bill \u2022could not be sustained until the right had been tried at law. But this rule was found to be inconvenient in this country; and the legislature, by the act above' referred to, conferred a jurisdiction \u2022on the court which it did not before possess. The decisions cited by Mr. Storer are therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">On the second point, he contended that the defendant had no \u2022subsisting lien on the property by virtue of his judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-9\">If any such lien does subsist, it is by virtue of the law regn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>dating judgment and executions, passed in 1822; the law of 1820, on the same subject, being absolutely repealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyY\">*lt is admitted, that under the law of 1822, the defendant, had it in his power to have retained the lien he had acquired by his judgment in 1820, on the lot in dispute; at the same time, it. is insisted he has lost that lien by negligence, or by relying on the-sufficiency of the property he had already levied upon for the satisfaction of his judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">In order to have retained his lien on the lot in dispute, the present defendant was bound by section 16 of the act of 1822, to have made a levy thereon within six months of the taking effect of the act, and it is expressly provided that if the judgment creditor shall not cause his original levy to be set aside as provided for, <em>\u201cthen, and in that case, such judgment shall operate as a lien only on such part of the debtor's estate as shall be levied on.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">The statute operates as a statute of limitations in fact. The defendant was only required by this act to make his levy within six months, instead of waiting until the property already levied upon, should be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">As the court remarked, in the case of McCormack <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ohio, 74, in the clause of the statute above referred to, \u201c there is nothing doubtful, nothing ambiguous, no words made use of, which operate to defeat the manifest intention of the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">As the court have already decided that the legislature have Empower to take away liens and grant them at their pleasure, the law as it is, not as it ought to be, must govern the court. The legislature have declared their will that judgment creditors, in order to retain a lien already given, shall do certain acts. If they see proper to accept of the lien tendered, they must comply with the requisitions of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-10\">The fact that the complainants purchased subsequent to theereation of the lien of the defendant\u2019s judgment, can have no effect in the decision of the cause; for, if the legislature have the power to take away the lien and have done so, it is perfectly immaterial who has the fee of the property or when it was acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">The complainants purchased the lot and paid their money at a time when the judgment debtors had a great sufficiency of real estate (as was supposed) to satisfy the defendant\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnI\">*The property first levied upon, was valued at four thousand $ight hundred and forty-four dollars, could it have been reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>supposed that in two years afterward that same property would have been disposed of for the sum of three hundred and fifty-two dollars. If, therefore, the court are disposed to look at the equity of the cause, as between complainants and defendant, they will find that the parties stand at least on equal grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">Again we contend that the law of 1822, is absolutely repealed by the act of 1824, and the repealing law has no saving clause by which the liens of prior judgments are preserved. This last act gives a lien to judgments rendered subsequent to the taking effect of the act, and to those only. The defendant, therefore, can claim no lien whatever at this time, as there is no law giving a lien to judgments rendered in 1820.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-6\">Mr. Este, on the same side:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">The defendant contends:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">1. That the complainants have plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, and, therefore, that the court has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">\u25a0 2. If the court retain jurisdiction, there is no equity in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-10\">The court has jurisdiction by virtue of its general powers as a court of chancery; and specially, the ninth section of the chancery act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-11\">Its jurisdiction extends to all cases properly cognizable by a court of chancery, in which plain, adequate, and complete remedy can not be had at law. Ch. act, sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-12\">\u201c When there is a remedy at law, if it is doubtful or difficult, the courts of equity will hold jurisdiction.\u201d Cooper\u2019s Equity, 129; 1 Vesey, 417; 3 Johns. 590, the same case cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel. See also 2 Johns. Ch. 176, same case, and the same authorities there cited. 3 Johns. 605, 607; Livingston <em>v. </em>Van Ingens, 9 Johns. 507; 10 Johns. 587. \u201c Where the remedy at law is doubtful, chancery will relieve.\u201d Kent. \u201cI do not say that there was no defense at law, but the remedy was doubtful.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-13\">It will be seen, by a reference to the above cases, that chancery will relieve, when plain, adequate, and complete ^remedy can not be had at law; and when it is doubtful or difficult. In the case in 3 Johns., Judges Yan Ness and Kent sustain the bill, because the complainant does not appear to have a clear and adequate remedy at law, although the only question was about legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>If the complainants take no step until the sale of the property, \u25a0will the remedy at law be plain, adequate, and complete, free from \u25a0doubt and difficulty?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">They are admitted to be in possession, under a valid legal title. The defendant sets up no claim other than the alleged lien of the judgment against the Cincinnati Bank, and that this court is perfectly competent to decide on the nature, extent, and effect of the lien, there can be no doubt.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-6\">In the case in 9 Johns., Judge Kent not only states the power -of the court to determine a question of law, but in direct and strong terms x'epresonts the absurdity of sending a mere question \u25a0 of law to the .common law side of the court, when the judges before whom it is to be tried are members of the same court, etc. After the sale, they can not prevent the court, if the proceedings be regular, from ordering a deed to the pux\u2019chaser, and then, by the summary law of unlawful detainer, he may obtain the posses.\u2022sion, and compel the complainants to bring their ejectment. And \u2022 even a trial in ejectment will not be final. If the principle contended for by the defendant, be correct, the possession may be .\u25a0shifted before the title can be tried. To turn a man out of possession, under color of law, and give all the advantage possession .gives, in trying title, compel .him to bring his ejectment, to subject himself to the expense, delay, and vexation of a long, difficult, and doubtful contest, and then tell him that his remedy is plain, .-adequate, and complete, is an abuse of terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">It is expressly provided, in the ninth section of the chancery -act, that a person having both the legal title, and 'the possession of land, may institute a suit against any other person setting up a \u2022 claim thereto, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-11-pl-split\">The complainants have both the legal title and possession. The \u25a0defendant claims to have a lien on the land, secured by actual levy. The defendant\u2019s counsel, who questions the jurisdiction, has given this part of the case a very slight ^consideration. He contends that the dismissal of the bill would settle no legal right; and, therefore, that the complainants ask a vain thing. The force -of this argument is not perceived. This question is, whether the \u2022lien asserted, reduced to levy, constitutes a claim on the land, within the spirit of the law. The object of the law was to enable .-,a person, having the possession and legal title, to quiet himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>against all claims that might be set up against the land, whether-as direct claims of title, or of incumbrances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">What good reason can be assigned why the possessor of a tract of land, holding the legal title, should not be permitted to quiet a. judgment claim as well as any other? Can he improve with more safety, sell with less difficulty, or have less anxiety than if it were,a mortgage ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\">The lien is a claim and charge on the land, and if pursued to-execution, levy, and sale, the purchaser will have <em>a legal claim, of title. </em>Then, beyond dispute, the complainants could file their bill. Why delay them for that event? The question then will be, lien&gt; or no lien? This is the only question now. Dismiss the bill, and -\u25a0 what is the situation of the .complainants ? They must either satisfy the judgment, permit it to remain to the prejudice of their.' title, or suffer the property to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">But if the court has jurisdiction, it is contended that the complainants have no equity. In other words, that the judgment of Schultz was a lien on the lot at the time of the sale to the Bank of-the United States, and so continues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">One of the defendant\u2019s counsel has said that \u201cthe right of the.judgment creditor is the creature of the law, and that a court of-' equity can give no assistance to perfect his lien. It grows out <em>of,' </em>a statutory provision; it is altogether dependent on the statute-for its validity; <em>it is limited by statute, </em>and can only be <em>specifically-enforced in the manner pointed out by the statute.'\" </em>By the statute,, then, let us abide. The complainants contend that the judgment, of Schultz <em>never was a lien, and if it were, it no longer exists.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">On February 25, 1820, 18 Ohio L. 180, the judgment and execution law, under which Schultz\u2019s judgment was rendered, was passed,, and took effect *June following. It contains the same general provision subjecting the lands, etc., <em>of the debtor, </em>to a lien. This statute, without other legislation, might be said to embrace \u00a1 the debts of banks as well as individuals; but at the same session, on the 18th of the same month, to take effect on the 1st of June following, an act was passed to regulate proceedings against banks &gt; and bankers, which, by fair construction, makes an exception.. By this law, section 2, it is provided that a writ of <em>ft. fa. </em>(only).shall be the first process, and directing the officer to levy only on personal property, and no authority, in any case, is given to levy on lands. Had the legislature stopped here, it might be said that - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>I it did not appear sufficiently clear that they intended to form an exception. But at the next session a law was passed, to take effect March 1, 1821, declaring that, in <em>all cases </em>where judgments <em>had been </em>or should be rendered, the plaintiff might proceed under the law of 1820, <em>or he might issue a fi. fa. et lev. fa., </em>and on return of no goods, etc., proceed to levy on the real estate of the bank, but <em>no interest whatever </em>of the defendant would be conveyed that <em>was not in him at the time of the levy. </em>In January 28, 1825, 22 Ohio L. 358, an act was passed expressly limiting the lien <em>to the date of the levy, </em>and repealing all other laws on the same subject. If there be any weight in the argument that the remedy given by the law of 1820 was merely cumulative, it does not apply to the law of 1821, <em>for judgments, in all cases when .judgments had been or should be rendered, .are embraced. </em>And his election is given him whether to proceed and enforce the collection of his judgment, under the statute of 1820, or to issue his <em>fi. fa. et lev. fa. </em>If the latter, on failure of per.sonal estate, it shall be the further duty of the officer to levy on lands, etc., which such bank may hold by deed in fee simple, etc., .and to sell the same, under the restriction and limitation hereinafter mentioned; and on sale to make to the purchaser a deed therefor, therein and thereby conveying to him, etc., all the right which such bank, etc., had in or to the property sold <em>at the time the same was levied upon. </em>By section 2 the same reservation is made when any person holds lands in trust for the bank; and by sec-\u2019 tion 3 they are required to proceed to appraise *and sell, \u201cin the manner pointed out for the sale of real estate, under the provisions of the act regulating judgments and executions.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">The last section authorizes to proceed under either or both the .acts of 1820 or 1821, until his judgment is satisfied. The same provisions are substantially contained in the law of 1824, taking effect from its passage. The levy not being made until about four years after the sale to the complainants, <em>no lien ever attached.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">| But if the judgment against the Cincinnati Bank were a lien from the commencement of the term in which it was rendered, it did <em>not continue until the levy in </em>1824, <em>but ceased to exist by the-operation of the judgment and execution law of </em>1822, <em>after </em>December 1, .1822.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7-pl-split\">In 1820 a levy was made on sundry lots valued at four thousand \u25a0eight hundred and fifty-four dollars. They were appraised, and .several times advertised and offered at sheriff\u2019s sale, to be sold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>.and in October, 1822, the valuation was set. aside, and the levy remained. In June, 1824, a <em>ven. ex. </em>issued and sold in August. In \u2022September, a <em>fi. fa. et lev. fa. </em>issued for the residue, and a levy was made on the lot in controversy. By the judgment and execution law of February, 1822, in force June 1 of the same year, 21 Ohio L., sec. 16, p. 69, when lands had been taken in execution, and twice offered, the <em>levy and appraisement </em>might, at any time before December 1, 1822, be set aside on motion, and a new levy made on \u2022such property as the plaintiff might deem sufficient, and the lien of the judgment ceased on the residue of the estate as to any other judgment creditor. But if the <em>levy, etc., </em>were not set aside within six months, viz: by December 1,1822, <em>the lien remained, only on the property levied on. </em>The plaintiff was presumed to be entirely satisfied with the levy; the limitation fixed, within which to make up his opinion, expired. The lien was absolutely gone, and the judgment debtor at liberty to sell his real estate not levied on, free from the incumbrance of the judgment. If the statute receive a literal construction, then the conclusion is inevitable that the lien \u25a0ceased to exist after December 1,1822, on all the real estate of the Cincinnati Bank, except the lots levied on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">*But the defendant\u2019s counsel insist that the limitations and restrictions imposed on him by the act of 1822 were intended to .apply <em>exclusively </em>to other judgment creditors, and that in no state of the case could a judgment debtor sell his land free of the incumbrance of an existing judgment. And if he could, as the judgment was rendered in 1820, the law of 1822 could not affect it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">The general intention of the legislature in passing the law of 1822 was to limit the duration of existing and subsequent liens. Unnecessary oppression to the debtor, and injustice to junior judgment creditors, are the necessary results of general and long-continued liens; so much so that general liens are said to be \u201codious in the law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">In all the New England states, in Kentucky, and indeed in a majority of the states, a general lien of a judgment is unknown. There is no lien until levy, and then only on the property levied on. In these states, where the judgment operates as a general lien, it has from time to time been limited by statu te, restrained in its operation by judicial construction, and relief frequently afforded in equity. In the case of the Bank of N. America <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Fitzsimons, 3 Binney, 361, the judges argue strongly in favor of the policy of limiting the liens of judgments, and specify the many abuses growing out of their continuance. The knowledge of many actual abuses, and of probable future mischiefs, no doubt induced the legislature to pass the limitation act of 1822.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">By this law this intention of limitation is clearly expressed. In section 16 all cases of then existing liens were supposed to be-enumerated, and the time limited for their duration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">1. When there had been a levy and appraisement, and two-attempts to sell, if the plaintiff thought he had not sufficient insecure him, even at two-thirds of a valuation, he had the privilege of setting aside his levy, etc., and of levying on as much of the defendant\u2019s property as he pleased, any time within six months. If lie did this, the judgment operated as a lien on the residue of the-debtor\u2019s estate, to the prejudice of any other <em>bona fide </em>judgment, creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJt\">*2. If the plaintiffs were satisfied with his levy and appraisement, and did not choose to set them aside in six months,, \u201cthen, and in that case, such judgment shall operate as a lien only on such part of the debtor\u2019s estate as shall have been levied on.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-8\">3. When no levy had been made, it was authorized to be made in six months, and no lien to exist on the residue of the estate-after the levy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-9\">4. And lastly, no judgment, heretofore rendered, on which execution should not be taken out, and levied within a year, should-, operate as a lien on the estate of the debtor, to the prejudice of any other <em>bona fide </em>creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-10\">Having thus provided for all the liens of judgments existing, or-to come, and providing further, that the judgments shall all be collected agreeably to the provisions of that act, the legislature repealed, without qualification, all other laws on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-11-pl-split\">The defendant\u2019s counsel misconceive, when they suppose that we-contend that the law of 1822 created the lien, except as to future judgments. We view it as intending to limit, and actually limiting all old liens, and providing, and intending to provide, for every possible case of existing liens; and we think those cases not expressly enumerated, are embraced by fair construction and necessary implication. Their argument, therefore, on this branch of the-case can not apply. It is urged, that inasmuch as no previous legislature had limited the incumbrance, so as to permit the debtor: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to sell, and as in the act of 1822, the first, third, and fourth classes of cases in section 16, and all future judgments, are limited, only in favor of other judgment creditors, therefore the limit is tobe confined to them in the second class. The language is clear, explicit, and positive. The classes of cases are as distinctly marked, and the intention as manifest, as if they had been in different sections. Examine, and compare, and conceive if you can, how the intention to remove the lien altogether could have been more clearly expressed. <em>\u201c Then and in that case,\u201d </em>contradistinguishing it from the preceding, and from all other cases \u201c such judgment shall operate as a lien <em>only, </em>on such part of the debtor\u2019s estate as shall have been levied on.\u201d In the first class, *\u201c shall not operate as a lien, etc., to the prejudice,\u201d etc. So of the third and fourth. If it had been intended to limit the lien as in other cases, why not only omit the important words, \u201c to the prejudice,\u201d etc., but so construct the sentence as not to admit of their insertion. The attempt to consider the section 16 as providing for two classes only, and so' connecting them as to subject them to the same qualification, will not answer. Four classes are named, and all possible cases, agreeably to the spirit, intent, and general policy of the law, embraced. A general lien existed. It was inconvenient and injurious. It was intended to get rid of it, and yet, in such a way, as to give to creditors an opportunity, by the exercise of proper diligence, to secure themselves. It was limited under certain conditions and restrictions, \u201c but,\u201d if you do not comply, the limitation, in one state of the case, is absolute. If you are not satisfied with your <em>levy and appraisement, </em>set them aside any time within six months, and make a new levy; and from the time you <em>levy, before any appraisement takes place, </em>you shall cease to have a lien, to the prejudice of any other judgment creditor. <em>\u201c </em>But,\u201d if you are entirely satisfied with your <em>levy and appraisement, </em>if you feel quite safe, and do not choose to set them aside, etc., <em>then your lien shall cease altogether, except on the lands already levied on and appraised.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\">This court never will construe the lien as extending to the <em>residue of the debtor's estate, </em>in the class of cases specified, in favor of judgment creditors, because the word <em>purchasers </em>is not named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">In the case of the Bank of N. A. <em>v. </em>Fitzsimons, before referred to, the law of 1791, cited in a subsequent limitation act, makes no limitation of a judgment, but the mischiefs of continuing the liens of judgments are set forth in the preamble. \u201c It is said whereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>defendants as well as <em>subsequent purchasers </em>of real property suffer much vexation,\u201d etc. The court <em>[vide </em>pages 361-355] <em>extend </em>all the privileges to <em>judgment </em>creditors, although they are not named. And by the law of 1822, by fair argument, <em>and in all the other classes </em>(viz: first, third, fourth, etc.), after real estate had. been levied on, appraised, and twice offered, and the judgment creditor would not, in a <em>reasonable time, </em>move to set *aside his valuation, he should <em>lose his lien altogether, as well against purchasers </em>as against judgment debtors. It would be fairly carrying into effect the intention of the legislature, in remedying the mischiefs intended to be provided against; and this view of the subject is aided by the latter part of section 16. After enumerating the classes specified, \u201cand in all cases,\u201d as well those enumerated, except No. 2, as all other cases, those enumerated by defendant\u2019s counsel, and all others, if any existed, <em>\u201c </em>where real estate <em>has been </em>or may hereafter be taken in <em>execution and appraised, </em>and <em>twice advertised and offered for sale, </em>and shall remain unsold for want of bidders, it <em>shdll be </em>the duty of the court, on motion of the plaintiff, to set aside the inquest and appraisement so made, and on a subsequent execution, the estate, etc., shall be appraised and sold according to the provisions of this act.\u201d Now, I maintain that a fair consideration of this provision, connected with class No. 2, in section 16, will legitimately lead to the conclusion : that <em>in all cases whatsoever, </em>where real estate had been taken in execution, appraised, <em>and twice offered for sale, </em>and the party did not set aside his inquest and appraisement within six months, or at farthest one year afterward (but I would say, by fair limitation, <em>six </em>months), his lien was absolutely gone on the residue of the debtor\u2019s estate. In all the cases, except class No. 2, in section 16, and in all judgments thereafter to be rendered, if the plaintiff complied with the law, he lost his lien on the residue of the debtor\u2019s estate from the moment of his levy, and to all other j udgment creditors ; but retained it as against purchasers. How long ? For two, ten, or twenty years ? As long as he pleased ? By no means. Relief of the debtor from unnecessary oppression, protection of the fair purchaser for a valuable consideration, come not only within the spirit, but within the fair construction of the letter of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5-pl-split\">In <em>all cases whatsoever </em>it was provided that the plaintiff should <em>levy to his satisfaction. </em>In cases when he had levied and made two or <em>more </em>offers to sell, if dissatisfied with his levy, he could it aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>and enlarge it. If he had levied, and had not offered it twice, etc., he could unquestionably, by making use of due diligence, have two offers, *and move to set aside his levy and enlarge it. If he had not levied, he could levy until satisfied. So as to future judgments. It is manifest, therefore, that to prevent all cause of complaint from judgment creditors, permission and time were afforded to carve for themselves. This done, other judgment creditors might levy, free ot lien, on the residue, etc., and so on: The levy made, what next? Is all this provision made that the plaintiff, after having taken his choice of quantity and quality, be permitted to lie still at pleasure ? <em>Then </em>he is to proceed in <em>all respects </em>to pursue his levy under that act. He must proceed <em>immediately </em>to <em>appraise, advertise, etc. </em>Having proceeded with all reasonable diligence to offer the land levied on <em>twice, </em>after appraisement, if he do not <em>then, </em>under the latter part of section 16, set aside his appraisement, and obtain a revaluation within six months, he places himself in the situation of judgment creditor in class No. 2. He <em>loses his lien on the residue of the estate. </em>The express and positive limitation, then, <em>as to him, </em>the provision in the latter part of section 16, in <em>a given state of case </em>as to <em>all others, </em>show as clearly that the legislature intended to provide that the lien should absolutely cease to ekist on the residue of the debtor\u2019s estate, except the property levied on, as they intended to provide that the lien should cease to exist <em>from the date of the levy, </em>on the residue of his estate against other judgment creditors. There is good reason why full effect should be given to the plain import of the words of the legislature in the second class of section 16. Where a creditor has sufficient time and notice given him to set aside and enlarge his levy on a valuation, on which two attempts to sell have failed, two-thirds of which is more than sufficient to satisfy his whole claim, it is unreasonable and oppressive to tie up the hands of the debtor, and prevent him from selling his other lands for a fair consideration. He is indebted to those who have not sued him. He can not pay them, nor can he dispose of his lands to pay them. He must be sued, harassed, and subjected to accumulated interest .and costs, and <em>then the judgment creditor </em>may take the residue of his land unincumbered. Other mischiefs might be enumerated, and yet the court are asked to depart from the plain letter of the law *in violation of the policy of the act, and of <em>public policy, </em>to leave them in full operation on society. If the court de* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>part in <em>the least </em>from the <em>letter, </em>they will rather embrace in <em>all the limitations purchasers for a valuable </em>consideration than exclude-them. If the law were doubtful, the court would seize upon it in favor of the fair purchaser and general policy. How, then, when-the language is clear and explicit, can it be supposed that the purchaser will be set aside ? It is further urged, that as the judgment was a lien in 1820, although it ceased to exist by the law of 1822, yet, as the conveyance of the Cincinnati Bank was during-the existence of the lien, the deed must be considered void, and before the complainants could acquire any title, it should be shown-that there was a conveyance <em>since </em>the expiration of the time to set-aside the levy in 1822. The defendant\u2019s counsel have certainly-made a judgment lien accommodate itself to their wishes.\"When the jurisdiction of the court is assailed, it sets so loosely as to constitute <em>no claim </em>on the land. Again, it is made to fasten so-closely as that nothing can separate it. It forms an exception to-all subjects of limitation. During life no right can be acquired that can survive it, and after death it may be revived at pleasure,, to reach back to its birth with all its power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-5\">The law of 1824, it is said, <em>revives the lien. </em>The words of the counsel are, \u201c This limitation of a lien of a previous judgment is abrogated by the act of 1824, and the <em>lien restored in general terms, in all cases when execution was sued out in twelve months. </em>The power thus to restore the lien, when it affected no rights acquired in the meantime, certainly existed in the legislature, and the complainants acquired no rights under the law of 1822.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">It is admitted in this argument, that under the law of 1822, the-lien was taken away. It is affirmed that the conveyance made to the complainants before that time, did not place them in a situation to acquire <em>any right </em>by the operation of that law, which the-legislature <em>did not </em>and <em>could not </em>destroy by the act of 1824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-7\">The whole of this argument is unsound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-8\">The law of 1824 did not restore the lien which had expired, and the complainant did acquire rights under the law *of 1822, which the legislature <em>could not constitutionally deprive them of, if it did restore the lien.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-9-pl-split\">In 1824, when the statutes were revived, the time having elapsed, by the law of 1822, for all judgment creditors prior to that time to secure their liens, and the legal presumption being that they had complied with the law, and presuming, also, that subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>judgment creditors had levied within a year, it was enacted, \u201c That \u25a0no judgment heretofore rendered, or which hereafter may be rendered, on which execution shall not have been taken out, and levied within the expiration of one year, after the rendition of such judgment, shall operate as a lien on the residue of the debtor\u2019s \u2022estate, to the prejudice of any other <em>bona </em>fide judgment creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIbt\">But if the legislature did take away a lien, secured under the act of 1822, not levied within a year after the date of the judgment, did it <em>revive the lien which had expired, because an execution had been issued within twelve months from date ? </em>From this, it is inferred that every judgment levied <em>within a year </em>is a lien, <em>as well before </em>as <em>after </em>1822. This inference could <em>only </em>be correct if the law of 1822 <em>had never passed. </em>Then the law of 1824 would have been the <em>first limitation act. </em>By the law of 1822, the lien was not merely suspended, it did not remain dormant, but it became extinct. In the language of Judge Breckenridge, it was \u201cgone to all intents and purposes.\u201d When, therefore, the legislature say, \u201c no judgment heretofore rendered, on which execution shall not,\u201d \u25a0etc., refers to the law of 1822, and from that prospectively; and \u25a0so far from intending to revive liens limited under that act, it intends to prevent revival or extension ; to leave the old judgments as limited by 1822; to continue in force the lien of those since rendered, if levied within a year, as in that law provided, and to continue the limitation of future judgments to the same period. If, however, the act of 1824 should be so understood as to take away liens secured under the act of 1822, it follows conclusively, from the above remarks, that it did not intend to <em>revive them. </em>Revive! When is the lien treated as dormant? The counsel have been driven to the necessity of giving color to an untenable position, to use the terms \u201ctemporary suspension,\u201d \u201ctemporary removal,\u201d and to assimilate it to <em>revived judgment Hien. </em>You may <em>revive a dormant lien </em>by reviving a dormant judgment, <em>provided' </em>that the <em>lien necessarily attaches to the judgment. </em>But if the lien be once severed, once destroyed, it never can again attach, except by legislative enactment, and I would add, <em>prospectively. </em>\u201c A judgment revived by <em>sci.fa. </em>revives the lien of the original judgment, with all its incidents and powers.\u201d Not so, since the limitation act of 1822, if it be intended to say that it revives a judgmont <em>prior to that time, </em>with <em>the lien it had at the time it was rendered. </em>It revives it only with the lien <em>incidental to it, at the time it became </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>dormant, if any lien can now be said to be an incident of a dormant judgment. If the lien had been lost before revival, it was-do longer an incident to the judgment, and the revival of the-judgment no more revives the lien, than if the lien had never-existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-5\">'A lien is not <em>necessarily an incident </em>of a judgment.- When a law, then, takes away a lien, and another law authorizes the revival of an unsatisfied judgment, how does it follow that the removal liem attaches to it ? It could easily be shown, if necessary, that no lien-whatever is incidental to a judgment, since the limitations of 1822, which judgment requires revival by the five years\u2019 law. We hasten, however, to a conclusion, and without stopping to inquire into the power.of the legislature, as contended for, which we by no means admit. For we insist, it would be equally a violation of right to take it away, whether it was acquired before or after the-destruction of the lien. Our case comes clearly within the counsel\u2019s own exclusion of legislative power, viz: \u201cWhere a right acquired-in the meantime is affected.\u201d For we did acquire rights* under the law of 1822, which a revival of the lien would impair. By a non-compliance of the defendant with the conditions of the law of 1822, our title, previously incumbered, was freed from, that incumbrance. To us, it was equivalent to satisfaction of the- ' judgment. We could enjoy, improve, or sell, clear of incumbrance. By the neglect of the defendant, and the operation of law, then the lien was removed, and we acquired a positive right, to hold and alien, discharged from it. As for the argument of infringing on vested rights, as contended for by one of the counsel,. it can have no place here. None are infringed or ^intended, to be. The most liberal offers were made to the defendant to help himself. He was either satisfied, or slept on his rights. As asserted by Judge Breckenridge, in the case before cited, it \u201cinvolves an inconsistency to suppose that the act did not embrace judgments already rendered, and contends for the exoneration of the property from the lien to all intents and purposes. He admits that the statute has a retrospective effect, but says there can be no unconstitutional objection to the power of the legislature, to enjoin such conditions as may let in the rights of others. A principle of the artificial system of the law gave the lien, and the law-may think proper to dissolve it. 1 <em>Omni solvitur eo ligamine quo&gt; ligatur.\u2019 </em>\u201d See also the case of McCormick, 2 Ohio.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Ewing and Hammond, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">Upon the facts in this case, the complainants insist that the defendant has lost his lien. And they ground themselves upon two positions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-6\">\u2022 1. As the levy was not set aside conformable to section 16 of the act of February 1, 1822 the lien upon all the debtor\u2019s lands,, except those levied upon, was lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-7\">2. No lien is reserved for previous judgments by the act of February 4, 1824, which repealed all previous laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-8\">Section 16 of the act of 1822, contains two provisions in relation to two distinct eases of judgments theretofore rendered : one where execution had been sued out and levied upon land, which had twice been offered for sale, and returned unsold; the other, where no execution had been sued out at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-9\">In the first case, the court are directed to set aside the appraisement and levy, if appplieation be made to that effect by the plaintiff, within six months from the taking effect of the act. This being done, a new execution may issue, and a new levy be made. And if, upon the return, the property levied on be appraised at one-third more than the debt, the lien, as to the residue of the debtor\u2019s estate, shall cease as to every other <em>bona fide </em>creditor <em>by </em>judgment. <em>\u201cBut,\u201d </em>the act proceeds, if this be not done, \u201c such judgment shall operate only as a lien on such part of the debtor\u2019s estate as shall be levied on.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-10\">*In the second case, that is, where no execution has been taken out, it is made lawful to sue out execution within six months from the taking effect of the act. After which, upon the same principles, as in the other case, the lien was at an end, as to the debtor\u2019s other estate, to the prejudice of any other <em>bona fide </em>judgment debtor. And it is further provided, that no judgment heretofore rendered shall operate as a lien upon the debtor\u2019s lands, against any other judgment creditor, unless execution be taken out within twelve months from the taking effect of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-11\">The object of this act is to settle the priority of lien between judgment creditors, and to determine the continuance and termination of the lien between judgments. The previous law, that of 1820, had given a general lien. This limited that lien, not as to the debtor or purchasers from him, but as to judgments only. The complainants attempt to separate a part of a sentence from its connection and context, and give it a meaning inconsistent with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>connection and context. Where land has been levied upon, and twice offered for sale, a certain proceeding may be had from which this consequence is to result, that is, the lien, as against a judgment creditor, shall be limited to the land levied on. <em>\"But\u201d </em>which is the same thing as to say nevertheless, in the case stated, and as between the same parties, if this proceeding be not had, the lien shall be confined to the property levied upon. It would seem to be a violation of all sound construction, to interpret the word but, so famous for its character and qualification and negation, and used uniformly to introduce the minor proposition, in logic, as an enlargement of what preceded it in the same sentence. If the levy be set aside, and a new one made, the existing lien shall operate only upon the lands levied, as against other judgment creditors. \u201c <em>But\u201d </em>if this be not done, the existing lien shall be limited to the lands first levied upon. Because the words, \u201cother judgment creditors,\u201d are not here repeated, it is maintained that this <em>\"but\u201d </em>extends the limitation to the case of purchasers. We insist that this can only be done by inserting additional terms, introducing a new class of creditors; especially a class nowhere provided for in the whole law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7o5\">*The next case provided for, is that of judgments upon which no execution has issued. On these, executions, if taken out and levied within six months, shall also, in the case stated, limit the lien, as between judgment creditors. <em>\"And\u201d </em>not <em>\"but\u201d </em>in such case if no execution be taken out in twelve months, the lien shall not operate at all to the prejudice of a judgment creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-6-pl-split\">This act, taken altogether, is a curious one, very defective, and somewhat unjust in its provisions. The creditor who has been so diligent as to sue out and levy his execution, and procure the land to be twice offered for sale, is limited, in his lien, to the land levied on, unless he set aside his own proceedings, at his own expense, and sue a new execution within six months. And, according to the interpretation claimed by the complainants, if he do not incur expense, as the penalty for his diligence, he loses his lien against everybody, except the subject levied on. The creditor, who has sued out no execution at all, holds his entire lien for twelve months, and then loses it. only as against a judgment creditor! This ought not to be. It never could have been the intention of the legislature. The absurdity is glaring enough as it- must stand. It ought not to be increased by construction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>made to mean what the letter does not call for, and embrace a class of creditors to which no part of the act applies. It comes fairly within the rule laid down by this court, in McCormick <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ohio, 74. \u201cWhere there is anything doubtful in a statute, it is the duty of a court, in expounding it, to give it such, construction as will comport with what is supposed to have been the intention of the enacting power. And where the intention is manifest, but that intention is in part defeated, by the use of some particular <em>word or phrase, </em>the court will look to the intention rather than the words.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-5\">These remarks were applied to the statute of 1824. In the case \u2022under consideration they are strictly applicable. They prescribe the rule by which this section should be interpreted. To be sure, there is no \u201c <em>word or phrase,\" </em>which imposes upon the court, the \u2022construction set up by the complainants. They are called upon to construe general terms, used in reference to particular subjects, \u2022in a ^universal sense, so as to introduce totally new cases and parties, for which, and for whom the act never was intended to make provision, and does, in no other part of it, make any provision whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-6\">The counsel on the other side treat this question as if the act of 1822 created the lien. As if we founded our claim upon that law. They forget that it is introduced by themselves, to limit our previous existing rights. They certainly err when they assert that the sentence of the law they rely upon, has no connection with other provisions of the law. This we have already shown. But they go further. They say we must maintain our lien on the act of 1822, because the act of 1820 is repealed, without a saving clause, by the act of 1822; and this act, they add, is repealed by that of 1824. And both these acts are held to be prospective. If this argument be correct, no judgment rendered previous to the taking off of the act of 1824, can operate as a lien, or indeed be enforced except by action of debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-7\">Section 16 of the act of 1822 contains all in that act that relates to previous judgments. It authorizes executions in but two cases, in terms, upon previous judgments; one where the levy was set aside after two attempts to sell; the other where no execution had been taken out, but should be taken out within six months from the taking effect of the act. By implication it would seem to authorize proceeding to sell upon the old levy in the first case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to take out execution within twelve months in the second. But-many cases may and do exist of previous judgments, which this section does not embrace \u2014 we enumerate some of them: where execution has been sued out, but not levied; has been levied, but-no attempt to sell; or where, upon a levy, there has been one attempt, to sell. Section 16 can not embrace any of those cases, and upon the opposite argument, there can be no proceeding by execution; the act of 1820 is repealed, that of 1822 prospective. The act of 1824 contains no provisions as to judgments theretofore rendered, except that of section 17, taking away the lien as against another judgment creditor, where execution has not been sued out in twelvemonths. If this *act be prospective, then no proceeding cam be had upon any previous judgment, if the ojjposite argument be sound. This consequence, and the universal \u00abpractice to the contrary, show that it is unsound. Section 2 of the act of 1824 continues the lien secured by previous judgments, and creates it as to those subsequent. And all the subsequent provisions apply to existing judgments and executions without regard to dates. The complainants, therefore, can not sustain either of the grounds on which they rely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5-pl-split\">Supposing, however, that they are correct in their interpretation of section 16 of the act of 1822, that it limited our lien to the lands-levied on, because we did not set aside our levy at our own expense,, what right did the plaintiffs acquire from that result? It is to be recollected that this limitation of the lien of a previous judgment is-abrogated by the act of 1824, and the lien restored, in general terms, in all cases where execution was sued out in twelve months. The-power thus to restore the lien, where it affected no rights acquired, in the meantime, certainly existed in the legislature. In the case of McCormick <em>v. </em>Alexander, before cited, the court decide that this lien is the mere creature of the law, and may be given or taken away at discretion. Now the complainants acquired no right under the act of 1822. When they made their purchase in 1820, they purchased subject to this lien. The subsequent law and proceedings of the defendant operated nothing upon the rights of the complainants. The temporary removal of the lien vested no new interest-in them, no new right accrued in virtue of any contract made in.\u00ed\u00e1ith of an existing law, and the restoration of the lien violated no &gt; -vested right. It left the complainants where they placed themselves - by their contract, and consequently could not impair that contract-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>This court have decided that land acquired after a judgment is not. subject to the lien. By the same rule, lands subject to the lien,, are not exonerated by a temporary suspension of that lien, unless in respect to rights originated during that suspension. A judgment revived by <em>sci. fa. </em>revives the lien of the original judgment. It is revived in all its incidents, and with all its powers. So the restoration of the lien in this case, suppose *it to have been lost, gives it operative effect from its original date. Ve conceive that upon a just view of the whole case the rights of the parties remain as they were when the complainants made their purchase, and that the lands in question are liable to our execution. Upon the other point of the cause, that of jurisdiction, we deem it unnecessary tO' add anything to the argument of Mr. Storer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-5\">The enactments in respect to judicial proceedings against banks and bankers are referred to by one of the complainants\u2019 counsel. But they have certainly no bearing on the case. They were intended to be, and are cumulative remedies. Schultz was not bound to proceed under them, and did not so proceed. His case stands as it would have stood had those laws never been passed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The court were unanimously of opinion that a court of equity might properly interfere to prevent a sale of land upon execution, where such sale would not at law confer a title on the purchaser. And its only consequence would be to embarrass the title of the complainants. Upon the merits of the case arising on the construction of the provisions of the statutes, the court were equally divided in opinion. Consequently the bill was dismissed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Note by the Editor. \u2014 Reaffirmed, iii. 73; v. 48, 178; S.
