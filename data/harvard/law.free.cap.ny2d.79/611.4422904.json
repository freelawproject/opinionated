For the reasons that follow, we conclude that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">According to the evidence adduced below, Jason Schuhle \u2014 a 17-year-old youth \u2014 met defendant on a street in the Village of McGraw, New York, during the early morning hours of August 6, 1988. Schuhle \u2014 who, at the time, was extremely distraught over having recently broken-up with his girlfriend\u2014 immediately imparted to defendant his desire to kill himself. At defendant\u2019s invitation, Schuhle then accompanied him back to defendant\u2019s apartment. There, for approximately the next half hour or so, Schuhle \u2014 who had been drinking heavily \u2014continued to express suicidal thoughts and repeatedly importuned defendant to shoot him. In response to these entreaties, defendant provided Schuhle with some more alcohol and challenged him several times to jump headfirst off the porch of his second-story apartment. Finally, defendant \u2014 who later explained to the police that he was \"tired\u201d of hearing Schuhle complain about wanting to die \u2014 told Schuhle that he had a gun which he could use to kill himself. Defendant then retrieved a British .303 caliber Enfield rifle from his gun cabinet, and handed it to Schuhle, along with a number of bullets. He then urged Schuhle to \"put the gun in his mouth and blow his head off.\u201d Moments later, Schuhle loaded the rifle, pointed the barrel at himself and pulled the trigger. He later died as a result of the massive injuries he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Defendant was thereafter indicted for two counts of manslaughter in the second degree. The first count alleged that he had intentionally caused or aided Schuhle in committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>suicide <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [3]), and the second alleged that he had recklessly caused Schuhle\u2019s death <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]). After a jury trial, defendant was acquitted of the first count but convicted of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On appeal, however, the Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the indictment. The court \u2014 with one Justice concurring in result only \u2014 concluded that defendant\u2019s conviction for <em>reckless </em>manslaughter <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]) could not be sustained because, in its view, Penal Law \u00a7 125.15, when read as a whole, clearly evinced a legislative intent \"that a person be found guilty of manslaughter in the second degree for causing or aiding a suicide <em>only when he or she acts </em>intentionally\u201d (171 AD2d 900, 901 [emphasis added]; <em>see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [3]). A Judge of this Court subsequently granted the People leave to appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">At the outset, we note that the conduct with which defendant was charged clearly fell within the scope of section 125.15 (l)\u2019s proscription against recklessly causing the death of another person. As the People aptly observe, a person who, knowing that another is contemplating immediate suicide, deliberately prods that person to go forward <em>and </em>furnishes the means of bringing about death may certainly be said to have \"consciously disregarded] a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d that his actions would result in the death of that person <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [3]; \u00a7 125.15 [1]). Accordingly, unless the Appellate Division correctly concluded that, despite the apparent applicability of section 125.15 (1), it was nevertheless specifically contemplated by the Legislature that second degree manslaughter prosecutions involving suicide-related homicides would be maintainable <em>solely </em>pursuant to section 125.15 (3), defendant\u2019s prosecution for reckless manslaughter cannot be said to have been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">As a general rule, a statutory prohibition against a particular type of conduct will not be deemed to constitute the exclusive vehicle for prosecuting that conduct unless the Legislature clearly intended such a result <em>(see, People v Valenza, </em>60 NY2d 363, 371-372). Defendant argues that the Legislature evinced just such an intention here when it specifically proscribed only <em>\"intentionally </em>caus[ing] or aid[ing] another person to commit suicide\u201d in section 125.15 (3). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Nothing in the language or the legislative history of section 125.15 (3) suggests that the Legislature intended to foreclose second degree manslaughter prosecutions for recklessly causing a suicide. Rather, by all indications, section 125.15 (3) was simply meant to serve as a means of prosecuting those who, while having intentionally caused or aided another person to kill him- or herself, were not, in the Legislature\u2019s judgment, as culpable as intentional murderers <em>(compare, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [3] [providing that \"intentionally caus(ing) or aid(ing) another person to commit suicide\u201d constitutes second degree manslaughter], <em>with </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1] [b] [providing that it is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for second degree murder that \"(t)he defendant\u2019s conduct consisted of causing or aiding, without the use of duress or deception, another person to commit suicide\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>Staff Notes of Commn on Revision of Penal Law and Grim Code, Proposed NY Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Spec Pamph, at 339 [1964]; Denzer and McQuillan, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law \u00a7 125.15, at 226-227 [1967]).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Nor can we discern any reason why the Legislature would have wanted to limit criminal liability for causing a suicide to those instances where the accused acted intentionally. An individual who \u2014 like defendant \u2014 consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his actions will lead to another person\u2019s killing him- or herself and thereby causes that person\u2019s death may be just as culpable as one who intentionally causes or aids another to commit suicide <em>(see, </em>Staff Notes, <em>op. cit., </em>at 339 [noting that section 125.15 (3)\u2019s proscription against intentionally causing or aiding a suicide applies even where the defendant is motivated by \"sympathetic\u201d concerns, such as the desire to relieve a terminally ill person from the agony of a painful disease]). In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, we are simply unwilling to ascribe to the Legislature an intent to criminalize the latter conduct while at the same time subjecting the former to no penal sanction at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Having concluded that a person may be convicted of second degree manslaughter for having engaged in reckless conduct which results in another person\u2019s committing suicide <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]), we now turn to the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct here was a \"sufficiently direct cause\u201d of Schuhle\u2019s death to subject him to criminal liability <em>(see generally, </em>Brenner, <em>Undue Influence in the Criminal Law: A Proposed Analysis of the Criminal Offense of \"Causing Suicide\u201d, </em>47 Albany L Rev 62 [1982]). Defendant, stressing the fact that it was Schuhle \u2014 not he \u2014 who loaded the rifle and pulled the trigger, urges us to answer this question in the negative. We find defendant\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Generally speaking, a person will not be held criminally accountable for engaging in conduct which results in another person\u2019s death unless it can be demonstrated that his actions were \"an actual contributory cause of death, in the sense that they 'forged a link in the chain of causes which actually brought about the death\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270, 280, quoting <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692, 697). The proof adduced below, when viewed in a light most favorable to the People <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495; <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621), indicates that defendant gave Schuhle a rifle and a number of rounds of ammunition knowing full well that Schuhle had been drinking heavily and was in an extremely depressed and suicidal state, and that he then began taunting Schuhle to \"put the gun in his mouth and blow his head off.\u201d In light of this evidence, we must disagree with defendant that Schuhle\u2019s act of loading the rifle and using it to kill himself constituted an intervening cause which \u2014as a matter of law \u2014 relieved defendant of criminal responsibility. The jury could rationally have concluded that the risk of Schuhle\u2019s taking these actions was something which defendant should have, under the circumstances, plainly foreseen <em>(People v Galle, </em>77 NY2d 953, 955, quoting <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407, 412; <em>see, Matter of Anthony M., supra, </em>at 280-281; <em>People v Warner-Lambert Co., </em>51 NY2d 295, 307; <em>People v Stewart, supra, </em>at 697; <em>People v Cruciani, </em>36 NY2d 304, 305-306; Donnino, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law art 125, at 497-498 [1987]; <em>cf., People v Pinckney, </em>38 AD2d 217, <em>affd </em>32 NY2d 749). There is therefore no basis, on this Court\u2019s review, to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to that court for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Kaye, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Judge Simons taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, Third Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
