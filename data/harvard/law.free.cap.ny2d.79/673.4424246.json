VII. Defendant was deprived of his State and Federal constitutional rights to a fair trial by the trial court\u2019s ex parte interview with the media and its failure to take proper steps to shield him from the adverse effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>massive publicity. <em>(Gardner v Florida, </em>430 US 349; <em>Williams v New York, </em>337 US 241; <em>Matter of National Broadcasting Co. v Cooperman, </em>116 AD2d 287; <em>Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333; <em>Chandler v Florida, </em>449 US 560; <em>Estes v Texas, </em>381 US 532; <em>Matter of People v Solomon, </em>138 Misc 2d 587; <em>Matier of Ladone v Lerner, </em>135 AD2d 535; <em>People v Brensic, </em>136 AD2d 169; <em>Matter of Poughkeepsie Newspapers v Rosenblatt, </em>92 AD2d 232.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-5\"><em>Robert M.

Defendant\u2019s guilt of manslaughter in the first degree was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v Logan, </em>74 NY2d 859; <em>People v Bynum, </em>70 NY2d 858; <em>People v Stahl, </em>53 NY2d 1048; <em>People v Dekle, </em>56 NY2d 835; <em>People v Karabinas, </em>63 NY2d 871, 470 US 1087; <em>People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103; <em>Matter of Eichner [Fox] </em>73 AD2d 431, <em>mod on other grounds sub nom.

The Trial Justice responded correctly to the jury\u2019s request for supplemental instructions on intent. Moreover, the Judge properly instructed the jury not to consider the count of manslaughter in the second degree until they had acquitted defendant of manslaughter in the . first degree. <em>(People v Getch, </em>50 NY2d 456; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>293 NY 259; <em>People v Jackson, </em>76 NY2d 908; <em>People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d 296, 459 US 847; <em>People v Cooke, </em>292 NY 185; <em>People v Flynn, </em>290 NY 220; <em>People v Boettcher, </em>69 NY2d 174; <em>People v Karabinas, </em>63 NY2d 871, 470 US 1087; <em>People v Hoke, </em>62 NY2d 1022; <em>People v Chin, </em>67 NY2d 22.) III. The trial court correctly determined that diminished capacity is not recognized as an independent defense in New York, and did not preclude defendant from making proper arguments in summation that bore on his criminal intent. <em>(People v Segal, </em>54 NY2d 58; <em>People v Moran, </em>249 NY 179; <em>People v Colavecchio, </em>11 AD2d 161; <em>People v Westergard, </em>113 AD2d 640, 69 NY2d 642.) IV. The prosecutors\u2019 conduct was fair and proper. <em>(People v Balls, </em>69 NY2d 641; <em>People v Galloway, </em>54 NY2d 396; <em>People v Bagarozy, </em>132 AD2d 225; <em>People v Fields, </em>27 AD2d 736; <em>People v Jorge, </em>171 AD2d 498; <em>People v Tutt, </em>38 NY2d 1011; <em>People v Fleming, </em>70 NY2d 947; <em>People v Lovello, </em>1 NY2d 436; <em>People v Rosario, </em>9 NY2d 286, 368 US 866; <em>People v Simonds, </em>73 NY2d 945.) V. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were entirely proper. <em>(People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350; <em>People v Gines, </em>36 NY2d 932; <em>People v Berrios, </em>71 NY2d 905; <em>People v Hudy, </em>73 NY2d 40; <em>People v Alvino, </em>71 NY2d 233; <em>People v Carter, </em>77 NY2d 95; <em>People v Brown, </em>160 AD2d 440, 78 NY2d 874; <em>People v Montanez, </em>41 NY2d 53; <em>People v Green, </em>35 NY2d 437.)

VII. The Trial Justice conducted defendant\u2019s trial in a fair and impartial manner. <em>(Matter of New York Times Co. v Rothwax, </em>143 AD2d 592; <em>People v Moore </em>42 NY2d 421, 434 US 987; <em>Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333; <em>Matter of Oliver v Postel, </em>37 AD2d 498, 30 NY2d 171; <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v Stuart, </em>427 US 539; <em>People v Boudin, </em>90 AD2d 253; <em>People v Harris, </em>84 AD2d 63, 57 NY2d 335; <em>Murphy v Florida, </em>421 US 794; <em>People v DiPiazza, </em>24 NY2d 342; <em>Stephens v People, </em>19 NY 549.).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b754-6\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Defendant\u2019s appeal from a conviction of first degree manslaughter, involving the death of six-year-old Lisa Steinberg, centers on his contention that only a person with medical expertise can form the requisite intent to cause serious physical injury to a child by failing to obtain medical care. We conclude that this contention, as well as the several others defendant advances, lack merit, and that the Appellate Division order sustaining the conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">In the evening of November 1, 1987, defendant and Hedda Nussbaum were at home in their one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, with their two \"adopted\u201d children, Lisa, then six years old, and Mitchell, 16 months old. Nussbaum was in the kitchen with Lisa while defendant dressed in the bedroom for his dinner appointment with a friend. Lisa went into the bedroom to ask defendant to take her with him. Moments later, defendant carried Lisa\u2019s limp body out to Nussbaum, who was then in the bathroom, and they laid the child on the bathroom floor. Lisa was unconscious, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>experienced blunt head trauma of great force, and her breathing was raspy. According to Nussbaum, defendant later admitted that he had \"knocked [Lisa] down and she didn\u2019t want to get up again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">While Nussbaum attempted to revive Lisa, defendant continued dressing. Defendant told Nussbaum to let her sleep, promised to awaken the child upon his return, and then left for dinner. Nussbaum did not seek medical care for Lisa because she believed defendant had supernatural healing powers, and felt that calling for assistance would be considered a sign of disloyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Defendant returned about three hours later, at 10:00 p.m., retrieved a file relating to his oil well investments, and left again. When he came back a few minutes later, Nussbaum urged him to revive the still-unconscious child. Defendant declined \u2014 explaining that they \"ha[d] to be relating when she wakes up\u201d \u2014 and he instead freebased cocaine for the next several hours. Finally, at 4:00 a.m., after Nussbaum\u2019s repeated urgings, defendant carried Lisa from the bathroom floor to the bedroom, where her breathing seemed to sound better. Defendant rested his arm on Lisa, and continued talking to Nussbaum.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">At 6:00 a.m., when Nussbaum left the room, defendant called out that Lisa had stopped breathing. Defendant initially rejected Nussbaum\u2019s offer to call 911, but finally acceded when his attempts to resuscitate the child failed. Police and paramedics arrived shortly after being summoned, administered oxygen, and rushed Lisa to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">At the hospital, defendant explained that Lisa had gone to bed complaining of a stomach ache, and had vomited during the night, but that he believed she was otherwise all right until he checked on her around 6:00 a.m. and discovered that her breathing was coarse. In fact, the doctors determined that Lisa, who was in a coma, was suffering from severe head injuries \u2014 a result of blunt trauma \u2014 and placed her on life support equipment. Lisa\u2019s condition did not improve, and neurological tests performed on November 3 indicated that she was brain dead. Life support was discontinued on November 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Defendant was indicted for second degree (depraved indifference) murder, first degree manslaughter, and seven charges that were severed or dismissed. Defendant was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter, and the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Division affirmed the conviction. We find no error and accordingly also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">First degree manslaughter requires proof that defendant, with intent to cause serious physical injury,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> caused death (Penal Law \u00a7 125.20 [1]). The People\u2019s theory, as charged to the jury, was that defendant performed both acts of commission (striking Lisa) and acts of omission (failure to obtain medical care), each with intent to cause serious physical injury, and that such acts caused Lisa\u2019s death. Defendant contends that failure to obtain medical care for a child cannot, as a matter of law, support the <em>mens rea </em>element of first degree manslaughter \u2014 intent to cause serious physical injury \u2014unless defendant has medical expertise, and would thereby know that serious injury will result from a lack of medical attention. That contention \u2014 which he characterizes as the core question on this appeal \u2014 is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The Penal Law provides that criminal liability may be based on an omission <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05), which is defined as the failure to perform a legally imposed duty (Penal Law \u00a7 15.00 [3]). Parents have a nondelegable affirmative duty to provide their children with adequate medical care <em>(Matter of Hofbauer, </em>47 NY2d 648, 654-655; Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 [f] [i] [A]). Thus, a parent\u2019s failure to fulfill that duty can form the basis of a homicide charge <em>(see, People v Flayhart, </em>72 NY2d 737; <em>People v Henson, </em>33 NY2d 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Although <em>Flayhart </em>and <em>Henson </em>involved prosecutions for reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, the failure to obtain medical care can also support a first degree manslaughter charge, so long as there is sufficient proof of the requisite <em>mens rea </em>\u2014 intent to cause serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The revised Penal Law, in accord with the modern trend <em>(see, </em>1 LaFave and Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 3.5 [b], at 305 [1986]), distinguishes between \"intent\u201d and \"knowledge\u201d <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [1], [2]; <em>People v Kaplan, </em>76 NY2d 140). A person acts intentionally when there is a \"conscious objective\u201d to cause the result proscribed by statute (Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [1]; <em>People v Gallagher, </em>69 NY2d 525, 529). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>By contrast, a person acts knowingly when there is an awareness that a particular element of a crime is satisfied <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [2]; <em>People v Kaplan, </em>76 NY2d, at 144, n 3, <em>supra). </em>Thus, if intent is the governing <em>mens rea </em>(as it is here), the focus is on the defendant\u2019s conscious aim or purpose \u2014 the objective \u2014 in doing particular acts. Defendant\u2019s knowledge or awareness that the result will occur \u2014 while a factor the jury may take into consideration to infer intent \u2014 is itself not a prerequisite of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, even a person without specialized medical knowledge can have the intent to cause serious physical injury by withholding medical care. If the objective is to cause serious physical injury, the mental culpability element of first degree manslaughter is satisfied\u2014 whether or not defendant had knowledge that the omission would in fact cause serious injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Defendant argues that \"everyone\u201d knows that failure to supply food to a child will lead to death, and thus intentional homicide is a proper charge under those circumstances <em>(see, e.g., Zessman v State, </em>94 Nev 28, 573 P2d 1174; <em>Harrington v State, </em>547 SW2d 616 [Tex Grim App]), but that the need for medical care is often a matter of opinion, and a layperson could not be expected to know the gravity of the situation. The distinction defendant would have us draw, as a matter of law, between defendants who have a medical background and those who do not, is unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Putting aside defendant\u2019s attempt to import a knowledge requirement into a statute that has none, and putting aside that the <em>mens rea </em>for first degree manslaughter is intent to cause serious physical injury, not death \u2014 it is plain that defendant\u2019s argument centers on factual, not legal, distinctions. Certainly there are situations where the need for prompt medical attention would be obvious to anyone \u2014 a child bleeding profusely, for example, or a six-year-old girl laying unconscious after a blunt head trauma. Thus, defendant\u2019s argument that the failure to obtain medical care for a child may not, as a matter of law, support a homicide charge that requires intent must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Having found no defect in the prosecution\u2019s legal theory, we next consider whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the conviction. In undertaking this review, the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>dence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the People <em>(Pe ople v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621) to determine whether there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495). There is no need to replicate the Appellate Division\u2019s extensive analysis of the record supporting its conclusion that the evidence was legally sufficient (170 AD2d 50, 65-70). It is adequate for our purposes to highlight the aspects of the case that demonstrate legal sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">There was no dispute at trial that Lisa\u2019s death was a homicide. Even the defense expert agreed that the child\u2019s death was caused by brain trauma as a result of abuse. The medical testimony, including Lisa\u2019s treating physicians and the postmortem examination, confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that Lisa\u2019s death was a consequence of an assault and a failure to obtain prompt medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The evidence was also legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the assault was administered by defendant \u2014 and not Nussbaum, as the defense had argued. Nussbaum herself testified that she did not strike Lisa that night; that moments after Lisa went into the bedroom, defendant carried her unconscious body out; and that defendant admitted to knocking Lisa down. There was also evidence that defendant had physically abused Lisa several days before her death, and that defendant\u2019s knuckles had fresh bruises on November 2. Moreover, there was evidence of Nussbaum\u2019s debilitated physical condition on November 1 from which a jury could infer that she did not deliver the fatal injury. Thus, based on the evidence, a rational jury could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was defendant who caused the head trauma that led to Lisa\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The evidence was also sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that defendant struck Lisa and thereafter failed to summon medical assistance, each with the intent to cause serious physical injury. Intent may be inferred from conduct as well as the surrounding circumstances <em>(see, People v Smith, </em>79 NY2d 309, 315; <em>People v Bracey, </em>41 NY2d 296, 301). The expert testimony described the tremendous force necessary to inflict the head trauma that caused Lisa\u2019s death. Moreover, after Lisa was rendered unconscious, defendant left for dinner, and when he returned three hours later, freebased cocaine while the child lay on the bathroom floor. Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ally, when defendant admitted to Nussbaum during the night that he knocked Lisa down, he explained that \"the staring business had gotten to be too much for her.\u201d This is relevant because there was evidence that defendant was convinced that the children were staring at him to induce hypnotic trances. Thus, the jury could have inferred from the evidence that defendant\u2019s objective in assaulting Lisa and failing to summon medical assistance was to cause serious physical injury, perhaps in response to Lisa\u2019s purported staring. That defendant acceded to Nussbaum\u2019s request to telephone 911 when Lisa stopped breathing might demonstrate that defendant did not intend to cause the child\u2019s death, but does not militate against the jury finding that he intended to cause serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In sum, the evidence was sufficient to establish the elements of first degree manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Similarly, there is no merit in defendant\u2019s claim that Nussbaum\u2019s testimony was insufficiently corroborated. Although many States, and the Federal courts, permit a conviction to rest solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice <em>(see, People v Moses, </em>63 NY2d 299, 310-311 [Jasen, J., dissenting]), our Legislature requires that accomplice testimony be corroborated by evidence \"tending to connect the defendant with the commission\u201d of the crime (CPL 60.22 [1]). The corroboration must be independent of, and may not draw its weight and probative value from, the accomplice\u2019s testimony <em>(People v Moses, </em>63 NY2d, at 306, <em>supra; People v Hudson, </em>51 NY2d 233, 238). The corroborative evidence need only \"tendQ to connect\u201d the defendant to the crime; it need not establish all the elements of the offense (CPL 60.22 [1]; <em>People v Hudson, </em>51 NY2d, at 238, <em>supra; People v Cunningham, </em>48 NY2d 938, 940). Seemingly insignificant matters may harmonize with the accomplice\u2019s narrative so as to provide the necessary corroboration <em>(People v Bretti, </em>68 NY2d 929, 930; <em>People v Moses, </em>63 NY2d, at 306, <em>supra; People v Cunningham, </em>48 NY2d, at 940, <em>supra). </em>So long as the statutory minimum is met, it is for the jury to decide whether the corroboration satisfies them that the accomplice is telling the truth <em>(see, People v Glasper, </em>52 NY2d 970, 971; <em>People v Fiore, </em>12 NY2d 188, 201-202).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The Trial Judge enumerated specific items of independent, corroborative evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration: (i) defendant\u2019s presence at the apartment at 6:30 a.m. on November 2, as confirmed by police and paramedics; (ii) defendant\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>statements that placed him in the apartment during the hours prior to the 911 call, and indicated that he and Nussbaum were the only adults in the apartment; (iii) the medical testimony indicated that the injuries to Lisa were inflicted by a man of defendant\u2019s stature, and that Nussbaum was so debilitated that she was physically incapable of inflicting the injuries; (iv) hairs, forcibly removed from Lisa\u2019s head, were found on defendant\u2019s clothing; and (v) defendant had fresh bruises on his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">This evidence, if credited by the jury \u2014 as was their prerogative \u2014 was sufficient to meet the \"tending to connect\u201d standard of CPL 60.22 (1). Thus, we reject defendant\u2019s assertions that there was insufficient corroboration as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The final issue that warrants discussion concerns defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in its response to a jury note. As one of its numerous requests during deliberations, the jury asked for the following \"clarification\u201d: \"If there was no apparent intention to cause injury, but the acts resulted in serious physical injury nonetheless, would that be grounds to conclude intent as spelled out by law?\u201d Defense counsel suggested that the court simply respond in the negative, but the trial court, to alleviate possible juror confusion, instead chose to give a more expansive supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The trial court is generally in the best position to evaluate the jury\u2019s request, and therefore is vested with discretion in framing an appropriate response <em>(People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d 296, 302, <em>cert denied </em>459 US 847). In all instances, the court must \"respond meaningfully\u201d to an inquiry <em>(People v Almodovar, </em>62 NY2d 126, 131). A meaningful response may, depending on the circumstances, include simply rereading the initial charge <em>(see, People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d, at 302, <em>supra). </em>The adequacy of the trial court\u2019s response is gauged by the form of the jury question, the particular issue of which inquiry is made, the supplemental instruction actually given, and the prejudice (if any) to the defendant <em>(People v Almodovar, </em>62 NY2d, at 131-132, <em>supra, </em>quoting <em>People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d, at 302, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Intent can be a difficult issue to grasp, and thus the trial court cannot be faulted for giving a broader response than defendant would have liked. In substance, the trial court explained that the People had the burden of proving, beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>reasonable doubt, that defendant had a conscious objective to cause serious physical injury; that intent is a mental operation that ordinarily must be inferred by an examination of all the facts and circumstances; and that the jury could infer that a person intended the natural and probable consequences of an act.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Nothing in the court\u2019s supplemental charge was a misstatement of the law, nor did it suggest a positive response to the jury\u2019s question. Indeed, as the Appellate Division noted, while a simple negative response would have informed the jury that it could not automatically infer intent to cause the injuries merely because the injuries occurred, such a response might have obscured the jury\u2019s right to make a factual finding of intent based on the natural and probable consequences of defendant\u2019s acts and the surrounding circumstances. For these reasons, the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, to the extent they are preserved for our review, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\"> \"Serious physical injury\u201d is \"physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes death or serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [10].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
