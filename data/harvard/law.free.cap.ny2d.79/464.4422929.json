We conclude that, in the circumstances presented, the pretrial ruling was erroneous, and the Appellate Division correctly ordered a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">On September 10, 1988, the victim \u2014 a married college professor \u2014 was driving from her home near Ithaca to a family wedding in Lake George, when at about 7:30 p.m. she was stopped on the Northway by defendant, then a uniformed State Trooper. At defendant\u2019s request, she gave him her license and registration. Defendant told her she was driving erratically and had failed to signal a lane change properly. He instructed her to leave her car, walk a straight line, and then enter the passenger seat of the patrol car, where he told her she could be in serious trouble, including \"driving while intoxicated\u201d charges, and would have to blow in his face as a sobriety test. While she was doing this a second time at defendant\u2019s behest, he put his mouth on hers, began fondling her, and told her he was going to \"make it\u201d or \"do it\u201d with her, but first had to go to State Police barracks for a condom. The victim followed defendant to the barracks in her own car, though he retained her license and registration. She testified that she remained terrified throughout this entire period believing that, with defendant armed, any escape attempt in an unfamiliar area would be futile and possibly even fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">At the barracks, defendant placed the victim in the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>car, instructing her to remain there while he went inside. She testified that she was still frozen with fear, not knowing whether defendant had friends in the barracks who knew what he was doing. On his return, they drove off while the victim \u2014 believing it vital to her safety \u2014 engaged defendant in conversation. When they reached a secluded area, defendant, still armed, sexually attacked her. He thereafter returned with her to the barracks and allowed her to proceed to her destination, where she explained to the wedding guests that she was late because of car trouble. On her return home\u2014 after being unable to eat or sleep for two days, and overcoming her fear that defendant would harm her \u2014 the victim contacted a local rape crisis center, which ultimately led to a report to the State Police, an investigation, and defendant\u2019s arrest. Defendant was convicted of rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, coercion, unlawful imprisonment and official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Essentially two errors were alleged on defendant\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division \u2014 the first relating to a pretrial ruling that would have permitted the People to cross-examine defendant regarding two other pending charges, the second relating to expert testimony regarding rape trauma syndrome. A divided Appellate Division overturned defendant\u2019s conviction on the first issue, and a Justice of that court granted leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The Pretrial Ruling Regarding Other Pending Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">While awaiting trial, defendant was indicted for official misconduct and criminal impersonation (Penal Law \u00a7 195.00 [1]; \u00a7 190.25 [3]). Those later charges arose out of defendant\u2019s efforts, after he had been suspended from the force, to obtain the victim\u2019s records from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) by representing that he was a State Trooper investigating a crime in which she was a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Before trial on the rape charges commenced, the People advised defendant that, if he testified, they would cross-examine him about specified prior criminal and immoral acts affecting his credibility. On defendant\u2019s pretrial motion addressed to the permissible scope of cross-examination regarding those acts, the trial court precluded the People\u2019s cross-examination regarding complaints by other women that defendant, as a State Trooper, had for no reason pulled them over and engaged in inappropriate behavior. Additionally, the court limited the People\u2019s inquiry into two areas involving claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>assault by defendant\u2019s wife and mistress. As to the DMV incident, however, the trial court concluded that if defendant testified, he would be deemed to have waived his privilege against self-incrimination and exposed to cross-examination. Defense counsel announced before opening statements that, based on that ruling, defendant would not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The Appellate Division determined that the trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneous, reversed the conviction, and ordered a new trial. Relying on <em>People v Betts </em>(70 NY2d 289), the court observed that permitting cross-examination of a defendant regarding other pending unrelated charges, for credibility purposes only, unduly compromised defendant\u2019s right to testify in the case on trial and jeopardized the corresponding right not to incriminate himself as to the other charges. The Appellate Division further concluded that the People\u2019s attempt to invest the evidence with independent relevance aside from credibility did not bear up under scrutiny. We agree with both conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Defendants who take the stand, like other witnesses, place their credibility in issue, and thus may be cross-examined on past criminal or immoral acts affecting credibility <em>(People v Sorge, </em>301 NY 198, 200; <em>People v Johnston, </em>228 NY 332, 340). Recognizing the importance of a defendant\u2019s informed choice whether or not to testify, in <em>People v Sandoval </em>(34 NY2d 371) we held that a defendant is entitled to a pretrial ruling on the scope of permissible cross-examination as to such prior misconduct (34 NY2d, at 375). A <em>Sandoval </em>ruling, which balances the probative value of the evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice, is \" 'largely, if not completely\u2019 a discretionary determination for the trial courts and fact-reviewing intermediate appellate courts, and * * * generally no further review by this Court is warranted.\u201d <em>(People v Mattiace, </em>77 NY2d 269, 274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">While per se rules in this area are eschewed, where defendant\u2019s misconduct is another pending criminal charge a more categorical approach is appropriate because of the constitutional protections against self-incrimination (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6; US Const 5th Amend). Cross-examination on an unrelated pending criminal charge, solely for the purpose of impeaching defendant\u2019s credibility, is impermissible <em>(People v Betts, </em>70 NY2d 289, <em>supra). </em>As we held in <em>Betts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\"Allowing a defendant-witness\u2019 credibility to be assailed through the use of cross-examination con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>cerning an unrelated pending criminal charge unduly compromises the defendant\u2019s right to testify with respect to the case on trial, while simultaneously jeopardizing the correspondingly important right not to incriminate oneself as to the pending matter.\u201d (70 NY2d, at 295.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">At the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing in this case, the People urged that cross-examination regarding defendant\u2019s alleged unlawful attempt to obtain complainant\u2019s driving records was appropriate because it went \"directly to the issue of [defendant\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>Betts </em>unambiguously held that \"a defendant-witness does not generally and automatically waive the privilege against self-incrimination as to pending collateral criminal charges\u201d (70 NY2d, at 294-295). On the authority of Betts\u2014 decided nearly two years before trial \u2014 the People should therefore have been denied permission to cross-examine defendant on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The Appellate Division majority also correctly rejected the People\u2019s alternative claim that the DMV incident was related to the rape charges, as evincing a consciousness of guilt. We need not reach the question whether consciousness of guilt could ever be a sufficient nexus to permit cross-examination under <em>Betts </em>because we conclude that the pending charges do not evidence defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Certain postcrime conduct is \"indicative of a consciousness of guilt, and hence of guilt itself.\u201d <em>(People v Reddy, </em>261 NY 479, 486.) <em>Reddy, </em>a case involving evidence of flight, noted that such evidence betrayed an awareness of guilt, citing Proverbs (ch XXVIII, v 1): \"The wicked flee, even when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.\u201d <em>(See also, People v Yazum, </em>13 NY2d 302; <em>People v Fiorentino, </em>197 NY 560, 567.) Other conduct that has been recognized as revealing a guilty mind includes false statements or alibis <em>(People v Moses, </em>63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>NY2d 299, 308; <em>People v Leyra, </em>1 NY2d 199, 208); coercion or harassment of witnesses <em>(People v Shilitano, </em>218 NY 161, 179; <em>see, People v Plummer, </em>36 NY2d 161); and abandonment or concealment of evidence <em>(People v Alexander, </em>37 NY2d 202, 204; <em>People v Butterly, </em>25 NY2d 159, 162-163).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Consciousness of guilt evidence has consistently been viewed as weak because the connection between the conduct and a guilty mind often is tenuous <em>(see, People v Yazum, </em>13 NY2d, at 304, <em>supra; People v Leyra, </em>1 NY2d, at 209, <em>supra). </em>Even innocent persons, fearing wrongful conviction, may flee or lie to extricate themselves from situations that look damning <em>(see, People v Moses, </em>63 NY2d, at 308, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The issue here, however, is not sufficiency but admissibility of evidence. Even equivocal consciousness-of-guilt evidence may be admissible so long as it is relevant, meaning that it has a tendency to establish the fact sought to be proved \u2014 that defendant was aware of guilt <em>(see, People v Yazum, </em>13 NY2d, at 304, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We agree with the Appellate Division that defendant\u2019s conduct at the DMV did not reach the threshold for admissibility as consciousness of guilt. The People contend that defendant\u2019s attempt to secure the victim\u2019s driving records was a \"natural step\u201d in an effort to harass or intimidate her. This argument overlooks the absence of <em>any </em>evidence \u2014 the crucial \"next step\u201d \u2014 that defendant actually intended to coerce the witness. Such a conclusion would not be a reasonable inference from the attempt to obtain driving records, but would be pure speculation. Indeed, it is a common part of the defense process to investigate the background of adverse witnesses for potential impeachment material. Such efforts alone would generally not constitute a consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The People claim, however, that the method defendant used to obtain the information \u2014 misrepresentations and false statements \u2014 is analogous to the false statements and alibis that have been admitted as consciousness of guilt. Defendant\u2019s misrepresentations to the DMV clerk that he was an active State Trooper investigating the victim are not the sort of false statements <em>about a crime </em>that would be admissible as consciousness of guilt. No valid inference could be drawn from the deceptions that defendant was manifesting an awareness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of guilt on the rape charges. Finally, we fail to see the asserted analogy between defendant\u2019s conduct and tampering with or fabrication of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Thus, we agree with the Appellate Division that in its pretrial ruling the trial court committed reversible error necessitating a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Rape Trauma Syndrome Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In that there must be a new trial, we briefly consider \u2014 as did the Appellate Division \u2014 defendant\u2019s challenge to the People\u2019s expert testimony regarding rape trauma syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The People\u2019s final witness on its case-in-chief was Dr. Ann Burgess, an expert on rape trauma syndrome. Defendant acknowledges that there \"can be little doubt as the qualifications of Dr. Burgess to testify as an expert in this regard.\u201d Dr. Burgess had never met or evaluated the victim; her direct testimony consisted largely of answers to three hypothetical questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The prosecutor first asked Dr. Burgess to assume certain facts about a hypothetical woman \u2014 setting forth, in chronological fashion, the victim\u2019s version of the facts from the stop of her vehicle to defendant\u2019s first advances in the police car \u2014 and then asked \"how that woman would react.\u201d Dr. Burgess answered that the \"woman would react by doing exactly as she was told * * * [b]ecause of the behavior, the authority figure, the gun, the order, and her view of this as something that she must do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">In his next question, the prosecutor followed the same format \u2014 repeating the victim\u2019s fact recitation between the trip to State Police barracks and the assault \u2014 and he elicited the expert\u2019s response that the hypothetical woman \"would comply\u201d and would not try to get away in her own car because of fear and stress concerning what else the officer might do. Finally, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions as to how the hypothetical woman would report the incident, Dr. Burgess responded that, out of \"fear of who this person was,\u201d she probably would not report it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The Appellate Division found no error in this examination, concluding that, just as in <em>People v Taylor </em>(75 NY2d 277), the purpose of the testimony was a permissible one: to explain behavior on the part of the victim that might seem unusual to a lay jury unfamiliar with the patterns of response exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>by rape victims. We note that this case is somewhat different from <em>Taylor, </em>and certain arguments defendant advances about that difference may have relevance to the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Beginning in the 1970\u2019s, scientific studies have described identifiable patterns of response among victims <em>(see, People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d, at 285-286, <em>supra). </em>Dr. Burgess\u2019 influential article, <em>Rape Trauma Syndrome </em>(131 Am J Psychiatry 981 [1974]), described an acute and a long-term phase of recovery, the acute phase beginning immediately after the incident. As recounted in that article and others, a victim\u2019s behavior following the assault may seem unusual \u2014 such as remaining calm and composed, failing to report the incident immediately, or falsely claiming not to know the attacker \u2014 but nevertheless may not be an unusual response to the attack. We noted in <em>Taylor </em>that rape trauma syndrome was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and thus expert testimony to dispel juror misconceptions regarding the ordinary responses of rape victims would be admissible <em>(People v Taylor, </em>at 292-293, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In this case, a large part of the expert evidence concerned the victim\u2019s behavior as the sexual attack unfolded, rather than after it. Dr. Burgess opined that the hypothetical woman, and women generally, when threatened by an armed authority figure would submit, without resistance, to the sexual attack described, as a means of self-preservation. Thus, defendant correctly notes that the first two hypotheticals were not concerned with the rape trauma syndrome evidence described in <em>Taylor, </em>which related to post-rape behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">That this portion of Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony is not precisely the type of testimony discussed in <em>Taylor </em>does not mean that such evidence would necessarily be inadmissible. It is sufficiently distinct from the kind of evidence we considered in <em>Taylor, </em>however, that our holding in that case does not govern its admissibility here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Assuming such expert evidence is again offered, and the objection lodged that is now before us, the court should determine at retrial whether the expert\u2019s opinion has the requisite scientific foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Even where that foundation is established, expert evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>is not in all instances admissible. While proper to help \"clarify an issue calling for professional or technical knowledge, possessed by the expert and beyond the ken of the typical juror\u201d <em>(De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296, 307), expert opinion is inadmissible when introduced merely to prove that a sexual assault took place <em>(People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d, at 293, <em>supra), </em>or bolster a witness\u2019 credibility <em>(People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431). In such instances, the potential value of the evidence is outweighed by the possibility of undue prejudice to the defendant or interference with the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Taylor </em>itself illustrates these principles. In <em>Taylor, </em>we upheld the admission of expert testimony of rape trauma syndrome to explain the reaction of a rape victim in the hours following the attack \u2014 behavior that was otherwise not within the common understanding of the average juror. In the companion case, <em>however </em>\u2014 People <em>v Banks </em>\u2014 we concluded that expert opinion that a person exhibiting certain symptoms \"suffered from rape trauma syndrome\u201d would be inadmissible because it bore solely on proving that a rape had occurred, and defendant would be unacceptably prejudiced by rape trauma syndrome evidence for that purpose alone <em>(People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d, at 293, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Thus, should similar expert testimony be proffered at a retrial of this case, and objection voiced, the trial court would be called upon to make two determinations not previously made: <em>first, </em>whether the evidence has the requisite scientific basis, and <em>second, </em>whether its potential value outweighs the possibility of undue prejudice to defendant or interference with the jury\u2019s province to determine credibility. In that these determinations are fact-intensive, and the outcome may vary with the scope and form of actual questioning, at this juncture we merely identify the issues, which \u2014 contrary to the observation of the Appellate Division \u2014 were not addressed in <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling permitting cross-examination on other pending charges requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Judge Simons taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">. The People\u2019s two grounds for distinguishing <em>Betts </em>are in fact a single argument. The People first posit that the outstanding charge need only be \"substantively relevant\u201d to the case on trial to fall outside <em>Betts, </em>and that consciousness of guilt establishes just such a substantive connection. The People then argue that even if a stronger connection need be shown \u2014 that the crimes be \"directly related\u201d \u2014 that test is also satisfied because the charges could have been joined under CPL 200.20 (2) (b) (offenses could be joined if proof of one crime would be admissible as evidence-in-chief on another). The People claim, however, that proof of the DMV incident would be admissible in the rape trial for the same reason advanced in its first argument: it evinces consciousness of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">. Of course, relevancy is not the sole measure of admissibility. The court must also determine that the probative value of the evidence outweighs the risk of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. The parties have not addressed and we therefore do not consider whether expert testimony concerning rape trauma syndrome is admissible to explain behavior that follows a sexual assault other than rape, and therefore whether it was admissible in this case because a sexual assault was completed before the rape occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
