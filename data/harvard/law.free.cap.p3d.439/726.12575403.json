Corporal Spears turned around to catch up to the vehicle and observed Mr. Brown swerving within his lane of travel, crossing the center line, and clocked him going 53 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone. As Corporal Spears neared Mr. Brown's vehicle, Mr. Brown quickly entered a turn lane, hit his brakes, and entered a dead-end street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] Corporal Spears initiated a traffic stop and approached Mr. Brown. When asked about his travel plans, he stated he was headed to his home, which was not located on the dead-end street, after traveling to Gillette from Torrington. He informed Corporal Spears that he had received a speeding ticket earlier that day on the interstate near Wheatland and that he was tired from his long drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] Corporal Spears initially suspected that Mr. Brown might be intoxicated because of his driving and bloodshot eyes. However, he did not appear to be intoxicated during questioning, which led Corporal Spears to believe his driving, including his abrupt turn, \"could be from trying to conceal something.\" Corporal Spears obtained Mr. Brown's identification and returned to his patrol vehicle where he learned from his dispatcher that Mr. Brown was on unsupervised probation for possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] Corporal Spears decided not to issue a traffic citation. He went back to Mr. Brown's vehicle and returned his identification. When asked, Mr. Brown confirmed he was on probation and volunteered, \"You may sobriety test me, you may look, do whatever you like, the other cop did as well.\" During this conversation, Corporal Spears thought he smelled a faint odor of marijuana, but due to the wind, it was difficult to be sure. He decided to accept Mr. Brown's unsolicited offer to search and requested Mr. Brown exit the vehicle so he could run his drug dog through it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] Mr. Brown hesitated at that point, and he told Corporal Spears that he wanted to make a call to his friend or his mother because it wasn't his vehicle. Corporal Spears explained that he could consent even if he did not own the car, but Mr. Brown remained hesitant. He asked if he could go, but Corporal\n   Spears insisted that he exit the vehicle and stated, \"First of all, [you're] totally cooperative, I said ok, you're balking now, so minimum intrusion, I'm gonna run the dog around your car.\" Mr. Brown complied, and Corporal Spears retrieved his drug dog, who alerted to the exterior of the vehicle in less than a minute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] Corporal Spears searched the interior of the vehicle and found a jar containing marijuana and another package with three sealed baggies of marijuana. The State charged Mr. Brown with felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] Mr. Brown filed a motion to suppress, arguing that Corporal Spears lacked reasonable articulable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop and to conduct a canine sniff. The district court denied Mr. Brown's motion after an evidentiary hearing. It found that several factors supported a finding of reasonable suspicion to extend the stop, and that the length of the detention, ten minutes and thirty-seven seconds, was not unreasonable. After the district court denied his motion, Mr. Brown entered a conditional plea of guilty, preserving his right to appeal the adverse decision on his suppression motion. The district court sentenced Mr. Brown to three to five years of imprisonment, with credit for 54 days served, and suspended the sentence subject to four years of supervised probation. Mr. Brown timely appealed after entry of the Sentence and Probation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610] In reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we adopt the district court's factual findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

In response, the State contends that Mr. Brown waived any claim that he was unlawfully detained on return of his identification, but regardless, that Corporal Spears had reasonable, articulable suspicion to detain him to conduct a canine sniff after completing the traffic stop. We first address the State's contention that Mr. Brown failed to preserve any claim that he was unlawfully detained on return of his identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

After the suppression hearing concluded, the district court determined that \"there was reasonable cause to detain the young man so as to permit the dog to do a free air sniff, not in the vehicle, but around the vehicle.\" Nothing in the plea agreement, the suppression motion, or the district court's denial of the suppression motion limited Mr. Brown's Fourth Amendment challenge to precisely nine minutes and fourteen seconds into the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b615] We acknowledge that Mr. Brown's argument became more focused at the suppression hearing when his counsel argued during closing remarks that Corporal Spears lacked reasonable suspicion to further detain him after he revoked his consent and asked to leave nine minutes and fourteen seconds into the stop, whereas Mr. Brown now contends that the traffic stop concluded two minutes earlier. However, the district court did not specifically determine when Corporal Spears completed the traffic stop, and Mr. Brown's general allegation that Corporal Spears unlawfully expanded the scope of the stop without reasonable articulable suspicion has not changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b616] These circumstances are different from those in cases where we determined waiver applied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

He explained that he initially thought Mr. Brown might be intoxicated, but other than his bloodshot eyes, Mr. Brown did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. This led Corporal Spears to believe that his driving, including an abrupt turn on a dead-end street after Corporal Spears caught up with him, \"could be from trying to conceal something at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b626] Corporal Spears testified that he thought Mr. Brown's travel route from Torrington to Gillette and receipt of a ticket on the interstate by Wheatland was \"a little odd\" because \"there's an exit to and from Torrington that's north of Wheatland.\" Corporal Spears learned from dispatch that Mr. Brown was on unsupervised probation for possession of marijuana, and he testified that when questioning Mr. Brown about his probation status, he thought he smelled marijuana:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. While I was talking to him, after I went back up and talked to him and asked him about the probation, I thought I could smell a little bit of weed at one time, but the wind was blowing so hard, I kept trying to smell again and again, and I could never smell it a second time, so I didn't smell it again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q.

Mr. Brown remained hesitant after Corporal Spears explained he could consent to a search even if he did not own the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b628] Corporal Spears described this conduct as a \"demeanor change.\" He testified that after Mr. Brown revoked his consent, he could not search the inside of the vehicle, but still believed he could run his K-9 around the outside of it. The district court also received Corporal Spears' body cam video into evidence. The parties presented no other witnesses or evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b629] The district court found Corporal Spears' testimony credible, stating that he was very honest, \"even-handed,\" and had many years of experience in his line of work. Relying on Corporal Spears' testimony and the body cam video, the district court concluded that the totality of the circumstances created a reasonable suspicion of criminal behavior sufficient to expand the scope of the stop to conduct a drug dog sniff. In reaching its conclusion, the district court found several circumstances established reasonable suspicion, which we summarize as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) Mr. Brown's driving, including his abrupt turn onto a dead-end street, which was an unusual way to go to Mr. Brown's home;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (2) Mr. Brown's unusual travel route from Torrington to Gillette using the interstate instead of Highway 85;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (3) Mr. Brown's bloodshot eyes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (4) Mr. Brown appearing alert in the body cam video despite reporting that he was tired;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (5) Mr. Brown's unsupervised probation for possession of marijuana;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (6) Mr. Brown's demeanor change when he revoked his consent to search; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (7) Mr. Brown \"furtively\" trying to make phone calls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court made no findings about Corporal Spears possibly smelling marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b630] Mr. Brown argues that the district court erroneously considered circumstances related to Corporal Spears' initial concern that he might be driving impaired, because Corporal Spears dispelled that concern prior to returning Mr. Brown's identification. He also argues that the district court's finding that his demeanor changed when he revoked consent is clearly erroneous. According to Mr. Brown, the only facts available for consideration under a reasonable suspicion analysis were his probation status and his desire to speak with his friend or mother before deciding whether to allow the drug dog in the vehicle, facts which he contends do not establish reasonable suspicion. We acknowledged above that the district court could consider facts obtained and observations made during the initial traffic stop, and consequently we review each of the district court's findings for error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Bloodshot eyes, driving, and alertness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b631] Corporal Spears initially thought Mr. Brown's driving (swerving and abrupt turn) and bloodshot eyes could mean Mr. Brown was driving impaired. Corporal Spears testified that upon questioning Mr. Brown, other than his bloodshot eyes he did not notice anything else that might indicate that he was under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. Corporal Spears admitted that Mr. Brown's bloodshot eyes could be the result of the long drive from Torrington. The district court therefore improperly factored Mr. Brown's bloodshot eyes into its reasonable suspicion analysis.\n   <em>\n    Damato\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371594\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/64/700/\">\n    64 P.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"some facts must be outrightly dismissed as so innocent or susceptible to varying interpretations as to be innocuous\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b632] Mr. Brown's possible impairment was not Corporal Spears' sole concern. He testified that he was also concerned Mr. Brown was trying to conceal \"something\" (i.e., illegal activity) based on Mr. Brown's driving, including his abrupt turn onto a dead-end street after Corporal Spears caught up to him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. ...

So it was an abrupt turn?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Yes. That's why I just -- I remember it as being a quick movement to the turning lane.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mr. Brown's abrupt turn after Corporal Spears turned around and caught up to him could be viewed as an evasive maneuver raising suspicion of illegal activity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996007\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/784/\">\n    220 P.3d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acting evasive is a proper factor to consider in conducting a reasonable suspicion analysis). Corporal Spears also thought turning onto the dead-end street was inconsistent with Mr. Brown's statement that he was headed to his home:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Well, he told me he was just about home. So I asked him where his home was, where his residence was, and he said on Alex Way. I forget the numerics, but he stated on Alex Way, which is -- we were stopped just off of 59 on Arapaho. Alex Way is in Doud subdivision west of Highway 50 off of Force Road, and Arapahoe was a dead[-]end street, it's not a through street; so I thought that was kind of odd that he stopped there or turned on Arapaho.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"We have recognized that unusual or inconsistent travel plans are a proper consideration in a reasonable suspicion analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Feeney\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331170\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/50/\">\n    208 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 (citing\n   <em>\n    Flood v.
