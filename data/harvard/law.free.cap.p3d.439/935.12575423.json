(collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") with Junkermier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens, P.C. (\"Junkermier\"). Junkermier's liability insurer, New York Marine and General Insurance Company (\"New York Marine\"), intervened to challenge the reasonableness of the settlement. After allowing limited discovery and holding a reasonableness hearing, the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, determined that the stipulated settlement was reasonable and entered judgment against Junkermier. New York Marine appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On appeal, we address whether the District Court properly found the settlement agreement reasonable when the insurer provided a defense under a reservation of rights throughout the relevant proceedings, but did not confirm coverage under the policy or file a declaratory action to determine coverage, declined to settle with Plaintiffs for policy limits, and misrepresented the policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold on the facts of this case that the District Court improperly held that the stipulated agreement was reasonable. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 This is the fourth time this case has come before this Court on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We restate the facts applicable to the issues in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Roger and Carrie Peters, husband and wife, own Draggin' Y Cattle Company, formerly Alaska Basin Grazing Association. The Peterses have been ranching in Montana since the 1970s. The Peterses were longtime clients of Junkermier, working directly with Larry Addink for accounting services both for themselves and for their various businesses related to their ranching and cattle operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In 2004, Addink advised Plaintiffs that they could structure a sale of real property to their advantage as a tax-deferred exchange pursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 1031. Addink's plan involved selling real estate owned by Alaska Basin and using those proceeds to buy other real estate owned personally by the Peterses. Attorney Max Hansen drafted the closing documents for the transaction. Hansen expressed concern to Roger Peters that the transaction would not\n   qualify for tax deferment under \u00a7 1031 because the parties to the exchange were related-the property being purchased to replace the Alaska Basin property was owned by the principals of Alaska Basin. He wrote a letter to Addink expressing these concerns, but explained that he had not provided Plaintiffs with tax advice about the proposed exchange. He wrote that he was leaving tax advice about the transaction to Junkermier because it had structured the deal. The property sales involved in the transaction closed in January 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In November 2007, Addink learned that, pursuant to a 2002 revenue ruling, the type of transaction he had structured for Plaintiffs was prohibited from qualifying for treatment as a \u00a7 1031 exchange by the related-party rule. Addink informed Junkermier of his discovery and Junkermier notified New York Marine of the possible claim against it. Junkermier did not inform Plaintiffs that the transaction would fail to qualify under \u00a7 1031 until February 6, 2008. At the February 6 meeting, Junkermier told Plaintiffs that the transaction failed to qualify because of new tax rulings that had changed the law on related parties. Junkermier explained that, due to these recent rulings, the taxes on the transaction could not be deferred and an estimated $2.5 million would be due in state and federal taxes in three weeks. Between the time Addink realized his mistake and Junkermier disclosed the tax consequences to Plaintiffs, the Peterses had taken on additional debt and closed on a deal to purchase the Mountain View Ranch. Roger Peters testified that they would not have purchased Mountain View Ranch had they known about the tax liability. Plaintiffs' expert Robert Storey opined that the tax liability had a significant negative effect on Plaintiffs' ability to retain adequate financing and operating capital to support the ranching operations and real estate financing. He opined that inability to retain adequate financing forced Plaintiffs to dramatically scale back their operations, leading to lost profits close to $8 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Addink and Junkermier crafted a plan to mitigate the tax consequences by seeking an extension for Plaintiffs' 2007 tax filings, restructuring various entities in order to use losses to offset the gain, and negotiating with tax authorities to settle taxes, penalties, and interest due. Addink and Junkermier continued to provide accounting services to Plaintiffs until Plaintiffs terminated the firm in April 2009. Plaintiffs terminated Junkermier after Hansen-whom Plaintiffs had hired to negotiate a tax compromise with the IRS as part of the mitigation plan-told Plaintiffs that Junkermier had misinformed them\n   about the reason the transaction failed to qualify under \u00a7 1031.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 New York Marine began providing Addink and Junkermier a\n   defense as early as 2008 against potential claims Plaintiffs could bring. As part of these efforts, New York Marine hired Patrick HagEstad to defend Addink and Junkermier. Plaintiffs filed a complaint in January 2011 against Addink and Junkermier alleging professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs' first amended complaint, filed in February 2012, included additional allegations of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, misrepresentation, deceit, and constructive fraud, as well as a claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Shortly after the Peterses filed their first amended complaint, New York Marine issued a reservation of rights letter. New York Marine's letter disclaimed any coverage for fraud or punitive damages. Its final paragraph stated, \"nothing herein or heretofore should be construed as an admission of coverage or liability by [New York Marine], or as a waiver, estoppel or modification of any of the terms, conditions or limitations of the [New York Marine] Policy and [New York Marine] reserves all rights, remedies and defenses, legal and equitable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Throughout the litigation, HagEstad reported to Addink, Junkermier, and New York Marine that the case was defensible and that Plaintiffs most likely would recover less than $250,000 if they succeeded in getting a verdict at trial. On June 10, 2014, Plaintiffs offered to settle all claims against Junkermier and Addink for the policy limits of $2 million in exchange for a full and final release of all claims. HagEstad advised the parties to seek independent counsel, because Plaintiffs' policy limits demand raised issues outside the scope of his representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Addink and Junkermier each retained independent counsel following the policy limits demand. Addink's independent counsel contacted HagEstad and informed him that Addink wanted the case settled within policy limits because Addink believed there was \"significant risk\" the verdict would be in excess of policy limits. Junkermier also sent a letter to New York Marine demanding that it settle the case within policy limits. HagEstad forwarded the policy limits demand to New York Marine on June 23, 2014, along with his assessment of the case. HagEstad maintained in his letter to New York Marine that he did not think the case was worth more than $250,000. HagEstad explained his views that Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent, that the taxes were not recoverable as damages, and that other claimed damages were speculative. He conceded that if Plaintiffs succeeded on the outstanding legal issues, however, \"the damages could be significantly closer to those stated by Plaintiffs in their\n   demand letter.\" At the time of the policy limits demand, Roger and Carrie Peters, Hansen, and Plaintiffs' damages experts had not been deposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 New York Marine, relying on HagEstad's counsel, authorized a counteroffer of $100,000, which HagEstad offered to Plaintiffs on July 11, 2014. Plaintiffs did not respond to this counteroffer before the mediation scheduled for November 12, 2014. Shortly after New York Marine's rejection of the policy limits demand, Addink's personal counsel wrote to New York Marine requesting that it confirm that, because it had rejected the policy limits offer, it would be responsible for any excess verdict. New York Marine did not respond to the letter. Addink's counsel wrote to New York Marine again on August 20, 2014, to inform New York Marine that he would be prepared to enter into separate settlement negotiations with Plaintiffs at the court-ordered mediation to protect Addink's personal assets. New York Marine responded that it would not agree to pay any excess verdict and that if Addink entered into separate settlement with Plaintiffs without its consent Addink would be breaching the terms of the insurance contract. In early September, Junkermier's personal counsel wrote to New York Marine to encourage it to retain separate coverage counsel so that it could be properly advised as to its responsibility for any excess verdict under Montana law, having refused a policy limits demand which the insured wanted to accept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Meanwhile, in July 2014, Plaintiffs filed their expert witness disclosure with a report from Robert Storey attached that outlined $12 million in damages, excluding emotional distress and punitive damages. After deposing Plaintiffs' damages experts, HagEstad filed motions for summary judgment on behalf of Junkermier raising issues regarding the statute of limitations, lost profits, emotional distress damages, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud claims, and tax liability damages. The District Court found that \"resolution of these pending motions would have turned the value of the litigation in one direction or the other, and subjected the case to further appeal.\" A hearing was scheduled on these motions for November 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 In October 2014, Plaintiffs reached out to Addink and Junkermier suggesting that the parties enter into a stipulated judgment and covenant not to execute, highlighting the $12 million in damages calculated by its experts, as well as the uncalculated emotional distress and punitive damage claims. In early November, shortly before the scheduled November 12 mediation, Plaintiffs again reached out to Addink and Junkermier to suggest that they enter into a stipulated settlement if the case was unable to settle. Plaintiffs wrote that\n   stipulated settlements with covenants not to execute and assignments of rights are \"a legitimate way for insureds to protect themselves from an excess judgment in circumstances where liability is reasonably clear and damages exceed policy limits.\" They further opined that an insurer's reservation of rights is \"another reason that permits the defendants to enter into a stipulated judgment, assignment, and covenant not to execute.\" Junkermier forwarded the two letters from Plaintiffs to New York Marine and asked New York Marine to \"accept responsibility for any failed negotiations\" by \"indemnify[ing] and hold[ing] harmless [Junkermier] from any excess verdict.\" None of the correspondence in the record from personal counsel to New York Marine challenged the reservation of rights letter or asked for confirmation of $2 million in coverage under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 HagEstad wrote to New York Marine a week before the settlement conference that a reasonable settlement value for the case was between $100,000 and $350,000. After this letter from HagEstad, New York Marine responded to Junkermier on November 11, 2014, that its outstanding offer of $100,000 was reasonable and that it \"cannot agree to accept liability in excess of policy limits, which are eroded by defense expenses. New York Marine fully understands its duties and obligations to its insured under Montana law and has acted, and will continue to act, in accord with those obligations and in the best interests of its insured.\" The case failed to settle at the November 12 mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 Immediately following the failed mediation, Addink, Junkermier, and Plaintiffs entered into negotiations that produced a stipulated settlement for $10 million. The settlement acknowledged that New York Marine \"has hired defense counsel to defend the defendants against the plaintiffs' claims.\" But, it continued, New York Marine's \"refusal to settle by paying policy limits or, in the alternative, waive policy limits, is unreasonable and constitutes bad faith and a violation of Montana's Unfair Trade Practices Act because the defendants are needlessly being exposed to the substantial likelihood of a financially ruinous excess judgment.\" The agreement \"ends the lawsuit through the entry of a stipulated judgment, that protects the defendants through a covenant not to execute [against Addink's or Junkermier's assets], and that permits the plaintiffs to enforce the stipulated judgment against [New York Marine] through an assignment.\" Addink, Junkermier, and Plaintiffs signed the agreement on November 13, 2014, the day before the scheduled hearing on the outstanding motions\n   for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The settlement was contingent on the parties requesting \"a hearing to approve the stipulated judgment as fair and reasonable.\" If the court did not approve the stipulated judgment, the case would proceed to trial. At the time that the parties entered into the settlement agreement, trial was three weeks away.\n   \u00b617 New York Marine moved to intervene in the case on December 8, 2014, to challenge the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement; the District Court granted intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court allowed limited discovery on the issue of reasonableness and held a reasonableness hearing on November 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, the District Court acknowledged, \"This is not a breach of the duty to defend case.\" It explained, however, that clear statutory directives under \u00a7 33-18-201(5) and (6), MCA, require insurers to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time and to settle a case in good faith. The District Court surmised that when an insurer fails to fulfill these requirements, \"its abandonment of its insured is just as certain as if it has breached the duty to defend.\" Because it determined that New York Marine effectively had abandoned its insured, the District Court relied on\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's Management Services Inc. v.

It challenges the District Court's conclusions that it failed to affirm coverage and failed to settle in good faith and its holding that such failures are equivalent to abandoning its insureds. New York Marine maintains that a stipulated judgment entered into without the consent or participation of the insurer is proper only when an insurer has refused to provide a defense to its insured. New York Marine maintains that the District Court erred by presuming that the stipulated settlement was reasonable under\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Junkermier and Plaintiffs (collectively, \"Appellees\") concede that New York Marine did not violate its duty to defend. They contend, though, that New York Marine violated other duties under the insurance contract, the \"constellation\" of which resulted in the abandonment of Junkermier by its insurer, \"just as certain as if it ha[d] breached the duty to defend.\" Specifically, Appellees argue that New York Marine failed to affirm coverage under the policy or to file a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage; refused to settle within policy limits when liability was reasonably clear and damages were in excess of policy limits; and misrepresented to its insureds that policy limits were eroded by defense costs. Because New York Marine effectively abandoned Junkermier, Appellees argue that Junkermier was entitled to enter into a stipulated judgment without New York Marine's consent and that the District Court properly presumed that the stipulated judgment was reasonable under\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 This Court has explained that \"a pretrial stipulated judgment may be enforceable\n   against the defendant's liability insurer if the insurer breaches its contractual obligation to defend that insured. Under the majority view, when an insurer improperly abandons its insured, the insured is justified in taking steps to limit his or her personal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

In that instance \"a stipulated settlement is presumed reasonable and the burden is on the insurer to rebut that presumption.\"\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Appellees allege that four separate actions of New York Marine together resulted in the abandonment of its insured and justified their negotiation of a stipulated settlement and assignment of rights in exchange for a covenant not to execute that is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. First, Appellees challenge New York Marine's reservation of rights letter. They contend that New York Marine refused to affirm, and thus effectively denied, any coverage under the policy because the final paragraph of the letter stated that \"nothing herein or heretofore should be construed as an admission of coverage or liability.\" Second, they maintain that this failure was compounded when New York Marine failed to file a declaratory judgment action to resolve the underlying coverage issues the reservation of rights letter raised. Third, New York Marine refused an offer to settle the case for policy limits and then refused to acknowledge that in doing so it assumed the risk of an excess verdict at trial. Finally, New York Marine misrepresented its policy limits when it wrote to Junkermier that the policy limits were \"eroded by defense costs.\" Appellees maintain that simply providing a defense to its insured is not enough and that the insureds properly entered into a stipulated settlement, coupled with a covenant not to execute, to protect their personal assets from the risk of an excess verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 Appellees' arguments raise the question whether an insurer \"improperly abandons its insured,\" justifying the insured \"in taking steps to limit his or her personal liability\" by entering into a confessed judgment, assignment of rights, and covenant not to execute that gives rise to a presumption of reasonableness, when the insured alleges the insurer breached contractual or statutory duties other than the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34 (internal quotations omitted). Our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , though answering a slightly different question, is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , the parties to a stipulated judgment sought enforcement of\n   their settlement against the insurer. We were asked to determine whether the stipulated settlement entered into without the consent of an insurer could be the proper measure of damages in later litigation to recover for a breach of the duty to indemnify. In answering that question, we carefully distinguished between an insurer's duty to defend and its duty to indemnify.\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26. We explained that \"[t]he duty to indemnify is independent of and narrower than the duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26. The duty to defend is triggered \"when a complaint against an insured alleges facts, which if proven, would result in coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Staples\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. \"The broader duty to defend requires an insurer to act immediately to defend the insured from a claim. ... On the other hand, the narrower duty to indemnify typically involves complicated interpretational questions that often require legal opinions and separate declaratory actions to determine.\"\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 We held in\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   that the stipulated judgment was not the appropriate measure of damages when an insurer has provided a defense to the insured, because the stipulated agreement could not fairly be attributed to the insurer's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We explained that a stipulated judgment is presumptively enforceable as the measure of damages when the insurer has failed to defend, \"because the non-defending insurer has left its insured on its own to challenge liability, and the insurer should not be able to 'reach back' and interject itself into a controversy it has sidestepped to 'void a deal the insured has entered to eliminate personal liability.' \"\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

But the insured cannot determine unilaterally that such violations occurred in order to justify a stipulated settlement that would be presumptively enforceable against the insurer in the underlying liability case or in subsequent litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b631 The facts of this case provide an illustrative example of why insureds cannot use the underlying liability case to bind an insurer to a stipulated settlement amount when they allege that the insurer failed to affirm coverage in a reasonable time. Appellees maintain that New York Marine violated the duty to affirm coverage because it explicitly failed to affirm\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   coverage under the policy in its reservation of rights letter and that New York Marine should have filed a declaratory judgment action to resolve the question of coverage that its letter created. On the other hand, New York Marine maintains that it reserved its rights to challenge coverage for fraud and punitive damages and did not call into question other coverage under the policy, as evidenced by its continued defense of the claims. It maintains that its reservation of rights letter created no disputes of coverage that needed to be resolved in a declaratory rights action unless fraud was\n   found or punitive damages were awarded. The various arguments both sides make as to how New York Marine violated or did not violate the duty to affirm coverage under \u00a7 33-18-201(5), MCA, underscore the reason for a separate framework for presenting such claims in a UTPA action. Failure to file a declaratory judgment action is not abandonment of its insured in the underlying action, but could be part of an alleged violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(5), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b632 An insured's potentially valid UTPA or contract claims do not render a pre-trial settlement and confessed judgment entered into without the consent or participation of the insurer and enforceable only against the insurer reasonable when the insurer is providing a defense. Plaintiffs argue that the constellation of an insurer's various acts in violation of UTPA duties or in breach of the insurance contract justifies the insured's unilateral action and that the District Court rightly applied the\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's\n   </em>\n   standard to give the settlement amount a presumption of reasonableness. Accepting this would supplant both the insured's common-law contractual remedy and the legislative remedy afforded for an insurer's unfair practices under \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. When an insurer has not confirmed or denied coverage or has not settled in good faith, the insured has remedies, including a breach of contract action and a separate statutory remedy that includes compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees. It is the failure to provide a defense-which is not addressed in the UTPA-that constitutes improper abandonment, justifying an insured to take steps limiting its personal liability through a settlement that the law recognizes as presumptively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westchester Surplus Lines Ins.

A reasonableness hearing is not a trial on the merits of an insured's claims against its insurer. It is a limited procedure in which the trial court \"may set parameters of the hearing[ ] and determine in its discretion whether and to what extent any further discovery is necessary prior to the hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 44.

The objective of the reasonableness hearing is not \"to further punish the insurer,\"\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14, but to ensure that there has not been \"mischief in settlement negotiations,\"\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40. Thus, the burden of proving the element of damages in a subsequent breach of contract claim presumptively is removed from the insured or its assignees when the insurer breaches the duty to defend. The corollary, however, is that an insurer does not waive its contract defenses when an insured alleges breaches of other duties, and the same presumptions do not attach to the settlement amount. The insured or its assignees retain the burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence each element of its claim, including damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freyer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b635 Appellees' settlement agreement called for entry of a stipulated judgment for $10 million, along with a covenant not to execute \"that permits the plaintiffs to enforce the stipulated judgment against the Insurer through an assignment.\" It further required the parties to \"request the [District] Court to set a hearing to approve the stipulated judgment as fair and reasonable.\" Junkermier and Plaintiffs certainly\n   were free to enter into a stipulated settlement and end the lawsuit between them.

Sandefur, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b641 I write separately to place this anomalous litigation in proper analytical context and to point out where I think the Court unnecessarily stopped short on the issue and record presented. As a preliminary matter, I concur with the Court's central holding that the amount of an insured's unilateral settlement of a third-party claim is not the\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   measure of damages for breach of the implied contract and related statutory duty to settle within policy limits, as is the case with a breach of the duty to defend. I thus concur in reversal of the District Court's entry of judgment against Junkermier as far as it goes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b642 However, based on and narrowly limited to what the parties actually litigated on the merits in the uniquely conflated litigation below, I would go further and recognize that the gravamen of the issue actually litigated by the insurer (New York Marine) and the insured (through its assignees) in the so-called \"reasonableness hearing\" was the damages element of what is in essence a common-law breach of contract claim or, alternatively, a statutory bad faith claim. I would recognize that, regardless of the shifted burden of proof resulting from the erroneous application of a presumed measure of damages, New York Marine had a full and fair opportunity to contest on the merits the amount of damages claimed as a result of its alleged breach of duty to settle within policy limits. Limited to the anomalous course of litigation and the issue actually litigated between insured and insurer in this case, I would thus further hold that the amount determined reasonable by the District Court below was in substance a full and final adjudication of the damages resulting from the alleged breach of duty, thus implicating collateral estoppel in the event of any parallel-pending or subsequent adjudication as to whether New York Marine breached its implied contract or parallel statutory duty to settle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b643 In so holding, I would clarify that the pertinent issue regarding the validity and effect, if any, of an insured's unilateral settlement with a third-party claimant is not whether the insurer \"improperly abandon[ed] its insured\" but, rather, whether the insurer materially breached the insurance contract by unreasonably failing to settle within limits, thus, as a matter of blackletter contract law, relieving the insured of reciprocal contract duties to the insurer. Accordingly, I would recognize that, as a contract law consequence of a material breach of the insurance contract unaffected by the UTPA, an insured may unilaterally settle a third-party claim upon an alleged breach of the implied contract duty to settle. However, I would further recognize that, subject to the ordinary burden of proof and available defenses, the insured thereby assumes the risk of subsequently proving, on a separate contract or statutory bad faith claim against the insurer, the alleged breach of implied contract or statutory duty to settle and the resulting measure of damages without presumption. I would clarify that, if an insured further unilaterally stipulates to an adverse third-party judgment in return for a non-execution covenant prior to asserting a contract or statutory claim against the insurer, the third-party claimant in turn assumes the risk of proof otherwise on the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b644 Liability insurers have express contract duties to defend and indemnify insureds within policy limits against covered third-party liability.

However, those choices come with significant risk. Whether on a subsequent first-party claim against the insurer for breach of contract or statutory bad faith, or a bifurcated first-party declaratory judgment claim against the insurer subsequently pled by amendment in conjunction with the underlying third-party liability claim against the insured tortfeasor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10, 12, the insured, in accordance with the ordinary burden of proof and available defenses, takes the risk of affirmatively proving the alleged breach of duty,\n   causation, and the resulting damages by separate claim against the insurer. If the third-party claimant further agrees not to execute against the insured in return for a confessed judgment and assignment of rights, the third-party thereby assumes the risk of proof otherwise on the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b657 Here, in a narrow holding, the Court correctly recognizes that, due to the conflated pleading and litigation below, the assignees, standing in the shoes of the insured, did not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   plead a claim for breach of contract or statutory bad faith against the insurer in the context of the underlying third-party liability action from which the\n   adjunct \"reasonableness hearing\" arose. I agree. The parties' conflation of common-law and UTPA remedies, the shifted burden of proof resulting from the erroneous application of a presumed measure of damages, and the parallel-pending piecemeal litigation of related issues in federal court certainly preclude us from providing complete relief and resolution of the larger dispute on appeal here. However, we are not responsible for the conflated and piecemeal manner of litigation followed by the parties across multiple forums. We can and should appropriately address what is properly before us and let the chips ultimately fall where they may as a result of other pending or subsequent litigation between the parties, whether in federal court, a separate state court action, or on amendment of the pleadings on remand below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b658 While the parties did not litigate the breach element of what is essentially a disputed first-party contract or UTPA claim below, they did in fact litigate the essence of the damages element of such claims upon the so-called \"reasonableness hearing\" below. Regardless of how expressly pled or otherwise asserted below, the underlying legal basis asserted for enforcement of the stipulated judgment against New York Marine upon the \"reasonableness hearing\" was essentially a first-party common-law contract or statutory bad faith claim, albeit incomplete, asserted by the insured, through its assignees, against the insurer for the presumed measure of\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   caused by the insurer's alleged breach of duty to settle within policy limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-33 and 38-41 (recognizing presumed measure of damages and \"reasonableness hearing\" procedure in context of\n   first-party declaratory judgment action against insurer\n   <em>\n    in re\n   </em>\n   coverage and alleged breach of insurer duty, as subsequently amended to third-party ERISA liability action against insureds). While it disputes that it breached the duty under the facts and circumstances of this case, New York Marine does not, and cannot, dispute that it had an implied contract and co-extensive statutory duty to accept a reasonable third-party settlement\n   offer within limits. While it similarly disputes aspects of the coverage asserted by its insured, New York Marine similarly cannot and does not reasonably dispute on this record that its insured was at least at some measure of risk within coverage and limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b659 Standing in the shoes of the insured, the third-party assignees sought adjudication of the reasonableness of the claimed amount of damages resulting from the insurer's alleged breach of duty to settle (i.e., the amount of the unilateral settlement). Upon notice and without demand for a jury trial, New York Marine voluntarily sought leave to intervene, and in fact did so, to at least contest the reasonableness of the amount claimed by its insured, through its assignees, as the measure of damages resulting from the alleged breach of duty. Thus, whether viewed as predicated on a breach of contract duty or similar UTPA duty, the duty element of the implied claim was and is not subject to dispute, the breach element of the claim remains in dispute, and the parties actually litigated causation of damages on the factual merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b660 It is important to note that, as a purported alternative to disposition by summary judgment or trial, we fabricated the purportedly more limited \"reasonableness hearing\" procedure from whole cloth as a means for insurers to contest the reasonableness of confessed judgments predicated on breach of the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Regardless of procedural nomenclature, we did so without specification of procedural \"parameters,\" other than a shifted burden of proof, clearly recognizing, with citation to a statutory damages standard, that the substantive focus of the procedure is on the damages claimed (i.e., the amount of the confessed judgment) as a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   measure of damages for the alleged breach of insurer duty.\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Aside from the erroneously shifted burden of proof, the only significant procedural difference between the procedure followed in this case and the procedure endorsed in\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   is that, prior to seeking \"approval\" of the confessed judgment and a resulting \"reasonableness hearing,\" the plaintiffs in this case did not first, as in\n   <em>\n    Tidyman's I\n   </em>\n   , seek leave to amend the pleadings in the third-party liability action against the insured to assert a first-party declaratory judgment action against the insurer (which resulted in the ancillary declaratory judgment action with an adjudication of the alleged breach of insurer duty and related reasonableness hearing).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tidymans II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-16 ;\n   <em>\n    Tidymans I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10, 12, 23-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b661 In any event, despite the shifted burden of proof resulting from the erroneous application of a presumed measure of damages in this case, the extensive evidentiary record resulting from the procedure\n   <em>\n    requested by the parties\n   </em>\n   manifests that New York Marine had a full and fair opportunity to challenge the extent to which, if any, the stipulated judgment was a reasonable measure of damages resulting from the alleged breach of duty to settle. The process afforded the opportunity for reasonable discovery, presentation of evidence, and prejudgment briefing. Procedural nomenclature notwithstanding, the \"reasonableness hearing\" was in every meaningful regard the substantive equivalent of a bench trial on damages on the particular record in this case. There is no record indication that the erroneously shifted burden of proof prejudiced New York Marine on the substantive merits in any substantial regard. Under these unique circumstances, the fact that we have generally defined the \"reasonableness hearing\" as an abbreviated process rather than a trial is of no substantial consequence here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b662 Consequently, re-litigation of the amount of damages resulting from the alleged breach of duty to settle under the ordinary burden of proof, whether in the parallel-pending federal litigation, a separate state court action, or upon amendment of the pleadings on remand in this case, would serve no substantial purpose other than additional delay and expense in furtherance of a second bite of the proverbial apple. While I concur that the parties have yet to litigate to adjudication whether the insurer indeed breached its duty to settle as alleged, I would thus go beyond the Court's limited holding and further hold that the amount determined reasonable by the District Court below was in substance a full and final adjudication of the damages resulting from the alleged breach of duty, thus implicating collateral estoppel in the event of any parallel-pending or subsequent adjudication as to whether New York Marine breached its implied contract or parallel UTPA duty to settle. Such holding would be expressly limited to the anomalous course of litigation and circumstances of this case without authorization or endorsement of any similar use of a \"reasonableness hearing\" in future cases involving an alleged breach of duty to settle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b663 I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Justice Ingrid Gustafson and Justice James Jeremiah Shea join in the concurring opinion of Justice Sandefur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Pending parallel to this matter is\n    <em>\n     N.Y.
