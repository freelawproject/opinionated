NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337 require plaintiffs bringing state tort claims against the State of Nevada and state employees to comply with certain requirements-particularly, naming the State as a party to the action-in order to properly invoke the State's waiver of sovereign immunity. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , plaintiffs may bring claims for damages against any person who, under color of state law, deprives the plaintiff of his or her civil rights. And it is well established that the State is not considered a \"person\" for the purposes of bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim; thus, such claims cannot be maintained against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue here is how NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337 's requirement that the State be named as a party to invoke a waiver of Nevada's sovereign immunity operates when a plaintiff brings an action against state employees pursuant to both NRS Chapter 41 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that, while a plaintiff must name the State as a party to any state tort claims in order to comply with NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337, this statutory requirement does not apply to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims, even when brought in the same complaint as a plaintiff's state tort claims. Indeed, the State cannot be named as a party to a plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 civil rights claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, plaintiff's complaint arguably asserted both state tort claims and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims against the respondent state employees, but did not name the State of Nevada as a party to any of these claims. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order dismissing the complaint to the extent plaintiff asserted state tort claims under NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337, but reverse and remand the district court's dismissal as to those claims made pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Teddie Craig is an inmate at the Lovelock Correctional Center. Craig filed a civil rights and torts complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and NRS 41.031 naming respondents, who are employees of the Nevada Department of Corrections, as defendants in their individual capacities and alleging that these parties violated his First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondents subsequently moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Craig failed to properly name the State of Nevada as required by NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337, and therefore, failed to invoke the State's waiver of sovereign immunity such that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. Craig opposed the motion, arguing that the prison, as an arm of the State, is not a person for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and asserting that, as a result, he was withdrawing his reliance on NRS 41.031 as a basis for the action. Craig also moved to strike any reference to NRS 41.031 as a basis for his complaint for the purpose of giving the district court jurisdiction over his \u00a7 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court granted respondents' motion to dismiss, concluding that Craig failed to name the State of Nevada in his complaint, as required by NRS 41.031, and that he therefore failed to properly invoke the State's waiver of sovereign immunity. Based on this determination, the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, noting that Craig could not plead around this jurisdictional defect by\n   attempting to strike the reference to the relevant statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Craig now appeals, contending that the district court erred in dismissing his case because he brought federal civil rights claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondents disagree, arguing that dismissal was proper because Craig failed to properly invoke the State's waiver of sovereign immunity under NRS 41.031, and therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court may properly dismiss a complaint when a lack of subject matter jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Rosequist v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters Local 1908\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221549\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/444/#p448\">\n    118 Nev. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221549\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/444/#p448\">\n    49 P.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653 (2002),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

NRS 41.031 provides that, to properly invoke the State's waiver of immunity and pursue a civil action against the State, a plaintiff must name \"the State of Nevada on relation of the particular department, commission, board or other agency of the State whose actions are the basis for the suit.\" Additionally, NRS 41.0337 requires that, to pursue a tort claim against a state employee, the complaint must name the State as a party pursuant to NRS 41.031. Thus, NRS 41.031 and NRS 41.0337 require that, to pursue a claim against the State or a state employee acting within the scope of his or her employment, a plaintiff must name the State of Nevada as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, Craig's complaint set forth\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims while also providing that jurisdiction for his claims existed under NRS 41.031.

With regard to the \u00a7 1983 claims, Craig's complaint properly named the state employees, in their individual capacities, as parties and not the State, as required to bring claims under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of any state tort claims in Craig's complaint, but reverse and remand the dismissal of Craig's complaint as to his\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -based causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    It is not clear that Craig actually asserted any state tort claims in his complaint, as he appears to only assert constitutional violations as causes of action. Indeed, Craig's complaint was filed using a standard form entitled, \"Civil Rights Complaint pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \" and Craig merely included NRS 41.031 as an additional statute providing jurisdiction. Nonetheless, to the extent his complaint could be read as including state tort claims, Craig waived them in his opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    We note that our conclusion on this point is in line with those reached by several of our sister states who have addressed similar questions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Besser v.
