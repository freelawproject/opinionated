Petitioner suffered a compensable injury after the effective date of the Administrative Workers' Compensation Act (AWCA) (Title 85A). The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded Petitioner Permanent Partial Disability (PPD). The ALJ also determined the City of Tulsa was entitled to a credit from the PPD award in the sum of $9,758.27, pursuant to 85A O.S. \u00a7 89. The Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of several sections of the AWCA which mandate the exclusive use of the latest edition of the American Medical Association's Guide (AMA Guide) to evaluate and award PPD. In addition, he challenged the constitutionality of the credit against PPD awards provided by 85A O.S. \u00a7 89. The ALJ found the use of the AMA Guide as well as the credit against PPD awards to be constitutional. The Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission En Banc affirmed. The dispositive issues on appeal concern the constitutionality of the sections of the AWCA which mandate the use of the AMA Guide as well as the employer credit against PPD awards. This cause was assigned to this office on March 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 Upon review of the record and briefs of the parties, this Court has determined the issues raised in this appeal have already been decided in our recent opinions,\n   <em>\n    Hill v.
