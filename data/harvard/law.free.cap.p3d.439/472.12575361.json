J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner appeals from an amended judgment denying post-conviction relief. In 2003, when she was 18 years old, petitioner was charged with eight felony counts in connection with the death of a single victim. After a bench trial and sentencing proceeding, petitioner was convicted on all counts and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Petitioner appeals from the post-conviction court's denial of her petition for post-conviction relief. Her chief contention on appeal is that she did not validly waive her constitutional right to a jury trial in the criminal proceeding; petitioner concludes that her conviction is thus void under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, specifically, ORS 138.530 (1)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the post-conviction court's factual findings, we conclude that petitioner's waiver of her right to a jury trial was voluntary and, consequently, valid. Accordingly, we affirm. We reject without discussion petitioner's second and third assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We review a post-conviction court's denial of relief for legal error.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Thus, we begin by laying out the relevant facts consistent with the post-conviction court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner was charged with four counts of aggravated murder, ORS 163.095, and one count each of felony murder, ORS 163.115, robbery in the first degree,\n   ORS 164.415, burglary in the first degree, ORS 164.225, and unauthorized use of a vehicle, ORS 164.135. All the charges involved a single victim. After being charged, petitioner engaged in plea negotiations with the state. During those negotiations, petitioner spoke with the judge presiding over her pretrial hearings. He told her that \"[i]f [she] did not take a plea bargain that he could almost guarantee that it would be bad and that [she] would probably, more than likely get the death penalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point after that discussion with the judge, petitioner accepted the state's offer to refrain from seeking the death penalty in exchange for petitioner's agreement to waive her jury right in both the guilt and penalty phases of her trial. On January 30, 2004, petitioner, in front of her attorney, executed a written jury waiver that stated:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    ORS 138.530(1)(a) provides that post-conviction relief shall be granted if the petitioner establishes\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    \"[a] substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in petitioner's conviction, or in the appellate review thereof, of petitioner's rights under the Constitution of the United States, or under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, or both, and which denial rendered the conviction void.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    \"I, the Defendant in the above entitled criminal proceeding, having been heretofore fully informed of all my several constitutional rights, including my right to a Jury Trial, and being well aware of my\n    right thereto, do hereby knowingly waive (give up) my right to a Jury Trial and I do so freely and voluntarily without any threat, promise, or other form of coercion.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    That waiver was submitted to the court along with a letter from Dr. Larsen, a psychiatrist who had evaluated petitioner. Larsen wrote that, in his \"medical psychiatric opinion[, petitioner] meets the minimum standard to aid and assist in her own defense and understands the nature of the charges and potential penalties levied against her.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    On March 22, 2004, at the beginning of petitioner's trial, petitioner engaged in a colloquy with the trial judge, a different judge from the one who presided over the pretrial hearings. The trial judge noted that a waiver of jury trial had been filed and asked petitioner's attorney, whether that was still petitioner's decision. This colloquy followed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. We would ask that the Court inquire, make the appropriate inquiries of [defendant] and it is our desire that the entire trial be tried before the court sitting without a jury.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n    \"I have explained to [defendant] that she's constitutionally and statutorily entitled to a jury. I have advanced the\n    opinion to her as her lawyer that it is in her best interest that we be trying it without a jury and she has agreed but I would appreciate inquiry into both points.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    \"THE COURT: Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    \"[Defendant], I know there was-from discussions with the attorneys there was significant opportunity for [defense counsel] to talk to you before you signed this document back in January and I assume-and you've had opportunities since then to talk to [defense counsel] further, is that a fair statement?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    \"THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    \"THE COURT: Okay. And I'm sure [defense counsel] explained and I would again state, you do have an absolute right to a jury trial if that is your decision and that's on all aspects of this matter. And because of the charges that would be a jury which would first hear evidence and make a determination as to whether you were not guilty or guilty of the Aggravated Murder charges and then the other charges and then, if, in fact, they found you guilty on the Aggravated Murder the jury would be making a decision as to what penalty would be imposed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    \"And in this matter the [state's attorneys] had indicated that they would not be seeking on the Aggravated Murder a death penalty sentence if, in fact, you were waiving a jury.

And the two sentences in that regard would be a life sentence without the possibility of parole or a life sentence with a possibility of parole after you had served thirty years.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \"And so is that still your decision?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \"THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \"THE COURT: Okay.

I would also-I think the record should reflect that there was documentation that a psychologist or psychiatrist who had examined and met with [defendant] was of an opinion that [defendant] was capable, mentally capable and of-in other words, there weren't any issues as far as signing the waiver of jury trial.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I address that issue, Your Honor?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    \"THE COURT: Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. I specifically asked that Dr. Jerry Larsen who is a psychiatrist in this state and who had visited with [defendant] on two or three previous occasions, visit her once more. I particularly needed to ascertain whether he was certain one, that she was competent to assist in her own defense and by the same token was competent to exercise that judgment to waive a jury. In his professional opinion as he indicated to you - or indicated to me and passed on to you - it was his opinion that she was competent to do those things.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    \"And I, myself, as her attorney, as a lay person in that area, feel she was competent to do, Your Honor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    \"THE COURT: Okay. Then the matter would, as I indicated, proceed.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The court accordingly proceeded with a bench trial. The court found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Counts 1 through 5 and proceeded to the sentencing phase. Petitioner's attorney handed the court an additional waiver of jury, signed by petitioner and her attorney, which stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    \"I, [defendant], being informed of my rights particularly with respect to my right to a jury sentencing proceeding, and not acting pursuant to any promises or threats by any person, do hereby freely, voluntarily and knowingly waive the right to a jury sentencing proceeding pursuant to ORS 163.150(3)(a)(B) and the right to a jury trial pursuant to the 6th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, \u00a7 11 of the OR Const.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    \"I acknowledge and agree that I have discussed this waiver with my attorneys and that I understand my right to a jury sentencing proceeding and freely, voluntarily and knowingly waive the right to a jury sentencing proceeding in this case.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The following colloquy ensued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm handing you an additional waiver of jury for the second aspect of this trial. It's the decision of the defense that that was not necessary. However, the position of the State was that it was necessary thus we are acquiescing. And if you would like to make inquiry of [defendant] we will put her acquiescence on the record.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    \"THE COURT: I'm-with my prior discussion with [defendant] prior to starting the proceedings and then with this one signed by her and witnessed by you I don't feel further inquiry is necessary.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Before announcing its sentence, the court commented that petitioner's childhood was \"certainly a childhood which we would wish no one to have to endure.\" Indeed, throughout petitioner's life leading up to her crime, she, her parents, and her extended family had experienced significant and ongoing substance abuse and mental health issues, and petitioner had suffered significant physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Nonetheless, ultimately, the court determined that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or release was appropriate. Petitioner appealed that sentence, and we affirmed in\n    <em>\n     State v.

As pertinent to this appeal, petitioner claimed that\n    she was coerced by the pretrial judge to agree to a bench trial, rendering her waiver invalid. Specifically, petitioner alleged that she was\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    \"told by the [pretrial judge] that he would guarantee the death penalty for the Petitioner if she insisted upon a jury trial. This Judge stated to the Petitioner that she would die, if she insisted upon a jury trial. The Petitioner was intimidated and only because of the judge's influence did she agree to a court trial.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Defendant, the superintendent of Coffee Creek Correctional Institution,\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    responded that petitioner had failed to provide any evidence of coercion and argued that the record demonstrates that petitioner voluntarily\n    agreed to waive her right to a jury pursuant to the agreement that the state would refrain from seeking the death penalty. In her deposition with the state regarding her claim for post-conviction relief, petitioner testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    \"I can't remember specifically what he said, but he told me that he could almost guarantee that I would get the death penalty and asked me if that's what I wanted. Did I want to sit on death row. And him being a judge, you know, it scared me.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Petitioner further testified that, \"being young and not knowing a whole lot about what was going on I was scared and I guess you could say they were really intimidating about it.\" The post-conviction court credited petitioner's testimony; it found that the judge had told petitioner that, \"in his opinion, a jury would certainly return a death sentence.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    After a hearing, the post-conviction court denied petitioner relief on all claims. On appeal, we reversed and remanded on the ground that the post-conviction court's judgment failed to comply with ORS 138.640(1) ; as a result, we did not address petitioner's substantive argument.\n    <em>\n     Myers v.

On remand, the post-conviction court entered a more detailed judgment. As relevant to this appeal, the court determined that there was\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    \"5. Insufficient proof of coercion by [the pretrial judge]. He told pet[itioner] that in his opinion, a jury would certainly return a death sentence. It was appropriate for the court to be sure pet[itioner] understood the reality of her situation. Pet[itioner] testified in her deposition that she knew she had the choice of court or jury. One fact that influenced the choice was the DA taking death off the table if she went court. It does not appear that pet[itioner] was incapable of making her own decision since she turned down a plea offer, that her [mother] and her attorney urged her to take.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    \"* * * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    \"7. Pet[itioner's] waiver of jury was knowing and voluntary. She signed a waiver, her attorney discussed the matter with [her] and the court inquired. At no time did she indicate to anyone any confusion. Clearly, she knew that the waiver meant the DA would not seek the death penalty. The DA's case was extremely strong. Conviction was highly likely. The choice benefitted pet[itioner].\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    On appeal, petitioner assigns error to the post-conviction court's denial of her claim for relief regarding her jury trial waiver.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ORS 138.530(1)(a). Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in concluding that her waiver was voluntary and not a product of coercion. The state first responds that petitioner's arguments are barred because they exceed the scope of the claim that she pleaded in her petition for post-conviction relief. We reject that argument.

As explained below, the evidence in the record supports the post-conviction court's findings regarding petitioner's waiver, and those findings show that the waiver was voluntary, that is, not coerced by the judge's statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Turning to the merits, petitioner contends, regardless of allocation of the burden of proof, that the post-conviction court erred in determining that her jury waiver was valid under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    We understand petitioner to essentially reiterate the argument that she made to the post-conviction court: that she was coerced into waiving her right to a jury trial when the pretrial judge, in discussing the state's settlement offer, said that he could almost guarantee that a jury would impose the death penalty. Petitioner relies on\n    <em>\n     United States v. Jackson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174728\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/570/\">\n     390 U.S. 570\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174728\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/570/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1209\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174728\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/570/\">\n     20 L.Ed.2d 138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968), to stand for her proposition that a waiver of a constitutional right in exchange solely for immunity from the death penalty is an involuntary waiver. Petitioner further argues that, because the trial court (1) did not specifically ask her whether she was making the decision to waive her jury right voluntarily and (2) only asked her three leading questions to which petitioner responded with the single word, \"Yes,\" the trial court failed to ensure that her waiver was not the product of coercion. The state responds that\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    does not stand for petitioner's proposition and argues that\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Furthermore, the state contends that the record as a whole demonstrates that petitioner's waiver was voluntary, that is, that it was not coerced.

As we explain below, we conclude that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the post-conviction court's resolution of the case, shows that petitioner's waiver of her right to a jury was voluntary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Petitioner characterizes the pretrial judge's statement that she would likely face the death penalty if she chose a jury trial as a \"threat of death\" that overbore her will and coerced her into waiving her right. However, the post-conviction court understood it differently. The court found that the pretrial judge was ensuring that petitioner was aware of the \"reality of her situation\" and that the statement of that reality did not overwhelm or confuse petitioner. The evidence the court cited in making that finding adequately supports it. At her deposition, petitioner testified that she knew she had the choice of a bench trial or jury trial. She discussed the matter with her attorney, and she signed a written waiver in which she explicitly acknowledged that she was waiving her right \"freely and voluntarily.\" Several months passed between petitioner signing the waiver and the colloquy with the trial judge, during which the judge offered her another chance to change her mind. Furthermore, before the state's offer at issue in this case, petitioner had rejected a previous plea offer by the state, demonstrating her ability to make independent decisions regarding her case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Petitioner's decision to waive her right to a jury trial may have been affected by the fear of facing the death penalty, but the record, viewed consistently with the post-conviction court's findings, does not indicate that the pretrial judge's statements impaired her capacity for self-determination or overbore her free will. To the contrary, the facts demonstrate that petitioner was able to rationally and independently weigh the decision of whether to accept the state's offer to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for her waiver. The court scrutinized petitioner's circumstances, including her history of mental health and substance abuse issues and her age when she entered her waiver. Petitioner was evaluated by a psychiatrist who opined that she was capable of making the decision on her own, and petitioner has not explained why her age, background, or life experiences rendered her decision an \"involuntary\" one. Petitioner is correct that the judge did not ask her directly whether her waiver was \"voluntary.\" However, given that a colloquy is not constitutionally required for a valid jury trial waiver, that oversight alone does not outweigh the record supporting a finding of voluntariness.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
