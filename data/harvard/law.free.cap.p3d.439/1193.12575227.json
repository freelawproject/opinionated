Randall appeals the trial court's ruling that an affidavit of renewal filed in the superior court of the county in which a transcript of a justice court judgment was docketed, instead of in the superior court of the county in which the judgment was obtained, complied with statutory renewal requirements. She also challenges the court's award of post-judgment attorneys' fees and costs. For the following reasons, we affirm the ruling that the judgment was properly renewed and the award of costs for the subsequent garnishment proceeding. We vacate, however, the award of attorneys' fees and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 2011, the Casa Grande Justice Court (Pinal County) entered judgment in favor of Ironwood Commons Community Homeowners Association, Inc. (\"Ironwood\") and against Randall in the amount of $4,089.05 arising from her delinquent assessments. The judgment included a clause purporting to award attorneys' fees and costs incurred in collecting the judgment. In 2014, Ironwood filed a transcript of judgment in the Maricopa County Superior Court and two days later recorded the judgment, also in Maricopa County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 To prevent the judgment from lapsing, Ironwood filed an affidavit of judgment renewal in the Maricopa County Superior Court in 2016, stating that the justice court judgment \"ha[d] not been recorded or docketed in any other county.\" Ironwood then filed an application for garnishment, a post-judgment statement of costs, and an application for post-judgment attorneys' fees. The clerk of the court issued a writ of garnishment, and the trial court awarded attorneys' fees ($1,130) and costs ($510.77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Randall moved to quash the writ of garnishment, arguing execution on the judgment was prohibited under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-1551(B) because the judgment was not properly renewed. Randall also filed a motion to vacate the award of attorneys' fees and costs, asserting the award was not grounded in any statutory or contractual provision and the justice court judgment was invalid. Ironwood opposed both motions and also filed an application\n   for order of continuing lien against Randall's non-exempt earnings, which the court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 During oral argument on the motions, Randall argued the justice court judgment expired because the affidavit of renewal should have been filed in the Pinal County Superior Court to give her proper notice. The trial court rejected the argument and, citing A.R.S. \u00a7 33-962(A) and \u00a7 12-1612(A), ruled that the \"proper court\" for filing a renewal affidavit was \"the court where the judgment was docketed,\" which in this case was the Maricopa County Superior Court. The court upheld its previous award of attorneys' fees and costs to Ironwood and this timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Proper Court for Judgment Renewal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Randall contends the justice court judgment cannot be enforced against her because it was not renewed in accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1612.

No language in this or related statutes prohibited Ironwood from following the procedures in \u00a7 33-962(A) to docket the justice court judgment in the Maricopa County Superior Court and from then renewing that judgment, as contemplated by \u00a7 12-1612.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1612(A) (allowing a renewal affidavit, filed in the \"proper court,\" to renew a judgment which \"has been entered and docketed\" in the \"superior court, whether originally rendered by it or\n   <em>\n    entered on a transcript of judgment from another court\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Moreover, no language in \u00a7 33-962 restricts the filing of the transcript of judgment to a superior court in any particular county, unlike prior versions of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-962 (2019) (\"The clerk of the superior court, on presentation of a certified transcript of a judgment for more than fifteen dollars, exclusive of costs, given by a justice or municipal court, shall forthwith file the judgment.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-962 (1992) (\"The clerk of the superior court, upon presentation of a certified transcript of a judgment for more than fifteen dollars, exclusive of costs, given by a justice of the peace\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   , shall forthwith file the judgment.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 In sum, our reading of the judgment renewal statutes is consistent with the conclusion reached in\n   <em>\n    J.C. Penney\n   </em>\n   and thus confirms Ironwood's position that it was not required to file the renewal affidavit in the superior court of the county where the justice court judgment originated (Pinal County), but only where that judgment was correctly filed and docketed (Maricopa County).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The only arguable support in\n   <em>\n    J.C. Penney\n   </em>\n   for Randall's argument is the reference to A.R.S. \u00a7 22-246, but that section does not apply here because Ironwood only sought to garnish Randall's wages, not force the sale of her real property. The trial court did not err in denying Randall's motion to quash the writ of garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Randall argues the court erred because no contractual or statutory basis supported Ironwood's request. She further contends that Ironwood's inclusion of \"self-serving language\" in the justice court judgment did not create a substantive right to such fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 We review the superior court's authority to award attorneys' fees de novo.\n   <em>\n    Bennett Blum, M.D., Inc. v.

Nothing in this record indicates she made a timely objection or filed an appeal.

In\n   <em>\n    Bennett Blum\n   </em>\n   , this court held that attorneys' fees related to a garnishment for \"non-earnings\" could be awarded only under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1580(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 209, \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248464\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/204/#p205\">\n    330 P.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute at issue here, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.07, provides that in a garnishment for\n   <em>\n    earnings\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he prevailing party may be awarded costs and attorney fees in a reasonable amount determined by the court,\" but \"[a]n award of attorney fees shall not be assessed against nor is it chargeable to the judgment debtor unless the judgment debtor is found to have objected solely for the purpose of delay or to harass the judgment creditor.\" \u00a7 12-1598.07(E). Other than the treatment of costs, \u00a7 12-1598.07(E) is substantially similar to \u00a7 12-1580(E). The language of both statutes plainly mandates that attorneys' fees may only be awarded against a judgment debtor if the debtor \"objected solely for the purpose of delay or to harass the judgment creditor.\" A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-1508(E), -1598.07(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 Because A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.07(E) is the exclusive means by which attorneys' fees may be granted in a proceeding to garnish earnings, the trial court erred by awarding Ironwood attorneys' fees related to the garnishment proceeding. As shown in its affidavit, Ironwood requested attorneys' fees for tasks related to general collection efforts, such as \"pursu[ing] [the] transcript of judgment\" and preparing the judgment renewal. But it also requested fees for tasks related to the garnishment proceeding, such as obtaining the debtor's employment information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.03(A)(4) (providing that the judgment creditor must file an application to obtain a writ of garnishment stating,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]hat the garnishee is believed to be an employer of the judgment debtor\"). Though Ironwood argues the fees sought did not include any fees for preparation of garnishment\n   <em>\n    documents\n   </em>\n   , if the fees relate to preparing for the garnishment proceeding, they are recoverable only under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.07(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 The trial court had no authority to modify the justice court judgment; thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees and costs for collection services unrelated to the garnishment proceeding. The court erred, however, in awarding Ironwood attorneys' fees related to the garnishment proceeding. We therefore vacate the superior court's award of attorneys' fees. Because we are unable to discern from this record what portion of the total award is attributable to work related to the garnishment proceeding, and therefore not recoverable, we remand for reconsideration of the proper amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Attorneys' Fees and Costs on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Randall and Ironwood both seek recovery of their attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.07(E). We cannot say that Randall's appeal was filed for the purpose of causing delay or harassment, and thus we deny Ironwood's fee request, but award taxable costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1598.07(E). Ironwood also seeks attorneys' fees under the declaration and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01. But the declaration is not part of the record and \u00a7 12-1598.07(E) provides the exclusive statutory authority for awarding fees in a garnishment proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Because Randall has not prevailed on appeal, we deny her request for fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 We conclude that Ironwood could properly pursue garnishment of Randall's wages because it timely renewed the justice court judgment in the Maricopa County Superior Court in accordance with statutory requirements. Thus, we affirm (1) the trial court's denial of Randall's motion to quash and (2) the cost award dated March 1, 2017. We vacate the court's award of attorneys' fees and remand for reconsideration of the amounts requested for the purpose of awarding only the fees that were unrelated to the garnishment proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    For the purpose of achieving administrative efficiency, voters adopted a new Article 6 in 1960.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ariz.
