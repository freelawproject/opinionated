Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant Tax Foundation of Hawai'i challenges the State of Hawai'i's implementation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 248-2.6 (Supp. 2015), which authorizes the State to be reimbursed for its costs in administering a rail surcharge on state general excise and use taxes on behalf of the City and County of Honolulu. More specifically, the issues on appeal are: (1) whether we lack jurisdiction because this is a \"controversy with respect to taxes\" under HRS \u00a7 632-1 ; (2) whether Tax Foundation has standing to bring its challenge; (3) whether the State violated HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 by retaining 10% of the gross proceeds of the surcharge without calculating the actual cost of administering the surcharge; and (4) whether the State's application of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that: (1) the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear Tax Foundation's claims because its complaint was not a \"controversy with respect to taxes\" within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 632-1 ; (2) Tax Foundation has standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (3) the State did not violate HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 by retaining 10% of the gross proceeds of the surcharge; and (4) the State's application of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 does not violate the Hawai'i or United States Constitutions. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court's order and judgment granting the State's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and remand this case to the circuit court with instructions to grant the State's motion for summary judgment on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Tax Foundation's Complaint\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    On October 21, 2015, Tax Foundation of Hawai'i (Tax Foundation) filed a class action\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    on behalf of all taxpayers in the City and County of Honolulu. The complaint alleged\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    that after Act 247 was enacted, the City and County of Honolulu enacted Ordinance 05-027, imposing a surcharge on state general excise and use taxes (Honolulu County surcharge). Tax Foundation asserted the following about the surcharge. Honolulu is the only county to have adopted such a surcharge. Budget and Finance has retained 10%\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    of the Honolulu County surcharge amounts collected by DOTAX since it was initially levied, and disbursed the remaining 90% to the City and County of Honolulu. During the fiscal years ending June 30, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, Budget and Finance retained approximately $21.2, $19.3, $24.2, and $24.8 million, respectively, which went to the State general fund. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative total of the State's surcharge withholdings was $177,865,487.24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Tax Foundation also alleged that the State violated HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(d) by retaining 10% of the City and County of Honolulu's surcharge gross proceeds without calculating the actual costs of administering it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Tax Foundation alleged that the 10% retained by the State \"grossly exceed[ed]\" the costs incurred to assess, collect, and dispose of the Honolulu County surcharge funds. Tax Foundation further alleged that City and County of Honolulu taxpayers were required to pay a higher state tax than taxpayers of other counties as a result of the State's failure to follow HRS \u00a7 248-2.6, that the State had violated the general laws provision in Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Hawai'i Constitution, and violated the equal protection clauses of the Hawai'i and United States Constitutions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Tax Foundation sought declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. In Count I, Tax Foundation sought an \"order enjoining the State from continuing to violate\" constitutional provisions and injunctive relief in the form of reimbursements, to the plaintiffs \"and/or\" the City and County of Honolulu, of amounts \"improperly kept by the State.\" In\n    Count II, Tax Foundation sought \"mandamus directing the State to follow HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(d), and deduct and withhold only the cost of administering the Oahu surcharge and to pay the remaining balance of the 10% county surcharge initially withheld to Honolulu.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     2. The State's Motion to Dismiss\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The State filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting: (1) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because HRS \u00a7 632-1 (1993)\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    prohibits declaratory relief in \" '\n    <em>\n     any controversy\n    </em>\n    ' with respect to taxes,\" (2) mandamus and injunctive relief was not warranted because HRS \u00a7\u00a7 40-35 (Supp. 2006)\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    and 232-14.5 (Supp. 2006)\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    provided adequate and exclusive remedies for tax disputes in tax appeal court, and (3) Tax Foundation lacked standing. Regarding the relief sought by Tax Foundation, the State argued that \"any taxpayer can pay a tax under protest and file suit for a refund under section 40-35, HRS, or timely file a tax refund claim and appeal from a denial of the refund claim to the Tax Appeal Court under section 232-14.5, HRS.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Tax Foundation's Opposition to the State's Motion to Dismiss\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Tax Foundation opposed the State's motion to dismiss, arguing that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction because its complaint did not challenge the assessment or collection of taxes, but rather sought to correct mishandling after assessment and collection of the Honolulu County surcharge. Tax Foundation argued that the matter was not a \"tax controversy\" or an attack on the State's ability to collect taxes, and was instead an attempt to force the State to comply with HRS \u00a7 248-2.6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Tax Foundation analogized to the ICA opinion in\n    <em>\n     Hawaii Insurers Council v. Lingle\n    </em>\n    , where the ICA held that HRS \u00a7 632-1 's prohibition on actions regarding taxes did not apply because the plaintiff was not attempting to keep the State from assessing and collecting taxes.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261748\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/117/454/\">\n     117 Hawai'i 454\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261748\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/117/454/\">\n     184 P.3d 769\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (App. 2008),\n    <em>\n     aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310694\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/120/51/\">\n     120 Hawai'i 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310694\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/120/51/\">\n     201 P.3d 564\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Tax Foundation also changed its position regarding the relief it was requesting. Although Tax Foundation initially sought reimbursement to itself \"and/or\" the City and County of Honolulu in its complaint, in its opposition, it stated that it \"does not seek any refund for itself or any other taxpayer.\" Tax Foundation argued that since it did not seek a declaratory ruling as to its own liability for taxes, and only sought to have the State pay its excess surcharge withholdings to the City and County of Honolulu, its claim did not belong in tax appeal court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Tax Foundation asserted that it had standing because it paid general excise tax on income derived from fundraising that it conducted to support its activities. As to the injury suffered, Tax Foundation argued that if the State returned the excess funds it had diverted to the City and County of Honolulu, the Honolulu surcharge \"could end sooner.\" Tax Foundation argued that this injury was traceable to the State's actions, and was redressable, asserting that \"the State could, if it chose, determine the costs\" of administering the Honolulu County surcharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Tax Foundation filed a motion for summary judgment, and argued,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , that the \"plain and unambiguous language of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6\" supported its interpretation, and that the State's reading of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 is unconstitutional and forces the City and County of Honolulu taxpayers to subsidize the rest of the State.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    In its cross-motion for summary judgment, the State argued: (1) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over Tax Foundation's claims, (2) HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 expressly requires that the State retain 10% of the Honolulu County surcharge, (3) retention of 10% does not violate the equal protection clause, (4) retention of 10% is consistent with the general laws provision of the state constitution, and (5) Tax Foundation was challenging a \"policy decision\" and should seek a statutory amendment from the legislature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Hearing on the Motions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    At a hearing on the various motions, the circuit court found that Tax Foundation's complaint presented a controversy arising out of a tax, and that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute based on HRS \u00a7 632-1, stating that HRS \u00a7 632-1\"broadly implies many controversies that can arise out of a tax.\" Tax Foundation orally requested leave to amend its complaint to clarify that the declaratory relief it sought was not subject to HRS \u00a7 632-1 's prohibition against tax controversies. The circuit court denied the request. The circuit court also determined that it lacked authority to impose mandamus relief on another branch of government. Thus, the circuit court granted the State's motion to dismiss, and did not reach the issue of whether Tax Foundation had standing. The court further ruled that the cross-motions for summary judgment were moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The circuit court subsequently filed its written order granting the State's motion to dismiss. The order stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    The court, having read the memoranda in support and in opposition to the motion and the declarations filed therewith, and having heard the arguments of counsel, and based on the records and files herein and for good cause shown, GRANTS Defendant STATE OF HAWAII'S Motion to Dismiss Complaint Filed on October 21,2015 (Filed on November 10, 2015) for the reason that Plaintiff's claims for relief are barred by section 632-1, Hawai'i Revised Statutes, because Plaintiff's complaint constitutes or involves \"a controversy with respect to taxes,\" and thus this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiff's request for leave to amend their complaint filed on October 21, 2015 is denied for the reason that the Court has dismissed the Plaintiff's complaint.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    The parties' cross motions for summary judgment filed on January 21, 2016, and March 3, 2016, respectively are, therefore moot, given the Court's decision to grant Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Final judgment was entered on June 1, 2016.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Appeal\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Tax Foundation timely appealed, seeking review of the circuit court's judgment and order granting the State's motion to dismiss. We granted Tax Foundation's subsequent request to transfer the appeal to this court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Tax Foundation's Opening Brief\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Tax Foundation raises three points of error. Tax Foundation argues that the circuit court erred in: (1) granting the State's motion to dismiss on the basis that it had no jurisdiction because the complaint sought declaratory relief involving a controversy with respect to taxes, (2) not granting Tax Foundation's motion for summary judgment, and (3) not allowing Tax Foundation the opportunity to amend its complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As to the first point of error, Tax Foundation argues \"[t]his is NOT a dispute over taxes.\" (Capitalization in original). Tax Foundation asserts that its claim \"arises from, and involves,\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    what the State does\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the Surcharge has been assessed, collected, and deposited into the State's coffers.\" (Emphasis in original). Tax Foundation emphasizes the portion of HRS \u00a7 632-1 providing that controversies involving the interpretation of\n    statutes are not prohibited.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Tax Foundation argues that HRS \u00a7 632-1 allows a declaratory ruling on the proper interpretation of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 because such declaratory relief would not affect the State's ability to assess or collect the general excise tax or the Honolulu County surcharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Tax Foundation also argues that the tax appeal court's limited jurisdiction would not include the claims in its complaint. HRS \u00a7 232-13 limits the jurisdiction of the tax appeal court to determining \" 'the amount of valuation or taxes, as the case may be, in dispute[.]' \" The liability for paying the general excise tax or Honolulu County surcharge is undisputed; therefore, Tax Foundation argues, the tax appeal court does not have jurisdiction over this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    As to the second point of error, Tax Foundation asserts that HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 is \"clear and unambiguous[,]\" and mandates that the State should retain only the costs it incurs in administering the Honolulu County surcharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    As to the third point of error, Tax Foundation argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in not allowing it \"at least one opportunity to amend\" its complaint. Tax Foundation cites Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 15(a)(2)\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    and case law stating that in the absence of an apparent or declared reason, such as undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive, leave to amend should be freely given.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     2. The State's Answering Brief\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In its Answering Brief, the State argues: (1) the circuit court correctly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it is a tax controversy under HRS \u00a7 632-1, (2) the circuit court correctly denied Tax Foundation's request for mandamus relief, (3) Tax Foundation does not have standing, (4) Tax Foundation improperly argues the merits of the case, (5) the State should prevail on the merits, and (6) the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tax Foundation's oral motion to amend its complaint. The State also argues that Tax Foundation is \"[a]sking the court to interfere with a statute ... [which] violates the separation of powers at the heart of our system of government.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As to subject matter jurisdiction, the State argues that the plain language of HRS \u00a7 632-1 supports dismissal, because HRS \u00a7 632-1 applies to \" 'any controversy with respect to taxes' \" instead of being limited to the assessment or collection of taxes. The State asserts that interpretations of the federal Declaratory Judgment Act and Tax Anti-Injunction Act protect not just assessment and collection, but \"any activities that are intended to or may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes[.]\" The State argues that Tax Foundation's lawsuit \"may ultimately culminate in the 'collection' of the State's portion of the taxes being obstructed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The State also argues that this type of case belongs in tax appeal court rather than in circuit court. The State argues that the tax appeal court has jurisdiction to hear: (1) \" 'taxpayer appeals from assessments' \" pursuant to HRS Chapter 232, (2) \" 'challenges to taxes paid under protest' \" pursuant to HRS \u00a7 40-35, (3)\" 'adverse rulings by the Director,' \" and (4) appeals from the denial of refund claims by DOTAX pursuant to HRS \u00a7 232-14.5. The State also argues that, even if the court finds that this case is not a \"controversy with respect to taxes,\" the circuit court lacks jurisdiction because the tax\n    appeal statutes in HRS Chapter 232 provide a \" 'special form of remedy' specific to tax cases\" that must be followed according to HRS \u00a7 632-1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The State argues that it is appropriate for an appellate court to rule on the standing issue presented in the State's motion to dismiss, asserting that standing is a jurisdictional matter that the court must address as a threshold matter. The State further asserts that Tax Foundation does not satisfy the first and third prongs of the\n    <em>\n     Sierra Club v. Hawai'i Tourism Authority\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259515\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/100/242/\">\n     100 Hawai'i 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259515\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/100/242/\">\n     59 P.3d 877\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002) (plurality opinion) test for standing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    As to the merits, the State argues that although \"it would be improper for this Court to decide this case on the merits when the circuit court did not have an opportunity to address the merits first[,]\" if this court decides to address the merits, the State should prevail as a matter of law based on the rules of statutory construction, legislative intent, and principles of statutory interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Tax Foundation's Reply Brief\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In its Reply Brief, Tax Foundation argues: (1) the circuit court had jurisdiction pursuant to the ICA's decision in\n    <em>\n     Hawaii Insurers Council\n    </em>\n    , (2) Tax Foundation has standing, (3) the State misreads HRS \u00a7 248-2.6, (4) the State's interpretation of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 is not consistent with the intent of the legislature, and (5) the circuit court erred in not allowing Tax Foundation to amend its complaint and amendment would not be futile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Relief Requested by Tax Foundation Does Not Constitute a Tax Refund Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We must first address whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Tax Foundation's complaint. The tax appeal court has exclusive jurisdiction over tax refund claims. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 232-13 and 232-14.5(a), (c). HRS \u00a7 232-13 states that the jurisdiction of the tax appeal court is limited to disputes about the \"amount of valuation or taxes.\" HRS \u00a7 232-14.5(a) provides that a denial of a tax refund claim by DOTAX \"may be appealed by the filing of a written notice of appeal to a board of review or the tax appeal court[,]\" and subsection (c) provides that \"this section shall apply to tax refund claims for all taxes administered by the department of taxation.\" The circuit court therefore does not have jurisdiction over tax refund claims, and only the tax appeal court may consider tax refund claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The State argues that Tax Foundation seeks a tax reimbursement to itself and class members, and as such, presents a tax refund controversy over which the tax appeal court has exclusive jurisdiction. Tax Foundation, however, now only seeks reimbursement to the City and County of Honolulu. Initially, Tax Foundation's complaint effectively sought a partial tax refund by requesting reimbursement to itself, its class members, \"and/or\" the City and County of Honolulu of the allegedly improperly kept surcharge funds. However, Tax Foundation later disclaimed any refund remedy for itself and its class members in its opposition to the State's motion to dismiss, leaving only the City and County of Honolulu to recover. Therefore, taxpayer liability is not in dispute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Because the tax appeal court's jurisdiction is limited to determining \"the amount of valuation or taxes, as the case may be, in dispute[,]\" HRS \u00a7 232-13, and here there is no dispute about any taxpayer's tax liability, Tax Foundation cannot bring its claim before the tax appeal court. Tax Foundation's dispute concerns only the post-collection disposition of the surcharge funds. Accordingly, the circuit court is not barred from hearing Tax Foundation's claim based on HRS \u00a7 232-14.5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

A ruling in Tax Foundation's favor would not impact DOTAX's ability to assess or collect these taxes because Tax Foundation does not dispute its liability to pay general excise and use tax, or the Honolulu County surcharge. Tax Foundation contests only the \"administration and allocation\" of the Honolulu County surcharge after it is assessed and collected.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Accordingly, this is not a \"controversy with respect to taxes\" and the exclusionary provision does not apply because only suits that would restrain the assessment and collection of taxes fall within the scope of HRS \u00a7 632-1. The circuit court therefore had jurisdiction and erred in dismissing on that basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     PART TWO: TAX FOUNDATION HAS HRS \u00a7 632-1 STANDING\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    (By: McKenna, J., with whom Pollack and Wilson, JJ., join)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

In Hawai'i state courts, standing is a prudential consideration regarding the \"proper - and properly limited - role of courts in a democratic society\" and is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, as it is in federal courts. Importantly, this court has repeatedly ruled that standing requirements may be tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative declarations of policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, standing requirements can differ based on legislative enactments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    HRS Chapter 632 is an example of a statutory scheme in which standing requirements have been prescribed by legislative declarations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Life of the Land II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8828640\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/63/166/#p172\">\n     63 Haw. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    172 &amp; n.5,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20P.2d%20431\">\n     623 P.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    438 &amp; n.5. Through language in HRS Chapter 632, the Hawai'i State Legislature has stated its views regarding when a party should be able to bring declaratory relief claims under that Chapter. Despite this, some of our recent opinions have required a party requesting declaratory relief under HRS \u00a7 632-1 to also satisfy the common law three-part \"injury in fact\" test for standing, which requires a showing that (1) the plaintiff has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant's conduct, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions, and (3) a favorable decision would likely provide relief for the plaintiff's injury.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    Requiring satisfaction of this test, which was originally developed in federal courts due to subject matter jurisdiction concerns, limits declaratory relief otherwise available under the language of Chapter 632, thereby contravening prudential\n    considerations of the \"proper - and properly limited - role of courts\" as \"prescribed\" by the Hawai'i State Legislature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Based on these considerations as well as the reasons discussed below, we hold that a party seeking declaratory relief under HRS \u00a7 632-1 need not satisfy the three-part \"injury in fact\" test to have standing. Rather, consistent with standing requirements prescribed by the legislature through the language of HRS \u00a7 632-1, we hold that a party has standing to seek declaratory relief in a civil case brought pursuant to HRS \u00a7 632-1(b) (2016): (1) where antagonistic claims exist between the parties (a) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or (b) where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. Applying this standard, Tax Foundation has standing to seek declaratory relief under HRS \u00a7 632-1. We therefore need not address whether Tax Foundation has \"taxpayer standing.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Background\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In this case, Tax Foundation, as a putative class representative, requested a declaratory judgment pursuant to HRS \u00a7 632-1 (1993), as well as other ancillary relief. The circuit court dismissed Tax Foundation's complaint due to an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the language in HRS \u00a7 632-1 that declaratory judgments are not available for \"any controversy with respect to taxes.\" The State of Hawai'i (\"State\") had alternatively requested dismissal based on Tax Foundation's alleged lack of standing, but the circuit court did not address standing due to its dismissal based on subject matter jurisdiction grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In its Answering Brief, the State reasserts Tax Foundation's alleged lack of standing as an alternative basis on which this court should affirm the circuit court's dismissal of Tax Foundation's lawsuit. The State argues that because Tax Foundation seeks to have the State pay the City and County of Honolulu (\"City\") the portion of the ten percent deduction from the City's 0.5% general excise tax surcharge (\"Surcharge\") that exceeds costs of administration, only the City can meet the three-part \"injury in fact\" test for standing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In its Reply Brief, Tax Foundation argues it has standing to request declaratory relief. It did not specifically assert \"taxpayer standing,\" but it alleges that \"[g]overnments do not pay taxes; taxpayers do[,]\" and that as a taxpayer, it is continuously injured by the State's diversion of money away from the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (\"HART\") project, \"which causes over-collection of the amounts needed to sustain HART.\" It contends that a favorable decision would provide more support to HART for the benefit of the City to the relief of affected taxpayers, including itself, and that the more the State diverts, the less the City receives, and the longer the Surcharge is needed, the more taxpayers must pay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

The Nature of Standing Requirements in Hawai'i State Courts\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Before discussing standing requirements for purposes of HRS \u00a7 632-1, it is important to clarify that, in Hawai'i state courts, the issue of standing is a prudential concern and not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, as suggested by some of our cases. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Keahole Defense Coalition, Inc. v. Board of Land &amp; Natural Resources\n    </em>\n    (\"\n    <em>\n     Keahole\n    </em>\n    \"),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262215\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/419/\">\n     110 Hawai'i 419\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262215\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/419/\">\n     134 P.3d 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006), we stated that \"standing is a jurisdictional issue that may be addressed at any stage of a case.\"\n    <em>\n     Keahole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262215\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/419/\">\n     110 Hawai'i at 427\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262215\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/419/\">\n     134 P.3d at 593\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation and footnote omitted). In\n    <em>\n     Akinaka\n    </em>\n    , we also stated that this court has a duty to address standing\n    <em>\n     sua\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     sponte\n    </em>\n    , even if it is not raised by the parties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Akinaka\n    </em>\n    , 91 Hawai'i at 55, 979 P.2d at 1081.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In federal courts, standing does implicate subject matter jurisdiction. The three-part \"injury in fact\" test is based on the \"cases and controversies\" limitation on federal court jurisdiction under Article III, section 2 of the United States Constitution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     504 U.S. 555\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 560,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     119 L.Ed.2d 351\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992) ( \"Though some of its elements express merely prudential considerations that are part of judicial self-government, the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, in federal courts, although standing secondarily implicates prudential concerns, standing is fundamentally an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. In other words, in federal courts, where a plaintiff lacks standing, no \"case or controversy\" exists to confer subject matter jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Hawai'i state courts, on the other hand, are not subject to a \"case or controversy\" jurisdictional limitation. Rather, pursuant to Article VI, Section 1 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i, \"[t]he several courts ... have original and appellate jurisdiction as provided by law ....\" In Hawai'i courts, standing is solely an issue of justiciability, arising out of prudential concerns of judicial self-governance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Life of the Land II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8828640\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/63/166/#p172\">\n     63 Haw. at 171-72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20P.2d%20431\">\n     623 P.2d at 438\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

It starts by providing that, in cases of actual controversy, courts of record have power to make binding adjudications of right whether or not consequential relief is, or at the time could be, claimed. It also provides that a declaratory relief action cannot be objected to on the grounds that declaratory relief is the only relief sought; in other words, other remedies, such as damages or injunctive relief, need not also be sought.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    Subsection (a) further provides that the district courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction over declaratory relief claims\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    and that other courts of record cannot grant declaratory relief in any controversy with respect to taxes or in a case seeking divorce or annulment. The subsection clarifies, however, that declaratory relief can be sought in controversies involving the interpretation of deeds, wills, other instruments of writing, statutes, municipal ordinances, or other governmental regulations. It further states that this list is not exhaustive, and that declaratory relief can also be sought in other situations involving other antagonistic assertions or denials of rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Subsection (b) of the statute more specifically addresses \"controversies subject to\" declaratory relief.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    It states that relief\n    by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil cases\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    where (1) there is an actual controversy between contending parties;\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    (2) (a) antagonistic claims exist between the parties (i) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or (ii) where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or privilege; and (b) a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    As indicated in the paragraph above, the plain language of HRS \u00a7 632-1(b) seemingly allows for declaratory relief where there is an \"actual controversy between contending parties\"\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    \"antagonistic claims\" are present between contending parties (along with other requirements). We discuss the first \"or\" in HRS \u00a7 632-1(b) in more detail in Section IV.C.3.d below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In any event, subsection (b) of HRS \u00a7 632-1 further provides that where another statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy must be followed. The subsection also clarifies, however, that if the other requirements for declaratory relief delineated in the statute are met, a party will not be prohibited from obtaining a declaratory judgment even if the actual or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy, an equitable remedy, or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether or not such a remedy is recognized by statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    HRS \u00a7 632-6 then provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    This chapter is declared to be remedial.

In addressing what constituted an \"actual controversy,\" the court stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    Against the validity of the statute it is urged that the occasion for judicial action cannot arise until a claim is made that an actual wrong has been done or is immediately threatened, and, moreover (what is much the same thing stated in another way), that a decision cannot properly be classed as a judgment, as strictly judicial act, unless, besides determining the merits of the controversy between the parties, deciding which is right, it affords (or denies) some additional remedy--in other words \"consequential relief\"--and therefore that power to decide a controversy in the absence of the conditions indicated is not judicial and cannot be conferred upon courts by the Legislature. This view appears to us to be unsound, and to be the result of confusing declaratory judgments with advisory opinions and decisions in moot cases, and perhaps also of an inclination to treat a general practice that has been long established as having acquired the force of a constitutional guaranty. A mere advisory opinion upon an abstract question is obviously not a judgment at all, since there are no parties to be bound, and the rights of no one are directly affected. The situation is substantially the same where opposing parties present a moot question--one the decision of which can have no practical effect. Where a judgment is sought of such character as to be of no benefit unless accompanied by an order the carrying out of which is impossible, the futility of the proceeding is a sufficient basis for a court's refusal to entertain it, whether or not jurisdiction to do so exists. But some judgments are wholly or in part self-operative. They perform a valuable function in and of themselves. It is often said that a cause of action arises only upon the breach of a duty--the invasion of a right. This, however, is merely the announcement of a general rule of practice subject to possible exceptions and to legislative change....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20P.%2082\">\n     201 P. at 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Thus, the Kansas Supreme Court indicated that an \"actual controversy\" under the Kansas declaratory judgment act (which Hawai'i copied in its entirety) did not require additional\n    \"consequential relief,\" but could not be an \"advisory opinion\" upon an abstract question or that involved a \"moot\" case, for which a declaratory judgment would have no practical effect. Therefore, at the time of the enactment of Hawai'i's declaratory judgment act, it appears an \"actual controversy\" was one that that did not lack justiciability based on the \"advisory opinion\" prohibition or \"mootness\" prongs of justiciability concerns. Much later, in\n    <em>\n     Life of the Land II\n    </em>\n    , we indicated that an \"actual controversy\" was one that generally satisfied prudential rules of self-governance, including \"standing.\"\n    <em>\n     Life of the Land II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8828640\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/63/166/#p172\">\n     63 Haw. at 171-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20P.2d%20431\">\n     623 P.2d at 437-42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Accordingly, the first prong of HRS \u00a7 632-1(b) allowing for declaratory relief in a case of \"actual controversy\" between contending parties merely mandates that prudential requirements, including standing, be satisfied, but does not set out any actual standing requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    In the second prong of HRS \u00a7 632-1(b), however, the legislature has expressed its policy and has expressed its view regarding the \"proper - and properly limited - role of [our] courts\" - by providing that a party has standing to bring an action for declaratory relief in a civil case (1) where antagonistic claims exist between the parties (i) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or (ii) where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    The Chief Justice's Dissent acknowledges that \"[w]hen the bill that enacted HRS \u00a7\u00a7 632-1 and 632-6 was first introduced in 1921, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary explained that its purpose was to provide 'parties in dispute' a judicial determination of rights 'before a cause of action accrues by breach of such rights by either party.' \" Dissenting Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J. (citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 263, in 1921 Senate Journal, at 616). Consistent with this purpose, the plain language of HRS \u00a7 632-1 does not require satisfaction of a three-part \"injury in fact\" test for a party to have standing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     35\n    </footnotemark>\n    Imposition of this additional requirement when standing requirements of HRS \u00a7 632-1 have otherwise been met limits the availability of declaratory relief in our state courts. Thus, imposition of an additional \"injury in fact\" requirement contravenes the legislature's specific declaration of policy regarding HRS \u00a7 632-1 standing as well as its general declaration of policy under HRS \u00a7 632-6 that Chapter 632 \"be liberally interpreted and administered, with a view to making the courts more serviceable to the people.\" Requiring satisfaction of an additional \"injury in fact\" test for standing under HRS \u00a7 632-1 contravenes prudential considerations of the \"proper - and properly limited - role of courts.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    To summarize, restricting standing by imposing standing requirements that do not exist in the language of HRS \u00a7 632-1, despite the express intent of the legislature, is antithetical to prudential considerations.

The common law three-part \"injury in fact\" test is simply inconsistent with HRS Chapter 632. For example, the first prong of the three-part \"injury in fact\" test for standing requires a showing that \"the plaintiff has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.\" This is a greater showing than required by HRS \u00a7 632-1(b), which does not require an \"actual or threatened injury.\" The second prong of the three-part \"injury in fact\" test requires a showing that \"the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions,\" a requirement that also does not exist under the language of HRS \u00a7 632-1(b). The third prong of the \"injury in fact\" test is also more stringent, as it requires a showing that \"a favorable decision would likely provide relief for the plaintiff's injury,\" rather than a showing that a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy. The third prong also clearly violates the language of HRS \u00a7 632-1(a), which provides that declaratory relief may be sought whether or not consequential relief could be claimed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     37\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Finally, our holding regarding the requirements for standing under HRS \u00a7 632-1 is consistent with the \"less stringent requirements for access and participation in the court process\" under HRS \u00a7 632-1, and recognizes that \"[o]ur touchstone remains the 'needs of justice.' \"\n    <em>\n     Life of the Land II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8828640\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/63/166/#p172\">\n     63 Haw. at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20P.2d%20431\">\n     623 P.2d at 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted).\n    <footnotemark>\n     38\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    <strong>\n     e.

Whether subsection (c) requires a calculation of actual costs, when viewed in isolation, is ambiguous. However, when viewed in context with the rest of the statute, the scope of subsection (c) becomes clear. Nothing in the remaining portions of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 suggests a requirement to engage in such a calculation and reimbursement. There is no language in the statute that establishes a procedure for remitting the funds in excess of the State's withholding. Beyond stating that \"[a]mounts retained shall be general fund realizations of the State[,]\" the text of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 does not contemplate any other manner of the disposition of the 10% deduction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    The language of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 expressly requires that the State retain 10% of the surcharge proceeds, and a literal application of the statute's language does not produce an absurd or unjust result. HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(a) provides that the State \"shall deduct ten per cent ... to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment....\" Subsections (b) and (d) prescribe the timing and payment of the surcharge balance to the counties, and (c) explains the broad range of costs contemplated by the legislature in determining that 10% was an appropriate retention. This construction of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(a) does not render the remaining subsections superfluous, void, or insignificant, as contended by Tax Foundation. Nor is this application of the language clearly inconsistent with the purpose of reimbursing the State for the costs of assessment, collection, disposition, and oversight of the county surcharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The legislative history of Act 247 also supports the interpretation that HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 requires the State to retain 10% of surcharge proceeds. Prior to its final amendment in conference committee, the bill that eventually became HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(a) contained the following language regarding the State's retention of costs:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n    [T]he director of finance\n    <em>\n     shall retain, from time to time, sufficient amounts\n    </em>\n    to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the county surcharge on state tax incurred by the State ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    H.B. 1309, H.D. 2, S.D. 2, 23rd Leg., Reg.

The State's legitimate interest is in reimbursing itself for the costs incurred in its administration of the surcharge. The State's 10% retention of the surcharge's gross proceeds is rationally related to this interest because in 2005, it was uncertain what the potential burden of the surcharge's administration would be, and it was reasonable for the State to estimate administration costs at 10% of the surcharge's gross proceeds. The purpose of the 10% retention under HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(a), to reimburse the State for its costs, was served because costs were incurred as a result of administering the surcharge. Beyond this stated purpose, it is also rational for Honolulu taxpayers to bear an increased tax burden to further a state interest in mitigating increased burdens on State services incurred by State agencies due to the implementation of the mass transit rail system, the use and benefit of which the City and County of Honolulu alone receives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Accordingly, the State's retention of 10% of the surcharge's gross proceeds has a rational relation to the purpose of reimbursing the State for the cost of administering the surcharge.

Any county that does so is subject to a withholding by the State of 10% of the gross proceeds of the surcharge as provided in HRS \u00a7 248-2.6. The fact that the City and County of Honolulu is the only county that has adopted the surcharge does not change the fact that HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 applies uniformly to all Hawai'i taxpayers who live in counties that have opted in and adopted the surcharge. Whether the statute requires the State to retain 10% of the surcharge's gross proceeds or retain only its actual costs similarly does not change the fact that each county is treated the same with respect to the disposition of those proceeds.

In addition to paying general excise and use taxes at a 4% rate to the State, Tax Foundation pays the county surcharge at a rate of 0.5%. The State collects this surcharge, deposits it into a special fund, and, after deducting 10% of the gross proceeds, disburses the balance to the City and County of Honolulu. HRS \u00a7 248-2.6(a) (1993 &amp; Supp. 2005). Tax Foundation alleges that \"the bulk of the 10% retained by the State\" exceeds the State's costs of administrating the county surcharge. Thus, according to Tax Foundation, the excess portion of the 10% is retained and diverted illegally.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Second, Tax Foundation has alleged future pecuniary loss. Tax Foundation contends that, if permitted, the State's continued retention of the 10% of gross proceeds from the surcharge will result in an increased tax burden for Honolulu taxpayers, including Tax Foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    This case is unlike\n    <em>\n     Iuli v.

While the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Iuli\n    </em>\n    challenged a government contract as illegal and stated that their taxes had increased, they nonetheless admitted that they were unsure whether the challenged contract caused the increase in taxes, and that they suffered no cognizable loss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20P.2d%20653\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Here, in contrast, a direct link may be drawn between the rail surcharge and an impact on Honolulu taxpayers. Tax Foundation argues that \"the State has created a vicious cycle: the more it diverts, the less the City receives, the longer the GET surcharge is needed; the more the taxpayers must pay.\" In other words, a portion of the surcharge is withheld by the State. If not withheld, these funds would be returned to the City and used to fund the rail project. It is thus reasonably likely that withholding this portion of the surcharge would cause a reduction in the proceeds available to the City and County of Honolulu, which would accordingly increase the overall tax burden for Honolulu taxpayers, including Tax Foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    Given this set of facts, Tax Foundation has sufficiently alleged an injury to its interests as a taxpayer and satisfied the elements of taxpayer standing. Tax Foundation established a \"personal stake\" in the controversy based on its interest as a taxpayer that pays the county surcharge and contributes to the general fund, and whose pecuniary interests are threatened by the State's continued retention of a portion of the surcharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    Such injury may be fairly traced to the State's actions in withholding a 10% portion of the rail surcharge from the City and County of Honolulu, and may be redressed by a favorable decision declaring the State's actions to be illegal, and ordering the State to return unlawfully withheld portions of the surcharge to the Honolulu government. Tax Foundation correctly observes that such a decision \"would provide more support to HART for the benefit of the City - to the relief of the affected taxpayers.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    Tax Foundation has thus alleged a threatened injury to its judicially cognizable interest in its capacity as a taxpayer, which is traceable to the State's actions, and likely to be redressed by declaratory and injunctive relief in its favor. Thus, Tax Foundation has standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Akau\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1433857\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/65/383/#p390\">\n     65 Haw. at 388, 390\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20P.2d%201130\">\n     652 P.2d at 1134, 1135\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding \"that a member of the public has standing to sue to enforce the rights of the public ... if he can show that he has suffered an injury in fact\" by \"demonstrat[ing] some injury to a recognized interest such as economic or aesthetic, and is\n    himself among the injured and not merely airing a political or intellectual grievance\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-249\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

The original \"Limitation on Actions\" section, which corresponds to HRS \u00a7 343-7 today, did not include any statements that could be construed to relate to standing for subsections (a) and (b), that is, judicial proceedings to challenge the lack of an EA or determinations regarding whether or not an EIS will be required. However, in the third subsection, concerning review of the \"acceptability\" of an EIS, the original law included the proviso that \"only\n    <em>\n     affected agencies\n    </em>\n    , or\n    <em>\n     persons who will be aggrieved\n    </em>\n    by a proposed action and who provided written comments to such a statement during the designated review period shall have\n    <em>\n     standing\n    </em>\n    to file suit.\" HRS \u00a7 343-6(c) (1976) (emphasis added) (current version at HRS \u00a7 343-7(c) (1993)). The report of the Senate Committee on Ecology, Environment and Recreation that considered the bill also demonstrates that the committee clearly viewed the \"Judicial Review\" section as dealing with standing concerns. Thus, the committee report described the effect of the amendment as \"provid[ing] a citizen\n    <em>\n     standing to sue\n    </em>\n    only when he has previously been involved in the public review process of the environmental impact statement and when his comments at that time dealt with the issues described in the suit,\" and also stated that \"[h]owever, his\n    <em>\n     standing\n    </em>\n    would be recognized after exhausting the existing remedies open to him as specified in Chapter 91.\" Sen. Comm. Rep. 956-74, in 1974 Senate Journal, at 1126-27.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n    Analogous sections regarding who may bring suit were added to subsections (a) and (b) in 1979, which allow pre-EIS challenges. Incidentally, at this time the legislature also eliminated the term \"standing to sue\" from Section 343-7(c), instead referring to those who \"shall be adjudged aggrieved parties\n    <em>\n     for the purpose of bringing judicial action under this subsection\n    </em>\n    .\" 1979 Haw. Sess. L. Act 197, \u00a7 8, at 412-13 (emphasis added). However, there is no relevant legislative history on these changes, as major changes of the 1979 law focused on other areas-the remainder being characterized by the Senate Committee Report as \"primarily housekeeping changes.\" Sen. Comm. Rep. 628, in 1979 Senate Journal, at 1264.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n    Therefore, although the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 343-7 is not particularly enlightening with respect to\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    standing requirements must be fulfilled in order for a party to bring judicial action under HEPA, the legislative history does clearly indicate that the subsection is directed at the question of standing to sue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-296\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 325 n.35,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260017\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/115/299/#p319\">\n     167 P.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    318 n.35 (first emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    Unlike the court in\n    <em>\n     Superferry I\n    </em>\n    , the Majority points to no actual language or legislative history of HRS \u00a7 632-1 indicating that it \"is directed at the question of standing to sue.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260017\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/115/299/#p319\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    This case also differs from\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     Asato\n    </em>\n    , which considered standing requirements in actions for declaratory relief pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-7.\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311352\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/132/333/\">\n     132 Hawai'i at 341-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311352\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/132/333/\">\n     322 P.3d at 236-40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Removal of this requirement in actions for declaratory relief marks a departure from a long history of judicial intervention only in justiciable controversies that are presented in an adversary context.

On motion by the State, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) dismissed Tax Foundation's complaint, ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the dispute pursuant to HRS \u00a7 632-1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-338\">\n    We are faced with the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the circuit court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the present case; (2) whether Tax Foundation demonstrated that it had standing to challenge the State's administration of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 ; (3) whether the State violated HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 in retaining 10% of the surcharge proceeds as reimbursement for the costs of administering the surcharge on the City's behalf; and (4) whether the State's implementation of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6 was unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    I join the Majority in its threshold holdings that: (1) Tax Foundation's requested relief does not constitute a tax refund claim; and (2) that HRS \u00a7 632-1 does not bar subject matter jurisdiction in this suit. Majority at Part I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    Justice McKenna, writing for the Majority on the issue of standing, next holds that Tax Foundation has standing under HRS \u00a7 632-1. Majority at Part II. I dissent from Part II, as I agree with the Chief Justice's dissent to the extent that the Chief Justice concludes HRS \u00a7 632-1 does not eliminate the requirement that a plaintiff establish an \"injury in fact\" in a declaratory judgment, and therefore does not establish a distinct test for standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-341\">\n    I disagree with the Chief Justice to the limited extent that I believe that Tax Foundation did not raise taxpayer standing, and that the Chief Justice considers whether Tax Foundation has taxpayer standing\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    . I believe that the Chief Justice's\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    consideration of whether Tax Foundation possessed taxpayer standing is inappropriate for two reasons. First, I believe that\n    the Chief Justice's decision to address whether Tax Foundation possessed taxpayer standing\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    is inconsistent with our case law. This court has previously declined to entertain whether a plaintiff possesses standing as a taxpayer when the plaintiff does not expressly rely upon such a basis for standing. Second, I believe that by effectively raising an alternative theory of standing on Tax Foundation's behalf, the Chief Justice undermines the principle of party presentation that lies at the core of the adversarial process. Therefore, I write separately because, as Tax Foundation itself proffers no other basis for standing, I would hold that Tax Foundation has failed to establish that it has standing to challenge the State's implementation of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    Finally, the Majority addresses Tax Foundation's arguments on the merits. Majority at Part III. I cannot join the Majority's holding in Part III because as I believe Tax Foundation lacks standing, I would not reach the merits of Tax Foundation's arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    <strong>\n     I. DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    <strong>\n     A. This court should not\n     <em>\n      sua sponte\n     </em>\n     consider taxpayer standing.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    The State raised standing as an issue at trial and on appeal, but no party elected to raise taxpayer standing specifically. The Chief Justice nevertheless concludes that Tax Foundation \"directly invokes the principles of taxpayer standing,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    and proceeds to apply the two-part test\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    that governs whether an individual has standing as a taxpayer to the facts in this case. Dissenting Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J., at 7-9. The Chief Justice then determines that Tax Foundation satisfied both requirements, and thus, has taxpayer standing to challenge the State's application of HRS \u00a7 248-2.6. Dissenting Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J., at 7-11. I respectfully disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    I do not believe Tax Foundation effectively raised taxpayer standing. The Chief Justice points to statements made by Tax Foundation such as, \"as a taxpayer, [Tax Foundation is] continuously injured by the State[,]\" and \"[t]he Foundation has paid the Surcharge and is vitally invested in its proper use considering it will be continually taxed for the same until the rail project is finished.\" Dissenting Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J., at 7. However, this court has consistently declined to consider taxpayer standing as a basis for standing\n    <em>\n     where plaintiffs do not explicitly allege taxpayer standing\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    . Such an explicit allegation of taxpayer standing is absent here.
