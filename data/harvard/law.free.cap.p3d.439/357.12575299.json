We affirm, and state Warren's issues on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court err by denying Warren's motion to suppress evidence obtained in warrantless searches of her commercial kennel property?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2.

In August 2013, Warren submitted an Animal Control Business Kennel Application to Lincoln County in which she stated she would (1) hold dogs for sale or\n   exchange; (2) breed, buy, sell, or barter dogs for profit or compensation; and (3) buy or receive dogs, and thereafter exhibit or offer such animals for sale, trade, or barter. Warren's application indicated the kennel was already in operation, and she publicly advertised the location of her kennel and that it was open for business. Pursuant to the application process, Warren's property was inspected by Lincoln County in 2013, and she was issued a license to operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In 2016, Lincoln County Animal Control employee Wendy Anderson (Anderson) received a noise complaint regarding barking dogs on Warren's property. Anderson discovered that, despite expiration of Warren's kennel license in October 2015, Warren was apparently still operating a commercial kennel. Anderson contacted Warren and explained that a new kennel license needed to be obtained, which would require an inspection of her property pursuant to county ordinance, as had occurred in 2013. Warren agreed and scheduled an inspection with Anderson, pending which Anderson issued Warren a conditional kennel license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The purpose of these inspections is to ensure the kennel facility is suitable for the number of animals present, and is not creating a health risk. Lincoln County Ordinance 7.1.306. The inspections are not designed to be criminal investigations, and a prospective kennel licensee is free to decline an inspection, in which case the application for the license will not be processed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Ultimately, three inspections of Warren's property occurred in 2016. The first, on April 21, 2016, was scheduled with Warren and performed by Anderson and Kathi Hooper\n   (Hooper), Director of the Lincoln County Health Department. During the inspection, Hooper and Anderson followed Warren through her property and inspected those areas as directed by Warren, including rooms inside her home, a barn, a kennel located in the nearby woods, and a metal horse trailer. As Hooper would testify, during this inspection she observed more than fifty poodles with matted hair located in inadequately small areas for the size of the dogs, leaving her concerned for the health of the animals. After this inspection, Anderson attempted to bring Warren into compliance with licensing requirements, and requested that Warren produce rabies vaccinations certificates, by May 10, 2016, for her dogs that were over six months old. In response, Warren provided the Animal Control Office with 132 rabies vaccination certificates for her approximately fifty dogs, without identifying which certificate corresponded to each dog. After reviewing the certificates, the Animal Control Office determined that some certificates corresponded to animals no longer in Warren's possession, while there were no\n   certificates for some dogs that remained in her possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Because Warren had not timely provided satisfactory verification, Anderson wrote a letter on June 7, 2016, advising Warren that she had failed to satisfy the conditions of the conditional kennel license, and that her previous kennel license had expired on October 31, 2015, thus requiring her to submit a new kennel application for processing. Warren submitted a new application dated June 10, 2016, after which Hooper and Anderson scheduled another kennel inspection with Warren for June 30, 2016. Lincoln County Sheriff Roby Bowe (Sheriff Bowe) accompanied Hooper and Anderson on this inspection, pursuant to Hooper's practice of requesting law enforcement assistance to keep the peace if she believed an inspection could be contentious. During this inspection, Hooper and Anderson observed approximately fifty-nine dogs on the property, along with horses, donkeys, goats, chickens, and small birds. The inspection raised concerns by Hooper and Anderson about the health of the animals and the conditions of the facilities. Additionally, Warren could not provide appropriate vaccination records for her animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Acting on their concerns, Lincoln County Animal Control scheduled a third inspection with Warren for July 26, 2016, to be conducted by Dr. Melissa Genovese, a veterinarian, to further determine the health of the animals and the conditions of the facilities. Dr. Genovese was accompanied by a veterinary technician and Sheriff Bowe. After the inspection, Dr. Genovese recommended the animals be evaluated by the U.S. Humane Society, because, in her opinion, the animals were not receiving adequate care. There were approximately fifty-two dogs on the property, despite a limit of twenty dogs stated on Warren's license application; dogs were kept in stacked crates that were too small; dogs were housed inside Warren's residence in crates, inside a barn, inside the kennel in the woods, or locked inside a metal horse trailer, often in direct sunlight or exposed to eighty-five or ninety degree temperatures; dogs either had no access to food or water or were being fed cat food; and most dogs were either underweight or emaciated and had severe fur matting and ear or eye infections. There were also cats, goats, canaries, parakeets, and mules on Warren's property. The mules were underweight, had long, shaggy coats despite high temperatures, and their hooves were long and curved upwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After the inspection by Dr. Genovese on July 26, Sheriff Bowe asked Detective Dave Hall to investigate Warren for possible animal cruelty. Hall obtained reports from Hooper, Anderson, and Dr. Genovese concerning Warren's animals and facilities, and obtained a search warrant based on those reports. Detective Hall served the\n   search warrant on Warren's property on August 2, 2016. Warren's animals were seized the same day, and she was subsequently charged with seventeen felony and misdemeanor animal cruelty offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Warren moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the three 2016 searches of her property, arguing a warrant was required for each inspection. The District Court found Warren \"was operating a business that implicated public health and safety and the well-being of the animals being bought, sold, bred,\n   traded, or bartered,\" which was \"open to the public, the address was advertised to the public,\" and that Warren both initiated the inspections and controlled the areas inspected. The court concluded there was no search because Warren did not have an expectation of privacy in her commercial kennel operation that society would consider objectively reasonable, and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The case proceeded to trial. After voir dire, the State used a peremptory strike to remove Felipe Jara-Pereira, a Hispanic male, from the jury panel. The defense objected to the strike on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), as a violation of equal protection because Jara-Pereira was \"the one minority juror on the panel.\" The prosecutor responded that the strike was \"not anything to do with any sort of race or ethnic background,\" but, rather, because the prosecution \"didn't get to\" several of the jurors during questioning, it knew \"a little bit less\" about them, and thus had struck jurors it had not questioned, including Jara-Pereira, even though the prosecutor \"didn't have a lot of great concerns\" about anyone on the panel. The District Court overruled the objection, stating \"we have a female Defendant who is not Spanish,\" and thus, concluded no\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation had occurred. Both parties used all eight of their peremptory strikes. Trial proceeded and Warren was convicted of eight felony counts and one misdemeanor count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 At sentencing, a primary issue was the amount of restitution or costs owed by Warren to Lincoln County. The Lincoln County Animal Control shelter in Libby cared for Warren's animals for over ten months until they were healthy enough to be fostered or adopted. Extensive care was needed to bring the animals back to health, including veterinary care for ear infections, eye infections, urinary tract infections, giardia, worms, tooth removal, overgrown hooves, and tumor removal. Lincoln County was responsible for the care of sixty-seven dogs and six donkeys, which overwhelmed their facilities so that they could not conduct normal animal control activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The District Court found that Lincoln County was a victim that suffered pecuniary loss under \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, and calculated costs\n   according to Montana's Animal Cruelty statute, \u00a7 45-8-211(3), MCA. The court determined that Warren owed statutorily-imposed costs, including for veterinary care, food and supplies, excess hours worked by county employees, and travel costs. Also included were costs incurred for (1) contracted sheltering with Tobacco Valley Animal Shelter (TVAS), a private, non-profit shelter in Eureka that Lincoln County contracted with to shelter county animals; and (2) lost revenue, calculated as the difference between the 2016 and 2015 revenue for the ten-month period that Lincoln County cared for Warren's animals, because the County was \"unable to conduct normal animal control business, and the shelter, primarily [TVAS], was unable to take in or adopt out animals\" and thus could not earn revenue from adoption fees. The District Court sought clarification on the lost revenue amount during the hearing, and asked Hooper:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [The Court]: There's a contract amount which [Lincoln County] pays [TVAS] every month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Hooper]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [The Court]: Okay. Then there was added costs above and beyond the contract amount that you paid them, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Hooper]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The State originally sought a total of $ 72,109.00, but the court subtracted care for parakeets, which were not part of the animal cruelty case, and reduced the amount of lost revenue claimed, imposing a total of $ 67,432.42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Warren appeals her conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 \"We review a district court's denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court's findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the inspections at issue were administrative in nature because they were designed, and their primary purpose was, to enforce Lincoln County Ordinance 7.1.306, which serves an interest other than crime control: to ensure the safety and health of animals and the community at large by enforcing regulations related to dog breeders and dog kennels, such as the requirement for animal vaccinations. The inspections were conducted, first, pursuant to Warren's application for a commercial kennel license, and then, out of a rising concern for the health and wellbeing of the animals kenneled on Warren's property. A criminal search was later initiated by police after securing a warrant, illustrating the distinctive government purposes at work. As the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Administrative statutes and penal laws may have the same\n   <em>\n    ultimate\n   </em>\n   purpose of remedying [a major] social problem, but they have different subsidiary purposes and prescribe different methods of addressing the problem. An administrative statute establishes how a particular business in a closely regulated industry should be operated, setting forth rules to guide an operator's conduct of the business and allowing government officials to ensure that those rules are followed. Such a regulatory\n   approach contrasts with that of the penal laws, a major emphasis of which is the punishment of individuals for specific acts of behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/#p699\">\n    482 U.S. at 712-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/#p699\">\n    107 S.Ct. at 2649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 A closely regulated industry is one that has \" 'such a history of government oversight that no reasonable expectation of privacy, see\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

The ordinance also sets forth the scope of the inspection, limiting it to \"the intended facilities\" (meaning areas intended as kennels), and, accordingly, places the operator on notice as\n   to how to comply with the statute.

However, Warren made no effort to do so.

The District Court failed to do so here, making appellate review of the issue difficult. We again admonish trial courts to make a proper record in response to\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b639 As we did in\n   <em>\n    Barnaby\n   </em>\n   , we are here able to conduct a review of the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge upon an assessment of the record.\n   <em>\n    Barnaby\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 53-55. First, Warren's failure to respond to the State's race-neutral explanation leaves the record devoid of any effort to demonstrate the explanation was pretextual. Then, like the evidence we relied upon in\n   <em>\n    Barnaby\n   </em>\n   , the State's actions regarding other jurors bolsters its race-neutral explanation for its action regarding Jara-Pereira.\n   <em>\n    Barnaby\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 53. The State had eight peremptory challenges. It used its first four peremptory challenges to strike jurors it did not question, followed by using its sixth and seventh peremptory challenges to likewise strike jurors it had not questioned. The State used its fifth and eighth peremptory challenges to strike jurors it had questioned. Thus, out of its eight peremptory challenges, the State used six to strike jurors it had not questioned, including Jara-Pereira. Warren argues on appeal that the State's proffered explanation was\n   pretextual because three other jurors who were not questioned by the State were empaneled on the jury. However, two of those jurors were questioned by the defense, allowing the State to hear from them during voir dire. Thus, only one juror was empaneled who was not questioned by either the State or the defense. In light of the many jurors struck by the State who had not been questioned, and the fact that the State used all eight of its peremptory challenges, leaving only one juror on the jury who had not been questioned, we cannot conclude Warren carried her burden to demonstrate the State's explanation was pretextual and that it struck Jara-Pereira on racial grounds. We therefore conclude that the District Court reached the right result on the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, but for the wrong reason.\n   <em>\n    Parrish\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b640\n   <em>\n    3.

However, the Cruelty to Animals statute, \u00a7 45-8-211(3), MCA, under which Warren was charged, specifically addresses the costs to be imposed upon conviction of this offense. Thus, Warren is liable for these statutorily-imposed costs, rather than restitution imposed under the general sentencing provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 Generally, Warren argues she is not required to pay the $ 35,141.00 imposed for the costs of sheltering with TVAS, because this was a contracted cost that Lincoln County was obligated to pay in any event.

At sentencing, the State presented Hooper's signed affidavit testifying to the county's pecuniary loss. The loss did not include any of the volunteer time or the various\n   donations that included veterinary services, medical supplies, and food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b645 The contracted sheltering cost was a nuanced question. Hooper testified the total cost included sheltering in both Libby, at the Lincoln County Animal Control, and Eureka, at TVAS, because \"[i]t took two different shelters to house all the animals.\" While the Lincoln County Health Department has a contract with TVAS to shelter county animals, for which the County paid monthly, TVAS provided services in addition to those contemplated by the contract to care for Warren's animals during the subject ten-month period. As Hooper explained, \"I included the monthly contract costs for those two shelters, plus additional cost of care,\n   <em>\n    for hours over the contract\n   </em>\n   that were needed at those shelters.\" (emphasis added). Lincoln County paid the costs of these additional services, but as explained by Hooper, both shelters were filled to capacity with Warren's animals and were unable to shelter any other animals during the subject period, resulting in revenue loss at both facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lost revenue amount was included because the County was \"unable to conduct normal animal control business\" such as taking in and adopting out animals, and the shelters and employees' activities were otherwise consumed with caring for Warren's animals, causing them to lose revenue. Hooper testified that the lost revenue amount was calculated by a comparison between \"last year's revenue with this year's revenue for the same period\" resulting in a difference of $ 6,918.27. Moreover, neither Lincoln County nor TVAS earned any profit from caring for Warren's animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b646 We conclude that the costs approved by the District Court were reasonably supported by the evidence. The shelters were literally overrun by Warren's numerous animals. We concur with the District Court that the costs imposed were tied to Warren's conduct in this case. Moreover, to the extent the lost revenue was arguably speculative, the District Court took Warren's objections into consideration and reduced the total amount claimed. Thus, we affirm the amount of statutory costs imposed by the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b647 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   DIRK M.
