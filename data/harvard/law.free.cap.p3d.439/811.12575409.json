We hold if a junior claimant files an application for excess proceeds resulting from a trustee's sale, and the superior court has reason to know a senior claimant may exist, the court may not issue an order releasing the proceeds until at least 180 days from the date the complaint is filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 33-812(G), (J). In so holding, we reject the argument that A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(J) imposes a 180-day deadline for applying for excess proceeds. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The Bekelians owned real property in Scottsdale. In 2003 and 2007, they executed deeds of trust against the property. Chase Bank is the beneficiary of the 2007 deed of trust. In November 2016, a trustee sold the property at a trustee's sale for $375,100 based on the 2003 deed of trust. After satisfaction of the debt owed to the foreclosing beneficiary and payment of the trustee's attorney's fees and costs, excess proceeds totaling $167,031.42 remained. At the time of the trustee's sale, Chase Bank's principal payoff balance was $220,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On January 9, 2017, the trustee deposited the excess proceeds with the county treasurer, filed a civil complaint, and was discharged from the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(C), (D). On July 10, 2017, the Bekelians applied for release of the excess proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(G). Approximately three weeks later, Chase Bank filed a response and separately applied for release of the excess proceeds, arguing that as the second lien holder it was entitled to the excess proceeds. In response, the Bekelians argued Chase Bank's application was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Chase Bank moved for entry of judgment. The parties stipulated to material facts, including that the complaint identified Chase Bank's second lien as having priority over the Bekelians' interest. The superior court awarded Chase Bank the excess proceeds, finding it timely responded to the Bekelians' application and had a superior claim to the proceeds. The Bekelians appealed, and we have jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Bekelians argue the superior court erred by releasing the excess proceeds to Chase Bank. They contend A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(J) establishes a 180-day deadline for applying for excess proceeds and any response. Accordingly, they argue they timely filed their application, while Chase Bank untimely filed its application and response. Therefore, the court should have awarded the Bekelians the excess proceeds. The text of\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812, however, does not support the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Statutory interpretation presents a question of law, which we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%20431\">\n    244 Ariz. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432, \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568013\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/215/#p216\">\n    420 P.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (App. 2018).

The Bekelians filed their application 182 calendar days after the trustee filed the complaint, which under their theory was the last possible day to file a claim because the 180th day was on Saturday.

We explained the deed of trust, which obligated the former owner to pay the property taxes, \"formed only a factual predicate for the action and was not its essential basis,\" that it was unnecessary to interpret the deed of trust to resolve the case, and that the essential basis of the dispute was the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(A)(3).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Likewise, the deed of trust here between Chase Bank and the Bekelians formed only a factual predicate for the action and is not its essential basis. Instead, the essential basis for the dispute is the interpretation of A.R.S. \u00a7 33-812(J) and whether Chase Bank or the Bekelians are entitled to the excess proceeds. We were not required to interpret the deed of trust, nor was the document a factor that caused the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keystone Floor &amp; More, LLC v. Ariz.
