Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Department filed a petition in dependency and neglect in April 2016. That same month, J.S.R. told the Department he had Cherokee heritage on his father's side. A month later, he told the trial court his father's lineage descended from a tribe in Arkansas, but he did not know which tribe. The Department did not notify any tribe or the BIA of the dependency and neglect proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Department filed a motion to terminate mother's, J.S.R.'s and S.B.-R.'s parental rights in November 2016. In December 2016, the Department sent notice of the termination proceeding to the three federally recognized Cherokee Tribes. Each of the tribes responded that A.R. was not a member or eligible for membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Department also notified the BIA. The notice stated that J.S.R. had indicated he had Cherokee heritage, but it did not mention his reported affiliation to an unknown tribe in Arkansas. The BIA replied that the notice indicated the child's possible tribal affiliation was Cherokee, the Certificate of Mailing showed the Cherokee Tribes had been notified, and the BIA does not research or determine tribal enrollment for tribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 The trial court terminated all three parents' parental rights in July 2017. Although the court held eight hearings in the eight months following the initiation of the termination proceeding in November 2016, it made no further inquiry regarding the children's possible Indian status at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 J.S.R. contends that the Department failed to comply with ICWA's notice requirements because it did not send notice to any tribes in Arkansas. We agree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 There are no federally recognized tribes with designated tribal agents in Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%204915\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 4915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -02 (Jan. 17, 2017). Nevertheless, J.S.R. contends that ICWA required the Department to research whether any federally recognized tribes are located at least partially in that state. In particular, he asserts that an investigation would have revealed that the Osage Nation, a federally recognized tribe with its designated tribal agent in Oklahoma, identifies its territory to include land in the state of Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Historic Preservation | Osage Nation (Apr. 9, 2018), https://perma.cc/C7V7-RN2M. (We note that J.R.'s opening brief characterizes Arkansas as included in \"Osage lands,\" while the website describes the area as part of its \"ancestral lands.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 ICWA does not, however, require courts or departments of human services to ferret out tribal connections from such vague information as the name of a state with no designated tribal agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Desiree F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525284\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/83/460/\">\n    83 Cal.App.4th 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20688\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695 (2000). Instead, that burden shifts to the BIA, which presumably has the resources and expertise necessary for the task.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20688\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2016 Guidelines, p. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 But the notice in this case did not alert the BIA that J.S.R. had reported a tribal connection to Arkansas. This omission frustrated the BIA's ability to fully discharge its responsibility under ICWA to identify potentially relevant tribes. Therefore, we must remand the case to the trial court to ensure compliance with ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IV. Remand Instructions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 On remand, the trial court shall direct the Department to (1) procure the appearance of all the parents, if possible, so that the court may inquire of each of them on the record and (2) inquire of such persons with whom it has contact who may have knowledge of the children's possible Native American ancestry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 The court shall then hold a hearing and ask the participants to state on the record whether they know or have reason to know or reason to believe that any of the children is an Indian child.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.107\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2016 Guidelines, p. 11; \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(b).

The appeal shall then be recertified to permit a division of this court to issue an opinion vacating the termination judgment as to the Indian child or children and remanding the case to the trial court with directions to proceed in accordance with ICWA as to that child or children. The appeal shall be recertified as to any non-Indian children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 If the trial court determines none of the children is an Indian child, within 7 days of issuance of the trial court's order making such determination, the Department must file notice with this court along with a copy of the trial court's order, and the appeal shall be recertified. A supplemental record consisting of the court record created on remand, including the trial court's order, is due 14 days after recertification. However, within 7 days of the matter being recertified, if any party wishes to supplement the record with transcripts of hearings that occurred on remand, that party must file a supplemental designation of transcripts with the trial court and this court. If supplemental transcripts are designated, the complete supplemental record, including the court record, will be due 21 days after the filing of the supplemental designation of transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 Within 14 days of the filing of the supplemental record, any parent may file a supplemental brief, not to exceed 3500 words, limited to addressing the trial court's ICWA determination. If M.B.-R.'s father, although not currently a party to this appeal, wishes to file a brief addressing the ICWA determination, he may do so, but his brief must be accompanied by a notice of appeal indicating his intent to appeal the ICWA determination. Within 14 days of any supplemental brief by a parent, any other party may file supplemental response brief not to exceed 3500 words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 This court further orders that the Department notify this court in writing of the status of the trial court proceedings in the event that this matter is not concluded within 28 days from the date of this order, and that the Department shall do so every 28 days thereafter until the trial court issues its order on remand.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
