We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the 2009 version of the Montana Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA) confers a private right of action.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On August 13, 2010, the Somers purchased a mobile home for $ 54,300 from Cherry Creek Development, Inc. (Cherry Creek) in Billings, Montana. The Somers paid $ 4,344 down and financed the remainder through an installment contract assigned to RJC Investment, Inc. (RJC Investment). The installment contract required the Somers to make monthly payments of $ 552 over a fifteen-year\n   period and to pay a $ 50 late fee for any late payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Prior to any default action filed against them, the Somers filed a putative class action in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment for themselves and all others similarly situated that the Montana Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA), \u00a7 31-1-201,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , MCA (2009), barred Cherry Creek and RJC Investment from recovery of any interest, finance charges, or late charges on installment contracts for the purchase of a manufactured home. Cherry Creek and RJC Investment answered and counterclaimed alleging the Somers defaulted on the installment contract. Cherry Creek and RJC Investment and the Somers filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On May 16, 2017, the District Court granted summary judgment to Cherry Creek and RJC Investment on the basis that RISA did not confer a private cause of action, but did not rule on Cherry Creek and RJC Investment's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On June 20, 2017, the Somers filed a M. R. Civ. P. 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the District Court denied on the basis that no unresolved claims existed and RISA did not confer a private cause of action. On October 19, 2017, Cherry Creek and RJC Investment and the Somers filed a joint motion to dismiss Cherry Creek and RJC Investment's counterclaim against the Somers. The Somers had become current on their payments to Cherry Creek and RJC Investment and were no longer in default. However, Cherry Creek and RJC Investment reserved the right to pursue new litigation against the Somers should they default in the future. The parties further requested that the District Court delay entry of judgment two months for the parties to discuss potential resolution. The parties did not resolve the matter, and on June 18, 2018, the District Court entered a final judgment granting summary judgment to Cherry Creek and RJC Investment.

The Somers argue they have a private cause of action under RISA, \u00a7 31-1-203, MCA (2009), barring Cherry Creek and RJC Investment from recovery of any finance, delinquency, or collection charge on the installment contract. In the alternative, the Somers argue for the first time on appeal that it is not necessary to find a private right of action under RISA, because the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, \u00a7 27-8-102, MCA, provides a private cause of action for determination of rights under a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 \"It is well established that laws existing at the time a contract is formed become part of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Earls v.

Therefore, the \"question of whether a statute creates a private cause of action by implication is a matter of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31. In\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , this Court developed a four-factor test (\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   test) to determine whether a statutory scheme confers a private cause of action. The\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   test leads this Court to determine whether the Somers' interpretation of RISA: (1) is consistent with RISA as a whole; (2) reflects legislative intent considering the plain language of \u00a7 31-1-203, MCA (2009); (3) is reasonable and avoids an absurd result; and (4) is consistent with the Department of Administration's (Department) construction of RISA, should one exist.\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 ;\n   <em>\n    Mark Ibsen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 First, the interpretation that RISA conveys a private right of action is not consistent with this Court's reading of RISA as a whole. The purpose of RISA was to establish an administrative process through which to protect retail buyers from holders of retail installment contracts not in compliance with the provisions of the Act. RISA authorizes the Department to: \"adopt rules necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of [RISA]\"; to investigate those \"it considers necessary\" to ensure compliance with RISA; to require licensure to engage in the business of a sales finance company in Montana; and to deny, suspend, or revoke licenses for \"failure to comply with any provision of this part relating to retail installment contracts,\" \"defrauding any retail buyer to the buyer's damage,\" or fraudulent misrepresentation. Sections 31-1-211, -212(1), -221, -222(1), MCA (2009). RISA requires the Department to enforce its provisions, not private parties. The Somers' argument does not pass the first prong\n   of the\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Second, the plain language of \u00a7 31-1-203, MCA (2009), does not reflect legislative intent to confer a private right of action. While the Somers argue that the plain language of \u00a7 31-1-203(4), MCA, creates a private right of action, the Somers cite the 2017 version of RISA. The 2009 version of RISA controls and does not contain this provision. Section 31-1-203(2), MCA (2009), states: \"Any person violating 31-1-231 through 31-1-243, except as the result of an accidental and bona fide error of computation, shall be barred from recovery of any finance, delinquency, or collection charge on the contract.\" A plain reading of this provision does not expressly indicate the Legislature's intent to include a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 The Somers argue that the purpose of RISA is to protect consumers, and that this Court has previously held that \"under certain limited circumstances,\" the plain language of a statute can support the conclusion that an implied private right of action exists when the statute \"has granted a class of persons certain rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 31, 37 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780023\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/677/#p717\">\n    441 U.S. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780023\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/677/#p717\">\n    99 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1956 ). \"[T]he [L]egislature would not enact a remedial statute granting rights to an identifiable class without enabling members of that class to enforce those rights. Without an implicit creation of a remedy, the statute is meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 RISA, however, does not grant a class of persons certain rights. RISA is an administrative statute authorizing the Department to enforce its provisions. Retail buyers are not left without a remedy under this Court's interpretation of RISA. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-212(2), MCA, a \"retail buyer having reason to believe that this part relating to the buyer's retail installment contract has been violated may file with the [D]epartment a written complaint setting forth the details of the alleged violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , this Court found the inclusion of an attorney fees provision in the Montana Consumer Loan Act (CLA), Title 32, Chapter 5, MCA, indicative of legislative intent to allow for an implied private right of action.\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43. This Court held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the express language allowing the prevailing party to recover attorney fees 'in any action on a contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of the [CLA]' so long as such an award is provided for in the parties' contract, is in accord with the ... conclusion that an implied right of action is consistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43 (citing \u00a7 32-5-407(1), MCA ). RISA contains no such attorney fee recovery provision. Accordingly, this Court finds no\n   express or implied private right of action based on a plain reading of RISA. The Somers' argument does not pass the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 Third, this Court agrees with the District Court's finding that vesting the cause of action solely in the Department to bar sellers from collecting finance charges is not an absurd result. While this Court has held that the enactment of a remedial statute granting rights to an identifiable class without enabling members of that class to enforce those rights is an absurd result, such is not the case here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37 ;\n   <em>\n    Mark Ibsen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33. As stated above, RISA is an administrative statute through which retail buyers may complain to the Department when holders of\n   retail installment contracts violate provisions of RISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31-1-212(2), MCA. Expansion of this Court's interpretation of RISA to include a private right of action \"is neither reasonable nor required to avoid absurd results.\"\n   <em>\n    Mark Ibsen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48. The Somers' argument fails the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Finally, the legislative history under RISA is sparse and does not provide clear guidance as to whether the Department itself placed a construction on the statute. Nevertheless, the Legislature's intent to grant authority to the Department to carry out the intent of RISA is express and persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 The Somers are not entitled to obtain private enforcement of RISA because a plain reading of RISA supports the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend RISA to be enforceable by private parties. Rather, the Legislature intended the statute to be enforced administratively by the Department. Because this Court agrees that no genuine issue of material fact exists and Cherry Creek and RJC Investment are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Cherry Creek and RJC Investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 Moreover, this Court will not address the propriety of whether a declaratory judgment action may be used to determine the existence of a potential contract defense. This issue was not raised below and the District Court had no opportunity to address the issue. The Court declines to address a new legal theory raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

They argued that RISA conferred a private cause of action and Cherry Creek and RJC Investment violated provisions of RISA. Accordingly, the District Court addressed those arguments. The Somers now argue on appeal that the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, \u00a7 27-8-102, MCA, entitles them to a declaratory judgment assessing the validity of a defense even before an affirmative action has been filed. This argument was not raised below and will not be addressed here.
