We affirm the superior court's judgment but strike its imposition of Rule 77(h) sanctions against Keeling because the method used to determine whether such sanctions were appropriate was inconsistent with the rule's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The Apodaca family-Jesus Apodaca, Sr.; Christina Flores De Apodaca; Jesus Apodaca, Jr.;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Maria Jose Apodaca Flores\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -suffered injuries when Keeling rear-ended their car, and they jointly sued Keeling in a tort action. After a compulsory arbitration hearing, an arbitrator awarded damages of $33,198.90 to Jesus, Sr.; $27,439.50 to Christina; $19,478.00 to Jesus, Jr.; and $16,492.00 to Maria. The arbitrator also awarded $510.78 in taxable costs, for a total arbitration award of $97,119.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Keeling appealed the arbitration award to the superior court under Rule 77(a), and in the ensuing trial de novo admitted liability but contested damages. The jury awarded $27,739.00 to Jesus Sr.; $19,939.00 to Christina; $10,418.00 to Jesus, Jr.; and $7,392.00 to Maria. The superior court awarded the Apodacas, as the prevailing parties, their taxable costs of $7,529.73, bringing their total award to $73,017.73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The Apodacas subsequently moved for sanctions under Rule 77(h), asserting that Keeling's appeal did not result in \"a verdict 23% more favorable than the arbitration awards with regards to [Jesus, Sr.] and [Christina].\" Keeling promptly objected, arguing that Rule 77(h) sanctions are not determined by comparing the amounts awarded to each individual, but by comparing the arbitration award to the trial judgment. Because the trial judgment was 23% more favorable to Keeling than the arbitration award, she maintained that sanctions were inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Applying the Apodacas' proposed party-by-party analysis, the superior court found that Keeling did not meet Rule 77(h) 's 23% threshold to avoid sanctions as to Christina and Jesus, Sr. In reaching that determination, the court compared the jury verdict for Jesus, Sr. (plus costs)-$29,638.35-to his arbitration award (plus costs)-$33,326.59. The court performed the same computation for Christina-comparing her award on appeal (plus costs)-$21,824.00-to her arbitration award (plus costs)-$27,567.19. The court then entered a final judgment, which included the Apodacas' damages, taxable costs, and an award of $30,593.25 in Rule 77(h) sanctions in favor of Jesus, Sr. and Christina. The Rule 77(h) sanctions were comprised of expert witness fees, attorneys' fees, and taxable costs for the trial. Keeling timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Keeling challenges the superior court's award of Rule 77(h) sanctions. She contends that the court erred by separating the arbitration award and judgment \"into individual awards and judgments and bifurcating the Rule [77(h) ] comparison.\" We review a court's interpretation and application\n   of Rule 77 de novo.\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw v.

Rule 77(h). As used in Rule 77(h), the term \"arbitration award\" includes any awarded taxable costs and the term \"judgment\" includes the verdict obtained in the trial de novo and any taxable costs assessed as part of that judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vega v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186765\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/504/\">\n    199 Ariz. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507-08 \u00b6\u00b6 10-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186765\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/504/\">\n    19 P.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-49 (App. 2001) (discussing Rule 7(f) of the Uniform Rules of Procedure for Arbitration, the early progenitor of Rule 77(h) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Rule 77(h) 's plain language mandates that a trial court compare the \"judgment on the trial de novo\" to \"the arbitration award\" for purposes of determining Rule 77(h) sanctions. Here, the record reflects that the Apodacas filed a single complaint and brought their claims against Keeling in a single lawsuit. The arbitrator consequently issued a single arbitration award. Accordingly, after Keeling appealed that arbitration award, the superior court issued one judgment. Moreover, because Keeling did not contest liability in arbitration or at trial and the individual plaintiffs had no claims against the other plaintiffs, the only issue in both proceedings was damages. Under these circumstances, comparing the total arbitration award to the total judgment was the proper method to determine whether the result of the trial de novo was sufficiently more favorable than the arbitration award. Because the difference between the judgment and arbitration award was 24.8%, Keeling met the 23% threshold to avoid the award of sanctions. The trial court thus erred in finding that Keeling did not receive a sufficiently favorable judgment to avoid Rule 77(h) sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The Apodacas argue that the Rule 77(h) analysis \"should be done on a party-by-party basis.\" They rely on\n   <em>\n    Fisher v. Edgerton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033034\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/71/\">\n    236 Ariz. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033034\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/71/\">\n    336 P.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2014), for support. That decision is inapposite to the case before us, however.\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   held only that Rule 77 sanctions are appropriate between defendants when one defendant is seeking to shift liability to another defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033034\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/71/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 76 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033034\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/71/\">\n    336 P.3d at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The sole issue before us is whether Rule [77(h) ] applies between multiple defendants when the appealing defendant unsuccessfully tries to shift comparative fault to the appellee defendant at the trial de novo.\"). This case involves no liability shifting, only the determination of the amount of damages one defendant owes the plaintiffs. Thus, the proper analysis is to compare the total arbitration award and costs to the total judgment and costs on appeal. The trial court erred in failing to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's judgment but strike the sanctions pursuant to Rule 77, as identified in part 3 of that judgment.

As the prevailing party, however, she is entitled to costs incurred on appeal upon her compliance with ARCAP 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Keeling cites to Rule 77(f) in her appellate briefs, which was changed to Rule 77(h) in 2017.
