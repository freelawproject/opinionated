Father, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, kept the child on the reservation in South Dakota and refused to relinquish custody to Mother, who is not a member of the tribe. He unsuccessfully sought orders from the district court and the tribal court transferring jurisdiction over the custody matter to the tribal court. In October 2017, Father again moved the district court for an order relinquishing permanent child custody jurisdiction to the tribal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father claimed the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the custody matter by issuing emergency child custody and/or protection orders, and the district court should, therefore, relinquish jurisdiction to make permanent custody orders to the tribal court.

The State of Montana established Father's paternity and ordered him to pay child support but did not enter a custody order. The parties moved to Wyoming separately, with Mother living in Sheridan and Father living in Newcastle. They informally agreed that the child would reside with Mother and Father would be entitled to liberal visitation.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n    426 P.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] During a visit with Father in March 2012, the child became ill because a coin was lodged in her esophagus. The coin had to be surgically removed, and Mother agreed Father could keep the child in his care until she finished her medical treatment. However, Father refused to return the child to Mother after her treatment concluded. He alleged that Mother was abusing and/or neglecting the child, and reported his suspicions, apparently prompted by the coin incident, to the Department of Family Services (DFS). DFS determined, on April 13, 2012, that Father's allegation did not \"fall within the Department's guidelines ... or definitions of abuse and/or neglect,\" and closed the case. Despite DFS's conclusion, Father refused to return the child to Mother or to allow any contact between Mother and the child.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n    426 P.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] On July 1, 2013, Mother filed a petition in the Sheridan County district court to establish custody and visitation. The parties agreed to a temporary custody and visitation order, giving Father temporary custody of the child subject to Mother's visitation. Because of the child's young age and the amount of time she had been separated from Mother, the visitation schedule was graduated, starting with visitation supervised through the Court Appointed Special Advocate Program (CASA). Father, however, refused to comply with the visitation order, and, over time, Mother filed two motions for orders to show cause. The district court found Father in contempt of court each time and ordered him to comply with the visitation order and to pay Mother's attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n    426 P.3d at 833-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69] In 2014, Father moved with the child onto the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota. On February 25, 2014, Father filed a petition for temporary full custody of the child with the Children's Court of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court. He incorrectly alleged in his petition that legal custody of the child had not been established in the district court. After a hearing on April 22, 2014, the tribal court dismissed Father's petition for lack of jurisdiction because the custody action was pending in the Sheridan County district court and Mother was not a tribal member.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n    426 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   835 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] The district court scheduled a trial on Mother's petition to establish custody and visitation for February 6, 2015.

(ICWA). The four orders that he claims establish tribal court jurisdiction are: 1) a March 10, 2016 order recognizing the State of Wyoming had primary jurisdiction over the child's custody, but stating the tribal court could exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction over the child pursuant to the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(C) ; 2) a June 20, 2016 restraining order prohibiting Mother from contacting Father, going to his residence, or harassing him; 3) a November 3, 2016 order granting Father and Grandmother temporary custody under the PKPA so they could seek counseling for the child; and 4) a July 31, 2017 order dismissing Grandmother's motion for custody of the child and for a protection order to prevent Mother from contacting the child. Father also claims the district court should have given full faith and credit to a notice from the Tribal Chairman placing the child under the permanent protection of the tribe, as a ward of the tribe, in the care of Grandmother. The Tribal Chairman directed all tribal departments and agencies to protect the sanctity of Lakota families until the custody issue was resolved in tribal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b616] Before we address Father's arguments, we are compelled to note that Father presented an incomplete and inaccurate recitation of the proceedings from the tribal court. This is particularly troubling because Mother did not make an appearance in this appeal and, therefore, did not designate the parts of the record that would support an affirmance of the district court's decision. We are aware, from the record we reviewed in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. State, supra,\n   </em>\n   that the tribal court issued an order on May 29, 2017, dismissing the custody case with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction and directing Father not to file any additional petitions with the tribal court \"unless there is a substantial change of circumstances.\" The May 29, 2017 order has the same case number as the November 3, 2016 temporary custody order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b617] We described the tribal court proceedings, including the May 29, 2017 order, in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570243\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/830/#p833\">\n    426 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   835 n.5 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Dissatisfied with the custody and visitation rulings, [Father] filed several petitions seeking custody and/or protection orders in the tribal court. He first filed a petition seeking temporary custody in February 2014. Additional petitions followed after entry of the February 2015 custody order. The tribal court dismissed several of [Father's] petitions for lack of jurisdiction due to the Wyoming court proceedings. At other times, the tribal court claimed temporary emergency jurisdiction. The record does not contain the complete filings and dispositions for every filing, however, on May 29, 2017, the tribal court dismissed a petition for custody with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, and ordered [Father] to refrain from further filings. [Father] and [Grandmother] disobeyed this order and continued to file documents requesting protection orders from the tribal court to establish emergency custody of [the child].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b618] Father's argument in this appeal entirely omits the May 29, 2017 order, apparently because it directly contradicts his assertion that the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the custody matter through its emergency orders. The May 29, 2017 order was comprehensive, examining the ICWA; the PKPA; the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (codified in Wyoming at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2020-5-201\">\n    Wyo.

The tribal court concluded that the Sheridan County district court had continuing jurisdiction over the child's custody and the tribal court did not have jurisdiction. Other parts of the record lead us to believe that Father appealed the May 29, 2017 order to the tribal court of appeals. Father has not informed us that the tribal court of appeals has reversed the May 29, 2017 order, so we will keep that order in mind as we address Father's issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b619] Father maintains that, under the ICWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201911\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (d), the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the custody matter by issuing emergency orders and its orders are entitled to full faith and credit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Exclusive jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   An Indian tribe shall have jurisdiction exclusive as to any State over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe, except where such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the State by existing Federal law.

We, therefore, conclude the ICWA does not apply to the private custody dispute between Mother and Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b623] Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that the ICWA and the full faith and credit provision in \u00a7 1911(d) apply to this case, we would still reject Father's argument that the tribal court's emergency orders gave it jurisdiction to make permanent custody decisions regarding the child. As we explained above, Father references four orders in his argument that the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the child custody matter-the March 10, 2016 order; the June 20, 2016 order; the November 3, 2016 order; and the July 31, 2017 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b624] Two of the four orders (the June 20, 2016 order and the July 31, 2017 order) do not, in any way, support Father's argument that the tribal court acquired jurisdiction to make permanent custody decisions regarding the child by issuing emergency orders. The June 20, 2016 tribal court order\n   was a restraining order prohibiting Mother from contacting or harassing Father. It did not mention the child or the child custody matter at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b625] The July 31, 2017 order dismissed Grandmother's request for custody of the child and/or a protection order to prevent Mother from contacting the child. It referenced an earlier order \"dismissing the custody issue\" because the tribal court lacked jurisdiction, which was then on appeal to the tribal court of appeals (presumably the May 29, 2017 order). The tribal court said that \"insofar as the Petition seeks custody, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear such matters until the Court of Appeals rules on the Appeal already filed[.]\" Given the July 31, 2017 order expressly denied Grandmother's request for custody, it does not support Father's argument that the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the child custody matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b626] In the other two orders (the March 10, 2016 and the November 3, 2016 orders), the tribal court asserted temporary emergency jurisdiction over the child pursuant to the PKPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(C). Father claims the Wyoming district court was required to give full faith and credit, under ICWA \u00a7 1911(d), to the tribal court's emergency orders and those orders demonstrate the tribal court acquired jurisdiction to make permanent custody decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b627] The PKPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   The appropriate authorities of every State shall enforce according to its terms, and shall not modify ... any custody determination or visitation determination made consistently with the provisions of this section by a court of another State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n   </strong>\n   A child custody or visitation determination made by a court of a State is consistent with the provisions of this section only if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   such court has jurisdiction under the law of such State; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   one of the following conditions is met: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (C)\n   </strong>\n   the child is physically present in such State and (i) the child has been abandoned, or (ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child, a sibling, or parent of the child has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b628] According to the tribal court, the \"Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court of Appeals has ruled that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Courts are 'state courts' for purposes of the [PKPA] and are bound to recognize state court custody orders and are entitled to be recognized as 'state courts' for purposes of recognition and enforcement of its child custody orders.\" Under the PKPA, the state that initially determines child custody generally retains jurisdiction to modify its custody order.\n   <em>\n    Marquiss v.

In the March 10, 2016 order, the tribal court stated that the Wyoming district court retained primary jurisdiction over the custody matter. The tribal court's May 29, 2017 order, which bore the same case number as the November 3, 2016 temporary order, confirmed that the tribal court was bound to recognize the Wyoming custody order. The tribal court also stated that the PKPA prohibited it from modifying the permanent custody order unless the Wyoming court lost or relinquished jurisdiction. Therefore, the tribal court's assertion of emergency jurisdiction in its March 10, 2016 and November 3, 2016 orders did not affect the February 2015 Wyoming custody order or the Wyoming district court's continuing jurisdiction to make permanent custody determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b632] In a final argument based upon the ICWA, Father claims that the tribal court acquired jurisdiction over the custody matter because the child is a ward of the tribal court. His argument is based upon the part of \u00a7 1911(a) that states: \"Where an Indian child is a ward of a tribal court, the Indian tribe shall retain exclusive jurisdiction, notwithstanding the residence or domicile of the child.\" Father's argument that the child is a ward of the tribal court is apparently based upon the emergency orders discussed above and a November 29, 2017 notice from the Tribal Chairman stating that he was placing the child under permanent protection of the tribe, as a ward of the tribe, in the care of Grandmother. Father incorrectly suggests that the Tribal Chairman's notice is an order from the tribal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b633] Father does not direct us to any tribal court order making the child its ward. He also does not address the ramifications of the Tribal Chairman, rather than the tribal court, declaring the child a ward. We generally refuse to consider arguments not supported by cogent argument or citation to pertinent authority.\n   <em>\n    Whitham v.

Furthermore, the Tribal Chairman deferred to the tribal court when he directed all tribal departments and agencies to protect the sanctity of the Lakota family \"until this issue is resolved in Tribal court.\" Thus, even if the ICWA applied in this case (which it does not), Father has not demonstrated that the tribal court made the child a ward so as to affect the Wyoming district court's continuing jurisdiction to determine the child's permanent custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b634] The district court properly concluded that it retained exclusive continuing jurisdiction to make permanent custody determinations regarding the child.
