We consider whether the family court exceeded its statutory authority by appointing specific treatment professionals for the child here and otherwise limiting the parent's sole legal decision-making authority. We hold that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Paul E. (\"Father\") and Courtney F. (\"Mother\") have three children including L., who was born in 2007. Upon the parties' divorce in 2010, the family court awarded them joint legal decision-making authority with equal parenting time and, as relevant here, gave Father final legal decision-making authority concerning L.'s education and medical and dental care. Mother and Father have clashed on several parenting issues since their divorce, making their relationship, according to the family court, \"volatile and dysfunctional.\" The dispute here stems from the parties' handling of L.'s gender identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 According to Mother, L., who is biologically male, displayed an early interest in toys and clothes generally associated with girls. Mother fostered this interest and attempted to socially transition L. to identifying as female without Father's knowledge or any professional consultation, with sometimes negative consequences. For example, in February 2013, Mother subjected then-five-year-old L. to ridicule by permitting L. to wear a skirt and other articles of \"girl\" attire to school on \"free dress day\" and asking the teacher to \"encourage his classmates to accept him for who he is.\" According to Father, this incident was the first time he learned of L.'s interest in wearing skirts and the like. Father immediately sought professional assistance and, with Mother's agreement, he retained Diana Vigil, a licensed professional counselor, to counsel L. and advise the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During the months following the \"free dress day\" incident, Father and Mother parented L. differently concerning gender identification issues. The parties agreed with Vigil that L. would explore wearing clothing and playing with toys typically associated with girls in Mother's home but nowhere else. They also agreed to only speak with L. about gender issues in a clinical environment. Although Father abided by the agreement, Mother did not. For example, she referred to L. with female pronouns and permitted L. to appear in public wearing clothes generally worn by girls. Mother also spoke with L. about matters beyond L.'s ability to comprehend, such as sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy. Mother summed up the parties' situation in a September email to Father: \"We definitely disagree about how to handle [L.'s] gender variance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 After Father learned that Mother would not follow Vigil's advice, he petitioned the family court in December 2013 to grant him sole legal decision-making authority concerning all three children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-411(A). As relevant here, he asserted that Mother \"determined [L.] ha[d] gender dysphoria,\" despite having no such diagnosis, \"insist[ed] the child ... be treated as a girl, rather than as a boy, and ha[d] been ... pushing such behavior on [L.]\" At Father's request, the court immediately ordered Mother to temporarily remove girl-oriented toys from her house and refrain from, among other things, dressing L. in clothing generally worn by girls, referring to L. with feminine pronouns, and discussing gender-related issues with L. and the other children. Although the order\n   applied only to Mother, Father also followed it. The parties and L. refer to these restrictions as \"the Rule.\" The court also ordered diagnostic and custody evaluations and appointed a parenting coordinator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Father's petition remained pending, and the Rule remained in effect, for more than two years as the evaluations occurred. Multiple medical professionals diagnosed L. with gender dysphoria of childhood, which refers to children with \"a marked incongruence between the gender they have been assigned to (usually at birth, referred to as\n   <em>\n    natal gender\n   </em>\n   ) and their experienced/expressed gender.\" Am. Psychiatric Ass'n,\n   <em>\n    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    DSM-5\n   </em>\n   ) 453 (5th ed. 2013). These professionals disagreed, however, on how best to address the diagnosis with L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Meanwhile, L. struggled under the Rule. L. repeatedly asked for the return of \"girl's stuff,\" expressed anger over the Rule, and, under Mother's influence, blamed Father for its existence. One incident especially illustrates L.'s distress. In February 2015, more than a year after implementation of the Rule, L. reportedly told Mother, \"I want to die\" and would do so by hanging. L. had purportedly made similar statements about dying to Mother in the preceding days. Mother took L. to the hospital, where L. expressed a desire to die due to the Rule. Fortunately, there were no signs of self-harm, and L. did not relate any incidences of self-harm. Hospital staff initially placed L. on a waiting list for inpatient psychiatric care but, after conducting a second evaluation outside Mother's presence, they discharged L. to Father. Based on the suicide threats and her concern that the Rule was harming L., Mother unsuccessfully moved the court to vacate the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 As the trial date drew near, Dr. Paulette Selmi, a psychologist appointed as the custody evaluator, submitted a lengthy and comprehensive report. She concluded that joint legal decision-making would not be possible due to the parents' \"high level of conflict\" and recommended that one parent be given sole legal decision-making authority. She predicted that Father \"[would] make the more rational and responsible decisions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Despite the parents' conflicts, Dr. Selmi found L. to be \"a delightful, funny, bright, articulate, and charming young person.\" L. excelled in academics, and teachers reported that L. is very friendly, has \"a lot of friends and [is] happy,\" with no behavior problems. Similarly, Vigil, who had seen L. frequently for more than the preceding two years, described L. to Dr. Selmi as \"remarkably resilient, funny, kind, brilliant, outgoing, [and] creative\" and reported that L. \"gets along well with classmates and is well-adjusted\" in school. Dr. Selmi also found that L. has a \"positive and close relationship[ ]\" with both parents and is well-adjusted to home, school, and the community, although L. has been teased at school regarding gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Dr. Selmi made several recommendations regarding L.'s care. She suggested that Vigil continue to provide therapy to L. but refrain from advising the parties on co-parenting matters. Dr. Selmi stated that Vigil's therapy should be a \"safe haven,\" meaning that what transpires in therapy would not be shared with the parents, absent L.'s agreement, or used in litigation. She also recommended that the court continue the Rule's \"gag order\" prohibiting Mother from discussing gender issues with L. and suggested the court consider extending the order to Father so that L. could explore gender identity without parental pressure. Finally, Dr. Selmi recommended that a \"physician gender specialist ... follow [L.] along the way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The family court conducted a four-day trial in December 2015. The court accepted Father's agreement that if given sole legal decision-making authority, he would consult with Mother on all major decisions for the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-401(6) (\" 'Sole legal decision-making' means one parent has the legal right and responsibility to make major decisions for a child.\"). Thereafter, the court designated Father as the sole legal decision-maker for all three children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 25-403(A), -403.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Pursuant to \u00a7 25-410(A) and Arizona Rule of Family Law Procedure (\"ARFLP\") 95(A) (repealed 2018), and having L.'s \"best interests\" as its \"primary consideration,\" the court implemented many of Dr. Selmi's recommendations\n   as mandatory \"guidelines,\" which are at issue here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 A \"gender expert\" shall be appointed to provide input to the Court and guidance to the parties regarding gender identification issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Diana Vigil will continue as [L.'s] therapist and will operate on a \"safe haven\" basis.

The Rule is lifted as it relates to gender exploration by [L.] in Diana Vigil's office, Father's home and Mother's home. In all other places, it remains in effect.

It further ordered that no other clinician could evaluate or treat L. without Vigil's permission or court order. It also ruled that neither party could have access to Vigil's records and that Vigil could \"determine when and if to share or discuss an issue with the parents.\" The court authorized Vigil to confer with L.'s teachers and child care providers and examine L.'s school and medical records. The court stated that its order \"act[ed] as a release by the parents\" of all privileged information concerning L. and directed them to provide any releases requested by Vigil to obtain information. Finally, it stated that both Vigil and Dr. Ehrensaft would be \"cloaked with applicable judicial immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 The court of appeals vacated the family court's orders to the extent they infringed on Father's exercise of his sole legal decision-making authority concerning L.\n   <em>\n    Paul E. v.

In contrast, when, as here, the family court has awarded sole legal decision-making authority to a parent, if the other parent disagrees with the sole legal decision-maker on a major issue, the court may only intervene as authorized in \u00a7 25-410(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b628 We also disagree with the court of appeals that endangerment and significant emotional impairment, as used in \u00a7 25-410(A), means abuse or neglect, which implies wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paul E.\n   </em>\n   , 244 Ariz. at 55 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567423\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1045/#p1053\">\n    418 P.3d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating \u00a7 25-410(A) applies only when a specific limitation is \"necessary to prevent abuse or neglect\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Also, the case relied on by the court of appeals did not address \u00a7 25-410(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Egan v.

This provision will be triggered most often after the sole legal decision-maker has either actually exercised authority or has indicated he or she would do so in a way that would harm the child. For example, refusing to retain particular therapeutic services could justify an order requiring such services if refraining from doing so would endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional development. The limitation imposed can be a prohibition or a directive. But any limitation must be tailored to prevent or remedy the endangerment or impairment. The court must be mindful not to unnecessarily intrude on the sole legal decision-maker's unshared authority to make major decisions concerning the child's upbringing, even if those decisions conflict with expert opinion or the court's own views on childrearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 As for the orders here, the family court found that \"Father's approach [to gender dysphoria issues] [w]as generally reasonable\" and he \"appropriately sought out therapy for [L.] and followed the therapist's advice\" before issuance of the Rule. But Father's failure to \"actively encourage gender exploration in his home\" before the Rule, maintenance of a log documenting events bearing on L.'s gender identification, and \"view that [L.] might be 'in remission' during 2015\" indicated \"he may not be as open to allow exploration as the experts ... believe is appropriate.\" Addressing \u00a7 25-410(A), the court found that \"[L.'s] gender dysphoria diagnosis and the parents' response to it has already caused [L.] emotional harm\" and \"[w]hile Father may argue that Mother[ ]\" mainly inflicted that harm, \"Father was slow to accept the diagnosis, and has advocated a position that [L.] was in 'remission'-a position at odds with the experts.\" Thus, given the \"complexity of [L.'s] situation, the dynamics of the parties' relationship and the potential for harm if it is not managed correctly,\" the court found that L.'s \"physical health would be endangered and emotional development impaired\" if the court did not \"establish some [mandatory] guidelines for the parents in addressing [L.'s] situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 This order does not satisfy \u00a7 25-410(A) because it fails to focus on how Father's exercise of unchecked legal decision-making authority would place L. at risk for physical injury or significantly impair L.'s emotional development. The complexity of L.'s situation is not a basis alone for invoking \u00a7 25-410(A). Fit parents, like Father, frequently guide their children through complex situations without court interference. The \"dynamics of the parties' relationship\" does not suggest that Father will exercise his sole legal decision-making authority in a way that endangers or impairs L. And the potential for harm due to mismanaging the gender dysphoria diagnosis is not equivalent to finding that absent a specific limitation, L. would be put at risk for harm or suffer harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-410(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Mother has not pointed to any evidence, and we have not found any, supporting a finding that absent the mandatory \"guidelines\" imposed by the court, Father's exercise of decision-making authority would physically endanger L. or significantly impair L.'s emotional development. Father's past reluctance to accept L.'s diagnosis does not demonstrate he would fail to appropriately address that diagnosis in the future. Indeed, he has meaningfully addressed the diagnosis, and the evidence suggests he will continue to do so. For example, Father originally retained Vigil's services, maintained them throughout the court proceedings, followed her advice, and said he would both continue to pursue therapy for L. with Vigil or a future therapist and retain a gender expert. Before the court, Father expressed a willingness to allow L. to fully explore gender issues in his home and agreed with Dr. Selmi's recommendation that Father see a therapist to acquire \"psycho-educational approaches to learning about gender issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 None of the expert evidence supports a finding that Father's exercise of sole legal decision-making authority, absent the mandatory \"guidelines\" here, would harm L. According to Vigil, although Father was initially uncomfortable with L.'s gender dysphoria diagnosis, he came to be \"more accepting\" of it. Dr. Selmi reported she \"never viewed Father as an individual who will reject [L.] if [L.] decides to be a transfemale, gay, or straight, or something else.\" Although Dr. Selmi recommended many of the directives that comprised the court's appointment orders, she did not state that the failure to implement them would endanger or impair L. She also did not express doubt about Father's ability to make decisions concerning L.'s gender dysphoria. Indeed, she implicitly found Father's parenting skills sufficient, as she noted that Father has a \"positive and close relationship[ ]\" with L., who is \"well adjusted,\" and predicted that \"Father will make the more rational and reasonable decisions\" when making parenting decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 Even if the evidence showed that absent a specific limitation on Father's authority L. would be physically endangered or his emotional development would be significantly impaired, the family court failed to tailor each directive to prevent such harm. A hypothetical illustrates our point. If the evidence showed that L. would be placed at risk for physical danger or significantly impaired emotionally if Father chose not to maintain therapy for L. or consult with a gender expert, the court could compel therapy and consultation. But absent evidence demonstrating that Father would choose an unqualified or ineffective therapist or gender expert, \u00a7 25-410(A) did not authorize the court to select a specific therapist and expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 In short, although the court had concerns about Father's ability to successfully guide L. through gender dysphoria, Mother failed to show that Father's exercise of his sole legal decision-making authority would place L. at risk for physical injury or significantly impair L.'s emotional development without the court's appointment of specific treating professionals and attendant restrictions on Father's authority. Absent such evidence, \u00a7 25-410(A) did not authorize the court's appointment orders. The evidence supports findings implicit in the court's orders, however, that L. would be physically endangered or suffer significant emotional impairment if Father fails to maintain therapy for L. or retain a gender expert or if he declines to allow L. to gender explore. On remand, if the court makes any or all these findings, it may order Father to continue L.'s therapy, retain a gender expert, and/or permit L. to gender explore.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-410(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
