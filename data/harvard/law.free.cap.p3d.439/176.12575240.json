INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   This case requires us to consider a series of rulings by the trial court in a complex commercial dispute involving the sale of a limousine service. Goran and Ana Maria\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pleho purchased Resorts Limousine Services (RLS), a Kona-based business, from their acquaintance, Dragan Rnic, in 2005. David W. Lacy, Esq., of the firm Lacy &amp; Jackson LLLC (collectively, \"Lacy Parties\"), represented Goran and Maria in the transaction. At Lacy's recommendation, Goran and Maria formed a corporation, Goran Pleho, LLC (GPLLC), and the transaction was completed in GPLLC's name. Goran and Maria discovered problems with the business several months after the purchase. Goran and Maria, and GPLLC (collectively, \"Pleho Parties\"), brought the present action in the Circuit Court for the Third Circuit (circuit court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , alleging that Rnic and Lacy Parties intentionally misrepresented the value of RLS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Pleho Parties asserted numerous claims against the defendants, including fraud and legal malpractice, and they asked the court to rescind or reform the sale of RLS and award compensatory and punitive damages. Rnic counterclaimed for breach of contract\n   and other counts related to Pleho Parties' failure to make payments on the purchase price, and cross-claimed against Lacy Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After extensive pretrial motions and discovery, Rnic settled all claims with Lacy Parties and Pleho Parties. Additionally, the circuit court dismissed or granted summary judgment on most of Pleho Parties' claims against Lacy Parties prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Meanwhile, Goran and Maria filed for bankruptcy in Nevada, which led to a stay of the action in the circuit court for eleven months. Lacy Parties filed a motion in limine requesting that Pleho Parties be barred from presenting any evidence regarding their assets that conflicted with Goran and Maria's submissions in the bankruptcy proceeding, which the circuit court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At trial, the circuit court granted judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) against Pleho Parties on most remaining claims, and only their legal malpractice claim based on Lacy's representation of GPLLC went to the jury. The jury found Lacy Parties not liable by special verdict. The circuit court entered judgment against Pleho Parties on all counts, awarding attorney's fees and costs to Lacy Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) partially vacated the circuit court's judgment, finding that the circuit court had erroneously dismissed or granted summary judgment on Goran and Maria's claims as individuals for fraud, legal malpractice, and punitive damages. The ICA also vacated the circuit court's denial of the motion in limine, finding that Lacy Parties had demonstrated all of the elements of judicial estoppel. The ICA affirmed the circuit court's judgment in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their application for writ of certiorari, Pleho Parties argue that the ICA erred in failing to revive their remaining claims against Lacy Parties. These include claims by Goran and Maria, as individuals, for conspiracy to commit fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), and unfair and deceptive trade practices (UDAP); and claims by GPLLC for fraud and punitive damages. Pleho Parties also argue that the ICA erred when it vacated the trial court's order denying Lacy Parties' motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the dismissal of Goran and Maria's claims for IIED and NIED was in error, as they stated colorable claims on both counts. We also conclude that the grant of JMOL on GPLLC's claims for fraud and punitive damages was in error. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a reasonable jury could have returned a verdict in favor of Pleho Parties on these counts. We also conclude that the ICA erred in vacating the trial court's order denying Lacy Parties' motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, a majority of this court concludes that the grant of summary judgment as to Goran and Maria Pleho's UDAP claim was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We affirm the ICA on all remaining issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sale of RLS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the sale of RLS to GPLLC, Rnic signed an agreement in June 2005 with a third individual, Don Rullo, to sell RLS for $800,000 in cash. The sale did not close. Rullo, a real estate agent, was a client of Lacy's who consulted with him about business matters frequently, and Lacy testified that he represented Rullo in this potential transaction. Rnic testified that Rullo introduced him to Lacy.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-293\">\n    In Petitioners' application for writ of certiorari, Ana Maria Pleho is referred to as Maria. We adopt this naming convention throughout this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-294\">\n    The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Goran Pleho and Rnic met in Las Vegas in 2004, and Goran subsequently served as Rnic's realtor in a number of real estate purchases. Rnic told Goran about his intention to sell RLS. Goran testified that Rnic gave him financial documents detailing RLS's profits and losses; when Goran told Rnic that he did not understand the documents, Rnic said that they should consult \"David Lacy, the best attorney on the island.\" Goran and Maria met Lacy on July 11, 2005, where, according to Goran:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    Mr. Rnic introduced Mr. Lacy as his attorney, but he also introduced him as the best attorney on the island, and only he was the one capable of doing all the business transactions, very capable. And at that point I said, \"Well, okay. But that is your attorney, and if we are going to even consider this, I have to have my attorney to represent me.\" Rnic said, \"Well, then I don't need an attorney, and Mr. Lacy can be your attorney.\" And Mr. Lacy said, \"Well, I'm not sure I can do it. I got to think about it.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Lacy described his introduction to Goran as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    Dragan Rnic was trying to sell his limousine company to Don Rullo. Don Rullo introduced Dragan Rnic to me. That fell through. And some, a week, five days, I forget what it was after that, Dragan brought Goran to my office. And I met him. And then they had all the terms and conditions of the deal that they had agreed to. And so I agreed to do the paperwork on behalf of Mr. Pleho as an LLC.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    [T]hey both came in and had agreed upon the terms and conditions of the sale, and I think I told 'em they needed lawyers. Mr. Rnic said he didn't, and I should just be Mr. Pleho's lawyer. And then after thinking about it and I guess I talked to [Lacy's partner] Kim [Jackson], I agreed to be his lawyer, if he wanted me to.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Lacy agreed to represent Goran in the transaction, and referred Goran to a certified public accountant (CPA) to obtain an appraisal of RLS. However, the CPA told Goran that he was not available to do the appraisal. Goran testified that he expressed concern about proceeding with the sale without an appraisal at his next meeting with Rnic and Lacy on July 19, 2005:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    So I said, \"I can't go forward with this. I need an appraisal. I need to see what is this company's worth.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    And Mr. Rnic said, \"Well, what do you mean? This is a unique company, only one of this kind. There's nobody to appraise this company. It's worth $2 million, and $1.5 is just a great price.\" And Mr. Lacy repeated the same thing to me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Goran testified that he and Lacy went over hundreds of documents provided by Rnic pertaining to RLS's finances, and that Lacy assured him that the \"financials\" were \"satisfactory.\" Lacy testified that he \"would never tell any client that his business was unique and could not be appraised.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Lacy recommended that Goran form a limited liability company to purchase RLS, and on July 25, 2005, Goran executed GPLLC's incorporation documents, which Lacy drafted. Goran was GPLLC's sole member at the time of incorporation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Also on July 25, 2005, Rnic and GPLLC executed a Sale of Assets Agreement (Sale Agreement), by which Rnic sold RLS to GPLLC for a price of $1,500,000. As a down payment, Goran and Maria agreed to transfer three Las Vegas properties worth approximately $378,000 to Rnic, with the rest of the sale price to be paid back by GPLLC in monthly installments based on the gross income of RLS. The agreement provided that closing would take place upon the transfer of Rnic's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) license to GPLLC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    That same day, GPLLC executed a $1,122,000 promissory note in favor of Rnic and a Management Services Agreement, whereby GPLLC agreed to manage and operate RLS until the transfer of Rnic's PUC license. Lacy prepared the Sale Agreement, the promissory note, and the Management Services Agreement. He also prepared a limited power of attorney allowing GPLLC to manage RLS on Rnic's behalf before the PUC license was transferred to GPLLC, and a warranty bill of sale, both executed on July 25, 2005. Although the Sale Agreement provided that closing would occur once the PUC license was transferred, the bill of sale was transferred to GPLLC that same day.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    After July 25, 2005, Goran and Maria received some training from RLS employees and began running the business. Goran testified that in November 2005, he received a phone call about RLS from a friend, who informed him that \"the numbers were altered before it was sold.\" Goran testified that he subsequently met with Lacy several times and told him that \"this surely looks like\n    fraud,\" but Lacy downplayed Goran's concern and advised him to wait for the completion of the PUC license transfer before taking any action \"as far as fraud.\" According to Lacy's notes from a February 14, 2006 meeting with Goran, \"Mr. Pleho wanted to wait until he had the [PUC] license and then approach Mr. Rnic and try and resolve the problems....\" Rnic's PUC license was transferred to GPLLC on March 10, 2006.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Circuit Court Proceedings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Pretrial\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Pleho Parties filed a complaint on July 6, 2006, naming Rnic and Lacy Parties as defendants. Pleho Parties asserted that they had purchased RLS for a price \"far in excess of the actual fair market value\" based on fraudulent information from Rnic. The complaint alleged that Lacy Parties had:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    failed, refused, and/or neglected to properly advise and assist [Pleho Parties] on the transaction and to safeguard them against the unconscionable terms of the agreement ultimately entered and, in fact, drafted the terms adverse to the interests of [Pleho Parties].... Further, [Lacy Parties] continued to represent [Pleho Parties] subsequent to the initial transaction and failed, refused, and/or neglected to take timely and appropriate action to foreclose or mitigate harm to [Pleho Parties] once the fraudulent conduct of [Rnic] was discovered.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Pleho Parties twice amended their complaint, which ultimately included the following counts against Rnic and Lacy Parties: (I) conspiracy to commit fraud; (II) fraud; (III) fraud in the inducement; (IV) gross inadequacy of consideration; (V) IIED; (VI) NIED; (VII) UDAP; (VIII) legal malpractice (against Lacy Parties alone); (IX) intentional spoilation of evidence; (X) negligent spoilation of evidence; and (XI) punitive damages. The second amended complaint alleged that Lacy intentionally misrepresented the value of RLS to Pleho Parties, and that Pleho Parties would not have purchased RLS if they had known that Rnic had agreed to sell the business to Rullo for only $800,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In their answer, Lacy Parties argued that Pleho Parties had caused or contributed to any injuries they suffered. That same day, Lacy Parties also filed a cross-claim against Rnic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Rnic filed an answer and counterclaim against GPLLC on September 26, 2006, alleging that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    since the Management Service Agreement, GPLLC and [Goran] Pleho have failed to maintain [RLS] in a reasonable, profitable fashion, running the business into the ground, causing lost profits and decrease in the value of the business and goodwill, all to Rnic's detriment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Rnic's counterclaim included six counts against GPLLC and Goran related to the sale and management of RLS, including breach of the Sale Agreement and promissory note for failure to make payments on the purchase price. Pleho Parties filed a cross-claim against Lacy Parties based on Rnic's counterclaim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Rnic filed a motion for summary judgment on Pleho Parties' claims against him, which the circuit court granted on May 13, 2009.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Lacy Parties filed a Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss all counts of Pleho Parties' second amended complaint except for Count VII (UDAP) and Count XI (punitive damages), which the circuit court granted on May 13, 2009.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Pleho Parties filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification of the May 13, 2009 order granting Lacy Parties' motion to dismiss. On July 29, 2009, the circuit court entered an order denying and clarifying Pleho Parties' motion. The court stated that it was dismissing all counts but the following: for GPLLC, Counts II (fraud), III (fraud in the inducement), and VIII (legal malpractice); for Goran and Maria Pleho as individuals, Count VII (UDAP); and for GPLLC and Goran and Maria Pleho as individuals, Count XI (punitive damages). The court explained its reasoning as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    Count I for conspiracy to commit fraud falls away because there is but one person accused and the prior co-conspirator has been judged not liable.... Because the\n    conspiracy was alleged to have been between Defendant Rnic and Defendants David W. Lacy and Lacy &amp; Jackson, LLLC, and Defendant Rnic was granted summary judgment on the count of conspiracy to commit fraud, there is no party for the remaining Defendants to conspire with.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    Count V and VI are properly dismissed by implication. There is no mental distress which can be suffered by a corporation....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    Count VII for unfair and deceptive trade practices can not stand on behalf of [GPLLC], because a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices is reserved by statute for consumers.... A corporation is not a natural person and does not have standing to bring a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices under the statute....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    Count VIII for legal malpractice was asked to be dismissed as to [Goran and Maria Pleho] as individual plaintiffs, because they had not suffered damages; they did not purchase, as individuals, the business that is the underlying subject of this case, and therefore did not suffer any individual damages relating to the purchase. The Court ruled in favor of the Defendants; therefore Count VIII for legal malpractice stands on behalf of the LLC alone.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    Count XI for punitive damages stands, based only on the claims still standing for [Goran and Maria Pleho] and the LLC. But because the only claim [Goran and Maria] can claim punitive damages for is unfair and deceptive trade practices, which awards double or treble damages, they should be held to only one form of recovery.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Lacy Parties subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on Goran and Maria's UDAP and punitive damages claims, which the circuit court granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    On March 10, 2011, counsel for all parties appeared before the circuit court to enter two settlement agreements into the record. The first settlement agreement provided that Lacy's indemnity insurance company would pay Rnic $650,000 in exchange for releasing GPLLC from all claims arising out of the RLS Sale Agreement and promissory note, so as to \"allow [GPLLC] to retain and operate RLS free and clear of any claims by or obligations to Rnic.\" Rnic also agreed to the dismissal of his counterclaim against GPLLC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The second settlement agreement provided that Rnic would release all claims against Pleho Parties in exchange for a stipulation of entry of judgment against Goran in the amount of $100,000, to be paid in twenty-five $4,000 installments.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Trial\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Jury trial began on June 7, 2011 on GPLLC's remaining claims: Count II (fraud), Count III (fraud in the inducement), Count VIII (legal malpractice), and Count XI (punitive damages).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Both Goran and Lacy testified at trial, giving their conflicting accounts of the events leading up to the sale of RLS. Among the other witnesses called were two expert accountants, who offered competing appraisals of the value of RLS: Lacy Parties' expert appraised RLS at $1,156,000, while Pleho Parties' expert Mark Hunsaker appraised RLS at $128,000. On cross-examination, Hunsaker testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    [Lacy Parties' counsel]: Now, what you valued in this case ... is the 100 percent equity interest in Goran Pleho, LLC dba Resorts Limousines as of July 25, 2005, on a controlling marketable basis?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    [Hunsaker]: Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    [Lacy Parties' counsel]: Are you familiar with the \"International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms\"?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    [Hunsaker]: I am.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    [Lacy Parties' counsel]: Isn't that an authoritative source that business appraisers customarily rely on?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    [Hunsaker]: It is.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    [Lacy Parties' counsel]: Isn't the definition of equity the owner's interest in property after deduction of all liabilities?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    [Hunsaker]: Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    After Pleho Parties rested their case, Lacy Parties moved for JMOL on all remaining claims. Lacy Parties argued that these claims must fail for lack of damages because Rnic had agreed to release all claims against Pleho Parties as part of Lacy Parties' settlement with Rnic, i.e., any damages based on Pleho Parties' liability to Rnic no longer existed. According to Lacy Parties:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Plaintiff's valuation expert, Mark Hunsaker, testified that he valued a 100% equity interest in RLS. His valuation was $128,000, but his own testimony establishes that valuation of the equity interest was an incorrect measure. Hunsaker agreed on cross-examination with the definition in the International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, 2001 Ed., that equity is \"the owner's interest in property after deduction of all liabilities.\" ... Conversely, in order to obtain the actual value of RLS, which is the owner's interest in the property, Hunsaker would need to take the equity and add back in the liabilities. Based on Hunsaker's valuation of the equity at $128,000, and adding the $1,122,000 liability for the promissory note ... the LLC's interest in RLS is valued at $1,250,000.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Even viewing Plaintiff's evidence in the best light possible, as a result of the settlement, the LLC obtained a $1,250,000 business for $452,698 [$378,000 (Plaintiff's down payment from the three properties) + $74,698 (the amounts paid to date) ] .... Not only does the LLC have no damages, it actually came out ahead as a result of the settlement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The circuit court orally granted the motion for JMOL as to fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages, but denied it as to legal malpractice, issuing a written order on July 6, 2011. Regarding the fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages claims, the court stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    looking at the evidence in light most favorable to the non-movant, the Court finds that no reasonable jury would be able to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants committed fraud or fraud in the inducement as well as awarding punitive damages.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The jury returned a Special Verdict on the legal malpractice claim, finding that while Lacy breached the standard of care in providing legal services to GPLLC, this breach was not a legal cause of damages to GPLLC. Thus, the jury found that Lacy Parties were not liable for legal malpractice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Lacy Parties on all claims asserted by Pleho Parties. Lacy Parties moved for attorney's fees and costs, and the court awarded $407,013.69 in attorney's fees and $29,191.96 in costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     3. The Motion in Limine\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    On June 9, 2009, Goran and Maria filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    On April 21, 2011, Lacy Parties filed a motion in limine to bar Pleho Parties from pursuing claims or introducing evidence regarding any alleged loan, debt, or other asset not specifically declared as an asset in the Nevada Bankruptcy Court action. Lacy Parties asserted that there \"is apparent discord and confusion between [Goran and Maria's] disclosures in the Nevada [bankruptcy] action and [Pleho Parties'] claims in this civil litigation.\" Pleho Parties responded that they were not required to disclose GPLLC's debt to Goran and Maria in the bankruptcy proceedings, and that there was no evidence that Pleho Parties stood to gain unfair advantage by the alleged inconsistency. On June 3, 2011, the circuit court orally denied the motion, noting, \"[c]ertainly it goes to credibility versus admissibility.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    At trial, Pleho Parties offered into evidence Exhibit 27-G(7), a check from Goran to GPLLC, in order to prove damages. Counsel for Lacy Parties objected based on lack of foundation and lack of relevance, but the circuit court received the check into evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     C. ICA Proceedings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Pleho Parties appealed to the ICA, and Lacy Parties filed a cross-appeal from the circuit court's order denying their motion in limine to bar evidence inconsistent with Pleho Parties' disclosures in their bankruptcy proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Pleho Parties' Arguments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Pleho Parties raised four points of error before the ICA relevant to this opinion,\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    arguing that the circuit court erred in: (1) granting Lacy Parties' motion to dismiss Pleho Parties' claims for conspiracy, inadequate consideration, IIED, NIED, and spoliation of evidence, and Goran and Maria's claims as individuals for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and malpractice; (2) granting Lacy Parties' motions for partial summary judgment as to Goran and Maria's UDAP and punitive damages claims; (3) granting the Lacy Parties' motion for JMOL as to GPLLC's claims for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages; and (4) granting Lacy Parties' attorney's fees and costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    First, Pleho Parties argued that they alleged sufficiently \"outrageous\" conduct that was \"calculated to cause, and did in fact cause, extreme emotional distress,\" supporting the restoration of their IIED and NIED claims. Pleho Parties further contended that although Lacy claimed that he only had an attorney-client relationship with GPLLC, Goran and Maria were \"real parties in interest\" because they had been injured by his conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Pleho Parties asserted that \"by first eliminating [GPLLC] as a non-customer, and then dropping [Goran and Maria] because they were allegedly not his clients, the court denied [Goran and Maria] relief for prima facie unfair and deceptive trade practices.\" Pleho Parties argued that \"a lawyer who deceives a client about the value a company he wishes to purchase, has not only committed malpractice, but also a deceptive trade practice.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Finally, Pleho Parties argued that JMOL for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages was inappropriate. According to Pleho Parties, the circuit court disregarded \"compelling evidence\" supporting all three claims, which \"cut the heart out of this case\" and left the jury \"with the absurd impression that [Pleho Parties] were seeking millions in damages because Lacy violated two or three technical provisions of the Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Lacy Parties' Arguments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Lacy Parties asserted (1) that the circuit court abused its discretion when it denied the motion in limine regarding evidence inconsistent with Pleho Parties' disclosures in their bankruptcy proceedings; and (2) that the circuit court erred in \"admitting evidence at trial of a payment made by [Goran] to [GPLLC] when [Goran] did not disclose any such debt owed to him in the bankruptcy schedules.\" According to Lacy Parties, Goran and Maria claimed loans to GPLLC as damages in their civil lawsuit while failing to disclose any such loans in their bankruptcy proceedings. Lacy Parties argued that the circuit court should have applied judicial estoppel to prevent Pleho Parties from asserting these inconsistent positions, which gave them an unfair advantage and suggested that one court or the other was being misled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <strong>\n     3. The ICA Amended Memorandum Opinion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The ICA addressed the circuit court's grant of Lacy Parties' motion to dismiss,\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    motion for summary judgment, and motion for JMOL in an unpublished Amended Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Regarding conspiracy to commit fraud, the ICA found that the trial court did not err in granting dismissal, noting, \"[t]here is no evidence in the record that the Lacy Parties intentionally participated in the sales transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    As to fraud and fraud in the inducement, the ICA noted that, although it was GPLLC that had purchased RLS, Goran and Maria\n    made a down payment of $378,000 on behalf of GPLLC. Thus, the ICA found that \"we cannot conclude that it appears beyond doubt that [Goran and Maria] can prove no set of facts in support of their claim that they were real parties in interest and suffered damages in conjunction with\" the transfer of their Las Vegas properties. The ICA concluded that the circuit court erred in dismissing the fraud claims, but noted that Lacy Parties remained free to assert on remand that [Goran and Maria's] claims were barred by the jury verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The ICA affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of Pleho Parties' IIED and NIED claims. First, the ICA noted its agreement with the circuit court's conclusion that a corporation such as GPLLC cannot suffer mental distress. Second, the ICA determined that, even accepting Goran and Maria's allegations as true, \"we cannot conclude that reasonable people could construe Lacy's conduct as 'beyond all possible bounds of decency' ... as required by our case law\" for IIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Regarding Pleho Parties' NIED claims, the ICA noted that \"Pleho Parties do not cite to any Hawai'i case law supporting recovery for NIED based entirely on a commercial transaction, and we find none.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The ICA found that the court properly dismissed GPLLC's UDAP claim because HRS Chapter 480 does not create a cause of action for corporations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Regarding Goran and Maria's legal malpractice claims, the ICA found that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Lacy formed an attorney-client relationship with Goran and Maria. The ICA concluded that the circuit court erred when it dismissed Goran and Maria's legal malpractice claim against Lacy Parties. The ICA noted that its ruling \"is without prejudice to the Lacy Parties asserting on remand that [Goran and Maria's] malpractice claims are barred by the jury's verdict.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The ICA then addressed the grant of Lacy Parties' motions for partial summary judgment on Pleho Parties' UDAP and punitive damages claims. The ICA concluded that HRS Chapter 480 did not apply to Lacy's conduct in his capacity as a practicing attorney, citing numerous cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that regulation of attorneys \"does not fall within the ambit of consumer protection laws.\" However, the ICA reinstated the punitive damages claims with respect to Goran and Maria's fraud and malpractice claims against Lacy Parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The ICA then addressed the grant of Lacy Parties' motion for JMOL on GPLLC's claims for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages. The ICA agreed with Lacy Parties' contention that Pleho Parties \"obtained a $1,250,000 business for $452,698 (including the $378,000 down payment ... and $74,698 that was otherwise paid, according to evidence entered at trial).\" Noting that Pleho Parties \"failed to cite any evidence at trial that is contrary\" to this argument, the ICA concluded that the circuit court did not err in granting the motion for JMOL in favor of Lacy Parties on fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The ICA affirmed the circuit court's award of attorney's fees and costs to Lacy Parties regarding GPLLC's legal malpractice claim. However, the ICA partially vacated the award to the extent that it held Goran and Maria jointly and severally liable, \"as it is unclear whether the Lacy Parties will be determined the prevailing party against Goran and Maria, as well as GPLLC\" on remand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Finally, the ICA addressed Lacy Parties' cross-appeal, finding Goran and Maria's apparently inconsistent positions in their Nevada bankruptcy proceeding and the instant case established the elements required to invoke judicial estoppel. Accordingly, the ICA held the circuit court erroneously concluded that \"the issue was a matter of credibility rather than admissibility, and did not reach the exercise of its discretion on whether to judicially estop [Pleho Parties] from asserting the factually incompatible position in this case.\" The ICA thus vacated the circuit court's ruling on the motion in limine and the admission of Exhibit 27-G(7) to allow the circuit court \"to exercise its discretion\" on Lacy Parties' request for judicial estoppel \"in the first instance.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The ICA entered judgment on October 13, 2016.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

Did the ICA commit grave error when it vacated the trial court's order denying a motion in limine to bar evidence of loans to [GPLLC] because of unrelated bankruptcy proceedings brought by Goran and Maria, when Lacy failed to renew his objection to the evidence at trial?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The ICA vacated and remanded the circuit court's dismissal of Goran and Maria's fraud and legal malpractice claims.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    At issue in Pleho Parties' application are several claims that the ICA did not restore, the award of attorney's fees, and the vacatur of the circuit court's denial of the motion in limine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Motion to Dismiss\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Conspiracy to Commit Fraud\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The circuit court relied on its grant of summary judgment in favor of Rnic when it dismissed the conspiracy count against Lacy Parties. The ICA thus reviewed the grant of Lacy Parties' motion to dismiss as a HRCP Rule 56 motion for summary judgment, as it appears that the circuit court looked beyond the pleadings and reviewed the \"record and file of the case.\" However, if on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and\n    <em>\n     all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    HRCP Rule 12(b) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    It does not appear that Pleho parties were given \"reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent\" by the conversion to a motion for summary judgment.

Further, Goran testified that Lacy repeated Rnic's claims about RLS's value, i.e., \"[t]his is a unique company, only one of this kind. There's nobody to appraise this company. It's worth $2 million, and $1.5 is just a great price.\" Where there is a duty to exercise reasonable care to disclose a matter in question, failure to disclose the matter is considered a false representation for purposes of the fraud analysis.\n    <em>\n     Santiago v.

Here, Lacy had such a duty stemming from his fiduciary role as Pleho Parties' attorney. Viewing such evidence in the light most favorable to GPLLC, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found in favor\n    of GPLLC on the fraud and punitive damages claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The ICA affirmed the circuit court's grant of JMOL with a different rationale, adopting Lacy Parties' argument that Pleho Parties could not show damages because the actual value of RLS was $1,250,000 even according to Pleho Parties' own expert. The ICA based its conclusion on the following exchange between Pleho Parties' expert accountant Hunsaker and Lacy Parties' counsel:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n    [Lacy Parties' counsel]: Isn't the definition of equity the owner's interest in property after deduction of all liabilities?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    Hunsaker: Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Hunsaker had previously testified that a \"market analysis and conclusion of value of a 100 percent equity interest\" in RLS at the time of sale was $128,000. The ICA thus attributed to Hunsaker the conclusion that that the \"actual value\" of RLS, i.e., \"the owner's interest in the property,\" was the $128,000 \"equity interest\" plus the $1,122,000 promissory note to Rnic, for a total of $1,250,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Pleho Parties argue that the ICA's characterization of Hunsaker's testimony represents a \"tortured interpretation of counsel's 'gotcha' question.\" We agree. \"Equity\" is an accounting term of art with a specific meaning, i.e., the \"owner's interest in property after deduction of all liabilities.\" Based on his answer to a question about this technical definition, the ICA incorrectly imputed to Hunsaker the conclusion that the \"actual value\" of RLS was $1,250,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    GPLLC's $1,122,000 debt to Rnic is a liability properly attributed to GPLLC, not to RLS. Thus, the ICA erred in considering this amount when calculating the actual value of RLS. Moreover, since the crux of Pleho Parties' claim alleges Lacy fraudulently induced them to purchase RLS for far more than its true value, it would be improper to hold that, as a matter of law, a promissory note allegedly procured by fraud should be used as a measure of RLS's value. The true value of RLS thus remains a question properly left to the trier of fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    To conclude, the circuit court erred in granting JMOL in favor of Lacy Parties on GPLLC's fraud, fraud in the inducement, and punitive damages claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Attorney's Fees and Costs\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The ICA upheld the circuit court's award of $407,013.69 in attorney's fees and $29,191.96 in costs to Lacy Parties, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-14 (Supp. 1997),\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    but vacated it \"to the extent that it held Goran and Maria jointly and severally liable, as it is unclear whether the Lacy Parties will be determined the prevailing party against Goran and Maria, as well as GPLLC, after further proceedings on their remaining claims.\" Because we vacate the grant of JMOL against GPLLC on its claims for fraud and punitive damages, we also vacate the award of attorney's fees to Lacy Parties, as it is unclear whether GPLLC will remain the \"losing party\" after the adjudication of these claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    <strong>\n     D.

The ICA explained that the purpose of vacatur was \"to allow the Circuit Court, in the first instance, to exercise its discretion on the Lacy Parties' request for judicial estoppel.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Although the ICA correctly states the elements of judicial estoppel, its conclusion that the circuit court failed to exercise its discretion is not supported by the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    As noted by the United States Supreme Court, \"judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion,\" intended to \"prevent the improper use of judicial machinery.\"\n    <em>\n     New Hampshire v.

Certainly it goes to credibility versus admissibility.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Although terse, this statement shows that the court considered the arguments presented in Lacy Parties' motion in limine and Pleho Parties' response to that motion, both of which focused on the issue of judicial estoppel. Accordingly, the circuit court's denial of the motion in limine should be interpreted as a discretionary determination that judicial estoppel was not appropriate in this instance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    As the circuit court properly exercised its discretion, we vacate the ICA's judgment to the extent that it vacates the circuit court's denial of the motion in limine, and we affirm this ruling of the circuit court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    <strong>\n     V.

We also vacate the ICA's judgment to the extent that it vacates the circuit court's ruling on the motion in limine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    A majority of this court also vacates the ICA's judgment to the extent that it affirms the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Lacy Parties on Goran and Maria's UDAP claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    In all other respects, the ICA's judgment is affirmed. The case is remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    We are called upon to determine whether Hawai'i's unfair or deceptive acts or practices statute, which on its face applies to the conduct of any trade or commerce, nevertheless excludes from its reach a lawyer who actively facilitated the sale of one company to another because of the lawyer's status as a legal professional. Our caselaw indicates that this conduct is in fact the type of participation in a business transaction that the law was intended to address, and the lawyer's conduct cannot be shielded from liability merely because it amounted to or was comingled with legal services. Further, the statute itself directs this court when construing the law to consider the interpretation of analogous federal statutes by federal courts and agencies. This guidance from federal decisions is consistent with the plain language and legislative history of the statute, and any concern that applying the statute in this context would invade this court's inherent authority to regulate\n    the legal profession is unfounded. We accordingly conclude that the alleged conduct in this case, which may or may not have involved the actual practice of law, properly states a claim for relief under our unfair or deceptive acts or practices statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    <strong>\n     I. Background and Procedural History\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In 2005, David W. Lacy, Esq., of the firm Lacy &amp; Jackson LLLC, represented Goran and Ana Maria Pleho (the Plehos) and their company, Goran Pleho LLC (GPLLC) (collectively, the Pleho Parties), in a transaction to purchase Dragan Rnic's company, Resorts Limousine Services (RLS). Several months later, the Pleho parties initiated the present action in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court) alleging a number of claims against Rnic, Lacy, and Lacy &amp; Jackson LLLC in connection with the transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    In a second amended complaint, the Pleho parties alleged that Lacy and Lacy &amp; Jackson LLLC (collectively, the Lacy parties) did not fully disclose the extent of their contemporaneous attorney-client relationship with Rnic at the time of the sale. The complaint alleged that, although Lacy was aware Rnic had previously agreed to sell RLS to a third party for only $800,000, Lacy had advised the Pleho parties to purchase the company for $1,500,000. The Pleho parties further claimed that Lacy had falsely informed them that an independent appraisal of RLS was not possible because of the company's unique nature and that the agreed-upon purchase price was well below RLS's true fair market value of $2,000,000. The complaint stated that, after the Plehos entered into the purchase agreement as Lacy had advised, they learned that Rnic had misrepresented various factors related to the value of the company. The Pleho parties then obtained an independent appraisal, the complaint continued, which concluded RLS's fair market value at the time of the sale was only $128,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    The Pleho parties alleged that the Lacy parties' conduct in connection with the transaction constituted,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"unfair and deceptive trade practices\" in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapters 480 and 481A.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Before trial, the Lacy parties moved for partial summary judgment on the Plehos' HRS Chapters 480 claims, arguing that the conduct alleged in the complaint amounted to the \"actual practice of law,\" which was beyond the scope of the consumer protection statutes.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    The circuit court granted the motion without written explanation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    After trial, the parties filed cross-appeals to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) from the circuit court's final judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Among other issues raised on appeal to the ICA, the Pleho parties challenged the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment on their HRS Chapters 480 claims in favor of the Lacy parties. The Pleho parties argued that a lawyer who deceives a client about the value of a company the client wishes to purchase commits both malpractice and deceptive trade practices.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    In an amended memorandum opinion, the ICA stated that the Plehos' argument on appeal raised for the first time the allegation that \"Lacy engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices within the context of the practice of law\" as opposed to \"within the\n    context of his role in the commercial purchase and sale of the business.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The ICA stated that it therefore need not address the issue. Nevertheless, the ICA proceeded to reject the Pleho parties' argument that HRS Chapter 480 applied to Lacy's conduct in his capacity as a practicing attorney, citing case law from other jurisdictions supporting the proposition that the regulation of attorneys does not fall within the parameters of consumer protection laws.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    The Pleho parties assert on certiorari,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that nothing new was added to their HRS Chapter 480 claim on appeal, that the ICA did not cite Hawai'i case law, and that the cases the ICA did cite do not support barring their claims under HRS Chapter 480 merely because Lacy was their lawyer. Thus, the Pleho parties argue that the ICA should have reinstated their HRS Chapter 480 claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

FTCA section 5(a)(1) prohibits\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    \"[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" The dissent's position would require us to conclude that federal courts ascribe two different meanings to the phrase \"in or affecting commerce\" when it occurs twice in the same sentence, with only one of those instances encompassing aspects of the practice of law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The flaw in this reasoning is even more apparent when we consider our own statute.

Yet few would argue that a lawyer who advises a client as to how to conceal a crime and evade capture does not commit a crime in the lawyer's own right. No implicit exception for the practice of law exists in the criminal statutes prescribing accomplice liability or prohibiting the hindrance of prosecution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 702-221(c) ; HRS \u00a7 710-1029.

A lawyer who engages in unfair or deceptive practices towards a client may be subject to professional discipline under the HRPC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRPC Rule 8.4(c). And that same conduct can give rise to separate and distinct civil liability under the HRS \u00a7 480-2 without interfering with this court's disciplinary authority or regulation of the legal profession.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawai'i Supreme Court\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265131\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/91/363/#p370\">\n     91 Hawai'i 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 370,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265131\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/91/363/#p370\">\n     984 P.2d 688\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 695 (1999) (\"Evidence underlying a violation of a disciplinary rule might also be evidence that would support civil or criminal liability, but determinations about civil or criminal liability are the province of the trial courts, not the [Office of Disciplinary Counsel] or the Disciplinary Board.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    In sum, the dissent theorizes that HRS \u00a7 480-2(a) 's application to the practice of law would invade this court's inherent authority to regulate the legal profession. But allowing the legislature to provide a mechanism for protecting the integrity of Hawai'i's economy and compensating consumers that are harmed by a lawyer's unfair or deceptive business acts serves a separate purpose from our regulation of professional conduct, and it does not undermine or conflict with our professional rules.

Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the ICA's judgment on appeal that affirms the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment on the Plehos' unfair and deceptive acts or practices claim, vacate the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment on this claim, and remand the claim to the circuit court for a determination of whether Lacy's alleged conduct and the Plehos' resulting loss satisfies the elements necessary for recovery under HRS Chapter 480.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    DISSENTING OPINION BY RECKTENWALD, C.J., IN WHICH NAKAYAMA, J., JOINS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    <strong>\n     I.

The House Committee on Housing and Consumer Protection introduced the proposal to enact HRS \u00a7 480-2 by stating, \"[a] law similar in effect to the Federal law was enacted by the State of Washington in 1961. Your committee is informed that the Washington law, like the Federal law, has been most effective in dealing with unfair and deceptive business practices.\" H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55, in 1965 House Journal, at 538. It further explained, \"[y]our Committee concludes that a law similar in effect to the federal law dealing with unfair and deceptive business practices is essential to a State-sponsored fair business program in Hawai'i.\" H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 267, in 1965 House Journal, at 600.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Soon thereafter, the Legislature enacted HRS \u00a7 480-2(a), which is almost identical to Washington's UDAP provision.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 480-2(a) (\"Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.\")\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.020\">\n     Wash.

Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55, in 1965 House Journal, at 539 (stating, \"the courts of Hawai'i must also necessarily give due regard to problems peculiar or pertinent to the State of Hawai'i\"). If the legislature intended to limit this discretion and encroach on this court's constitutional authority by exposing attorneys to UDAP liability under HRS \u00a7 480-2, it would have done so expressly.

Majority at 144 Hawai'i at 253-54, 439 P.3d at 202-03; HAW. CONST. art. VI, \u00a7 7. Given this grant of regulatory authority to a co-equal branch of government,\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    it is fair to presume that the legislature would make its intent to encroach on that authority through \u00a7 480-2 explicit.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-274\">\n    In sum, I share the concern expressed by other state courts that subjecting the actual practice of law to UDAP liability under HRS \u00a7 480-2 may interfere with this court's regulation of the practice of law, and is inappropriate absent clearly expressed legislative intent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Beyers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363860,3596583\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/1082/\">\n     937 A.2d at 1091-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (because the Pennsylvania legislature \"has no authority under the Pennsylvania constitution to regulate the conduct of lawyers in the practice of law,\" any application of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law to attorney misconduct \"would purport to regulate the conduct of attorneys and would be an impermissible encroachment upon the power of this Court.\").

Even in the absence of UDAP liability, attorneys are not \"allowed\" to engage in patently illegal activities on behalf of clients. Such conduct would subject an attorney to professional discipline under the Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct, civil liability in the form of legal malpractice and tort actions, and criminal\n    prosecution.

In fact, the Majority declines to determine whether Lacy's conduct amounted to the practice of law, deeming it to be irrelevant to the UDAP analysis. The Majority's statement that HRS \u00a7 480-2\"places within its ambit virtually all activity occurring in the business context,\" followed by examples of statutes with broad application, further demonstrates that its approach will impose UDAP liability upon all aspects of the practice of law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    Majority at 144 Hawai'i at 249, 439 P.3d at 201.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-284\">\n    The increased exposure to liability imposed upon attorneys by the Majority's holding could make the procurement and maintenance of legal malpractice insurance prohibitively expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-285\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

As discussed above, Lacy entered into an attorney-client relationship with Goran and Maria and engaged in legal research, contracting, strategy, and advising on their behalf. These services clearly constitute the actual practice of law, rather than the business or entrepreneurial aspects of the legal profession.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Kessler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"214174\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/994/240/#p242\">\n     994 F.Supp. at 243\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (the legal, advisory, analytical aspects of law constitute the actual practice of law);\n    <em>\n     Short\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=691%20P.2d%20163\">\n     691 P.2d at 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (the actual practice of law includes the performance of legal advice and services).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-287\">\n    Further evidencing the fact that Lacy's conduct constituted the actual practice of law, Pleho Parties argued that \"Lacy used his position of trust and confidence as [their] attorney to fraudulently induce them into purchasing [RLS] for $1,500,000.\" Because Goran and Maria's UDAP claim is directed to Lacy's competence and the strategy he employed, it amounts to an allegation of legal malpractice.

I conclude that the actual practice of law is not subject to UDAP liability under HRS \u00a7 480-2. Lacy's purported misconduct constitutes the actual practice of law, and thus does not subject him to UDAP liability under HRS \u00a7 480-2.

Unlike the imposition of UDAP liability on the actual practice of law, criminal prosecution is not duplicative or unnecessary. While this court may discipline an attorney professionally for the commission of a crime, it does not have authority to prosecute and sentence the attorney for that crime. No other framework exists to hold attorneys personally responsible for crimes they may commit. In contrast, this court's close regulation of the practice of law, as well as the imposition of civil liability, adequately deter non-criminal attorney misconduct and impose appropriate professional discipline upon attorneys, hold attorneys personally liable for their misconduct, and provide aggrieved clients with sufficient legal recourse.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"23\">\n    <p id=\"p-374\">\n     As noted in\n     <em>\n      Cieri\n     </em>\n     , even Massachusetts' UDAP statute is not \"broad enough to reach\n     <em>\n      any\n     </em>\n     type of commercial exchange, regardless of the nature of the transaction or the character of the parties involved.\"\n     <em>\n      Cieri\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258701\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/54/#p65\">\n      80 Hawai'i at 63\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258701\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/54/#p65\">\n      905 P.2d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     38 (citing\n     <em>\n      Lantner\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=373%20N.E.2d%20973\">\n      373 N.E.2d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     977 ).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
