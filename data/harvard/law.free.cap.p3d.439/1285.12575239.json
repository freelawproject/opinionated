Sandefur delivered the Opinion and Order of the Court.\n  </judges>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b61 By petition filed March 1, 2019, the Montana Office of State Public Defender (OPD) petitions this Court to exercise supervisory control over the Cascade County Justice Court regarding certain orders directing OPD to appoint a public defender to represent the underlying criminal defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the sole charged offense of theft, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47-1-104(4) and 46-8-101(3), MCA, OPD asserts that the Justice Court has no authority to compel it to provide a public defender to represent an indigent criminal defendant charged with a non-jailable misdemeanor offense. OPD thus asserts that the Justice Court is proceeding under a mistake of law for which OPD has no right of ordinary appeal, thereby resulting in gross injustice by requiring it to act in excess of its statutory duty and authority. In response, the Justice Court contrarily asserts that the underlying defendant has an unwaived right to government-provided counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution. The Justice Court further asserts that \"any legislation,\" such as \u00a7 46-8-101, MCA, \"enacted for the purpose of taking away a [d]efendant's right to [counsel] and thus save money is unconstitutional.\" Upon consideration of OPD's petition, the Justice Court's response, limited facts of record, and governing law, we find that exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper and accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Whether the Justice Court erroneously denied OPD's motion to rescind its order for appointment of counsel pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47-1-104(4) and 46-8-101(3), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Alleging that the defendant exercised \"unauthorized control\" with purpose to deprive the owner of property with an alleged value of $ 650, the State charged the defendant by complaint with the offense of theft, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA. Based on the limited record provided, the charge is currently pending in justice court on an unsworn, standard-form\n   <em>\n    Notice to Appear and Complaint\n   </em>\n   issued by a deputy of the Cascade County Sheriff on August 28, 2018, referencing the alleged commission of the offense on that same date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint does not specify whether the offense is charged as a first or subsequent offense. However, in subsequent orders regarding appointment of counsel on December 10, 2018, January 23, 2019, and February 27, 2019, the Justice Court asserts that the defendant is charged with first-offense misdemeanor theft, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 At her combined initial appearance and arraignment on the charge in or about early December 2018, the defendant pled not guilty and, in response to questions from the court,\n   stated her desire for counsel, stated she could not afford to hire private counsel, and requested a public defender. On December 10th, the court issued a written order directing OPD to appoint a public defender. However, upon OPD's motion asserting that \u00a7 45-6-301(7)(a), MCA (2017), precludes \"jail time\" as an available sentencing option on a conviction for first-offense misdemeanor theft, the Justice Court issued a subsequent written order rescinding its prior order for appointment of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 By\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   order filed January 23, 2019, the Justice Court reversed course a second time and, without elaboration, again ordered OPD to appoint counsel to represent the defendant on \"1st Offense\" theft. OPD responded and again moved the court to rescind the order\n   pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47-1-104(4)(a)(i) and 45-6-301(7)(a), MCA (2017). Following a \"brief hearing on the motion,\" the Justice Court subsequently issued written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment denying the motion. Though expressly noting that the case was charged as a first offense and that \u00a7 45-6-301(7)(a) (2017) thus precluded incarceration as a sentencing option, the Justice Court denied the motion to rescind on the asserted ground that an uncounseled conviction on a first offense would, as a matter of law, render any second or subsequent conviction for theft \"constitutionally infirm.\" OPD seeks immediate review by supervisory control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65\n   <em>\n    1. Whether exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper in this case?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 This Court has \"general supervisory control over all other [Montana] courts.\" Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2 (2). We generally exercise supervisory control only by discretionary writ under extraordinary circumstances including, as pertinent here, where a lower \"court is proceeding under a mistake of law\" which otherwise will result in significant injustice for which ordinary appeal will not be an adequate remedy.

However, we will not allow use of supervisory control to circumvent the ordinary appeal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 As a threshold matter, OPD is not a party to the underlying action. However, it is nonetheless uniquely injected into the underlying proceeding by law as an ancillary third party directly subject to and affected by lower court orders directing it how to proceed within its limited statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 47-1-104(1), (3), (4)(a), MCA. As a matter of law, OPD has no right or remedy of appeal in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-101, -103, -104, MCA ; M. R. App. P. 1(2), 4(1), 4(2)(a), 4(4)(a). OPD's petition raises a meritorious issue of law as to whether the Justice Court is acting under a mistake of law that will require OPD to act in excess of its limited statutory duty and authority. Under these extraordinary circumstances, we hold that exercise of supervisory control is necessary and proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68\n   <em>\n    2. Whether the Justice Court erroneously denied OPD's motion to rescind its order for appointment of counsel pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47-1-104(4)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    and 46-8-101(3), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 OPD \"is required to deliver public defender services in all courts in this state\" in accordance with Title 47, MCA. Section 47-1-104(1), MCA.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 46-8-101(2), -104(1), MCA (referencing Title 47, MCA). A \"court may order\" OPD to assign a public defender in any criminal case where a defendant desires the assistance of counsel, is financially unable to retain counsel, and \"\n   <em>\n    is entitled\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    by law\n   </em>\n   ] to assistance of counsel at public expense....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 47-1-104(4)(a), MCA (emphasis added). As of 2017, upon request of a criminal defendant who asserts inability to retain private counsel, \"the court shall order [OPD] ... to assign counsel to represent the defendant\" pending determination of eligibility if the charged offense is either a felony or \"a misdemeanor\" for which \"incarceration is a sentencing option....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 46-8-101(2), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though certainly not the model of clarity, \u00a7 46-8-101(2) - (3), MCA, manifestly provides that the assistance of counsel at public expense is not available regarding a charged misdemeanor that is either not punishable by incarceration by definition of the offense or in regard to which the court may discretionarily waive incarceration as a penalty by order at the defendant's initial appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 The offense of theft involving property not exceeding $ 1,500 in value is a misdemeanor offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 45-1-201, 45-2-101(42), MCA, \u00a7 45-6-301(7), MCA (2017). As a matter of law, second or subsequent offenses of misdemeanor theft are subject to incarceration upon conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-6-301(7), MCA (2017). However, as of 2017, the maximum penalty for first-offense theft of property not exceeding $ 1,500 in value, is a $ 500 fine without potential for incarceration. Section 45-6-301(7)(a), MCA (2017). Thus, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(7)(a), MCA (2017), 46-8-101(2) - (3), 47-1-104(1) and (4)(a), MCA, OPD has no duty or authority to appoint counsel to represent a criminal defendant charged with first-offense theft of property not exceeding $ 1,500 in value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 The Justice Court essentially cursorily asserts that\n   \u00a7 46-8-101(2) - (3), MCA, contravenes the right to counsel separately guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution. However, the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to counsel at public expense regarding misdemeanor offenses not punishable by incarceration, regardless of whether an uncounseled misdemeanor may later be a basis for sentencing enhancement upon a subsequent conviction for a jailable offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols v.
