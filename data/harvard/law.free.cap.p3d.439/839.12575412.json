In accordance with the terms of his written conditions of supervised probation, Lietzau agreed to submit to \"search and seizure of person and property\" by the Adult Probation Department \"without a search warrant.\" He also agreed to grant safe access to his residence and property, submit to searches and seizures of \"person and property by any probation officer,\" and provide probation officers with truthful answers to inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In early December 2014, a woman contacted Lietzau's probation officer to report \"an inappropriate relationship\" she believed Lietzau was having with her thirteen-year-old daughter, S.E. A few weeks later, a probation surveillance officer arrested Lietzau for violating conditions of his probation based on his failure to provide access to his residence, participate in counseling programs, comply with drug testing, and perform community restitution. On the way to the jail, the surveillance officer examined Lietzau's cell phone and saw numerous text messages between Lietzau and S.E. The probation department reported these findings to the Tucson Police Department (\"TPD\"); a police detective then obtained a search warrant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and discovered incriminating photos and text messages in the phone. Lietzau was subsequently indicted on charges of sexual conduct with a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Lietzau filed a motion to suppress all evidence gleaned from his cell phone, citing\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

Adair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309904\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/58/\">\n    241 Ariz. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309904\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/58/\">\n    383 P.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The state countered that no constitutional violation occurs when a warrantless search is expressly authorized in a probationer's terms of probation, and maintained that the search of Lietzau's phone fell within the scope of the search conditions in his probation orders, and therefore was \"within the probation search exception to the warrant requirement.\" The state further argued that\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   was \"inapposite\" because the defendants there were not on probation, and the search here was in compliance with\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   . The trial court granted Lietzau's motion to suppress, reasoning that the surveillance officer's search of the phone had not been related to Lietzau's \"administrative\" violations of probation, and was therefore \"arbitrary,\" and impermissible. The state appealed; we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and 13-4032(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The state contends the trial court erred by suppressing the cell phone evidence because the surveillance officer's examination of Lietzau's phone \"was reasonable,\" and therefore \"constitutional\" under\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   . It also suggests the search was consensual pursuant to Lietzau's conditions of probation, in which he \"agreed and acknowledged\" that his personal property could be searched without\n   a warrant.

Lara\n   </em>\n   , a Ninth Circuit case reversing the denial of a suppression motion based on a warrantless and suspicionless search of a probationer's cell phone, in part because his terms of probation did not clearly encompass such a search.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146415\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/605/#p607\">\n    815 F.3d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607, 610, 614 (9th Cir. 2016).

The state contends the court erroneously relied on\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   because it is significantly distinguishable from Lietzau's case, and, in any event, not binding on Arizona courts, and argues the court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Probationary Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Our supreme court has held that when a defendant is on probation, \"his expectations of privacy are less than those of other citizens not so categorized.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the search of a probationer's cell phone, however, invokes more constitutional protection than a search of his home, as argued by Lietzau citing\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   , we are nevertheless confident in concluding that actual founded suspicion falls much closer to the governance of\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   and, together with the surrounding circumstances, justified the warrantless search here. Stated differently, the\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   reasonableness standard, as applied to a probationer's cell phone, must necessarily be informed by facts supporting founded suspicion when it exists, as in the case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Under the totality of the circumstances, including Lietzau's significantly diminished privacy rights as a probationer, his acceptance of search conditions when he agreed to probation which arguably included his cell phone, the probation department's well-grounded suspicion that Lietzau might be involved in a serious offense with an adolescent child, and the well-known use of cell phones as an aid in committing sexual offenses against children, it cannot be said the officer's search of Lietzau's cell phone was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309904\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/58/\">\n    241 Ariz. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309904\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/58/\">\n    383 P.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in granting Lietzau's motion to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Because we have determined the probationary search here was lawful on the specific facts involved, we reverse the trial court's order granting Lietzau's motion to suppress and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    At the hearing, the state repeatedly asked that Lietzau's probation officer be permitted to testify, but the trial court declined its request, stating it had read the parties' \"responses,\" and did not \"need any testimony.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The warrant application stated that S.E.'s mother was aware her minor daughter was \"possibly sexually active\" with an adult, impliedly identified as Lietzau, S.E. had told a doctor she had been sexually active with a twenty-one-year-old male \"on previous occasions,\" and the probation department had informed TPD they had reviewed Lietzau's cell phone and found \"information on that phone that pertained to that relationship.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Thus, while Lietzau's probation terms are another factor to consider under\n    <em>\n     Adair\n    </em>\n    , it is not necessary to reach the issue of whether they constitute an independent waiver of rights regarding his cell phone or electronic data.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Knights\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108037\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/112/#p121\">\n     534 U.S. at 117-18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108037\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/112/#p121\">\n     122 S.Ct. 587\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (declining to resolve whether acceptance of probation term authorizing warrantless searches constituted waiver of Fourth Amendment rights).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Because we reverse on this ground, we need not address the state's additional argument that the trial court erred in not permitting its witness to testify at the evidentiary hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
