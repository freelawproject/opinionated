Because Phoenix voters never took any affirmative act to authorize this practice, we hold the regulation does not violate common-law or constitutional protections applicable to public employee pensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Phoenix is a home rule city organized under Article 13, Section 2 of the Arizona Constitution through adoption of a city charter (\"Charter\") in 1913. Phoenix voters amended the Charter in 1953 to adopt the Plan and vested administrative, management, and operation authority for the Plan in a Retirement Board. Phoenix City Charter, ch. XXIV, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 3.1, 4.1. Except where noted, we refer to Phoenix, the Retirement Board, and the Plan collectively as \"the City.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 AFSCME Local 2384, AFSCME Local 2960, and ASPTEA (\"Unions\") represent three \"units\" of Phoenix employees and are joined in this litigation by 12 retired employees who began receiving pension benefits under the Plan after July 8, 2012 (\"Retirees\"), as well as four current Phoenix employees (\"Current Employees\"). Unless otherwise noted, we refer to the Unions, Retirees, and Current Employees collectively as \"Members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Under the Plan, an employee's pension benefit is calculated by multiplying three figures:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) \"final average compensation,\" (2) credited service, and (3) a defined benefit rate. \"Final average compensation\" is calculated based on a member's average compensation paid over a three-year period of credited service. Phoenix City Charter, ch. XXIV, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 2.13, 2.14. As explained below, a member's \"compensation\" may either be monetary (\"salary or wages\") or non-monetary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.13. Phoenix voters amended the Plan in 1973 to allow members to include additional credited service based on the amount of accrued sick leave they had remaining at retirement but never authorized the use of accrued sick leave as part of the pension calculation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 14.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Consistent with collective bargaining agreements between Phoenix and the Unions, the city manager adopted Administrative Regulation (\"A.R.\") 2.441 in 1996, which allowed employees to convert a certain percentage of their accrued unused sick leave hours to a cash payout at retirement. A.R. 2.441 was silent as to whether the Charter required this payout to be treated as \"compensation\" for purposes of calculating pensions. As a matter of administrative practice, however, from 1996 to 2012 the Retirement Board counted these one-time payouts as part of the employee's \"final average compensation,\" and the City repeatedly communicated this practice to employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The City created a pension reform task force to evaluate the health of the Plan. The task force recommended, among other things, that the City prospectively end the practice of including accrued sick leave payouts at retirement in the pension calculation. During negotiations with the Unions regarding the 2012-2014 collective bargaining agreements, Phoenix proposed a \"sick leave snapshot\" program that would have prospectively ended the practice but would still allow Plan members to include payouts for unused sick leave hours accrued as of July 1, 2012 in their \"final average compensation.\" The Unions rejected the proposal and thus the 2012-2014 collective bargaining agreements did not explicitly address whether Plan members could include accrued sick leave payouts in their \"final average compensation.\" The deputy city manager then amended A.R. 2.441 (\"Revised A.R. 2.441\"), essentially adopting the snapshot program by excluding payouts for sick leave accrued after July 1, 2012, from an employee's pensionable compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Several days before this amendment, Current Employees and the Unions sued the City, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief based on the claim that Revised A.R. 2.441 would unlawfully reduce their pension benefits. After Retirees intervened the superior court conducted a bench trial on various issues, including whether Members had \"a vested and contractual right\" to include accrued sick leave payouts in the calculation of their \"final average compensation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The superior court ruled in favor of the Members, finding that (1) unused sick leave is non-monetary \"compensation\" under the Plan; (2) the city council fixed the value of that compensation through A.R. 2.441 and its repeated approval of the collective bargaining agreements; and (3) the parties to those agreements understood that accrued sick leave payouts were included as \"final average compensation.\" The court explained that a public employee has a right to \"the existing formula by which his benefits are calculated as of the time he began employment,\"\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

The court declined to award attorneys' fees to either party. This timely appeal and cross-appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 The City argues that accrued sick leave payouts do not qualify as \"compensation\" under the Plan and thus Members have no common-law or constitutional right to compel the City to include such payouts in their \"final average compensation.\" Members\n   counter that accrued sick leave constitutes non-monetary \"compensation,\" as defined by the Plan. Alternatively, Members argue the payout is monetary \"compensation\" because it is part of a member's \"salary or wages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Because\n   <em>\n    Yeazell v.

Phoenix City Charter, ch. XXIV, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 2.5-2.6, 12.1-12.2, 31.1. As pertinent here, the Plan defines \"final average compensation\" as the \"average of the highest annual compensations paid a member for a period of 3 consecutive ... years of his credited service.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.14. \"Compensation\" is defined to include monetary compensation and non-monetary compensation. Monetary compensation is defined as \"a member's\n   <em>\n    salary or wages\n   </em>\n   paid him by the City for personal services rendered by him to the City.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.13 (emphasis added).

The City argues those terms cover only fixed amounts of money paid on a regular basis, while the Members contend \"compensation\" includes any remuneration or money paid for an employee's services. In isolation, the terms \"salary or wages\" might reasonably be open to the conflicting definitions the parties assign to them.

When Arizona courts have been asked to sanction an attempt to alter a charter's voter-approved text, they have refused to do so absent compliance with procedures required by both the Arizona Constitution and the charter itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Paddock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5010633\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/35/214/#p220\">\n    35 Ariz. at 223-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5010633\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/35/214/#p220\">\n    276 P. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Phoenix voters themselves must amend the Charter if they desire to make the practice at issue in this case part of their \"contract\" with the City's public employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b636 We therefore continue to adhere to a fundamental principle in\n   <em>\n    Yeazell\n   </em>\n   and its progeny-a pension term in a public employment contract must have a sound basis in the codified retirement plan.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , 241 Ariz. at 36-37, 41, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 8-9, 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309881\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/33/#p40\">\n    383 P.3d at 1110-11, 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a legislative amendment to pension statutes-changing employee contribution rate and formula granting permanent benefit increases-violated\n   <em>\n    Yeazell\n   </em>\n   because the statutory pension terms in effect before the amendment were part of the employment contract and were modified without employees' assent);\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   , 234 Ariz. at 216-17, 220-21, \u00b6\u00b6 3-11, 27, 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323291\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/214/#p220\">\n    320 P.3d at 1162-63, 1166-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding statutorily-prescribed future increases in pension benefits were part of the employment contract, and retired judges had the right to the pension benefit increase formula found in pension statutes when they began employment);\n   <em>\n    Yeazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610265\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/109/\">\n    98 Ariz. at 116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610265\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/109/\">\n    402 P.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a pension statute in effect when police officer began employment was part of his employment contract and the city improperly modified the contract by applying a subsequent amendment of the pension statute to the officer without his assent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b637 In sum, we conclude that the City's adoption of Revised A.R. 2.441 to partially end the erroneous practice of including accrued sick leave payouts as \"final average compensation\" did not violate\n   <em>\n    Yeazell\n   </em>\n   , the Pension Clause, or the Contract Clauses of the Arizona and United States Constitutions. Given this conclusion, we do not address Members' remaining arguments, which ask us to consider issues not before us on appeal, such as the inclusion of other payouts (e.g., holiday and vacation pay) in a Plan member's compensation. Nor do we address Members' cross-appeal, which challenges the superior court's denial of a permanent injunction, class certification, and attorneys' fees. Moreover, the legality of the City's decision to continue the practice of including payouts for sick leave accrued before July 1, 2012 in pension calculations is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b638 We hold that the Plan does not compel the City to include lump-sum, irregular cash payouts for accrued sick leave benefits at separation as pensionable \"compensation,\" and the City did not violate common-law or constitutional principles by adopting Revised A.R. 2.441. We therefore reverse the superior court's judgment and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the City. Because Members have not prevailed on appeal, we deny their request for attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal. In our discretion, we deny the City's request for attorneys' fees but award taxable costs to the City upon its compliance with ARCAP 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Arizona courts have described city charters as equivalent to \"a local constitution.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
