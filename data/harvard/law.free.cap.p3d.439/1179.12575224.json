Urban Phoenix Project PAC (the \"Committee\") failed to collect sufficient valid signatures to trigger a recall because its signature sheets were not attached to a time-and-date-marked copy of its recall application, as required by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Nowakowski represents District 7 of the City of Phoenix. Displeased with his conduct as a councilman, some electors from District 7 sought to initiate a recall election. To that end, the Committee filed an application for a recall petition on August 29, 2018. After gathering signatures over the next several months, the Committee in December submitted a recall petition with 2,361 signatures to the Phoenix City Clerk for verification. The next month, the City Clerk certified that the petition had sufficient signatures to\n   be on the ballot for the March 2019 city election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Rosa Maria Morales, an elector of District 7, then filed this action challenging the recall petition in superior court. She raised three objections: (1) the Committee failed to attach the \"official text of the recall, which consists of the date-and-time stamped copy of the petition serial number application,\" to petition sheets in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 19-202.01(D) and -203(D); (2) \"a copy of the petition form\" was not attached to the Committee's petition application, in violation of \u00a7 19-202.01(B)-(C) ; and (3) the petition sheets did not include language required by A.R.S. \u00a7 19-204(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The Committee moved to dismiss, arguing that Morales lacked a statutory cause of action, as the sole statute authorizing an elector's challenge to recall petitions is A.R.S. \u00a7 19-208.04, which only allows challenges to \"the number of signatures certified by the county recorder under the provisions of \u00a7 19-208.02.\" (Pursuant to Phoenix City Charter Chapter XVII, \u00a7 3, the Phoenix City Clerk takes the place of the county recorder in the signature verification process.) On the merits, the Committee argued that it should be required only to substantially comply with the statutory requirements for recalls; that \u00a7 19-201.01's requirement of strict compliance with statutory requirements is unconstitutional; and that it had substantially complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The trial court ruled that \u00a7 19-208.04 is the only statute authorizing a private right of action in the recall context. Under that section, a private party may challenge the validity of signatures. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that Morales was statutorily authorized to raise her first objection. Because Morales's other two objections were not based on signature verification, the court held they were not cognizable and dismissed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On the merits of Morales's surviving objection, the trial court determined that the Committee had failed to comply with the statutory requirements. The court found that the Committee failed to attach a \"time-and-date-marked copy of the [petition] application\" to its petition sheets, and thus the City Clerk should not have included any of the sheets in certifying the number of signatures. \u00a7 19-203(D). Accordingly, the court ruled the recall was not eligible to be placed on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Although ultimately unnecessary to its decision, the trial court also rejected the Committee's challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 19-201.01, and, in the event the court's jurisdictional rulings were not upheld on appeal, ruled alternatively for Morales on her second objection and for the Committee on the third.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Morales and the Committee appealed to the court of appeals, and we granted the Committee's unopposed motion to transfer. In this Court, Morales argues that the trial court erred by holding that no broad right of action exists to challenge recall petitions and by rejecting Morales's third objection related to the petition language. The Committee argues that the trial court erred in upholding \u00a7 19-201.01, in ruling that the petitions did not comply with \u00a7\u00a7 19-202.01(D) and -203(D), and in its alternative ruling on Morales's second objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Before reaching the merits, we consider whether Morales is statutorily authorized to raise any of her objections to the recall. Morales contends that \u00a7 19-208.04 broadly authorizes recall challenges; the Committee argues that no statute allows her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Section 19-208.04 allows any elector to challenge the number of signatures certified on a recall petition. Morales argues that this authorization creates a broad private right of action \"irrespective of the legal theory undergirding the challenge.\" She states that it is \"well-established in the initiative and referendum context\" that petitions can be challenged for reasons beyond the certification of signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Morales neglects two key points. First, her claim that the \"plain language\" of \u00a7 19-208.04 creates a broad private right of action is undermined by the statute's own terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 19-208.04(B) authorizes a challenge to \"the number of signatures certified by the county recorder.\" In this respect, recalls (title 2 of chapter 19) are like initiatives and referenda (title 1 of chapter 19), for which the same sort of challenge is authorized by A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.03(B). But the provisions for initiatives and referenda are notably different from those for recalls because they also include A.R.S. \u00a7 19-122(C), which authorizes any person to \"contest the validity of an initiative or referendum\" for failure to comply with any statutory requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kromko v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p55\">\n    168 Ariz. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55-56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p55\">\n    811 P.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16-17 (1991) (stating that \u00a7 19-122(C)\"permits any citizen to explore beyond the county recorder's certification\" of signatures). The cases Morales cites in support of her broad right of action, all in the initiative and referendum context, were brought under \u00a7 19-122, for which there is no counterpart in the recall context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The second flaw in Morales's argument is that it conflates the process for recalls with those for initiatives and referenda.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755760\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/174/\">\n    228 Ariz. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 \u00b6\u00b6 19-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755760\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/174/\">\n    265 P.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (2011). We have previously declined to extend the same requirements we place on referendum petitions to recall petitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755760\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/174/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We decline to do so here as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The legislature has statutorily created a broad private right of action in the context of initiatives and referenda but has declined to do so for recalls. With that background, we will not construe \u00a7 19-208.04(B) as implicitly incorporating \u00a7 19-122.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Flagstaff v. Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1541608\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/164/395/#p398\">\n    164 Ariz. 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1541608\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/164/395/#p398\">\n    793 P.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551 (1990) (stating \"[w]here the legislature uses a term within one statute and excludes it from another, the term usually will not be read into the provision from which it was excluded\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 By its terms, \u00a7 19-208.04 authorizes a challenge to \"the number of signatures certified by the county recorder under the provisions of \u00a7 19-208.02.\" Section 19-208.02(A), in turn, requires \"the county recorder [to] determine the number of signatures or affidavits of individuals whose names were transmitted that must be disqualified for any of the reasons set forth in \u00a7 19-121.02, subsection A.\" Under \u00a7 19-121.02(A), the county recorder must disqualify signatures for statutorily prescribed reasons, including \"the same reasons any signatures or entire petition sheets could have been removed by the secretary of state pursuant to \u00a7 19-121.01, subsection A, paragraph 1 or 3. \u00a7 19-121.02(A)(11).\" As the final link in the chain, \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1) and (3) specify requirements for petition sheets and signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 Although Morales is not entitled broadly to challenge the validity of the recall, \u00a7 19-208.04 authorizes her to challenge the number of signatures certified. The grounds for such a challenge rest in the statutes, including \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1) or (3), that specify how the number of certified signatures is determined. Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction to consider Morales's first objection, which contended that the signature sheets should not have been counted because they had not been attached to \"the complete title and text of the measure.\" \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Morales's other objections - a failure to attach a petition sheet when initially filing the petition application and to include on petition sheets the precise language prescribed by \u00a7 19-204(A) - do not relate to the validity of signatures. Although these procedural steps should be followed by those undertaking a recall petition, \u00a7 19-208.04 does not contemplate a private right of action challenging a failure to comply with these requirements. Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that it was not authorized to consider Morales's second and third objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 We now consider whether the Committee complied with \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(a), which requires that petition sheets be attached to the \"complete title and text\" of the recall in order for the signatures to be verified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 The \"complete title and text\" of a recall measure is defined in \u00a7 19-202.01(D), which states \"the time-and-date-marked application ... constitutes the official copy of\n   the text of the recall and shall be used in all instances as the text of the recall.\" Similarly, \u00a7 19-203(D) states the \"time-and-date-marked copy of the application ... constitutes the full and correct copy of the recall text and is the only valid copy for circulation of signatures. Signatures that are collected with any copy of the recall text that is not a facsimile of the time-and-date-marked copy ... are invalid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 The Committee argues that neither \u00a7 19-202.01(D) nor \u00a7 19-203(D) states that a time-and-date-marked copy of the application must be attached to the petition sheets. True, neither statute uses the word \"attach.\" But \u00a7 19-203(D) expressly recognizes that signatures, to be valid, must be collected with such a copy, which \u00a7 19-202.01(D) specifies \"shall be used in all instances as the text of the recall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 Moreover, the definition of the text of the recall does not operate in isolation. Morales's entire challenge is premised on \u00a7 19-208.04 which, at the end of a line of references, incorporates \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(a). That statute requires the removal of petition sheets \"not attached to a copy of the complete title and text of the measure.\" Thus, to the extent that \u00a7 19-203(D) only implicitly requires the attachment of the time-and-date-marked application, \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(a) makes the requirement express.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Taken together, the statutes require that any petition signature sheet not attached to a copy of the time-and-date-marked application be removed from the verification process. It is not enough, as the Committee argues, for the petition sheets to reproduce the application's statement of why a recall is being sought. The time-and-date-marked copy of the application - unlike the petition sheets - both identifies the applicant (including any organization, certain officers, and contact information) and reflects that the application has in fact been filed. Requiring the attachment of a such a copy also helps ensure that signatures are not obtained before the application is filed, consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 19-202.01(A) (requiring the submission of an application before circulating a petition) and -203(D) (providing that signatures are invalid if not collected with a copy of the time-and-date-marked copy of the application).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 Here, none of the Committee's sheets were attached to the complete time-and-date-marked application. Moreover, because the Committee failed to attach a copy of the application to the petition sheets, and it did not otherwise collect the signatures with a \"facsimile of the time-and-date-marked copy,\" \u00a7 19-203(D), it completely failed to comply with the statutory requirements. Finally, because the Committee did not substantially comply, we need not determine the constitutionality of \u00a7 19-201.01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanwitz v. Reagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=245%20Ariz.%20344\">\n    245 Ariz. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570878\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/429/1138/#p1142\">\n    429 P.3d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 (2018). Nor do we address any of the other issues raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Our state constitution guarantees voters the right to recall elected officers for whatever reasons they choose.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755760\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/174/\">\n    228 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   176 \u00b6 7, 180 \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755760\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/174/\">\n    265 P.3d at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 362. That right, however, must be exercised pursuant to constitutional and statutory provisions. While we recognize that the Committee and its volunteers undertook substantial efforts to gather signatures, those signatures could not be certified because the petition sheets were not attached to a time-and-date-marked copy of the recall application. We therefore affirm the trial court's decision enjoining the recall election.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
