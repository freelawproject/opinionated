The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded Petitioner Permanent Partial Disability (PPD). The ALJ also determined the City of Tulsa was entitled to a credit from the PPD award in the sum of $1,095.20, pursuant to 85A O.S. \u00a7 89. The Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of this credit. The ALJ found the credit against PPD awards was constitutional. The Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission En Banc affirmed. The dispositive issue on appeal concerns the constitutionality of the employer credit against PPD awards. This cause was assigned to this office on March 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Upon review of the record and briefs of the parties, this Court has determined the issues raised in this appeal have already been decided in our recent opinion in\n   <em>\n    Braitsch v.
