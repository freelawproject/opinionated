Judge Pressley, before whom the motion was made, refused to grant it, and Robert Garvin appealed. <em>Held </em>by this court\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">1. That proceedings under the act of 1869 <em>(Gen. Stat. </em>497, \u00a7\u2022 2,) are purely legal, and this court, therefore, can correct only errors of law committed by the Circuit judge in such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">2. The real purpose of this act considered and the conclusion reached that it probably was intended to affect only <em>the method of procedure, </em>and to provide a uniform proceeding for cases both at law and in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">3. That from the wording of the motion, and after the decision in <em>Garvin </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>13 <em>S. C. </em>160, the relator cannot now deny that his motion is under the act of 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">4. That the Circuit judge correctly held that under this statute he had no power to set aside the judgment except for errors-of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">5. That no error of law was committed by the Circuit judge in holding that the facts which would justify a re-opening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the case, must be such as were shown to his satisfaction to have been overlooked or newly discovered.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AWSk\">March 18th, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ9\">P. <em>A.

It is very questionable whether any appeal is allowed under this statute; but, without reference to its phraseology, the conclusions of the Circuit judge as to what' is <em>\u201c </em>satisfactory proof,\u201d cannot be reviewed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">7. This court cannot decide whether proof was \u201c satisfactory to the presiding judge.\u201d Appeal dismissed. Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AvS\">McGowan, A. J.,</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
