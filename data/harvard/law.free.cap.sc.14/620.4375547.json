After a time A entered into cotton speculations in the firm name, and, on account of such speculations, a large sum of money became due to plaintiffs in Liverpool, for which they brought this action. Plaintiffs knew nothing of the terms of the partnership agreement. A testified that B knew of these speculations, and drew her share of the profits, knowing whence they <em>came; </em>B denied all knowledge, and testified that she had always opposed all suggestions of speculating. Verdict was for defendants. Hudson, J., Charleston.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Plaintiffs appealed to this court upon exceptions to the judge\u2019s charge. The following principles were decided:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">1. Defendant B did not render herself liable because of failure to give notice <em>\u201c </em>to the plaintiffs of any limitations or conditions imposed on either of the partners defendants.\u201d The rule as laid down in 1 <em>Coll, on Part. </em>645, approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">2. Whether these transactions were inconsistent with the general scope of the business of the partnership of defendants, was a question of fact properly submitted to the jury. <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 <em>Bail. </em>553.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">3. The judge properly charged the jury that B did not bind herself to plaintiffs by a receipt of profits arising from these speculations, unless she knew how the moneys so received were derived. 1 <em>Coll, on Part. </em>646.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">4. An act by one member of a firm inconsistent with the practice and usage of the business of the co-partnership, would be outside the scope of the co-partnership as matter of fact, and, according to the principles of law governing and controlling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>partnerships, well understood and long since settled, would not. bind the firm; and a party thus acting with the firm in an outside transaction, could not plead ignorance.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AYM\">December 14th, 1880.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys id=\"AqPc\"><em>A.
