Jacobs were joint tenants of a tract of land, and upon Edward\u2019s interest rested the lien of a judgment in favor of William Jacobs. In 1860 Richard purchased Edward\u2019s interest. William died, leaving Edward his executor; then Edward died. In December, 1860, Richard became administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with will annexed of William, and, as such, assigned this judgment to W. B. Charles, trustee. In March, 1872, Richard became administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Edward. In August, 1872, Charles brought his action against Richard, administrator <em>o\u00ed </em>Edward, to renew the judgment in favor of William Jacobs \u2014 Richard resisted ; the history of this litigation will be found in 5 <em>8. G. </em>348; 6 <em>8. G. </em>69, and 9 <em>8. G. </em>295. After this judgment was renewed, and, in 1879, the interest of Edward was sold thereunder to Goldsmith, the plaintiff here, who brought this action to recover possession. Defendant pleaded the bar of the statute of limitations and adverse possession. His plea was sustained on Circuit by Judge Pressley, under whose instruction the jury found for defendant. An appeal by plaintiff to this court was dismissed. <em>McRaa </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 <em>Bay </em>339; <em>Lamar </em>v. <em>Raysor, </em>7 <em>Rich. </em>509; <em>Pegues </em>v. <em>Warley, ante p. </em>180; <em>Faysoux </em>v. <em>Prayther, </em>1 <em>N. &amp; McC. </em>296.
