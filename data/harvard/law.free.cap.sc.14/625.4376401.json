Judge Thomson, on Circuit, confirmed the return of the appraisers, and the debtor appealed. This court dismissed the appeal, refusing to accept the unsworn assertion of defendant as evidence; and, moreover, not assured that the defendant had no interest in the lands assigned, even if his wife\u2019s, as it did not appear that the coverture commenced and the wife\u2019s title was acquired <em>after </em>the adoption of our present constitution.
