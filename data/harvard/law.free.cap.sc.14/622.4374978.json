The value of the services was fixed by special referees appointed for that purpose, and confirmed by the court; but the county was no party to these proceedings. Case submitted, and the Circuit judge (Aldrich) gave judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed. This court following the case of <em>Ostendorff </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, ante p. </em>403, held that only the county commissioners could make a contract binding on the county; and reversed the judgment of the court below.
