' Defendant set up debt due him by assignor before notice of assignment, and called it a counter-claim, but demanded no relief against plaintiff. Evidence offered at the trial to prove this equitable defence was objected to, because pleaded only as a counter-claim. Objection overruled and evidence admitted. <em>Held, </em>no error. <em>Bliss\u2019 Code PL, </em>\u00a7 389; Pom. <em>on Bern., </em>\u00a7 92; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">3. Defendant failed <em>to </em>serve itemized statement of his account within ten days after demand, but plaintiff did not return it, nor object until trial. The items were set out in the answer, except amounts. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in permitting this account to be proved at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">4. It would seem that an allegation in the answer that defendant \u201c was attorney of the said assignor, and so continued up to the commencement of this action,\u201d would support a charge of <em>\u201cfee </em>as general attorney for three years, at $100 a year.\u201d Appeal dismissed.
