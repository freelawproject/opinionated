The first causes of action in the three first cases are substanially copies of the petition upon which the judgment of this court in the <em>State on the relation of the Attorney General </em>v. <em>The Standard Oil </em>Company, 49 Ohio St., 137, is founded. The questions now to be determined arise upon the second causes of action in the several petitions. In those causes of action the allegations of the first causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>action are by averment alleged to be true, as though fully repeated. This mode of pleading is manifestly improper, since the causes of action are independent. The second cause of action counted upon violations of the act of April 19, 1898 (93 O. L., 143), entitled \u201cAn act to define, trusts and provide for criminal penalties in civil damages, and punishment of corporations, persons, firms and associations, or persons connected with them, and to promote free competition in commerce and all classes of business in the state.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">In the second cause of action it is alleged against each of the defendants that it entered into a combination with nineteen other named corporations for the purpose of preventing competition in the production, transportation and refining of petroleum, and of fixing and maintaining the prices at which its various products should be sold. It is alleged that the same persons are chosen to the directories of said several corporations, to the end that their opera-, tion may be so controlled as to accomplish the purpose of said trust agreement, the object of which is alleged to be that the functions of producing, transporting and refining petroleum are so apportioned among them as to prevent competition. The terms of the agreement are not set out, but its purport is alleged as follows: \u201cThe said defendant company whoily violated the said act in carrying out said trust contract, obligations and agreements by continuing to bind itself and remaining obligated not to sell, dispose of and transport petroleum or any of its products that are now, or have heretofore been used in trade for merchandise or consumed by the citizens of the state of Ohio at a fixed value, and have confederated and agreed to establish and maintain the price of said petroleum and its products at a higher price than the said commodities would have been furnished to the consumers had the said trust agreement not been made, entered into and continued as aforesaid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the true amount and advance between the competitive price and the price determined by said combination, plaintiff has not the means of fully stating and advising the court, and that they have by entering into said trust agreements and by continuing operation thereunder, directly and indirectly precluded a free and unrestricted competition among themselves as well as between purchasers and consumers in the transportation and sale of said petroleum and all its products; that the defendant company has, by entering into and continuing in its operation under said agreements hereinbefore set forth and by entering into other and further agreements, the nature of which plaintiff is unable to state, defendant company has agreed to pool, combine and have directly and indirectly united its interest with the said nineteen other companies hereinbefore set forth, and its stockholders, directors, officers and other persons to the plaintiff unknown, in order that they may have connected with the transportation and sale of said petroleum and all its products, so that its price is fixed thereby in this, to-wit: that the open market, competitive' price of the high-grade of petroleum or illuminating oil manufactured and refined by defendant company, is about four (4) cents per gallon. By means of said combination and confederation by which this defendant directly and indirectly aids the other said nineteen companies is able to destroy competition and extort an amount from the purchasers, residents of the state of Ohio, eight (8) cents and upwards per gallon for said commodity to the detriment of the citizens of the state of Ohio, and wholly in abuse of its corporate rights, franchises and powers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\">The prayer of each petition is that the defendant be adjuged to have forfeited its corporate rights, privileges and franchises and that it be ousted and excluded therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">It was probably in view of the averment intended to couple the first cause of action with this, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>defendant, instead of demurring to the second cause of action, made it the subject of a second defense in the answer in which they allege that the act referred to is unconstitutional. To this defense a demurrer is interposed on behalf of the state. The same questions are raised in case No. 6416 by the allegation of the fifth defense in the answer alleging that the act is unconstitutional. To this defense there is a reply denying that the act is unconstitutional, but this may be treated as a demurrer. The act is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">\u201cAn act to define trusts and to provide for criminal penalties and civil damages, and punishment of corporations, persons, firms and associations, or persons connected with them, and to promote free competition in commerce and all classes of business in the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">\u201cSection 1. <em>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio, </em>That a trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons, firms, partnerships, corporations or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them, for either, any or all of the following purposes:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">\u201c1.

N. C. Constitution, Art. L., Sec. 31; Tennessee Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 22; Texas Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 18; Compiled Laws of New Mexico, p. 382, Sec. 1292; Stimson Am. Stat.

The managers of these several corporations, companies or business simply agree among themselves to transfer all, or at least a majority of their stock, in trust to a central committee of trustees, who give back to them in return trust certificates to the estimated value of the plant and property of the individual, together with the good will of the business and any patents it may control or advantages which it may possess, making its consolidation Avith the trust particularly desirable. Each member also generally receives back a mortgage covering his original property given by the trustees to secure the individual in case the combination should fail or be dissolved. The trustees then \u201chave the poAver to elect the directors, place their own agents in charge, prevent all clashing of interests and so control the market.\u201d This is the \u201coriginal or sim\u00f3n pure trust.\u201d Hobson\u2019s Modern Capitalism, p. 130; Yon Halle on Trusts, p. 127; Cook\u2019s Corporation Problem, p. 218, 219; Headley\u2019s Economics, p. 158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">Of such form was the Standard Oil trust, the Cotton Oil trust, the Sugar trust, the Whiskey trust, and the host of combinations that folloAved in their train. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>See the result of New York trust investigation given in \u201cAppendix A\u201d of Cook on Trusts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-4\">The second method of forming the consolidations differs but little in its practical workings from the first. In form it is a gigantic corporation, it consolidates the undertakings itself, either by leasing them for a term of years or by purchasing them outright, giving its own stock in payment. The pioneer of this second group was the Diamond Match Co., and to it belond also many of the railroad combinations. The United States Leather Company; the United States Rubber Company; The American Tobacco Company, and later the Continental Tobacco Company; the Cleveland &amp; Sandusky Brewing Company, and most of the new companies that are forming, and old trusts as they have been reorganized.

S., 505; 54 U. S. App., 723.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-5\">No contract for the purpose of limiting or reducing production, or to increase or reduce price, the second purpose of the law, was ever held valid. No contract or combination to prevent competition was ever held legal. None of the other purposes of the act were ever considered legal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-6\">It was upon the construction that the act included contracts in reasonable as well as unreasonable restraint of trade, that Justice Swayne, in the <em>In re Grice, </em>79 Fed., 627, declared the Texas law unconstitutional. This was an erroneous construction and the case was reversed by the supreme court, 169 U. S., 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-7\">Two supreme courts have already declared in favor of the constitutionality of laws of this character, namely, Texas and Missouri. <em>Waters-Pierce Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>44 S.

In reply to this criticism we beg leave to remind the court that the legislature had full power to prescribe rules of evidence and methods of proof. This clause only provides a rule of evidence, and as such- evidence it is not made conclusive, but the parties have an opportunity to rebut such evidence by proof, submitting issues under all evidence to the court. <em>Meadowcroff </em>v. <em>People, </em>L. R. A., 177; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>36 L. R. A., 179; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>54 Me., 562; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>108 Mo., 135; Cooley Con.

Co. </em>v. <em>Mass., </em>10 Wal., 573; <em>Orient Co. </em>v. <em>Daggs, </em>172 U.

The act in question only prohibits the defendant, as well as other citizens, from entering into such contracts and engaging in such acts as are hurtful to society and consequently in opposition to the public welfare. There can be no vested right granted to any individual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>set of individuals to do that which is wrongful and in violation of public policy. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>101 U.

Makes penal all association of two or more persons for business purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-8\">II. Renders it impossible for two or more persons associated to carry on business; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-9\">III. That the right of persons to associate and carry on business is one of the liberties protected by the fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution and by article 1, section 1, of the constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-10\">That act defines a trust as follows: \u201cA trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons, firms, partnerships, corporations-or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them, for either, any or all of the following purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-11\">The words \u201ccombination of capital, skill or acts,\u201d embrace every method by which men can associate in business, whether by partnership, corporatibn, joint-stock association or by contract of any nature. Parsons on Partnership, 3rd Edition, p. 6; 3 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, p. 23; 1 Lindley on Partnership (4th Ed., p. 3).</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In order to demonstrate that the act makes criminal all association for business purposes, it is only necessary to show that one or more of the enumerated purposes is essential to every business association, whether partnership, corporation, or joint-stock association, being so necessary a factor of the combination that the existence of the one implies the existence of the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-4\">This renders it necessary 'to consider what the law regards as a \u201cpurpose.\u201d A purpose is a mental state, an intent, a design. Every man is <em>prima facie </em>supposed to intend every necessary or even probable consequence of his own act. Broome\u2019s Legal Maxims, 7 Ed., p. 307; Bishop on Crim. Law, Sec. 337; <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>86 Texas Rep., 250; <em>Texas Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>89 Texas Rep., 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">I. We now call attention to the prohibitions which we claim prevent all association of two or more persons in business, to-wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\"><em>a. </em>Combinations of capital, skill or acts of two or more persons which prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-7\">5. The making or entering into or carrying out or executing any contract, obligation or agreement of any kind or description by which (two or more persons) shall in any manner, directly or indirectly, preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any article or commodity, or by which,</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-8\"><em>c. </em>They shall agree to pool, combine, or, directly or indirectly, unite any interests they may have in connection with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in any manner be affected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-9\">We do not claim that the act is unconstitutional because it makes criminal the union of capital, skill and acts which create restriction in trade. Our claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>is that the act is unconstitutional because it makes criminal contracts between two or more persons which \u201cprevent competition\u201d or which \u201cpreclude directly or indirectly a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,\u201d and prevent the \u201cunion, directly or indirectly, of any interests,\u201d which might in any manner affect prices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-5\">It is usual in articles of co-partnership to stipulate that each partner shall devote his time and attention to the business of the firm and shall not engage in any business in competition with the firm. This is an agreement to prevent competition. Parsons on Partnership, 4th Ed., Sec. 153; <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>136 N. Y., 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">There is no possible escape from the obvious and self-evident proposition that any association in business prevents competition among the persons associated, and that if prevention of competition is made criminal, association is made impossible. Prevention of competition is a purpose or effect of every co-partnership, joint-stock association, or corporation. It is a purpose or effect of every contract, agreement or understanding by which men associate or co-operate. Prevent men from making contracts which preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves and we are at once relegated to the savage state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-7\">II. In addition to the provisions of the act which make associations for business purposes impossible, other provisions render business by two or more persons associated impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-8\">Without dwelling upon this provision we may ask how it is possible for two or more persons to associate in business if they may neither limit nor reduce their production nor increase nor reduce the price of their commodities, nor agree not to sell below a common standard figure; nor to settle the price either as between themselves or themselves and others; nor to unite their interests so that price might in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>manner be affected. <em>In re </em>Grice, 79 Fed. Rep., 642.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-4\">It may be contended that the legislature did not intend to interfere with corporations or partnerships or the right of association; that the act recognizes associations as already existing \u2014 a fact which could not be ignored \u2014 cannot defeat the plain language which renders their future existence penal. Neither can the plain language of a statute be altered by reference to other statutes. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Blight, </em>2 Cranch, 358; <em>Schooner </em>v. <em>The U. S., </em>7 Cranch, 52; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>3 H., 556; <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>Blacker, </em>146 U. S., 1, 27; <em>United Society </em>v. <em>Eagle Bank, </em>7 Conn., 457.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-5\">Neither can the act be confined to prohibition of unreasonable restraint of competition. It is specific and particular in describing what character of restrictions of competition is meant, and embraces every agreement which directly or indirectly precludes free and unrestricted competition between few or many. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Freight Assn., </em>166 U. S., 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-6\">III. Thq right of persons to associate and carry on business and to enter into contracts necessary to their business, is one of the liberties protected by the fourteenth amendment to the Federal constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-7\">The constitution protects liberty of contract, except in so far as that liberty encroaches upon the liberty of others. <em>Allgeyer </em>v. <em>La., </em>165 U.

St., 431. The United States Circuit court in Ohio declared unconstitutional a statute preventing railroad companies from contracting with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>employes in respect of personal injuries. <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Pa. Co., </em>71 Fed. Rep., 931. The supreme court of this state held an act relating to mechanics\u2019 liens void because it interfered with the right of contract. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Tingley, </em>55 Ohio St., 423. It has also been held that the statute requiring certain employers to pay their employes twice a month is unconstitutional. In Illinois the truck-store act, the coal-weighing act and other legislation has been set aside for the same reason. <em>Frorer </em>v. <em>People, </em>141 Ill., 171; <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>People, </em>142 Ill., 380; <em>Harding </em>v. <em>People, </em>160 Ill., 459; <em>Richie </em>v. <em>People, </em>152 Ill., 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-4\">Legislation has been pronounced unconstitutional in other states on the same ground. <em>Kuhn </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>70 Mich., 534; <em>Spry Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Trust Co.. </em>77 Mich., 199; <em>State </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>115 Mo., 307; <em>State </em>v. <em>Julow, </em>129 Mo., 163; <em>State </em>v. <em>Good will, </em>33 W.

As for example, contracts on sale of good will not to engage in the same business; contracts between partners not to engage in a rival business, etc., etc. Who can doubt that such contracts not only indirectly, but directly prechide free and unrestricted competition between the contracting parties? <em>Ry.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahc\">Counsel seem to be in accord as to the mode of challenging the validity of the act and, without devoting time to iriticism of the pleadings, we follow them in the consideration of that question. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>brief on behalf of the state it is said that the act is merely declaratory of the common law. If that prop-' osition could be accepted it would relieve the cases of all difficulty, but for obvious reasons it cannot be accepted. The act creates criminal offenses and prescribes penalties to be imposed upon those who commit them; while, as is well known, we have no common law crimes in this state. Furthermore, it is quite clear that as to some of the persons and contracts within the operation of the act its purpose is to authorize proceedings against parties who are performing the terms of the forbidden contracts, while without the aid of the statute courts can denounce the contracts as unlawful only when by actions against defaulting parties they are called upon to aid in their enforcement. The act may in other respects exceed the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We do not, however, deem it necessary or prudent to pass upon all the objections which are urged against the act. It is quite familiar doctrine that in determining the constitutional validity of statutes their different provisions are not necessarily subject to the same conclusion. They are not, unless they constitute a single scheme, and are so interdependent that it could not be rationally presumed that any of them would have been made if it had not been supposed that all could be enforced. The application of this doctrine to the act before us is quite clear in view of the differences in the nature of the several combinations which are forbidden and in the characters of those against whom the prohibition is directed. Moreover, that the legislature regarded the provisions of the act as severable, is indicated by the distributive force of the phrase \u201ceither, any or all,\u201d preceding the enumeration of the forbidden purposes, as well as by the terms of the ninth section requiring that the provisions of the act shall be held to be cumulative with respect to one another as well as with respect to other laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We are, therefore, to consider only those provisions of the act which are relevant to the cases before us. These cases are civil actions brought against independent corporations. The contract which we are asked to denounce is not incidental to the sale of property or any interest therein. It does not concern the good Avill of any business. It does not contemplate the formation of any corporation or other company for the carrying on of any business. In the subject of the contract the interests of the contracting parties are not adverse; they are not even diverse. The agreement, according to the allegations of the petition, has no purpose whatever except to prevent competition in the production, transportation and refining of petroleum, to the end that there may be received from the consumers of its products higher prices than would prevail under the condition of open competition. Counsel for the defendants admit that such a contract is within the inhibitions of the act, but deny the poAver of the legislature to inhibit it. Laws of this general character were entirely familiar to our English ancestors and to those who framed the American constitution. In view of the omnipotence of the English parliament, such enactments do not, of course, furnish a standard for the validity of enactments passed by our legislatures, whose poavers are subject to defined limitations. They do, however, show that such real or supposed invasion of the interests of the public was a well known subject for the exercise of legislative power. The definite proposition of counsel upon this point is that although the act is an exercise of legislative power, it transcends the provisions of the state and Federal constitutions which render inviolable the rights of liberty and property, which include the right to make contracts. It would be difficult to place too high an estimate upon these guaranties, and they include the right to make contracts. But it is settled that these guaranties are themselves limited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>public welfare or the exercise of the police power. Although that power may not be conclusively defined, its nature and attributes have been the subject of much investigation. In all considerate discussions of the subject it is conceded that in the exercise of this power the legislature can prohibit only those uses of property which are hurtful to the public, and the inhibited use must be hurtful in a legal sense. That contracts like these are hurtful in that sense has been held in more cases than it would be practicable to cite. They abound throughout nearly three centuries of the development and administration of the common law in England and America. We cite, because of their full consideration of the subject and their direct application to legislation of this character, <em>United States </em>v. <em>The Trans-Missouri Freight Association, </em>166 U. S., 290; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Joint Traffic Association, </em>171 U. S., 505; <em>United States </em>v. <em>The Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co., </em>54 U. S. App., 723. These cases are applicable, since the provisions of the Federal anti-trust statute are not substantially different from those of the Ohio act which are brought under consideration in these cases, and there is no substantial difference between the contracts or constitutional provisions involved. That the contracts there considered were in restraint of commerce between states, served only to bring the subject within federal jurisdiction. The considerations affecting the validity of the legislation are in all respects as applicable here as there. Since the contract alleged in these petitions is for the sole purpose of restraining trade or limiting competition, we find no decision which doubts that they are in a legal sense hurtful to the public. There appear to be differences of opinion respecting the test of the reasonableness of contracts of sale where the good will of a business is in part the subject of the transaction and there are restraints imposed upon the vendor to secure the purchaser in the subject of the sale. But such doubts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>do not extend to contracts whose only purpose is to* impose such restraints. Such contracts have been uniformly held to be unlawful. They cannot be reasonable in a sense which would bring the right to make them within the protection of any guaranty of either the state or federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>The demurrers are sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
