Ohio by the Attorney General, brought its action in the court of common pleas of Warren county to quiet its title to a certain lot of lands in the village of Franklin in said county, and forming a part of what is known as the Great Basin of the Miami and Erie canal. The petition averred that the state was the owner in fee simple and in actual possession of said lot of land, and that the defendant claimed an estate and interest therein, and averred that the defendant had no estate or interest in the lands, and prayed that the title of the state be quieted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-12\">The answer denied that the state was in possession of the lands, denied that the state had title to the lands, and set up a tax title and deed thereunder at delinquent tax sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-13\">The reply denied all the new matter in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-14\">In the court of common pleas a decree was rendered in favor of the state, and the cause was taken on appeal to the circuit court, and upon trial in that court the decree was against the state, and in favor of the defendant in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-15\">The circuit court made a finding of facts separate from its conclusions of law as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201cCONCLUSIONS OF FACT:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">\u201cThat this is an action to quiet title to real estate; that the real estate in question is situated in Franklin, Warren county, Ohio, and was formerly known as the Great Basin; that in the year 1828 the Miami and Erie canal was built through said Franklin, Warren county, Ohio, and that said land in said year was by the State of Ohio, plaintiff herein, without any grant of title or proceeding in condemnation, flooded with water, and the same was thereafter for several years used by the state for canal purposes as a part of the said Miami and Erie canal; that the State of Ohio flooded said basin with water from said canal for the full length of said basin; that there was no obstruction or barrier existing between said canal and basin; that the water from said canal flowed freely from said canal into said basin for the full length of said basin; that the plaintiff herein, the State of Ohio, used said basin property for canal purposes for years thereafter; that said plaintiff used said basin all of said time in connection with said canal, for turning its boats and canal boats in use and traversing said canal. That during a period of said time said state cleaned out said basin and removed the mud and earth therefrom to keep it navigable for, boats traversing said, canal. About the year 1848 the State of Ohio ceased to use said land in question and described in the petition for canal purposes, and the grantors of defendant, who before the state had so used the said land, owned the same, took possession thereof, claimed to be the owners thereof and erected buildings thereon and used said land until 1886, when the land was leased by one William H. Squires, who had acquired the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>title thereto of said original owners, to P. P. Maxwell, for one year with the privilege of five years. This lease expired in July, 1891, but said Maxwell did not yield possession of said land to said Squires, grantor of defendant, but acquired a lease from the State of Ohio for said lands for a period of fifteen years, while said Maxwell was holding the same as the tenant of said Squires, and has paid rent to the State of Ohio since November, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">\u201cIn 1890 the State of Ohio by its Board of Public Works and Canal Commissioners, caused said land to be surveyed and platted, and claimed to be the owner thereof, and asserted title thereto, and in August, 1890, duly executed and delivered to said P. P. Maxwell a lease for said lands for a period of fifteen years from that date, while he was holding under said lease from Squires and as his tenant, and said Maxwell has remained in possession of said land ever since, and has refused to pay rent to said Squires or the defendant herein, but since November, 1890, has paid to the State of Ohio rent for the premises according to the terms of its said lease to him. And the court further finds that the only right or claim of the state to the possession of said premises is by virtue of the possession of Maxwell. In May, 1894, said William H. Squires executed a deed to the defendant, Charles H. Griftner, for said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">\u201cAnd the court further find that the plaintiff in this case, the State of Ohio, had, at the commencement of this action, no possession of said land except as above stated.

L., 50), for the state to have acquired title to such lands as the canal commissioners, or any of them, considered necessary for canal purposes was merely to enter upon, take possession of, and use the same for canal purposes, either by themselves, their superintentendent, agent, or engineer. That such acts constituted an \u201cappropriation\u201d under that statute. And that the title so acquired, and vested in the state, is a fee simple. 34 Ohio St., 541; <em>Ohio ex rel. </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 189; <em>Vought </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>58 Ohio St., 160; <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>The Valley Ry.

No reversion works against the state by reaon of non-user. Walker\u2019s American law, page 344; Anderson\u2019s Law Dictionary; Washburn\u2019s Real Property, Vol II, page 344; <em>Ohio ex rel. </em>v. <em>Ry. Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">The title acquired by the state being an unqualified fee, where was there any \u201cresidue of an estate remaining in the grantor?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-7\">The act in question under which canal lands were thus appropriated (23 O. L., 57) did not make the fee simple title conditional upon continuous user or occupancy, nor did it provide for any reversion of the title to the original grantors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-8\">Possession by the state follows from its owner ship, and the state cannot be disseized except in the manner provided by the statute. Its ownership being continuous since 1828, its possession is likewise continuous; no act amounting to disseizin being shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">Examining the finding of facts critically, one cannot help but characterize the ownership or possession claimed by the defendant as a \u201cpretentious, bald assertion,\u201d with nothing to support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-10\">.Can an individual acquire title or possession to state property by \u201cclaiming to be the owner thereof, and erecting buildings thereon?\u201d The proposition answers itself. We admit that, as between individuals, such an assumption of possession might ripen into a title in the claim after a term of years, if it be exclusive, adverse and continuous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-11\">But such a rule never obtained against the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>To be possession at all, it must be such possession as would ripen into a title in time. And as against the state no such title can ever accrue. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Pet., 666; <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Rensellear, 8 </em>Barb., 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>10 Barb., 120; <em>Kingman </em>v. <em>Sparrow, </em>12 Barb., 201; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>6 Pick., 409; <em>Burgess </em>v.

L., 491.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">It was said by the circuit court that Maxwell was the tenant of Squires, a former claimant to said lands, and at the time of entering into a lease with the State of Ohio, he had not surrendered possession under the lease made with Squires; hence, that he, at that time, was not a tenant of the state, and this action cannot be maintained, as the state was not in possession itself, or by its tenant Section 5779, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-7\">We admit that, in order to maintain the action, the plaintiff, the state of Ohio, must set forth and prove actual possession, and also must have the legal title. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>8 Ohio, 382; <em>Buchannan </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>2 Ohio St., 251; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 Ohio St., 540; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>5 Ohio, 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-8\">It could only be by virtue of a lease executed under the provisions of the canal commissioner\u2019s act found in Vol. 86, Ohio Laws, page 270. No other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>way is provided by statute. It is unnecessary to state that the defendant herein had no such lease from the state, but the lease to Maxwell, the tenant of the state, made about August, 1890, was made pursuant to this act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-4\">Under section 5 of said act, before the commis' sion could enter into such lease, such commission shall find the land to be the property of the state; and with the board, of public works, and its chief engineer, shall first determine it not to be necessary for the actual use for the canals of said state; and it further provides the terms they may lease it upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">The finding of facts showing that the state executed a lease to Maxwell for said lands, it will be presumed, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that all the necessary steps were taken, acts done, and findings made by the proper authories before entering into such lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">We think the maxim, \u201comnia rite acta prsesumuntur\u201d is properly applied to such a case. We should not presume a state of facts which would \u201cinvalidate the record.\u201d <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>17 Ohio St., 579; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>28 Ohio St., 561; <em>Lessee of Winder </em>v. <em>Sturling, </em>7 Ohio, 539.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-7\">We contend that section 5779, Revised Statutes, does not contemplate that a mere \u201csquatter\u2019s\u201d occupation of real estate is \u201cpossession,\u201d such as would preclude the rightful owner from maintaining an action against him to quiet his title. And if the defendant was occupying the land at all, which we deny, it could only be as a \u201csquatter,\u201d or trespasser, one without any claim of right. <em>Grubb </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>34 Iowa, 150; Washburn Real Property, Vol. 3, page 139; <em>Pulaski County </em>v. <em>State, </em>42 Ark., 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The state can never lose its title by \u201cadverse possession\u201d in another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-6\">The defendant, Griftner, did not get a deed of said lands from Squires, the pretended owner, until in May, 1894. At that time Maxwell was onr tenant. Griftner, therefore, never acquired any possession himself; and as this action is against him alone we are not concerned with the claims, if any, made by his grantors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">The state\u2019s possession at the time of his purchase was notice to him of onr title, and he took such deed as he received with knowledge of all our rights. <em>Talbut </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>42 Cal., 395; <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Hard, </em>58 Vt., 217; (S.

When the state quit using the lands for canal purposes in the year 1848 the former owners, and those claiming under them, entered upon the lands, claiming to be the owners, and erected buildings thereon and used the lands until 1886, and then made a lease of the lands to one P. P. Maxwell, which lease by its terms ran to July, 1891. This entry upon the lands and claiming to be the owners thereof was without warrant of law, and gave the former owners of the lands no color of title, because as against the state their possession could not ripen into a title.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In the year 1890 the state caused these canal lands to be surveyed and platted, and claimed to be the owner thereof and asserted title thereto, and in August of that year duly executed and delivered a lease of said lands to said. P. P. Maxwell for a term of fifteen years, while he was holding under said lease from the\" former owners and as their tenant, and he has remained in possession of said lands ever since, and has paid rent to the state, and. refused to pay rent to the former owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Under this state of facts, the question is whether the state was in possession of the lands by its tenant. The state claimed and was the owner of the lands, surveyed and platted the same, asserted title thereto and made a lease thereof and received the rent therefor. These facts clearly constitute possession by tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">But it is urged by counsel for defendant in error that as Mr. Maxwell had accepted a lease of these lands from the former owners, and was in possession of the lands under that lease when he accepted the lease from the state, that the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that a tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord is applicable, and that the possession of Mr. Maxwell continued to be the possession of the former owners, and could not become the possession of the state. The rule that a tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord is sound, and we have no fault to find with the rule in cases where it is applicable. The rule has application only to litigation between landlord and tenant and those claiming under them. This is not such a case. Here the litigation is not between landlord and tenant, but between two parties, each of whom claims to own the fee simple. The state does not claim under or from Mr. Maxwell, and he is not a party to the suit. In an action by the former owners against Mr. Maxwell for possession, the rule of evidence that the tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord would obtain, but that rule cannot have the effect to oust an actual possession by a mere theoretical one, in an action to quiet title. In such an action the possession need not be acquired rightfully, so long as' it is actual. The object of the action is to test and quiet the title, and this may be done by any one in actual possession, and the question as to whether the possession is rightful will usually be settled by the judgment as to the title. The right to bring the action is not limited by the statute to one rightfully in possession, but it may be brought by anyone in possession. The matter of the right is involved in the trial of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">It is not a question as to what Mr. Maxwell can or cannot do as to disputing the title of his landlord, whether such landlord be the state or the former owners, but the question is whether the state had the power to put him into actual possession of its lands while he held, as against the state, a wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ful possession of the same lands under a lease from persons having no color of title. We think the state had such power. In Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, section 705, the author says: \u201cSo an adverse claimant, who gets into possession of land by tampering with the tenant can not resist the landlord\u2019s claim where the tenant himself could not.\u201d This clearly implies that an adverse claimant may get into actual possession by tampering with the tenant, and being thus in actual possession, our statute enables him to test the question as to title, by an action to quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We therefore hold that under the facts as found by the circuit court, the possession of Mr. Maxwell under his lease from the state, was the possession of the state, and that his. duty to the former owners did not, as between the state and such former owners, disqualify him from becoming the actual tenant of the state, and that his possession under such actual tenancy was and is the possession of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The title to these lands being in the state, the auditor of Warren county had no authority to put the lands upon the duplicate for taxation, and the tax sale and the deed of the auditor were void, and conferred no right upon the purchasers to hold the lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The judgment of the circuit court upon the facts found should have been for the state, and its judgment will therefor\u00e9 be reversed, and judgment rendered by this court for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment for plaintiff in error.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
