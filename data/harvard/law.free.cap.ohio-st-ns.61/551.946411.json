An appeal having been taken to the court of common pleas, the plaintiffs below filed their petition, setting forth that the defendant connects with the Ohio River Railroad at Wheeling, West Virginia; that on or about February 1, 1895, they delivered to The Ohio River Railroad a car of lumber to be carried to the city of Toledo, Ohio, via defendant\u2019s line of railway for a compensation to be paid at the determination of the carriage; that the lumber was carried over the defendant\u2019s road and arrived in Toledo about Feb. 5, 1895, and remained in possession of the defendant up to and after February 21, 1895, at which time the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>signee of said lumber, The Gashe Lumber Company, was insolvent and has remained so since that date; that said lumber had been sold to The Gashe Lumber Company on credit, and that the purchase price has not been paid; that on February 21, 1895, the plaintiffs gave notice to the defendant of stoppage <em>in transit </em>and requested it to hold the lumber subject to the order of the plaintiffs; that they demanded possession of defendant and tendered the amount claimed by defendant to be due for freight, but defendant refused to give possession of the lumber and has converted the same to its own use; and that the lumber was reasonably worth, after allowance for the freight thereon, the sum of |262.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\">The answer of defendant admitted that on or about February 5, 1895, the said car of lumber was by it transported to Toledo, and alleged that on or about the 7th day of February, 1895, it delivered the lumber to the said Gashe Lumber Company; and that after said delivery The Gashe Lumber Company sold the same to the defendant and the same thereby became the property of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">The plaintiffs replied, denying that the car of lumber was ever delivered to The Gashe Lumber Company) and alleging that it was in the exclusive possession of defendant as a common carrier to and after February 21, 1895; that said company was insolvent on February 7,1895, and that defendant knew it; that the alleged sale did not take place until after February 9, 1895, on which date a receiver was appointed for The Gashe Lumber Company, and that the only consideration for such sale was the reduction of the then existing debt of The Gashe Lumber Company to the defendant. It is further stated in the reply that The Gashe Lumber Company obtained the lumber on credit by falsely and fraudulently representing that it was solvent and able to pay for the lumber when the credit expired, and that on February 21, 1895, on learning of the insolvency of said lum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ber company, they elected to rescind said sale and retake said lumber, and on that day notified the defendant to hold the lumber subject to the order of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-4\">The court of common pleas, there being an agreed statement of facts and a jury being waived, found for the plaintiffs and rendered a judgment against the defendant, The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway Company, for $295.41, with interest and costs. This judgment was affirmed by the circuit court; and the case comes into this court by petition in error to reverse the judgment of the circuit court and of the common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-5\"><em>Swayne, Hayes &amp; Tyler, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-6\">1. It is conceded that the lumber in controversy was sold by the plaintiffs to The Gashe Lumber Company upon credit. Therefore, the absolute title thereto and the right to the possession thereof passed to and vested in the vendee. Benjamin on Sales, 6th Ed., Sec. 677.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\">2. A sale of goods upon credit vests in the vendee the absolute title thereto, which is not divested by reason of his insolvency or failure to pay the contract price therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-8\">3. A sale of goods upon credit vests in the vendee the right to the immediate possession thereof, and of this right he may be divested if, before the goods are in his actual or constructive possession, he becomes insolvent. <em>Bloxam </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>4 B. &amp; C., 941.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-9\">4. It is conceded that the plaintiffs delivered the lumber in controversy to a common carrier for transportation to the vendee, The Gashe Lumber Company, of Toledo, Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-10\">It is well settled that when the vendor assumes or undertakes to send goods to the vendee a delivery thereof to a common carrier is a delivery to the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>chaser. <em>Emery\u2019s Sons </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>25 Ohio St., 360; <em>Wigton </em>v. <em>Bowley, </em>130 Mass., 252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-4\">5. From these principles of law and conceded facts it is evident that when the plaintiffs delivered the lumber they had sold on credit, to the railway company, for transportation, the absolute title thereto and the right to the possession thereof vested in The Gashe Lumber Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-5\">It is, however, well settled that, in every sale upon credit there is implied an agreement that the buyer shall remain solvent until the goods purchased come into his possession, and a breach of this implied agreement revests in the vendor the right of possession for the sole and only purpose of enabling him to enforce his lien for the contract price. It is upon this principle that the doctrine of stoppage in transitu is based. Benjamin on Sales, Section 828; <em>Penna. Co. </em>v. <em>American Oil Works, </em>126 Pa. St., 485.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-6\">6. In order that the right of stoppage in transitu may be exercised, the goods must be in transit; that is, in the possession of the carrier as carrier. Benjamin on Sales, section 841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-7\">7. The right of stoppage in transitu cannot be exercised after the goods have come into the actual or constructive possession of the vendee. Hutchison on Carriers, section 416a. Benjamin on Sales, Sec. 839.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-8\">A failure to observe the different senses, in which the words \u201cconstructive possession\u201d and. \u201cconstructive delivery\u201d are used by the courts, has led to some confusion. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 908.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-9\">There are many cases illustrative of the well-recognized principle of law that even a constructive delivery by carrier to the consignee will defeat the vendor\u2019s right of stoppage in transitu. <em>Foster et al. </em>v. <em>Frampton, </em>6 B. &amp; C., 111; <em>Whitehead </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>9 M. &amp; W., 518; <em>Langstaff et al. </em>v. <em>Stix et al., </em>28 A. &amp; E.

What will cut off the right of stoppage in transitu?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-7\"><em>(a) </em>The right of stoppage in transitu is not cut off or defeated by an attachment or other legal process issued on behalf of a creditor of the vendee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-8\">This decision is supported by all the authorities of which we cite: <em>Kitchen </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>30 Vt., 545; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>16 Md., 122; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>21 La.

Sc. 17 App. Rep., 28; <em>Mottram </em>v. <em>Heyer, </em>5 Denio (N. Y.), 629; <em>Donath v. Broomhead, </em>7 Pa. St., 301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-6\"><em>(f) </em>The mere arrival of the goods at the town or city of the buyer, if they still remain in the hands of the carrier, as carrier, does not terminate the right of stoppage. <em>White </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>38 Mich., 390; <em>Greve </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>60 Ia., 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-7\"><em>{g) </em>A vendor\u2019s right of stoppage in transitu is not terminated by the goods coming to the hands of a shipping agent appointed by the vendee. The transit continues until the goods come into the possession of the vendee or of some agent authorized to act in respect to the disposition of them otherwise, and by forwarding them to the vendee. <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Mouille, </em>14 Pa.

Div., 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-9\">(i) Whether a delivery of part of the goods will cut off the right of stoppage as to the remainder, must depend upon the facts of each case. <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Scovill, </em>14 Mess. <em>&amp; </em>W., 28; <em>Secomb </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>14 B.

C. Q. B., 590; <em>Feise </em>v. <em>Wray, </em>3 East, 93; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Brewer, 2 </em>Mess. &amp; W., 375; <em>Diem </em>v. <em>Koblitz, </em>49 Ohio St., 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\">(7) While stoppage in transitu is an adverse proceeding and must be exercised adversely to the consignee, that is, it must not be asserted under a title derived from the vendee, still it need not be asserted in hostility to the vendee. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>1 La., 64; <em>Naylor </em>v. <em>Dennie, </em>8 Pick. (Mass.), 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-7\"><em>(m) </em>Lapse of time between the sale of the goods and notice of stoppage does not defeat the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-8\"><em>(n) </em>The entry of goods at custom house by the vendee for the payment of duties, does not terminate the right of stoppage in transitu. In such case, goods are in the possession of the United States or their officers. <em>Fraschieris </em>v. <em>Henriques, </em>6 Abb. Pr. N.

Mon. (Ky.), 324; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Yeatman, </em>15 B. Mon. (Ky.), 270; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>27 Barb. (N.

Railway Co., </em>58 Tex., 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-11\"><em>(p) </em>A mere sale of property, unaccompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>delivery, or by anything in legal contemplation operating as a change of possession, will not divest the right of the vendor to stop the goods. The purchaser from the vendee, in such case, takes only the vendee\u2019s right, subject to the contingency which may, before the goods are received, entitle the original vendor to resume the possession and hold it until the price be paid. <em>Isley </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>9 Mass., 65; <em>Wait </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>6 Grants Sc., 5 Ch. &amp; App. Rep., 154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-4\">If the consignee sells the goods and the purchaser buys them in good faith for a valuable consideration, and obtains possession, the vendor has no claim upon such purchaser. <em>U.

(N.

It had been carried to its destination, but it is not claimed that any manual delivery had been made to the consignee. There was no delivery to the consignee unless it was by construction. The facts which are claimed to constitute a constructive delivery, as they appear in an agreed statement of facts, are that the car arrived at its destination, Toledo, Ohio, on February 2, 1895; that the carrier notified the consignee of the arrival of the lumber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and that thereafter, up to and including February 7, 1895, the car, with the lumber remaining thereon, remained upon the yard track of the defendant in Toledo, <em>for delivery </em>to the consignee; and that on or about the 7th day of February, 1895, the consignee sold the said car of lumber to the defendant for the sole consideration of a pre-existing indebtedn\u00e9ss, which consisted of the freight charges on the carload of lumber in question and other indebtedness. These facts show no delivery, either manual or constructive, unless the sale by the consignee to the defendant implies it. It does not appear that the consignee paid the freight or in any manner put himself in position to demand and enforce the possession of the lumber; nor does it appear that there was any agreement between the consignee and the defendant by which the former assumed the possession of the lumber and constituted the latter his agent to hold and care for the same. But in the absence of these necessary indications of a constructive delivery to the consignee, the defendant retained the custody and control of the property under a sale which is based partly on the consideration of the freight thereon, which must have been paid before a delivery could be presumed to have taken place, and partly on the consideration of other pre-existing debts, Avhich were admitted by counsel on the oral argument to consist also of unpaid freight bills. Such a sale Ave do not think would constitute the defendant a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser; and we are of the opinion that the lumber Avas still in transit at the time when the plaintiffs gave notice of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>and tendered to defendant the freight due to it for the transportation of the lumber. The case having been twice reported heretofore (5 N. P., 15; 15 C. C., 288) it is unnecessary to review the authorities cited by counsel, nor to cite others.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\n<em>The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
