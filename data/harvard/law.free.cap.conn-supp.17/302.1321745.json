The following appears in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the finding and award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-17\">\u201c7. It is found that the claimant had a congenitally weak back which made him susceptible to injury. The accidental injury of July 29, 1946 was a ruptured disc at the 4-5 lumbar interspace. The rupture responded to conservative treatment and partially healed, achieving maximum improvement in January, 1950, at which time the claimant had a residual permanent disability of 15%. On June 29, 1950, the claimant sustained a new accidental injury, consisting of a reopening of the old rupture at the 4-5 lumbar interspace. . The two accidents were equal, concurrent and contributing causes of the claimant\u2019s disability since that date, the second injury being superimposed upon and an aggravation of the condition remaining from the first injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-18\">\u201c8. The average weekly wage on June 29, 1950 was $69.01, and the compensation rate is therefore $32.00 per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201c9. The respondent-employer and the respondent-insurers are directed to pay the claimant compensation for total disability at the rate of $32.00 a week for the period of 15-3/7 weeks from June 29 to October 16, 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201c10. The respondents are further ordered to pay the following medical bills which are found to be reasonable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Dr. Burr H. Curtis and Dr. Walter L. Butterfield</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">Treatment ..................................$ 68.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">Appearance at hearing......................... 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Dr. Benjamin Whitcomb Treatment .................................. 315.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">Appearance at hearing......................... 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">Hartford Hospital............................... 568.82</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">In addition, the respondents are ordered to reimburse the claimant for incidental medical expenses incurred by him in the amount of $14.26, and for transportation in connection with his medical treatment, and to assume charges for continuing medical treatment recommended by Dr. Curtis as attending physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">In their reasons of appeal the respondents in No. 19934 claim that the commissioner erred in refusing to correct the finding in the respects set out therein, in failing to dismiss the claim as against them, and in failing to find liability solely on the respondents, Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., and Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">In their reasons of appeal the respondents in No. 19933 claim that the commissioner erred in refusing to correct the finding in the respects set out therein, in concluding \u201cthat the two accidents were equal, concurrent and contributing causes of the claimant\u2019s disability since June 29, 1950,\u201d and that the commissioner erred \u201cin holding both insurers liable instead of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">\u201cUpon an appeal to the Superior Court from a finding and award of a compensation commissioner the court cannot retry the facts. It inquires into the facts merely to determine whether the finding and award appealed from are unauthorised in law, irregular or informal, or based upon a misconception of the law or of the powers or duty of the administrative tribunal, \u2018 \u201cor are so unreasonable as to justify judicial interference.\u201d \u2019 Ken<em>nerson </em>v. <em>Thames Towboat Co., </em>89 Conn. 367, 370. . . . \u2018The court cannot review conclusions of fact made by a commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>which merely concern the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond </em>Co., 89 Conn. 143, 153. . . . \u2018The foundation underlying the power which the Superior Court exercises in correcting the finding of a commissioner is its right to correct the finding when it is \u201cso unreasonable as to justify judicial interference.\u201d \u2019 <em>Leszczymski </em>v. <em>Radel Oyster Co., 102 </em>Conn. 511, 516. . . .\u201d <em>Fiengo </em>v. <em>E. Vitale, Inc., </em>125 Conn. 559, 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Judgment is rendered in each case dismissing the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
