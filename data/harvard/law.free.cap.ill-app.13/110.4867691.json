The building was partially destroyed by fire, causing a loss of $540. The declaration was in the usual form, containing two special counts on the policy, and also the common counts. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and gave notice thereunder \u201c that the plaintiff forfeited his policy, by allowing a smoke house to be and remain on said insured property, and that the fire occurred by reason of the existence of said smoke house.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-13\" pgmap=\"114\">The policy contained among other clauses, the following: \u00a3\u2018If the risk be .increased by the erection or occupation of neighboring buildings, or by any means whatever, within the control of the assured, without the consent of this company indorsed thereon, this policy shall be void.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-3\" pgmap=\"115\">The case was tried by a jury, who found the issues for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at one cent.

The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to support the allegations in his declaration, and the jury found the issues in his favor. By the undisputed evidence the damages proved amounted to the sum of $540. If the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the verdict should have been for r,hat sum; if he was not entitled to recover, the verdict should have been for the defendant. The record as it stands, is simply a judicial burlesque, and, if allowed to remain unreversed, would reflect unfavorably upon the administration of justice in courts of law.</p> <p id=\"b116-7\" pgmap=\"116\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b116-8\" pgmap=\"116\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
