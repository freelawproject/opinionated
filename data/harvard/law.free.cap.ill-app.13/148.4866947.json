But, in opposition to the facts on which that theory was based, the defendant introduced several witnesses, who directly contradicted the plaintiff and his witnesses, and who also gave testimony tending to show that the plaintiff was himself guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury complained of. The court, on behalf of the plaintiff, gave to the jury this instruction:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\" pgmap=\"153(222) 154(139)\">\u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that Heaney, the foreman, was in charge of a gang of men, of which the plaintiff was one, and that said Heaney had the power to direct and order the men where they were to work, and how they were to work, just as the employer would, and that he, Heaney, in the conduct of such business, had the authority and exercised the right to hire, or discharge the men under him, and that said Heaney, if thus employed, and acting by the authority of the defendant corporation, directed the plaintiff to go to work undermining the bank in question, and that after said bank had been undermined some feet, the plaintiff asked said Heaney (if the bank was not getting dangerous, while said Heaney was standing on top of bank, and that said Heaney told plaintiff that it was not, and to go on and dig it good and he would watch and give him notice, and that thereupon the. plaintiff relied upon the assurance of said Heaney, and went to work again undermining, and that within a minute or immediately thereafter, said bank fell and injured plaintiff, and if the jury further believe from the evidence, in addition to the above, that the position of the said Heaney on said bank, was one which afforded him better opportunity for knowing the danger, than that occupied by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff was guilty of no negligence himself in so working, and if they believe from the evidence that said Heaney, if so authorized and constituted by the defendant, was guilty of negligence or indifference to the personal safety of plaintiff in so directing him to work, if he had so directed him, or in failing to properly notify him of the danger, if he did so fail, and if they believe from the evidence and circumstances proven, that the negligence of Heaney was gross in that respect, and that the negligence of the plaintiff, if any, was slight, then the jury will find the defendant guilty, and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at whatever sum the evidence will sanction.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\" pgmap=\"154\">The jury found the defendant guilty and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at two thousand dollars.

Suffice it to say that, in our judgment, it is a clear case for the application of the rule in regard to the accuracy of instructions above indicated.</p> <p id=\"b157-5\" pgmap=\"157\">The instruction given for the plaintiff below was defective and inaccurate in several particulars. First, it contains no hypothesis that the plaintiff was in the exercise of ordinary care or diligence in the protection of his person from injury at the time of the occurrence of such injury. That the plaintiff was not entirely free from contributory negligence, is clear from the evidence beyond doubt. That being so, it should have been submitted to the jury to determine whether he was in the exercise of ordinary care, for it was indispensable to recovery for the mere negligence of the defendant, in any point of view, that the plaintiff was in fact in the exercise of ordinary care to protect himself at the time the occurrence happened. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Ill. 512, and cases there cited. Bo such proposition of fact was submitted, and then the court told the jury that \u201c if they believed from the evidence and circumstances proven, that the negligence of Heaney was gross in that respect, and that the negligence of the plaintiff, if any, was slight, then the jury will find the defendant guilty, and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at whatever sum the evidence will sanction.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b157-8\" pgmap=\"157(138) 158(48)\">If the above was intended to be an announcement of the yule of comparative negligence, which obtains in this State, it was wanting in one of its essential requirements, because there was no suggestion of a comparison of the negligence of the plaintiff with that of Heaney. Such comparison should have been required. Sterling Bridge Co. v. Pearl, 80 Ill. 251; Railroad Co. v. Delaney, 82 Ill. 198; C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Harwood, 90 Ill. 425; Wabash R. R. Co. v. Henks, 91 Ill. 406; East St. Louis Packing, etc. Co. v. Hightower, 92 Ill. 139; N. W. R\u2019y Co. v. Dimick, 96 Ill. 42. And the court still adheres to the formula of comparison in the late case of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 103 Ill. 522, not withstanding it there defines the terms \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cgross,\u201d as applied to negligence, and holds that neither of them admits of any comparison. It is not for us, being a subordinate court, to change or modify the rule,\" nor can we disregard a depart-. nre from it.</p> <p id=\"b158-4\" pgmap=\"158\">The instruction is erroneous, in that it does not expressly require the jury to find, as a fact, that the injury complained of. was caused by the negligence of the defendant or its authorized servant.</p> <p id=\"b158-5\" pgmap=\"158\">We think, also, that the direction to the jury that if they found the defendant guilty, \u201cthey should assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at whatever sum the evidence will sanction,\u201d was not proper, because it embodied no rule of damages, but left the whole subject to the unlimited discretion of the jury. It should have been at such sum as would be a just compensation to the plaintiff for the injury sustained, as shown by the evidence. For the error in giving that instruction, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b158-6\" pgmap=\"158\">\u00a1Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
