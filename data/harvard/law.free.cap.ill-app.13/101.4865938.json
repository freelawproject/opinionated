So far as the record discloses, they were never brought within the jurisdiction of the court. The summons issued by the justice was served upon Bartlett only, and he alone appeared. Judgment was rendered by the justice against him only, and he alone appealed. Hibbard and Spencer neither joined in the appeal, nor were brought into the superior court by process, nor did they appear to the suit in person or by attorney. The fact that they were copartners with Bartlett did not authorize the rendition of a judgment against them in a suit to which they had not been made parties by the service of process or by their voluntary appearance. The' court was, therefore, without jurisdiction to render judgment against them.</p> <p id=\"AdE\" pgmap=\"107\">But had appellants all been properly before, the court, we are of opinion that appellee was not entitled to recover in his own name upon the tickets in question. They were neither due-bills nor promissory notes, but. naerely acknowledgments of indebtedness to the person to whom they were issued. While no particular form of words is necessary to constitute a promissory note, and while it need not contain the words \u201cpromise to pay,\u201d it is settled that in the absence of such words, there must be other words of equivalent import. Parsons on Notes and Bills, 24. Thus the words \u201c good to A B or order for $100,\u201d held, a promissory note. Franklin v. March, 6 N. H. 364. So where the promise was to be accountable to A or order, for $100. Morris v. Lee, 2 Ld. Raym. 1396. In these and like cases, it is held that the words used are equivalent to a promise to pay.</p> <p id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">Here the only words used are \u201c Cartage Ticket, 50 cents, Hibbard, Spencer &amp; Co.\u201d There is not only no promise to pay, but no words of equivalent import. Standing alone, and without extraneous proof, their meaning and effect is wholly conjectural; and to characterize as a negotiable promissory note, an instrument which is so uncertain or defective in its terms as to require outside proof of its meaning, is unwarranted.</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107(94) 108(47)\">It appeared in evidence that the tickets in question were issued to Fitzgerald by appellants, from time to time, for carting goods to and from their store, and the amounts represented by the tickets were paid to him or his employes upon presentation to appellants. We can not regard these tickets as constituting negotiable paper, any more than would be a pass book, in which had been entered credits for like services rendered. The most that can be properly claimed for them is, that thev are in the nature of vouchers, or acknowledgments of services rendered by Fitzgerald to appellants, upon which the law implies a promise to pay to him, but not to a third person, for such services. They are merely non-negotiable dioses in action, upon which suit can only he brought in the name of Fitzgerald.</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">In Weston v. Myers, 33 Ill. 424, relied on by the learned counsel for appellee, the words of the instruction were \u201cgood for fifty cents.\u201d They were held to constitute a promissory note; and properly, the words \u201cgood for\u201d being, as already said, equivalent to the words \u201cI promise to pay.\u201d That case is not in conflict with the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b108-7\" pgmap=\"108\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
