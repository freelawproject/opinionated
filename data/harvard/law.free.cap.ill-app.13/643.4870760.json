Moving on house\u2014Permission to cross railroad track\u2014 Agency-\u2014Plaintiff hired a licensed house mover to move his house, and obtained a permit of the commissioner of public works, as required by law, authorizing the removal of the house in question. Among the conditions of the permit was the following: \u201c No right to move the building along or across any railroad track is given, unless the consent of the officers of any such railroad to occupy the track shall be first obtained.\u201d The house mover obtained permission of defendant\u2019s ticket agent to cross the track a,t a certain time, and while the house was being moved over the track, it was run into and damaged by a train of defendant. Held, that as the right to cross is expressly withheld unless preceded by the consent of the \u201cofficers\u201d of the defendant corporation, and as a mere ticket agent is in no proper sense an officer of the company, and as the injury was not wanton or willful, the company is not liable.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b647-11\" pgmap=\"647\">2. Evidence.\u2014Even if it were conceded that the company could properly delegate such authority to any one but its own officers, which the court does not admit, the point urged that the company had by its acquiescence at other times held out the ticket agent- as its agent to express its consent in like cases, is not supported by proof; for there is no evidence in the record that the company either authorized or even knew that the ticket agent had ever given such permission.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b647-12\" pgmap=\"647\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Twenty-sixth street is intersected by the railroad tracks of appellant\u2019s railroad, and while the house was being moved across the tracks, it was run into and injured about 8:20 in the evening by a northern bound freight train of appellant, and the present action was brought by appellee to recover the damages occasioned thereby.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">The original declaration contained seven counts, four in case, alleging that the injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant company, and three counts in trespass qware elauswn. Subsequently and after one trial had been had, the plaintiff filed by way of amendment as the record states, nine additional counts, all in case, the first, second and ninth of which allege that the injury happened through the negligence and carelessness of the defendant. The other six counts allege that the injury was occasioned by the defendant\u2019s willful and wanton neglect of duty, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\" pgmap=\"648\">It appeared in evidence that one W. H. Wood was ticket or station agent at Twenty-second street for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, and the Chicago, Bock Island and Pacific railroad companies. Stevens, the house-mover, testified that Wood gave him permission to cross the tracks at any time between 7:30 and 9 o\u2019clock on the evening in question. This was denied by Wood and the telegraph operator, who swear that Stevens was told that he could have from 6:40 to 7:20 if he could get across in that time, but that, he was expressly told he could not cross later than 7:30, and if he could not get over by that time, he must wait until the next morning. The evidence tended to show that Stevens on previous occasions had moved buildings across appellant\u2019s tracks by permission of Wood.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648(59) 649(13)\">The plaintiff introduced in evidence the license of Stevens, also the permit from the commissioner of public works, authorizing the removal of the house in question. The permit is made subject to various conditions, among which was the following: \u201cHo right to move the building along or across any railroad track is given, unless the consent of the officers of any such railroad to occupy the track shall first be obtained.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\" pgmap=\"649\">Evidence was also given as to the amount of damages.

By article one of chapter four of the revised ordinances of the city, a department of public works is established, including a commissioner of public works, to whom is committed the power to regulate and control the manner of using the streets, alleys, highways and public places of the city. By another ordinance it is provided that no person but a licensed house-mover shall remove any bu. ding within the limits of the city, and he is required to obtain a license therefor from the mayor of the city, and give a bond with conditions as required by the ordinance. Section 1109 provides that * * * \u201c the said licensed persons shall in each and every instance, before removing any building obtain a permit to do so from the commissioner of public works, and pay to said commissioner a fee of five dollars, whereupon said commissioner shall issue a permit, stating specifically all the conditions prescribing the route to be taken\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b650-6\" pgmap=\"650(258) 651(90)\">The plaintiff on the trial introduced the mayor\u2019s license to Stevens, also the permit of the commissioner of public works, authorizing the removal of the house in question. Among other conditions, and the only one necessary to be referred to, was the fo..owing: \u201c ISTo right to move the building along or across any railroad track is given, unless the consent of the officers of any such railroad to occupy the track shall be first obtained.\u201d Compliance with this condition was an indispensable prerequisite to the right to cross the defendant\u2019s railroad tracks. The right to cross is expressly withheld unless preceded by the consent of the \u201c officers \u201d of the defendant corporation. The insertion of a condition in the permit requiring the consent of the officers of the company, rather than that of a mere ticket agent or other subaltern, was but an act of wise and prudent forethought, for the protection of human life and property. In a large city like Chicago, penetrated to its very center by great lines of railroads, over which trains are constantly passing day and night, the discretion to permit so cumbersome and dangerous an obstruction as a building to cross its tracks, should properly be vested only in those who direct the movements of the company\u2019s trains, and know, or have the means of knowing the exact location of every train at all times, and who also have the requisite authority to hold or move them at their will. A mere ticket agent is in no proper sense an officer of the company. Regulating the movement of trains is foreign to the duties of his employment. It might as well be claimed that a flagman, a track layer, or any other mere employe of the company, could bind the company by their consent in such cases. The commissioner was careful to specify in the permit the class of persons whose consent to the crossing of the track was to be obtained, and Stevens was thus notified to whom it was necessary to apply-</p> <p id=\"b651-4\" pgmap=\"651\">It is urged, however, that Stevens had on previous occasions moved buildings across appellant\u2019s tracks, by the consent alone of Wood, and that the company had, by its acquiescence, held him out as their agent, to express its consent in like cases. If it were conceded that the company con\u2019d properly delegate such authority to any one but its own .officers, or could constitute a ticket agent an officer for such purpose, which, however, we are by no means prepared to admit, it is enough to say that there is no evidence in the record that the company either authorized or even knew that Wood had given permission to Stevens or to any person to move buildings. The proof, and the only proof on that subject, is that Stevens had frequently moved buildings across appellant\u2019s tracks by the consent of Wood. It thus appears that Stevens moved the building in question onto the track without any right so to do, and in violation of the express terms of his permit from the commissioner of public works. Being there in his own wrong, the plaintiff for whom he was acting can not recover., unless the injury inflicted was malicious or willful. This, under the evidence, there is no ground for claiming.</p> <p id=\"b651-5\" pgmap=\"651(93) 652(12)\">It may be added as a corollary to what has been said, that the plaintiff\u2019s first instruction was improper as not being based on evidence. The instruction was in substance, that if the defendant permitted Wood to hold himself out to the public as having authority to grant permits to people to move buildings across defendant\u2019s tracks, and that Stevens knew that Wood was thus held out by the defendant as having'such authority, and believed that Wood did have such authority, and acted upon it, the defendant was bound by such permit of Wood, whether lie was specially authorized to grant it or not.</p> <p id=\"b652-4\" pgmap=\"652\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed and the \"cause remanded to the court below</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
