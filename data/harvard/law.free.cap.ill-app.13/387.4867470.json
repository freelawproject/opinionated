The O. &amp; M. R. R. Co. v. Meisenheimer, 27 Ill. 30; Same v. Jones, 27 Ill. 41; T. P. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Bookless, 55 Ill. 230.</p> <p id=\"b393-7\" pgmap=\"393\">So indispensable to a recovery is such evidence held, that we have carefully examined the evidence as furnished us in the record of the case to determine whether such evidence was given on the trial, and we are constrained to say that there is an entire absence of any such testimony and therefore appellee has failed to maintain this branch of his case.</p> <p id=\"b393-8\" pgmap=\"393(111) 394(98)\">As to appellee\u2019s other ground for recovery, it appears that at the time his horses were killed lie was on the right of way of the railroad with his son and the three horses harnessed, and was plowing some furrows to let the water off the right of way. They had been there about twenty minutes when the train came along, running at the rate of about fifteen or twenty miles an hour. The horses were standing still when the train approached and were within eight or ten feet of the track on the railroad right of way and on appellee\u2019s private crossing. Just before the accident, appellee crossed the track ahead of the team to open the gate of the crossing, telling his son to follow him with the horses while he opened the gate. Appellee\u2019s son was holding the horses and they saw the train first and wanted to rush across the track and go to the stable, lie tried to hold them but was unable to do so and they had got squarely on the track when the engine struck them. This was about one half mile from the public crossing on the east and a little over a quarter from the one on the west.</p> <p id=\"b394-5\" pgmap=\"394\">It appears from appellee\u2019s own testimony given in the case, that appellant had complied with all the requirements of the statute concerning farm crossings, by the erection of gates on each side of its track at appellee\u2019s farm crossing, and no complaint is made that the injury for which appellee seeks redress was caused by any other act of appellant than the running of the train at the speed of fifteen or twenty miles an hour, and the failure to ring a bell or blow a whistle at the approach of the train to the public crossing, about half a mile west of the place of the accident, and also at the farm crossing of appellee on his farm.</p> <p id=\"b394-6\" pgmap=\"394\">In C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Lee, 68 Ill. 576, it was held that there was no general law of this State which imposes any restraint as to the rate of speed a railroad company may run it's trains, and when not prohibited by municipal regulation, it may adopt such a rate of speed as it shall deem advisable, provided always it is reasonably safe. It will be subject to no liability for the rate adopted, if the company is not otherwise at fault. To the same effect is C. &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Robinson, 9 Bradwell, 89.</p> <p id=\"b394-7\" pgmap=\"394\">Here the horses were killed while on the right of way of the company at the farm crossing of appellee. At such a crossing a railroad company is not required by our statute to ring a bell or blow a whistle. It is only where a railroad crosses or intersects any public highway that such a duty is imposed by the statute: Revised Statutes of 1874, page 808, Sec. 43.</p> <p id=\"b394-8\" pgmap=\"394(49) 395(41)\">Whether a bell was rung or a whistle blown at the public crossing half a mile west of the place of the accident is uncertain, as the substance of the testimony is that the witnesses did not hear one rung or blown; but whether, if a bell had been rung or whistle sounded half a mile from where the accident happened, appellee would have heard it and thus been warned of the approach of the train in time to prevent the accident, is too speculative to have any weight.</p> <p id=\"b395-5\" pgmap=\"395\">Evidence was also given to the jury against the objection of appellant as to what would be a reasonable or usual attorney\u2019s fee in cases of this kind, where about nine or ten hundred dollars were involved. The statute gives a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee only in cases where suit is brought against a railroad company to recover damages for failure on the part of the company to erect and maintain fences on both sides of its road. Evidence in regard to the attorney\u2019s fee in this' case, instead of being general and applying to the three horses killed and the harness destroyed, not claimed to have been caused by the want of fences, should have been confined exclusively to so much of the case as was brought and prose-en ted to recover damages to animals killed or injured for want of such fences.</p> <p id=\"b395-6\" pgmap=\"395\">We think the judgment below can not be sustained, and it therefore must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b395-7\" pgmap=\"395\">Jndgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
