The declaration was in the usual form. The defendants pleaded, 1st, non est factum, 2d, that as to any greater damages than one cent actio non because the merits of the replevin suit were never tried, and the property was the property of Widdecombe.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\" pgmap=\"159\">Issue to the country was joined on the first plea. To the second plea appellees replied, 1st, that the property was not the property of Widdecombe; 2d, the recovery by Follansbee in the Superior Court of Cook county, of a judgment against one Watson, the issuance of an execution thereon to Charles Kern, sheriff of Cook county, and levy of same upon the goods in question, which the replication alleges were the property of said Watson, and not the property of Widdecombe.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\" pgmap=\"159\">Issues of fact being joined on these replications, the case was tried by a jury, resulting in a verdict for appellee for $318. Before the case was submitted to the jury, the plaintiff, by leave of the court, withdrew his replication, setting up the judgment and execution aforesaid against Watson. Whereupon the defendant moved the court to exclude all the evidence given tending to show that Kern was sheriff, the execution and levy thereunder, the return, and the judgment against Watson; which motion was sustained, and such evidence was stricken out.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\" pgmap=\"159(19) 160(10)\">The defendant thereupon asked the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages only.

Watson executed and delivered to appellant Widdecombe, his promissory note for $300, payable one year after date, and a chattel mortgage of same date to secure the note, upon the goods mentioned in the replevin bond in suit. The mortgage was acknowledged as provided by the act concerning chattel mortgages, and was recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Cook county, January 18,1877. It also appears that immediately upon the recording of the mortgage, Widdecombe took actual possession of the goods and remained in continuous possession of the same down to the time they were seized by the sheriff upon the execution in favor of Follansbee against Watson, in March thereafter. As between Watson and Widdecombe, the goods were therefore the property of Widdecombe.</p> <p id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">Appellee by his second replication to appellant\u2019s plea of ownership, set up the recovery of a judgment against Watson in favor of Follansbee, and the seizure of the goods upon an execution issued thereon, thereby placing himself in a position as judgment creditor, to challenge the bonafides of the mortgage. Had that replication remained as a part of the pleadings in the case, any competent evidence tending to show that the mortgage was fraudulent as against creditors, would have been admissible. But the replication having been withdrawn by appellee, he was left in no position to contest the mortgage, and the court properly excluded all the evidence offered by him on that branch of the case. The mortgage being valid as between Watson and Widdecombe, and showing title in the latter to the goods, the defendant\u2019s plea of ownership was sustained, and the plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages only.</p> <p id=\"b161-6\" pgmap=\"161\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b161-7\" pgmap=\"161\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
