Landlord and tenant.\u2014A tenant in possession is not estopped by his parol agreement to pay rent, or by his actual payment of it to another not in privity with his lessor, nor having any interest in the premises, under the belief that he is the proper person to receive it, to deny the latter\u2019s title.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-11\" pgmap=\"259(49) 260(47)\">2. Estoppel\u2014Evidence.\u2014While a tenant can not affect his landlord\u2019s interest by accepting a lease from another, he may by accepting two leases of the same premises for the same time, estop himself from denying the title of either; yet an exception to this rule is recognized where 'the tenant already in possession under the first, accepts the second under the belief, through mistake, arifice or fraud, that the second lesser is privy in title with the first.

In this case, having no seal it did not of itself import a consideration, and if he who was to receive the rent neither gave possession nor was able of right to withhold or take it from him who was to pay there was none in fact, and so the agreement was void. Cornish v. Scurell, 8 Barn. &amp; Cress. 471; Claridge v. McKinzie, 4 M. &amp; G. 142; Evans v. Bidwell, 76 Pa. St. 497; Fuller v. Sweet, 30 Mich. 237.</p> <p id=\"b263-4\" pgmap=\"263\">In addition to a total want of consideration, it is manifest that in making this agreement defendant had no fraudulent purpose against the plaintiff, nor did he thereby induce any change of position on his part. Neither was he guilty of any fault or laches on his own. Anderson v. Smith, 63 Ill. 127; Glum v. Rise, 6 Watts, 44. His only weakness was credulity, and for that the plaintiff was himself too much to blame to be permitted to take advantage of it. Livingstone v. Strong, Chicago Legal News of April 7, 1883. Upon principle, then, he should not be estopped by it from showing that he made it under a misapprehension of plaintiff\u2019s relation to the title, and that another was really his landlord and had a right to the rent. Chandler v. White, 84 Ill. 436; Flower v. Elwood, 66 Ill. 447; Davidson v. Young, 38 Id. 152.</p> <p id=\"b263-5\" pgmap=\"263\">And so, upon authority-, a tenant in possession is not estopped by his parol agreement to pay rent, or by his actual payment of it, to another not in privity with his lessor, nor having any interest in the premises, under the belief that he is the proper person to receive it, to deny the latter\u2019s title. Some of the cases have already been cited. Many others in England will be found referred to and approved in Gregory v. Doidge, 3 Bing. 473, and Jew v. Wood, Craig &amp; P. 185. See also Jackson v. Cuerdon, 2 Johns. Cas. 353; Schultz v. Elliott, 30 Tenn. 182; Franklin v. Medira, 35 Cal. 558. Still others are cited in the brief of counsel for appellant, to which we do not deem it important more particularly to refer.</p> <p id=\"b263-6\" pgmap=\"263(21) 264(131)\">Our own Supreme Court has said that while a tenant can not affect his landlord\u2019s interest by accepting a lease from another, he may, by accepting two leases of the same premises for the same time, estop himself from denying the title of either. Bailey v. Moore, supra; Carter v. Marshall, 72 Ill. 609; Cox v. Cunningham, 77 Id. 547. It seems, however, from these cases, that this would be true as to the second lessor only where the tenant accepted his lease with knowledge that his title was adverse to that of the first, and agreed to hold under it as such. And an exception to the rule is certainly recognized where the tenant already in possession under the first accepts the second under the belief\u2014through mistake, artifice or fraud\u2014that the second lessor is privy in title with the first. Cox v. Cunningham, supra; Anderson v. Smith, 63 Ill. 127.</p> <p id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">Here, as is evident from the account given by the plaintiff himself, the defendant did not intend to attorn to the holder of a title adverse to that of his original lessor. The latter was just dead, and the tenant, not knowing who was the successor to his title, inquired of plaintiff. That was a question he could not solve by examination of the record, as in the case of Dunbar v. Bonesteel, 3 Scam. 32. Plaintiff knew he was seeking the present holder of the same title. If he, the plaintiff, was not, he must have known that he was not, and his statement that he was must have been a willful misrepresentation with purpose to secure an obligation from the defendant into which he knew the latter would not otherwise have .entered. That was fraudulent on his part, and if the Supreme Court holds proof of fraud essential to take the case out of the operation of the general rule, the evidence offered and excluded tended to show it. The evidence was therefore competent and its exclusion error. The deed was proper in connection with the other proof, as tending to show that Charles Etting was justified in attorning to Mansfield who by the deed was shown to be in privity with the title under which he originally entered.</p> <p id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264\">For the error of the circuit court in excluding the evidence offered, its judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity herewith.</p> <p id=\"b264-7\" pgmap=\"264\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
