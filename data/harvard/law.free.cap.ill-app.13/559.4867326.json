Sec. 1, Chap. 39, R. S., provides that all intestate estates, after all just debts and claims against such estates are fully paid, shall descend to and be distributed in the manner designated in said section. These several sections are in pari materia and are to be construed together; and when the two sections found in the chapter providing for the administration of estates speaks of \u201cdistributees,\u201d it is evident they refer to such persons only as come within the statute of distribution and take intestate estates. It was not intended by the legislature that creditors should be required to give refunding bonds with security before they can compel executors or administrators to pay their judgments. In the cases of The People v. Admire, 39 Ill. 251, and Windom v. Becker, 52 Ill. 342, the word \u201c distributees \u201d is used in the sense we have indicated; and so far as we are advised it has always been so understood by the bar. In Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary the word \u201cdistribution\u201d is defined tobe, \u201cThe division by order of the court having authority, among those entitled thereto, of the residue of the personal estate of an intestate after the payment of the debt? and charges.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">The order and judgment of the court below is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">Beversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
