In exchange for site-plan approval and a subsequent building permit, the city council demanded the dedication of a strip of land adjacent to Newburgh Road for an unrelated road-widening project. Although the plaintiff repeatedly requested that the council remove the restriction, it did not appeal the council\u2019s decision to a higher city authority. Nor did the plaintiff attempt to have the restriction lifted by way of a circuit court injunction or declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">At a council meeting on June 11, 1979, the council approved the plaintiff\u2019s site plan subject to five stated conditions, one being the dedication of land. The plaintiff refused to give away its property and submitted no revised site plan. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>proposed building was never erected. However, the City of Westland, through formal condemnation proceedings, eventually acquired the strip of land abutting Newburgh Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Later, the plaintiff brought an action against the city under 42 USC 1983, alleging that the city \"took\u201d its property without just compensation and without due process of law in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. We are asked, in this case, to determine whether this property owner is entitled to recover damages under 42 USC 1983 for the alleged taking caused by the \"wrongful\u201d denial of a building permit. Accordingly, we must first determine the procedural prerequisites for such an action and whether this plaintiff has met them.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We hold that before proceeding under 42 USC 1983, a property owner must first obtain a final decision from the particular governmental entity that is alleged to have unconstitutionally taken his property and also attempt to obtain just compensation through inverse condemnation. In the instant case, because the conditional approval of the plaintiff\u2019s site plan was not the city\u2019s final disposition of the matter, we hold that the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was not ripe for adjudication. We need not reach, therefore, the question whether the council\u2019s actions actually constituted a \"taking\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals that the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiff to proceed to trial on its \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Plaintiff-appellant, Electro-Tech, Inc., manufactures electrical and electronic products. Much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Electro-Tech\u2019s business involves contracts with the United States military. The company\u2019s manufacturing facility is located on Newburgh Road in the City of Westland.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Mr. Jack Beauchamp is the president and sole shareholder of Electro-Tech. In anticipation of securing additional contracts with the government and in order to more efficiently complete existing contracts, Mr. Beauchamp decided to build another manufacturing plant directly behind the existing facility. On October 26, 1978, Electro-Tech contracted with defendant, H. F. Campbell Company, to construct the new building. Pursuant to the agreement, Campbell was obligated to obtain a building permit and to complete construction by February 13,1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">On or about March 3, 1979, Mr. Beauchamp approved Campbell\u2019s site plan. However, before obtaining a building permit and actually beginning construction, Campbell was required to submit its plan for review by various city departments. The recommendations of these departments are then submitted to the planning commission for initial site-plan approval. The planning commission thereafter makes its recommendation to the city council for approval. After a site plan passes the council, the matter is finally submitted to the building department. The building department then examines the final site and building plans and, if approved, issues a building permit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">On February 21, 1979, representatives of the various departments met to discuss Campbell\u2019s proposed site plan. At that meeting, the representatives compiled a list of thirteen items which were required to be included in the site plan before submission to the planning commission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>city council. This list was forwarded by letter to Mr. Richard Wagner, the project director for Campbell. Although not included in the list, a recommendation was apparently made at this meeting to require, in exchange for site-plan approval and a subsequent building permit, the dedication of a twenty-seven-foot strip along the front of Electro-Tech\u2019s property for the widening of Newburgh Road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instant lawsuit concerns this dedication requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On March 22, 1979, Mr. Wagner received a letter stating that the planning commission would recommend that the city council approve the site plan contingent upon, among other things, ElectroTech\u2019s dedication of the strip adjacent to New-burgh Road. At trial, Mr. Beauchamp testified that, during the spring of 1979, he attended four or five council meetings protesting the city\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Nonetheless, at a meeting on June 11, 1979, with Mr. Beauchamp in attendance, the city council approved the site plan, subject to five stated contingencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">1) Loading area should be clearly designated as such by striping and signage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">2) A second access door in the new addition is required along the north side of the building for fire protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">3) Fire and Engineering requirements must be met on final engineering and building plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">4) <em>Dedication of 27 feet wide, approximately 210 feet in front of K2da for future Newburgh Road right-of-way.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">5) The front greenbelt area is to be graded and sodded. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Neither Campbell nor Electro-Tech attempted to appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the decision of the city council or to take the matter directly to the building department. It is also established that Electro-Tech did not attempt to have the dedication condition removed by way of a circuit court injunction or declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Soon after the meeting of June 11, however, Campbell began making revisions to the site plan to comply with the requests of the city council. Plaintiff claims that all of the contingencies except for the dedication were met. However, evidence adduced at trial suggests that Campbell never submitted a final site plan to the council or to the building department (which is ultimately responsible for issuing the building permit) and was, in fact, still revising through September of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Because of its failure to procure site-plan approval and a subsequent building permit, Campbell could not proceed with the construction of Electro-Tech\u2019s new plant. Without the additional work space, Electro-Tech alleged it could not bid on several upcoming contracts and was forced to subcontract work on existing contracts in order to meet government deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On October 15, 1979, the City of Westland sent Electro-Tech a letter offering to purchase the strip of land abutting Newburgh Road. Mr. Beauchamp rejected the initial offer, maintaining that the proposed purchase price was too low. In January of 1980, the city filed a condemnation action in Wayne Circuit Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">On May 21, 1982, Electro-Tech brought this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>action against the City of Westland,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging that the city\u2019s \"extortionary\u201d demand and \"wrongful\u201d denial of the building permit violated both state and federal law. At the pretrial motions for summary disposition, the trial court dismissed ElectroTech\u2019s state claims as being barred by governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">On June 11, 1985, Electro-Tech proceeded to trial on its claim under 42 USC 1983. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Electro-Tech in the amount of $433,052. On July 9, 1985, the city moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which was denied by order entered July 23, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The city appealed, raising four issues. Reaching only the first, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial court erred in permitting Electro-Tech to proceed to trial under 42 USC 1983.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated \"that no violation of constitutional or federal law exists where plaintiff has merely been erroneously denied initial site approval and a building permit by a city council. Plaintiff must look for a review of that decision within the state.\u201d 161 Mich App 622, 629; 411 NW2d 800 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">On March 22, 1988, we granted leave to appeal limited to the issue whether the plaintiff\u2019s judgment under 42 USC 1983 should be reinstated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Section 1983<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides a civil remedy to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>deprived of constitutional rights by individuals acting under color of state law. In <em>Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527; 101 S Ct 1908; 68 L Ed 2d 420 (1981), a state prison inmate lost a mail-order hobby kit, valued at $23.50, when a prison official negligently handled the prison mail. The inmate brought a \u00a7 1983 action, claiming a deprivation of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In deciding the fate of the respondent\u2019s claim, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">[I]n any \u00a7 1983 action the initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements to a \u00a7 1983 action are present: (1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. [451 US at 535. See also <em>Collier v City of Springdale, </em>733 F2d 1311, 1313 (CA 8, 1984), cert den 469 US 857 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">As in <em>Parratt, </em>the Westland City Council here was undoubtedly acting in its official capacity and, therefore, \"under color of state law.\u201d Our analysis, therefore, focuses, as it did in <em>Parratt, </em>on whether the plaintiff has been denied a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In its fourth amended complaint, upon which this case was tried, Electro-Tech alleged that the city council\u2019s refusal to approve its site plan and building permit violated its rights to just compensation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and due process<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court of Appeals ruled that Electro-Tech could not maintain an action under \u00a7 1983, concluding that no constitutional violation exists \"where plaintiff has merely been erroneously denied initial site approval and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>building permit by a city council. Plaintiff must look for a review of that decision within the state. It is a review of the city\u2019s decision and not tort remedies which we point out to plaintiff.\u201d 161 Mich App 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">While we are in agreement with the result reached by the Court of Appeals, we believe that its analysis is flawed by the blurring of what we believe should be three distinct inquiries: the existence of a constitutional violation, exhaustion of state administrative remedies, and ripeness. The issue whether Electro-Tech was actually deprived of its property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is distinct from the issues whether Electro-Tech was required to exhaust state administrative remedies before proceeding under \u00a7 1983 and whether the city\u2019s decision regarding Electro-Tech\u2019s property was final and, thus, judicially reviewable. We will, therefore, treat these inquiries separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">A. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"Akh\">1. REGULATORY TAKING</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">According to the Supreme Court of the United States, a taking may occur where a governmental entity exercises its power of eminent domain through formal condemnation proceedings, see, e.g., <em>Berman v Parker, </em>348 US 26; 75 S Ct 98; 99 L Ed 27 (1954) (Fifth Amendment taking), or where a governmental entity exercises its police power through regulation which restricts the use of property, see <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co v Mahon, </em>260 US 393, 415; 43 S Ct 158; 67 L Ed 322 (1922) (this claim may be framed as a Fifth Amendment taking or as a Fourteenth Amendment \"due process\u201d type taking). It is well established that land use regulation does not effect a taking if it \"substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tially advance[s] legitimate state interests\u201d and does not \"den[y] an owner economically viable use of his land.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Agins v Tiburon, </em>447 US 255, 260; 100 S Ct 2138; 65 L Ed 2d 106 (1980). See also <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v DeBenedictis, </em>480 US 470; 107 S Ct 1232; 94 L Ed 2d 472 (1987); <em>Penn Central Transportation Co v New York City, </em>438 US 104; 98 S Ct 2646; 57 L Ed 2d 631 (1978). Regulation that \"goes too far . . . will be recognized as a taking.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal, supra, </em>p 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The plaintiff in the instant case relies on two recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court to support its contention that the actions of the Westland City Council constituted a \"taking\u201d of property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v Los Angeles Co, </em>482 US 304; 107 S Ct 2378; 96 L Ed 2d 250 (1987), the Court held that where a land-use regulation effects a \"taking\u201d of all use of property, the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires payment to the property owner even where the intrusion was only temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The plaintiff, in <em>First English, </em>owned and operated a campground for handicapped children. In 1978, when a flood destroyed the facility and much of the surrounding area, Los Angeles County passed an interim ordinance prohibiting any reconstruction in the flood area. The church then brought an inverse condemnation suit in state court, claiming that the ordinance denied the plaintiff of all use of its property. _</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The county moved successfully to strike the claim on the ground that the only relief available was a declaration that the ordinance was invalid or a writ of mandamus specifically permitting the proposed use of the land. <em>Agins v Tiburon, </em>24 Cal 3d 266; 157 Cal Rptr 372; 598 P2d 25 (1979), aff'd on other grounds 447 US 255; 100 S Ct 2138; 65 L Ed 2d 106 (1980). The Supreme Court, however, recognizing the inherent unfairness of applying the <em>Agins </em>rule to the church\u2019s cause of action, held that \"where the government\u2019s activities have already worked a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective.\u201d <em>First English, supra, </em>p 321.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Electro-Tech contends that <em>First English </em>is analogous to the instant case because the city council\u2019s imposition of the improper dedication requirement resulted in its temporary failure to obtain a building permit. Thus, like Los Angeles County\u2019s flood ordinance, Electro-Tech argues that the council\u2019s condition here \"worked a taking of all use of [the plaintiff\u2019s] property\u201d and that no \"subsequent action\u201d by the City of Westland, not even the eventual condemnation of the twenty-seven-foot parcel, \"can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>for the period during which the taking was effective.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Recognizing the similarities between <em>First English </em>and the instant case, it should be noted that the <em>First English </em>Court expressly declined to address \"the quite different questions that would arise in the case of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Two weeks after <em>First English </em>was decided, the Court decided <em>Nollan v California Coastal Comm, </em>483 US 825; 107 S Ct 3141; 97 L Ed 2d 677 (1987), a case factually similar to the one before us today. In <em>Nollan, </em>the coastal commission issued the plaintiffs a permit to rebuild their beach house upon the condition that they allow the public an easement across their beach. The plaintiffs sued the commission in state court bn the ground that the condition constituted a taking.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Supreme Court agreed, reasoning that the commission\u2019s imposition of the easement condition was not a valid land-use regulation since it did not serve public purposes related to the permit requirement. For example, although the state is authorized to pursue its comprehensive public-access program by exercising its eminent domain power and paying for such easements, it cannot compel coastal residents to give away their property in furtherance of that goal. In other words, \"if [California] wants an easement across the [plaintiffs\u2019] property, it must pay for it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In Electro-Tech\u2019s view, <em>Nollan </em>is also dispositive of the constitutional issue before this Court today. According to the plaintiff, the dedication condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>here, like the easement condition in <em>Nollan, </em>does not serve any public purpose related to the building permit requirement. Electro-Tech\u2019s plans to expand its manufacturing facility are in no way related to the city\u2019s plans to widen Newburgh Road. Thus, although Westland is authorized to pursue the goals set forth in its master plan, i.e., the expansion of Newburgh Road, it cannot, within the confines of the Fifth Amendment, compel nearby landowners to give away their property in realization of that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On the basis of <em>First English </em>and <em>Nollan, </em>Electro-Tech argues that the City of Westland \"took\u201d its property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, Electro-Tech contends that it has properly asserted a claim for damages against the city under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The city, on the other hand, argues that there was no \"taking\u201d because it did in fact condemn and pay Electro-Tech for the twenty-seven-foot strip of land adjacent to Newburgh Road._</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Having reviewed the record in this case, we find that the \"taking\u201d involved in the \u00a7 1983 action is different than the \"taking\u201d involved in the city\u2019s condemnation action. The subject of the \u00a7 1983 suit is the property upon which Electro-Tech intended to build, while the subject of the condemnation suit was the twenty-seven-foot parcel abutting Newburgh Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We agree, on the basis of Nollan, that had the city actually enforced the dedication requirement, a \"permanent physical occupation\u201d of ElectroTech\u2019s land (i.e., the twenty-seven-foot parcel) would have resulted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We note, however, that the city eventually paid Electro-Tech for this parcel'of land. Similarly, in <em>Nollan, </em>a permanent physical invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s property (i.e., the land upon which the public easement was to be placed) did not occur because the commission\u2019s threatened action never came about. The <em>Nollan </em>Court simply held that the easement condition did not advance <em>any </em>legitimate state interest. <em>Id., </em>p 841.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>We acknowledge the obvious similarities between <em>Nollan </em>and the instant case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Nollan, </em>however, is procedurally distinguishable from the instant case because ripeness (finality) was never an issue there. Unlike the city council in the instant case, the commission in <em>Nollan </em>apparently placed only one condition, albeit improper,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> on the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>anee of the building permit. Thus, the plaintiffs there had no further steps to go through before coming to court to contest the improper condition. In the instant case, the council had imposed, in addition to the improper dedication requirement, four \"valid\u201d conditions on the issuance of the permit. Because Electro-Tech failed to remedy these valid requirements or to submit a revised site plan evidencing compliance therewith, it was unclear whether or how much the improper condition interfered with the owner\u2019s investment-backed expectations. Electro-Tech\u2019s claim, therefore, was not ripe for review. See discussion of <em>Williamson Co Regional Planning Comm v Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 US 172; 105 S Ct 3108; 87 L Ed 2d 126 (1985), in section n(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Because we conclude in section n(c), that the City of Westland had not made a final determination regarding the disposition of Electro-Tech\u2019s property, we need not decide at this time whether Electro-Tech has established an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">2. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Justice Brickley asserts that a property owner like Electro-Tech may \"advance a [substantive] due process claim separate and distinct from the regulatory taking due process claim\u201d discussed in this opinion. <em>Post, </em>p 94. Justice Brickley contends that Electro-Tech has, in the instant case, established \"arbitrary] and capricious[ ]\u201d action on the part of the city council in imposing the dedication condition in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>p 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In support of these assertions, Justice Brickley relies on <em>Nollan, supra, </em>and <em>Daniels v Williams, </em>474 US 327, 337; 106 S Ct 662; 88 L Ed 2d 662 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(1986). In our view, Justice Brickley mistakenly relies upon <em>Daniels </em>to support the alleged constitutional violation in the instant case. In Daniels, the plaintiff, a state prison inmate, claimed that he was deprived of due process when he slipped and fell on a pillow left on the jail stairs by a prison guard. The Court held that the Due Process Clause is <em>not </em>implicated by a state official\u2019s negligent act causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property. <em>Id., </em>p 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Unlike <em>Daniels, </em>the instant case involves a land use restriction. We recognize that at least two federal circuits have employed substantive due process in analyzing similar land use restrictions. See, e.g., <em>Bateson v Geisse, </em>857 F2d 1300 (CA 9, 1988); <em>Bello v Walker, </em>840 F2d 1124 (CA 3, 1988), cert den 488 US 868; 109 S Ct 176; 102 L Ed 2d 145 (1988). But see <em>Chiplin Enterprises, Inc v City of Lebanon, </em>712 F2d 1524 (CA 1, 1983). We find it significant, however, that the Supreme Court has yet to employ such an approach in cases involving the wrongful denial of a land use permit. In <em>Nollan, </em>for example, the Supreme Court not only applied a traditional regulatory taking analysis, but it repeatedly referred to the case as one involving a taking.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">We are not suggesting, however, that ElectroTech was foreclosed from asserting a substantive due process claim in the instant case. In fact, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>agree with Justice Brickley that both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have acknowledged the possibility of substantive due process claims in response to governmental regulation of property. See, e.g., <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co, </em>272 US 365; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926); <em>Goldblatt v Town of Hempstead, </em>369 US 590; 82 S Ct 987; 8 L Ed 2d 130 (1962); <em>Kropf v Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich 139; 215 NW2d 179 (1974); <em>Cryderman v City of Birmingham, </em>171 Mich App 15; 429 NW2d 625 (1988). Our review of the record here, however, indicates that this case was tried as a regulatory taking due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In part i of his opinion, Justice Brickley himself acknowledges that a property owner may properly assert that a land use restriction \" 'goes so far that it has the same effect as a taking by eminent domain [and] is an invalid exercise of the police power, violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>pp 93-94 citing <em>Williamson. </em>It is apparent in the instant case that Electro-Tech has asserted such a taking claim from the start. See plaintiff\u2019s fourth amended complaint and brief on appeal in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff here clearly tried its case on a regulatory taking due process theory. The record reveals that the trial court instructed the jury on the <em>\"deprivation </em>of property without due process of law.\u201d There was no instruction relating to <em>substantive </em>due process or to the \"arbitrary\u201d or \"unreasonable\u201d nature of the council\u2019s dedication requirement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>As explained by Justice Brickley, \"[r]egardless of the manner in which a 'regulatory taking\u2019 claim is framed, whether as a violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment or of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the claim does not ripen until the landowner has received a final decision regarding the application of the regulation or ordinance to the particular piece of property. <em>Williamson, supra; MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v Yolo Co, 477 </em>US 340; 106 S Ct 2561; 91 L Ed 2d 285 (1986).\u201d <em>(Post, </em>p 94.) Because the City of Westland did not have the opportunity to make a final decision regarding Electro-Tech\u2019s property, see section ii(c), we hold that its claim was not ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">EXHAUSTION OF STATE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In <em>Patsy v Florida Bd of Regents, </em>457 US 496, 550; 102 S Ct 2557; 73 L Ed 2d 172 (1982), the Supreme Court unequivocally stated that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to bringing an action under 42 USC 1983.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The plaintiff in <em>Patsy </em>filed a \u00a7 1983 action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>in federal district court, alleging that her employer intentionally denied her employment opportunities solely on the basis of her race and sex. The employer successfully moved to dismiss because the plaintiff had not exhausted available administrative remedies. However, the Supreme Court, examining the legislative history of 42 USC 1983 and noting \"the paramount role Congress has assigned to the federal courts to protect constitutional rights,\u201d decided not to overrule its prior decisions that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to a \u00a7 1983 action.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Although <em>Patsy </em>unequivocally establishes that Electro-Tech was not required to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing its \u00a7 1983 claim, other Supreme Court and lower federal court cases dealing specifically with regulatory taking have focused on the importance of obtaining a final decision from the governmental entity that is alleged to have acted unconstitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">FINALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">In <em>Williamson Co Regional Planning Comm v Hamilton Bank of Johnson </em>City, supra, 192-193, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">The question whether administrative remedies must be exhausted is conceptually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>distinct . . . from the question whether an administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable. While the policies underlying the two concepts often overlap, the finality requirement is concerned with whether the <em>initial decisionmaker has arrived at a de\u00f1nitive position on the issue </em>that inflicts an actual, concrete injury; the exhaustion requirement generally refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which an injured party may <em>seek review </em>of an adverse decision and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful or otherwise inappropriate. [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>Williamson, </em>the plaintiff bank brought a \u00a7 1983 action against the county. The plaintiff claimed, as Electro-Tech does in this case, that the local government\u2019s temporary refusal to allow development of its property constituted a compensable taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court, however, did not reach the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim because it found the action unripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The <em>Williamson </em>Court set forth two finality requirements which must be satisfied before a plaintiff may bring an action under \u00a7 1983 for damages resulting from an unconstitutional regulatory taking. First, the Court required that the plaintiff obtain a <em>\u00f1nal decision </em>regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property. <em>Id., </em>p 186, citing <em>Hodel v Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass\u2019n, Inc, </em>452 US 264; 101 S Ct 2352; 69 L Ed 2d 1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">According to <em>Williamson, </em>requiring a final decision from the appropriate administrative body prior to initiating a \u00a7 1983 action \"is compelled by the very nature of the inquiry required by the Just Compensation Clause.\u201d <em>Williamson, supra, </em>p 190.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Although \"[t]he question of what constitutes a 'taking\u2019 for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty,\u201d <em>Penn Central Transp Co v New York City, </em>438 US 104, 123 [98 S Ct 2646; 57 L Ed 2d 631 (1978)], this Court consistently has indicated that among the factors of particular significance in the inquiry are the economic impact of the challenged action and the extent to which it interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations. Those factors simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question. <em>[Id., </em>pp 190-191.

As stated previously, the building department is responsible for examining the final site and building plans (as well as the final report from the engineering department) and, if everything is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>approved, for ultimately issuing the building permit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">These facts, in our view, support the conclusion that the process for obtaining the city\u2019s permission to build had not yet been completed. The fact that the council\u2019s approval was \"conditional\u201d indicates that the entire matter had not yet been finally resolved and that Electro-Tech would have to submit an amended site plan before it could begin building. As indicated in <em>Williamson, </em>until all five of the council\u2019s objections, including the four \"valid\u201d conditions, are addressed and finally resolved (either by compliance or by refusal to comply), it is impossible to accurately determine the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s land retained any reasonable beneficial use or the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s expectation interest had been destroyed<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>We agree with Justice Brickley that the building department has no authority \"to override a condition imposed by the city council.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 107. However, this fact does not obviate the need for obtaining a final decision from the city in this case. The fact that the building department cannot overrule the city council does not, as Justice Brickley suggests, reduce the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement to a mere exercise in futility.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s primary purpose in mandating a final decision from the appropriate administrative body was to establish the existence of a \"taking\u201d and the extent to which it has harmed the plaintiff. Thus, while a final decision by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>building department in the instant case probably would not have resulted in approval of the site plan or the issuance of a building permit, it would have indeed resolved any issue regarding the four \"valid\u201d conditions and would have established a basis upon which a factfinder could conclude that \"but for\u201d the improper dedication requirement, Electro-Tech would have been able to \"derive economic benefit\u201d from its land. <em>Williamson, supra </em>at 191.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In light of the record in the instant case as well as the purpose underlying the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it would have been futile to submit an amended site plan to the building department.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The second finality requirement set forth by the <em>Williamson </em>Court is that a taking claim is not ripe until a plaintiff has sought compensation through state procedures. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation. Nor does the Fifth Amendment require that just compensation be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is required is that a \" 'reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation\u2019 \u201d exist at the time of the taking. . . . <em>Similarly, if a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation. [Id., </em>pp 194-195. Citations omitted; emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The Supreme Court reaffirmed its finality requirements in <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v Yolo Co, supra. </em>Similarly, the lower federal courts have followed suit in requiring that a plaintiff first obtain a final decision from the governmental entity that is alleged to have taken property without just compensation and utilize the state procedures for obtaining just compensation before the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim will be considered ripe for adjudication. <em>Bateson, supra; A A Profiles Inc v City of Ft Lauderdale, </em>850 F2d 1483 (CA 11, 1988); <em>Austin v City &amp; Co of Honolulu, </em>840 F2d 678 (CA 9, 1988), cert den 488 US 852; 109 S Ct 136; 102 L Ed 2d 109 (1988); <em>Kinzli v City of Santa Cruz, </em>818 F2d 1449, 1453-1455 (CA 9, 1987), cert den 484 US 1043; 108 S Ct 775; 98 L Ed 2d 861 (1988); <em>Ochoa Realty Corp v Faria, </em>815 F2d 812, 816-817 (CA 1, 1987); <em>Norco Construction Inc v King Co, </em>801 F2d 1143, 1145-1146 (CA 9, 1986); <em>Anthony v Franklin Co, </em>799 F2d 681, 683-684 (CA 11, 1986); <em>Union Pacific R Co v Idaho, </em>654 F Supp 1236, 1243-1244 (D Idaho, 1987); <em>Kaiser Development Co v City &amp; Co of Honolulu, </em>649 F Supp 926, 938-943 (D Hawaii, 1986); <em>Ross v City of Berkeley, </em>655 F Supp 820, 840-842 (ND Cal, 1987); <em>JBK, Inc v Kansas City, </em>641 F Supp 893, 908-909 (WD Mo, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Like the State of Tennessee in <em>Williamson, </em>the State of Michigan recognizes a cause of action for a de facto taking. Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2; <em>Hart v Detroit, </em>416 Mich 488; 331 NW2d 438 (1982); <em>In re Urban Renewal, Elmwood Park Project, </em>376 Mich 311; 136 NW2d 896 (1965); <em>Foster v Detroit, </em>405 F2d 138 (CA 6, 1968); <em>In re Acquisition of Virginia Park, </em>121 Mich App 153; 328 NW2d 602 (1982); <em>Detroit Bd of Ed v Clarke, </em>89 Mich App 504; 280 NW2d 574 (1979).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> An inverse or reverse condem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>nation suit is one instituted by a landowner whose property has been taken for public use \"without the commencement of condemnation proceedings.\u201d <em>Hart, supra, </em>p 494. Under Michigan law, a \"taking\u201d for purposes of inverse condemnation means that governmental action has permanently deprived the property owner of any possession or use of the property. <em>Id., </em>pp 501-502. When such a taking has occurred, the Michigan Constitution entitles the property owner to just compensation for the value of the property taken. <em>Id., </em>p 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Further, Michigan law also recognizes a cause of action for inverse condemnation in cases, like this one, without a physical taking of property, where it is alleged that the effect of a governmental regulation is \"to prevent the use of much of plaintiff\u2019s property ... for any profitable purpose.\u201d <em>Grand Trunk W R Co v Detroit, </em>326 Mich 387, 392-393; 40 NW2d 195 (1949). For example, in <em>Spanich v Livonia, </em>355 Mich 252, 259-265; 94 NW2d 62 (1959), this Court acknowledged that the application of a zoning ordinance to a particular property can constitute an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Generally, the remedy in such cases is a declaration that the regulation is unconstitutional and void. <em>Schwartz v City of Flint, </em>426 Mich 295, 308; 395 NW2d 678 (1986); <em>Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 253, 268-269; 351 NW2d 831 (1984). Assuming, however, that the plaintiff shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a proposed specific use of the property is reasonable, the trial court may additionally declare the use to be reasonable and enjoin the municipality from interfering with that use. <em>Schwartz, supra, </em>pp 325-329. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Although we found the notion \"appealing,\u201d <em>Schwartz, supra, </em>p 324, this Court has yet to decide whether plaintiffs may also be <em>compensated </em>for temporary regulatory takings. Recently, however, in <em>Poirier v Grand Blanc Twp, </em>167 Mich App 770, 774; 423 NW2d 351 (1988), the Court of Appeals adhered to the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>First English, supra, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">[It is well established] that regulation that goes too far will be recognized as a taking. Where government action works a taking, that necessarily implies the constitutional obligation to pay just compensation. That the regulation was an interim one or could be invalidated did not preclude an award for damages. The Court held that \" 'temporary\u2019 takings . . . are not different in kind from permanent takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation.\u201d <em>Where government activities effect a taking, the mere invalidation of the offending ordinance does not relieve the government of its duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective. </em>The Court did not distinguish between takings accomplished by the use of police power or by eminent domain. The key consideration was whether there had been a taking. [Citations omitted and emphasis added.][<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Having examined the entire record in this case, we are persuaded that Electro-Tech attempted to pursue an inverse condemnation action in state court<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and that the trial court improperly disposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of this claim on governmental immunity grounds.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOp\">In light of <em>both </em>finality requirements set forth in <em>Williamson, </em>however, we find that the plaintiff here has, at the most, satisfied only the second requirement. The fact that Electro-Tech was not permitted to pursue its inverse condemnation action does not obviate the fact that the plaintiff had not yet obtained a final decision from the City of Westland regarding its request to build. Accordingly, we hold that Electro-Tech has brought its \u00a7 1983 \"taking\u201d claim prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In light of <em>Williamson </em>and its progeny*, we are persuaded that Congress did not intend 42 USC 1983 to be an immediate tort recovery act for every person adversely affected by a local agency\u2019s initial zoning or building decision. In the instant case, because the conditional approval of the plaintiff\u2019s site plan was not the city\u2019s final disposition of the matter, we hold that the plaintiff\u2019s action under 42 USC 1983 was not ripe for adjudication.

Accordingly, because it would be impossible to predict when such random deprivations would occur, the state could hardly be expected to provide a predeprivation hearing. The Court also found significant the fact that, although Nebraska provides a tort remedy for persons suffering damages at the hands of the state, the plaintiff failed to avail himself of that procedure.

The dispute between the parties whether Electro-Tech actually complied with the four remaining contingencies need not be resolved in light of <em>Nollan. [Post, </em>pp 116-117.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASl\">Justice Brickley\u2019s substantive due process analysis is fatally flawed because it fails to establish the existence of a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest. According to Justice Brickley, <em>Nollan </em>eliminates the need to establish whether Electro-Tech\u2019s \"interest should be treated as a property or liberty interest enjoyed ... as an incident of its ownership of the property, or as a government privilege or benefit which did not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected interest until such time as Electro-Tech\u2019s 'unilateral expectation\u2019 of receiving the permit became a 'legitimate claim of entitlement\u2019 to it.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 116, quoting <em>Bd of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 577; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"A-3\">Justice Brickley correctly quotes the <em>Nollan </em>Court as stating that \"the right to build on one\u2019s own property \u2014 even though its exercise can be subjected to legitimate permitting requirements \u2014 cannot remotely be described as a 'governmental benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 833, n 2. However, Justice Brickley overlooks the fact that this statement was not discussed in the context of substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\"><em>Nollan </em>is a taking case. The Court made the above statement in response to an argument, based on <em>Ruckelshaus v Monsanto Co, </em>467 US 986; 104 S Ct 2862; 81 L Ed 2d 815 (1984), that because the Nollans were <em>on notice </em>that the granting of a building permit would be conditioned on the granting of the easement, they had no reasonable \" 'expectation of being able to exclude members of the public\u2019 from walking across their beach.\u201d <em>Nollan, supra, </em>p 833, n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">In <em>Monsanto, </em>which is also a taking case, the Court held that the granting of an insecticide registration is a \u201cvaluable Government benefit\u201d which licenses the government to use and disclose trade secrets in the registration application. The <em>Nollan </em>Court distinguished <em>Monsanto, </em>stating simply that \"the [commission\u2019s] announcement that the application for (or granting of) the [building] permit will entail the yielding of a property interest cannot be regarded as . . . the voluntary 'exchange\u2019 . . . that we found to have occurred in <em>Monsanto. \u201d Id., </em>p 833, n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">Justice Brickley interprets footnote 2 of <em>Nollan </em>too broadly. He would have us believe that <em>Nollan, </em>a taking case, renders the <em>Roth </em>substantive due process \u201cgovernment benefit/entitlement\u201d test unnecessary in the land use area. Unlike Justice Brickley, we are not \"puzzl[ed]\u201d that the post <em>-Nollan </em>due process cases (e.g., <em>RRI Realty Corp v Village of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911 [CA 2, 1989]) do not mention <em>Nollan. Post, </em>p 118. <em>Nollan </em>is a taking case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">Furthermore, even assuming the instant case was, as Justice Brickley asserts, tried on a substantive due process theory and that <em>Nollan </em>applies in this context, we would still find Electro-Tech\u2019s claim premature for want of a final decision. <em>Herrington v Sonoma Co, </em>834 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>F2d 1488 (CA 9, 1988). The <em>Nollan </em>Court stated that a person has a right to build on its land subject to <em>\u201clegitimate permitting requirements.\" </em>The Court did not state that a person has an automatic right to or indisputable property interest in a building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"AcG\">In <em>Nollan, </em>the plaintiffs were <em>entitled </em>to build on their land because they apparently had satisfied all the legitimate permitting requirements. There was only one condition imposed there and that condition was improper. Here, there were four valid conditions imposed which were never satisfied. Thus, Electro-Tech did not have a <em>legitimate claim of entitlement </em>to the building permit and, therefore, has not demonstrated a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\"> It is also well established that a plaintiff need not exhaust state judicial remedies before proceeding to federal court with a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Monroe v Pape, </em>365 US 167, 183; 81 S Ct 473; 5 L Ed 2d 492 (1961), overruled on other grounds in <em>Monell, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\"> See <em>McNeese v Cahokia, Illinois Bd of Ed, </em>373 US 668, 671-673; 83 S Ct 1433; 10 L Ed 2d 622 (1963); <em>Barry v Barchi, </em>443 US 55, 63, n 10; 99 S Ct 2642; 61 L Ed 2d 365 (1979); <em>Gibson v Berryhill, </em>411 US 564, 574; 93 S Ct 1689; 36 L Ed 2d 488 (1973); <em>Carter v Stanton, </em>405 US 669, 671; 92 S Ct 1232; 31 L Ed 2d 569 (1972); <em>Wilwording v Swenson, </em>404 US 249, 251; 92 S Ct 407; 30 L Ed 2d 418 (1971); <em>Houghton v Shafer, </em>392 US 639, 640; 88 S Ct 2119; 20 L Ed 2d 1319 (1968); <em>King v Smith, </em>392 US 309, 312, n 4; 88 S Ct 2128; 20 L Ed 2d 1118 (1968); <em>Damico v California, </em>389 US 416; 88 S Ct 526; 19 L Ed 2d 647 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> In <em>Williamson, </em>the city planning commission had voiced eight objections when it initially rejected the plaintiff\u2019s preliminary plat.

According to Justice Brickley, \"the finality requirement must be applied only when a landowner\u2019s claim alleges that a regulatory taking of the property has occurred.\u201d <em>Post, </em>pp 100-101. Justice Brickley asserts that ElectroTech has alleged a substantive due process claim rather than a regulatory taking claim and that <em>Williamson, </em>therefore, is inapplicable. <em>Post, </em>p 102.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah_\">We disagree with Justice Brickley\u2019s characterization of the plaintiff\u2019s claim here. Electro-Tech has, in our view, asserted and tried a regulatory taking due process-type claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">Justice Brickley has, in our view, overlooked the obvious similarities between the instant case and <em>Williamson. </em>For example, each case involved a land use restriction whereby a local government imposed certain conditions on permission to build. Moreover, each case was brought pursuant to 42 USC 1983 and was tried as a regulatory taking action.</p>\n<p id=\"Aha\"><em>Williamson </em>is clearly applicable in the instant case. Regardless of the manner in which a regulatory taking claim is framed, whether as a violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment or of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (as in the instant case), <em>Williamson </em>instructs that the claim is not ripe until the property owner obtains a final decision regarding the application of the regulation to the property. <em>Id., </em>pp 197-200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"AN\"> We acknowledge that <em>Williamson </em>involved a zoning ordinance while the case sub judice involves a city council resolution. We find, however, that this distinction does not render <em>Williamson </em>inapplicable here. In our view, the similarities between these two cases substantially outweigh their dissimilarities. For instance, both concern a local government\u2019s decision regarding a particular piece of property. Moreover, both cases involve the <em>process </em>through which a local body renders its final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">As in <em>Williamson, </em>we hold that a property owner need not resort to state \"review procedures\u201d (like appealing the council\u2019s decision to the board of zoning appeals or seeking mandamus) because such action would merely \"result in a judgment whether the [council\u2019s] actions violated any of [the owner\u2019s] rights.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>p 193. Instead we counsel the property owner to use the procedures available which might enable it to build according to the plans it had originally submitted for approval. In <em>Williamson, </em>that meant that the respondent should have sought variances regarding each of the eight objections. In the instant case, it meant that Electro-Tech should have at least submitted revised plans reflecting compliance with the four \"valid\u201d conditions. In this way, not only would the city be afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the opportunity to reconsider the dedication requirement, but also, assuming the case went to trial, a factfinder would be able to determine whether Electro-Tech was deprived of its property <em>solely on the basis of the unlawful dedication requirement.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> This number had been narrowed from the original thirteen recommended by the planning commission on February 21, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> The City of Westland has asserted all along that Electro-Tech simply decided to abandon its plans to build the new facility since the contractor, from the start, was already months behind schedule and since the chance to secure certain government contracts had already passed. The record reveals that the entire facility was to be completed by February 13, 1979. However, as of March of 1979, Campbell had not even submitted its proposed site plans to Mr. Beauchamp for approval. Further evidence that the plaintiff may have decided to abandon its plans is the fact that, as early as October of 1979 when the city first notified Electro-Tech of its intention to condemn the twenty-seven-foot parcel, the plaintiff was aware that the dedication requirement was no longer an obstacle and yet still failed to submit its final plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> Justice Brickley asserts that the building department does not make the ultimate decisions regarding building requests. <em>Post, </em>pp 107-109. However, testimony adduced at trial suggests unequivocally that building department approval is the final step in the process. Justice Brickley himself states that the function of the building department is \"to <em>determine whether the \u00f1nal plans conform </em>to the requirements of the building code and zoning ordinance with such modifications as may have been approved by the city council or board of zoning appeals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 107 (emphasis added). In our view, Justice Brickley inappropriately characterizes this function as \"nondiscretionary and nondecisional.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">While we agree that the building department had no authority to revise or override the June 11 council resolution, we disagree that no permit could issue unless Electro-Tech dedicated the twenty-seven-foot parcel. In our view, such a conclusion is premature at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">By neglecting to submit an amended site plan reflecting compliance with the four \"valid\u201d conditions, the plaintiff not only precluded any chance of obtaining a building permit from the city (we can only speculate that the council would not have reconsidered the dedication requirement had Electro-Tech complied with the four \"valid\u201d conditions), but also made it impossible for a jury to determine whether a \"taking\u201d could have occurred as a result of the unlawful dedication requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> The reason we would require Electro-Tech to address each condition imposed by the council is illustrated by the following scenario. Suppose Electro-Tech had refused to comply or was, in fact, unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>comply with one of the \"valid\u201d conditions imposed by the council. Under these circumstances, a question would arise regarding the extent to which the unlawful dedication requirement actually affected the plaintiff\u2019s \"beneficial use\u201d of the land. A similar question would also arise as to whether Electro-Tech\u2019s \"expectation interest\u201d was destroyed by the improper dedication requirement or by its own failure to meet one of the \"valid\u201d conditions. The requirement that the building department issue a final decision on each of the four \"valid\u201d conditions thus serves an indispensable function in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> Like the plaintiff in <em>Williamson </em>who had asserted that the county\u2019s actions had deprived it of an economically viable use of its property, Electro-Tech has specifically asserted that it had been deprived of the right to use and derive income from its property. An examination of the record confirms that this was the precise theory upon which this case was tried. A significant portion of Electro-Tech\u2019s case in chief was devoted to estimating the amount of profit the company <em>could have realized </em>had it been able to build its new manufacturing facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In our view, determining the value of lost profits was purely speculative at that point in time. The City of Westland was entitled to impose the four valid conditions on the issuance of the building permit. Electro-Tech failed to submit any proof of compliance with those legitimate conditions. Thus, the city was under no obligation to issue Electro-Tech a building permit. Furthermore, it was questionable whether Electro-Tech could have erected the new building in time to bid on the contracts anyway. The building completion date had run by the time Electro-Tech had presented its first site plan to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Because this case was submitted to the jury prematurely, it was impossible, as it was in <em>Williamson, </em>to <em>accurately </em>determine the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s land retained any reasonable beneficial use or the extent to which its expectation interest had been destroyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> Contrary to Justice Brickley\u2019s assertion, we are not requiring Electro-Tech to \"prove [to a] 'certainty\u2019 \u201d that the city\u2019s dedication was the sole cause of its failure to receive a building permit. <em>Post, </em>p 112.

First, by concluding that ElectroTech\u2019s claim is unripe for want of a \"final decision\u201d from the city regarding Electro-Tech\u2019s right to build on its property, the majority has unjustifiably expanded the ripeness requirements set forth in <em>Williamson Co Regional Planning Comm v Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 US 172, 190-191; 105 S Ct 3108; 87 L Ed 2d 126 (1985). Second, by treating Electro-Tech\u2019s right to improve its property as a government benefit and concluding that Electro-Tech has not identified a protected property interest because of its failure to demonstrate a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\u201d the majority has disregarded the teaching of <em>Nollan v California Coastal Comm, </em>483 US 825, 833-834, n 2; 107 S Ct 3141; 97 L Ed 2d 677 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Regarding allegations of due process violations, Justice Stevens has aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">It is not enough to note that [the petitioners] rely on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for that Clause is the source of three different kinds of constitutional protection. First, it incorporates specific protections defined in the Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of Rights. . . . Second, it contains a substantive component, sometimes referred to as \"substantive due process,\u201d which bars certain arbitrary government actions \"regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d . . . Third, it is a guarantee of fair procedure, sometimes referred to as \"procedural due process\u201d: the State may not execute, imprison, or fine a defendant without giving him a fair trial, nor may it take property without providing appropriate procedural safeguards. <em>[Daniels v Williams, </em>474 US 327, 337; 106 S Ct 662; 88 L Ed 2d 662 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A claim that a governmental land-use decision has worked a deprivation of property in violation of the Due Process Clause may fall into one or more of these categories. Into Justice Stevens\u2019 first classification, for example, fall claims asserting that governmental action has resulted in a \"taking\u201d of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment by a physical occupation of the landowner\u2019s property. <em>Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp, </em>458 US 419, 434-435; 102 S Ct 3164; 73 L Ed 2d 868 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">A landowner may also assert that a land-use regulation has denied the landowner all use of the property even though there is no physical invasion. Such a claim could fall into Justice Stevens\u2019 first category if the landowner complains that the regulation has effected a \"taking\u201d of the property, <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v Los Angeles Co, </em>482 US 304; 107 S Ct 2378; 96 L Ed 2d 250 (1987), or, possibly, into the second category if the complaint alleges not a \"taking for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation\u201d but that a regulation \"goes so far that it has <em>the same effect as a taking </em>by eminent domain [and] is an invalid exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>police power, violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Williamson, supra, </em>p 197 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Should the government wish to accomplish the goals of such regulation, it must proceed through the exercise of its eminent domain power, and, of course, pay just compensation for any property taken. The remedy for a regulation that goes too far, under the due process theory, is not \"just compensation,\u201d but invalidation of the regulation, and if authorized and appropriate, actual damages. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Regardless of the manner in which a \"regulatory taking\u201d claim is framed, whether as a violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment or of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the claim does not ripen until the landowner has received a final decision regarding the application of the regulation or ordinance to the particular piece of property. <em>Williamson, supra; MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v Yolo Co, </em>477 US 340; 106 S Ct 2561; 91 L Ed 2d 285 (1986). This is because regulatory taking claims depend upon an interference with the use of property that is so drastic as to represent the practical equivalent of a taking. Until such a final decision has been rendered, it is impossible to determine the extent of this interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Alternatively, a property owner challenging a particular land-use decision may advance a due process claim separate and distinct from the regulatory taking due process claim discussed in the preceding paragraph \u2014 that the property owner\u2019s due process rights have been otherwise interfered with by irrational or arbitrary governmental action. In contrast to regulatory taking due process claims, this type of substantive due process claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>falling squarely into Justice Stevens\u2019 second category, \"does not require proof that all use of the property has been denied . . . <em>Bateson v Geisse, </em>857 F2d 1300, 1303 (CA 9, 1988), quoting <em>Herrington v Sonoma Co, </em>834 F2d 1488, 1498 (CA 9, 1988), modified 857 F2d 567 (CA 9, 1988), cert den \u2014 US \u2014; 109 S Ct 1557; 103 L Ed 2d 860 (1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, \"the deliberate and arbitrary abuse of government power violates an individual\u2019s right to substantive due process.\u201d <em>Bello v Walker, </em>840 F2d 1124, 1129 (CA 3, 1988), cert den 488 US 868; 109 S Ct 176; 102 L Ed 2d 145 (1988) (relying on <em>Daniels, supra).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">II. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">It is well established that deliberate, irrational governmental action may violate due process guarantees. Both the majority in <em>Daniels </em>and Justice Stevens\u2019 concurrence emphasize this aspect of the Due Process Clause. As the <em>Daniels </em>majority observed, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">guarantee of due process has been applied to <em>deliberate </em>decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property. . . . [T]he Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta . . . was \" 'intended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government.\u2019 \u201d... And by barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them ... it serves to prevent governmental power from being \"used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>for purposes of oppression,\u201d . . . <em>[Daniels, supra, </em>p 331. Emphasis in the original.][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Applying this theory in the land use context, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>Bello </em>reversed the federal district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of city council members where the plaintiffs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">presented evidence from which a fact finder could reasonably conclude that certain council members, acting in their capacity as officers of the municipality improperly interfered with the process by which the municipality issued building permits, and that they did so for partisan political or personal reasons unrelated to the merits of the application for the permits. <em>[Bello, supra, </em>p 1129.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Looking to <em>Daniels, </em>the court relied on the general rule that \"the deliberate and arbitrary abuse of government power violates an individual\u2019s right to substantive due process.\u201d <em>Bello, </em>p 1129. The court distinguished an earlier decision from the same circuit in which a <em>zoning </em>regulation was held not to deprive the plaintiff of substantive due process. <em>Pace Resources, Inc v Shrewsbury Twp, </em>808 F2d 1023 (CA 3, 1987), cert den 482 US 906 (1987). In <em>Pace, </em>the complaint alleged no facts suggesting that the zoning was arbitrary, and it did \"not present a case involving actions aimed at this developer for reasons unrelated to land use planning.\u201d <em>Bello, </em>p 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Other federal courts have also found that a denial of a land use permit may give rise to a substantive due process claim. See, e.g., <em>Scott v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>Greenville Co, </em>716 F2d 1409, 1418-1421 (CA 4, 1983) (allegations of abuse of discretion or caprice in zoning administrator\u2019s refusal to issue permit stated substantive due process claim); <em>Southern Cooperative Development Fund v Driggers, </em>696 F2d 1347, 1356 (CA 11, 1983), cert den 463 US 1208 (1983) (substantive due process is violated where unauthorized requirements are imposed on a permit applicant); <em>Littlefield v City of Afton, </em>785 F2d 596, 607 (CA 8, 1986) (complaint alleging an arbitrary and capricious imposition of an unconstitutional condition on a permit application stated a substantive due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In addition, even those judges in the federal courts of appeals disfavoring substantive due process claims in the land use context have admitted the viability of such claims in appropriate cases. See <em>Creative Environments, Inc v Estabrook, </em>680 F2d 822, 833 (CA 1, 1982) (the plaintiif was not denied due process by the denial of the development plan where the dispute with the town planning agency was \"not tainted with fundamental procedural irregularity, racial animus, or the like\u201d); <em>Lemke v Cass Co, </em>846 F2d 469, 472 (CA 8, 1987) (en banc) (Arnold, J., concurring) (stating that the substantive due process claims should be limited to cases in which challenged land use decisions bearing \"no relationship whatever to the merits of the pending matter\u201d); <em>Coniston Corp v Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F2d 461, 467 (CA 7, 1988) (Posner, J.) (\"Of course if a zoning decision is based on considerations that violate specific constitutional guarantees, it is invalid; but in all other cases the decision can be said to deny substantive due process only if it is irrational\u201d); <em>Chiplin Enterprises, Inc v City of Lebanon, </em>712 F2d 1524, 1528 (CA 1, 1983) (suggesting that substantive due process claims may be viable where \"rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ognized fundamental constitutional rights are abridged,\u201d quoting <em>Estabrook, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The majority finds it significant that the United States Supreme Court \"has yet to employ such an approach in cases involving the wrongful denial of a land use permit.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 76. However, in <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co, </em>272 US 365; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926), the Court considered a due process attack on a zoning ordinance. The Court rejected the challenge on the ground that the reasons advanced by the municipality on behalf of the zoning provisions were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">sufficiently cogent to preclude us from saying, as it must be said before the ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, that such provisions are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. <em>[Id., </em>p 395.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In more recent times, the Court has considered a claim that a municipal ordinance prohibiting excavations below a certain depth violated due process. The Court held that the plaintiff failed to sustain its burden of proving the ordinance to be an invalid exercise of the town\u2019s police power. <em>Goldblatt v Town of Hempstead, </em>369 US 590, 594-596; 82 S Ct 987; 8 L Ed 2d 130 (1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Finally, I note that <em>this </em>Court has employed that theory before. In <em>Kropf v Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich 139; 215 NW2d 179 (1974), we unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>accepted the proposition that the enactment of an irrational zoning ordinance may deny a landowner substantive due process. <em>Id., </em>pp 157-159, 167 (Levin, J., concurring). The majority quoted extensively from <em>Euclid, supra, </em>in its analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim, which was considered separately from the plaintiffs\u2019 taking claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">hi. electro-tech\u2019s due process claim in the LOWER COURTS</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Electro-Tech\u2019s fourth amended complaint adequately alleged facts to support its substantive due process claim. At the close of proofs, Circuit Judge Giovan determined that if in fact the City of Westland imposed the dedication requirement as a condition for obtaining a building permit, then, as a matter of law, Electro-Tech had established a constitutional violation for purposes of \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that \u201cplaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>have shown no constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Electro-Tech v H F Campbell Co, </em>161 Mich App 622, 628; 411 NW2d 800 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On appeal in this Court, Electro-Tech argues that its property rights were deprived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">[D]ue to a \"calculated, deliberate abuse of governmental power,\u201d the City was guilty of violating plaintiff\u2019s constitutionally protected right to substantive due process. [Citing <em>Daniels v Williams, supra.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">IV. THE RIPENESS OF ELECTRO-TECH\u2019S DUE PROCESS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">In my opinion, the <em>Williamson </em>ripeness requirements do not present an obstacle to our consideration of the merits of Electro-Tech\u2019s substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Initially, I note that because Electro-Tech\u2019s substantive due process claim does not require proof of an <em>uncompensated </em>taking, the <em>Williamson </em>requirement that an aggrieved property owner seek compensation is inapplicable. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>pp 194-195.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Perhaps less obviously, the <em>Williamson </em>final decision requirement is also inapplicable. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>pp 190-191. I believe that a principled decision to apply, or not to apply, the finality requirement requires us to look beyond the label attached to a constitutional land use claim to the policy underlying the requirement and to the nature of the governmental conduct under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">In my opinion, the finality requirement must be applied only when a landowner\u2019s claim alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that a regulatory taking of the property has occurred. A regulatory taking claim requires a showing that the application of a regulation, usually a facially legitimate exercise of the police power, has caused an interference with the use of property that is so drastic as to represent the practical equivalent of a taking, even though there has been no physical invasion of the property. Although such a claim might be framed in two different ways, the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement is applicable in both instances. In <em>Williamson, </em>the plaintiff challenged a local zoning ordinance under both the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment and under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, contending in both claims that the application of the ordinance to its property had resulted in the practical equivalent of a taking. Because the plaintiff had failed to request variances from the regulations which formed the basis of the planning commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s land use application, the Court found that it could not determine the effect of the regulations on the use and value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. <em>Id., </em>p 190, n 11. Such determinations, the Court reasoned, cannot be made \"until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 191. See also <em>Hoehne v San Benito Co, </em>870 F2d 529 (CA 9, 1989) <em>(Williamson </em>requirements applied to a regulatory taking due process claim when it was necessary to determine the government\u2019s position as to an acceptable use of the plaintiff\u2019s property); <em>Shelter Creek Development Corp v City of Oxnard, </em>838 F2d 375 (CA 9, 1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In a later case, the Supreme Court clarified the application of the <em>Williamson </em>finality require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ments. In <em>Yolo Co, supra, </em>p 344, a property owner alleged that the municipality\u2019s rejection of its subdivision plan deprived the property of its \" 'entire economic use.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff\u2019s failure to secure a final determination whether some other sort of development would be permitted led the Court to reject the plaintiff\u2019s regulatory taking claim. The Court observed that in several earlier cases, including <em>Williamson,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">we declined to reach the question whether the Constitution requires a monetary remedy to redress some <em>regulatory takings </em>because the records in those cases <em>left us uncertain whether the property at issue had in fact been taken. </em>Likewise, in this case, the holdings of both courts below leave open the possibility that some development will be permitted, and thus again leave us in doubt regarding the antecedent question whether appellant\u2019s property has been taken. <em>[Yolo Co, supra, </em>pp 352-353. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The finality requirement serves two related purposes in regulatory taking cases. It enables the judge and jury to determine how the applicable regulations will be applied to a particular piece of property and to decide whether the resulting interference with the property is so severe as to constitute the practical equivalent of a taking. Neither determination need be made in the instant case, because plaintiff\u2019s substantive due process claim, unlike that advanced by the landowners in <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Yolo Co, </em>is not a regulatory taking due process-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The defendant in this case did not merely apply to plaintiff\u2019s property a facially valid ordinance or regulation requiring all builders situated similarly to Electro-Tech to dedicate property for the widening of city streets. If the defendant had done so, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>might have made sense under <em>Williamson </em>to insist that Electro-Tech have at least attempted to obtain a further determination by showing that any increased traffic burden resulting from the expansion of its existing building would be insufficient to justify the dedication requirement. However, no such ordinance existed in the present case. Rather, the city council pulled the dedication requirement out of thin air and imposed it arbitrarily in a resolution applicable to Electro-Tech only. This resolution, like the variance decision required in <em>Williamson, </em>was a concrete determination applicable to a particular piece of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Moreover, Electro-Tech\u2019s due process claim does <em>not </em>require proof that its property has been \"taken.\u201d In other words, Electro-Tech does <em>not </em>have to show that the city\u2019s action resulted in either a physical occupation of its property or a restriction on the use of its property which was so drastic as to represent the practical equivalent of an actual physical \"taking\u201d of the property. Electro-Tech need only prove that it was deprived of its property rights as a result of its refusal to submit to the unconstitutional condition deliberately and arbitrarily imposed by the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The plaintiffs in <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Yolo Co, </em>on the other hand, alleged that their real property had in effect been taken by government action. The Supreme Court required those plaintiffs to obtain final decisions regarding the application of the regulations to their particular pieces of property in order to enable the finders of fact to determine whether the alleged interference with each plaintiff\u2019s real property was in fact so severe as to constitute a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">(Nor is any further decision by the city necessary even to determine whether the <em>condition itself </em>was, in fact, violative of the Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ment. Had Electro-Tech actually complied with the dedication requirement in order to obtain the permit, there is no doubt that a permanent physical occupation of Electro-Tech\u2019s land would have resulted. See <em>Nollan, supra </em>[a permit condition unrelated to the merits of the application which threatened a permanent physical occupation of the landowner\u2019s property without compensation was unconstitutional]; <em>Parks </em>v <em>Watson, </em>716 F2d 646, 650-654 [CA 9, 1983] [same].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Because the <em>governmental </em>action in <em>Nollan </em>was nearly identical to the actions of the city, it is significant that the Supreme Court in <em>Nollan </em>did not even mention the final-decision requirement, despite its contemporaneity with the decision rendered in <em>First English, </em>in which a landowner alleged a regulatory taking and in which the Court <em>explicitly </em>found the final-decision requirement to be applicable. In the instant case, the final-decision requirement is not implicated because ElectroTech\u2019s due process claim \u2014 that it was deprived of its <em>right to improve its property </em>by arbitrary and irrational government action \u2014 does not in any way require Electro-Tech to prove that the admittedly illegitimate condition imposed by the city actually resulted in such a severe restriction on ElectroTech\u2019s ability to use its property as to violate Electro-Tech\u2019s <em>independent right </em>not to have its property taken without just compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">For cases applying a similar analysis, see <em>Long Island Lighting Co v Cuomo, </em>666 F Supp 370, 405 (ND NY, 1987) (the failure to satisfy the finality requirement barred the taking claim but not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>substantive due process claim which was \"not dependent on the actual economic effect\u201d of the land use decision upon plaintiff\u2019s property); <em>Long Grove Country Club Estates v Village of Long Grove, </em>693 F Supp 640, 657-658 (ND Ill, 1988) (applying the finality requirement to the taking challenge but not the substantive due process claim in a suit arising from the denial of a land use permit).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Although a final decision test has been applied in at least one case from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, I find that basis for the application to be flawed. In addition, the due process claim in that case is distinguishable from that raised by Electro-Tech.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Herrington, </em>the court relied on an earlier decision from the same circuit for the proposition that the finality requirement applies to substantive due process claims. <em>Id., </em>857 F2d 569. In <em>Kinzli v Santa Cruz, </em>818 F2d 1449 (CA 9, 1987), a different panel of the court found a landowner\u2019s substantive due process claim premature for want of a final decision. <em>Id., </em>p 1456. Although the nature of the substantive due process claim is not discussed in detail, it appears from the district court\u2019s published opinion, <em>Kinzli v Santa Cruz, </em>620 F Supp 609 (ND Cal, 1985), to which the Court of Appeals referred for further details, <em>Kinzli, </em>818 F2d 1451, that the plaintiff\u2019s due process claim was in fact the sort of <em>regulatory taking </em>due process claim also raised in <em>Williamson.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\"><em>Plaintiffs do not challenge Measure 0 </em>as facially invalid or <em>as an arbitrary use of the City\u2019s police power; </em>rather they challenge the Measure on the grounds that <em>as applied </em>to their property it deprives them of an economically viable use. <em>[Kinzli, </em>620 F Supp 616. Additional emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The <em>Herrington </em>court did not explain why the finality requirement applied in <em>Kinzli </em>to a regulatory taking due process claim should apply to a <em>nontaking </em>substantive due process claim. In the absence of a compelling policy analysis to support this extension of <em>Kinzli, </em>I am unable to concur with <em>Herrington\u2019s </em>analysis on this point.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The application of the final-decision requirement proposed by the majority is misdirected not only because it erroneously assumes that Electro-Tech must demonstrate a \"taking,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 86, but also because it requires Electro-Tech to perform an exercise in futility and imposes upon Electro-Tech an unjustifiably high burden of proof on the issue of causation, which, in effect, would require Electro-Tech to establish an \"entitlement\u201d to a permit, a requirement which I believe should not be applied in this case. See section v(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s primary purpose in mandating a final decision from the appropriate administrative body was to establish the existence of a \"taking\u201d and the extent to which it has harmed the plaintiff. Thus, while a final decision by the building department in the instant case probably would not have resulted in approval of the site plan or the issuance of a building permit, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>have indeed resolved any issue regarding the four \"valid\u201d conditions and would have established a basis upon which a factfinder could conclude that \"but for\u201d the improper dedication requirement, Electro-Tech would have been able to \"derive economic benefit\u201d from its land. <em>Williamson, supra </em>at 191.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">In light of the record in the instant case as well as the purpose underlying the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it would have been futile to submit an amended site plan to the building department. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 86-87.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It is true, as the majority suggests, that the \"ultimate decision regarding building requests lies with the building department. . . . [T]he building department is responsible for examining the final site and building plans . . . and, if everything is approved, for ultimately issuing the permit.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>pp 84-85. But the building department has no discretion to override a condition imposed by the city council. Its sole function is to determine whether the final plans conform to the requirements of the building code and zoning ordinance with such modifications as may have been approved by the city council or board of zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The head of the building department, Robert Fritz, testified that \"we do not make the final decision,\u201d and that the ultimate decision is made by the \"[zoning board of appeals], Planning Commission or City Council.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He said he would en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>force the city council\u2019s decision requiring the dedication of the parcel whether it was, in his opinion, \"right or wrong,\u201d and on <em>cross-examination by the city </em>explained that it was not part of his responsibility<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to question such a condition. A planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>examiner for the building department similarly testified that the building department would not issue a building permit unless the twenty-seven-foot parcel had been dedicated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">It is immaterial that Electro-Tech \"failed to submit a final site plan (either to the council or to the building department) reflecting at least\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> compliance with the four unobjectionable conditions. The testimony of the city employees clearly establishes that it would have been futile for ElectroTech to do so and that no building permit would have been issued unless Electro-Tech had complied with the remaining and illegal dedication requirement. Even assuming for the moment that ElectroTech in* fact failed to comply with the four unobjectionable conditions, there is no support for the conclusion \"that the process for obtaining the city\u2019s permission to build had not yet been completed.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">From the fact that the city council \"conditionally\u201d approved the site plan subject to the unconstitutional dedication requirement, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>concludes that \"the entire matter had not yet been finally resolved and that Electro-Tech would have to submit an amended site plan before it could begin building.\u201d Ante, p 85. But the city council\u2019s decision on the unconstitutional condition, on which approval depended, was conclusive. The amendment and resubmission contemplated by the majority, absent compliance with the dedication requirement, would have been to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In sum, I cannot agree that the ultimate decision regarding Electro-Tech\u2019s ability to improve its property was vested in the building department. The only \"ultimate decision\u201d of the building department \u2014 whether to issue a building permit\u2014 was nondiscretionary and nondecisional. The building department\u2019s sole function was to decide whether the final plans conformed to the building code and zoning ordinance as they may have been modified in this particular case by the board of zoning appeals or the city council. The building department had no authority to revise the June 11 city council resolution nor to issue a building permit absent dedication of the property. Uncontroverted evidence at trial showed conclusively that a building permit would never have been issued even if all other contingencies required by the Westland City Council other than the dedication requirement had been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Moreover, if the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement were construed so broadly as to require a decision from the Westland building department \u2014 a body with no discretionary authority regarding West-land\u2019s demand for the illegal dedication of land\u2014 the Court would be abandoning the core of its proper legal inquiry as to whether a final relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>city policy was established in the context of this case and would instead be embarking, improperly, on an extended and purely factual inquiry which duplicates that already undertaken by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">It is true that if we were to require of plaintiffs that they prove as a matter of law that the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct is the only possible cause of the resulting harm in a given case, then we could rest assured that every verdict unfavorable to a defendant would be justified. The majority appears willing to hold Electro-Tech to such an unprecedented standard of proof by insisting that Electro-Tech demonstrate to a certainty that its failure to receive a permit is attributable solely to the dedication requirement. The requirement of such a standard of proof from the plaintiff, notwithstanding the finality requirement of <em>Williamson, </em>is not uniquely justified by the special context of \u00a7 1983 actions. \"[F]ederal tort statutes such as 42 USC 1983 are not self-contained. They are enacted against a background of common law tort principles governing causation and damages. . . . Those principles are therefore applicable to federal civil-rights tort cases unless unsuitable to them . . . .\u201d <em>Taliferro v Augle, </em>757 F2d 157, 161-162 (CA 7, 1985) (Posner, J.). See also <em>Parrett v Connersville, Indiana, </em>737 F2d 690 (CA 7, 1984), cert dis 469 US 1145 (1985), in which the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated that, in examining \u00a7 1983 decisions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[n]othing in any of these cases suggests to us that if a plaintiff succeeds in proving a violation of his constitutional rights, the principles used to determine whether he has demonstrated that the violation caused the injury for which he is seeking damages should be other than those applied in ordinary tort cases. <em>[Id., </em>p 695 (Posner, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The jury in this case, on the issue of causation, was instructed that Electro-Tech had the burden of proving</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">that the Defendant, City of Westland, knowingly imposed as a condition of the Plaintiff obtaining a building permit that the Plaintiff give up twenty-seven feet of its property to the City. Or to state it another way, they must prove that the City refused to grant a building permit to the Plaintiff unless the Plaintiff dedicated twenty-seven feet of its property to the Defendant at no charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">[And] that the act complained of on the part of the Defendant was a proximate cause of the damages suffered by the Plaintiff. An act is a proximate cause of damages if the damages are a natural and probable consequence of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The City of Westland made no objection to the instruction. In particular, the city has never argued that the trial court\u2019s definition of causation in terms of \"natural and probable consequences\u201d was unsuitable in this case or in any way incompatible with the requirement set forth in <em>Monell v Dep\u2019t of Social </em>Services, 436 US 658, 694; 98 S Ct 2018; 56 L Ed 2d 611 (1978), that the municipal policy or custom<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> be the \"moving force\u201d behind the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The majority\u2019s proposed application of the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirement would transform the question of causation from a question of fact for the jury into a question of law for the court. However, it is not the <em>court\u2019s </em>function to conclude whether the dedication requirement caused the plaintiff harm. Nor do any common-law tort principles justify requiring Electro-Tech to prove \"certainty\u201d or any other standard of proof beyond that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>given by Judge Giovan in his instructions to the jury. Under some circumstances, it may be proper for the Court to reexamine proof of causation in a tort cause of action. But, \"[i]f reasonable jurors could disagree, neither the trial court nor this Court has the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675, 682; 385 NW2d 586 (1986) (emphasis added). Even such a comparatively modest review, however, is inappropriate in this case, because the defendant failed at trial to challenge the adequacy of the evidence of causation in a motion for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Napier v Jacobs, </em>429 Mich 222; 414 NW2d 862 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The proposition that Electro-Tech must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that it would have received approval <em>but for </em>the unconstitutional condition essentially calls upon Electro-Tech to demonstrate an entitlement to the permit. As explained in the following section, I do not believe that the law requires Electro-Tech to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">V. THE MERITS OF ELECTRO-TECH\u2019S DUE PROCESS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Having concluded that Electro-Tech\u2019s claim is ripe, I turn now to the merits of the claim. First, while Electro-Tech\u2019s substantive due process claim does not depend on an antecedent demonstration that a taking has occurred, it may nevertheless be necessary to identify a constitutionally protected property interest of which Electro-Tech was deprived without due process. Second, it is necessary to determine whether the governmental action which affected the property interest was arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">In <em>Bello, </em>the court did not look to see whether the plaintiffs had a protected property or liberty interest under state law, holding instead that \"the deliberate and arbitrary abuse of government power violates an individual\u2019s right to substantive due process.\u201d <em>Bello, supra, </em>p 1129. The viability of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim in that case did not depend on an antecedent <em>legal </em>determination that the plaintiff had a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to the permit. Rather, the court held that the jury must determine whether the interference with the plaintiff\u2019s right to build on his land was occasioned by a legitimate permit requirement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>by an illegitimate use of governmental power by the issuing body.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Some federal courts, however, have augmented the <em>Bello </em>analysis with the preliminary inquiry whether the plaintiff had established the existence of a state-created liberty or property right entitled to federal constitutional protection. See, e.g., <em>Scott v Greenville Co, </em>716 F2d 1409, 1418 (CA 4, 1983) (the applicant\u2019s interest in a building permit was protected); <em>Rymer v Douglas Co, </em>764 F2d 796, 801 (CA 11, 1985) (real property); <em>Yale Auto Parts v Johnson, </em>758 F2d 54, 58 (CA 2, 1985) (there was no property interest in a certificate of use to operate a junkyard); <em>Sullivan v Town of Salem, </em>805 F2d 81, 84 (CA 2, 1986) (there was a protectible interest in a certificate of occupancy); <em>Dean Tarry Corp v Friedlander, </em>826 F2d 210 (CA 2, 1987); <em>RRI Realty Corp v Village of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911 (CA 2, 1989) (wide discretion to deny a permit under local law defeated a claim of property interest). See also <em>Wilkerson v Johnson, </em>699 F2d 325, 328 (CA 6, 1983) (the applicant\u2019s interest in a barber\u2019s license was protected); <em>Packish v McMurtrie, </em>697 F2d 23, 25 (CA 1, 1983) (there was no protectible interest in indemnification for injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">If such a preliminary inquiry into the existence of a constitutionally protected interest were required in this case, it would be of paramount importance in describing Electro-Tech\u2019s interest in building on its land to determine whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>interest should be treated as a property or liberty interest enjoyed by Electro-Tech as an incident of its ownership of the property, or as a government privilege or benefit which did not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected interest until such time as Electro-Tech\u2019s \"unilateral expectation\u201d of receiving the permit became a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to it. <em>Bd of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 577; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972). Justice Brennan, dissenting in <em>Nollan, </em>argued that under <em>Ruckelshaus v Monsanto Co, </em>467 US 986; 104 S Ct 2862; 81 L Ed 2d 815 (1984), the granting of government approval where the property in question is subject to regulation is a government benefit. <em>Nollan, supra, </em>p 860, n 10 (Brennan, J., dissenting). This view was explicitly rejected by the majority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">[T]he right to build on one\u2019s own property \u2014 even though its exercise can be subjected to legitimate permitting requirements \u2014 cannot remotely be described as a \"governmental benefit.\u201d And thus the announcement that the application for (or granting of) the permit will entail the yielding of a property interest cannot be regarded as establishing the voluntary \"exchange,\u201d that we found to have occurred in <em>Monsanto. [Id., </em>p 834, n 2. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Thus, it was immaterial in <em>Nollan </em>whether the Nollans had presented a legitimate claim of entitlement to the building permit. Presumably, such a showing could not have been made, since the Court was willing to assume that the California Coastal Commission enjoyed broad enough discretion to have denied the Nollans\u2019 request for a permit altogether. <em>Id., </em>p 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In my opinion, <em>Nollan </em>compels the conclusion that Electro-Tech\u2019s right to improve its property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>subject to legitimate permitting requirements<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was violated by the city\u2019s admittedly illegitimate imposition of the dedication condition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The dispute between the parties whether Electro-Tech actually complied with the four remaining contingencies need not be resolved in light of <em>Nollan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Because <em>Nollan </em>makes clear that the right to build on one\u2019s property is not to be treated as a government benefit, it is puzzling that some courts have continued to apply the government benefit/ entitlement analysis in similar cases after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nollan </em>and without mentioning that case. See <em>Carolan v Kansas City, </em>813 F2d 178 (CA 8, 1987); <em>Spence v Zimmerman, 873 </em>F2d 256 (CA 11, 1989); <em>RRI Realty, supra. </em>In <em>RRI Realty, </em>the court, without reference to <em>Nollan, </em>considered itself bound by <em>pre-Nollan </em>Second Circuit precedent to apply a government benefit/entitlement test in a land use permit case; it nevertheless questioned the wisdom of this type of inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">It is not readily apparent why land regulation cases that involve applications to local regulators have applied the <em>Roth </em>entitlement test to inquire whether an entitlement exists in what has been applied for \u2014 whether a zoning variance, a business license, or a building permit \u2014 instead of simply recognizing the owner\u2019s indisputable property interest in the land he owns and asking whether local government has exceeded the limits of substantive due process in regulating the plaintiff\u2019s use of his property by denying the application arbitrarily and capriciously. <em>[RRI, supra, </em>p 917.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">These cases, however, do not change the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>that <em>Nollan </em>has eroded the applicability of the entitlement analysis in this context. Moreover, many courts in addition to <em>Bello, </em>both before and after <em>Nollan, </em>have not applied such an analysis. See <em>Herrington, supra; Scudder v Town of Greendale, </em>704 F2d 999 (CA 7, 1983) (building permit); <em>Neiderhiser v Borough of Berwick, </em>840 F2d 213 (CA 3, 1988), cert den 488 US 822; 109 S Ct 67; 102 L Ed 2d 44 (1988) (zoning exemption application); <em>Batch v Town of Chapel Hill, </em>376 SE2d 22 (NC App, 1989) (subdivision application); <em>Bateson, supra; </em>see also <em>Epstein v Town of Whitehall, </em>693 F Supp 309 (ED Pa, 1988) (development application).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">I conclude that a government benefit/entitlement analysis is not required in this case, and that Electro-Tech\u2019s interest in improving its property subject to legitimate permitting requirements was a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The majority concedes, as it must, that the Supreme Court in <em>Nollan </em>explicitly rejected the proposition that the right to improve one\u2019s property should be treated as a government benefit. <em>Ante, </em>p 77, n 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The majority then immediately disregards this recent teaching and rejects Electro-Tech\u2019s substantive due process claim on the very ground that Electro-Tech \"did not have a <em>legitimate claim of entitlement </em>to the building permit . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 77, n 22 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In the majority\u2019s view, I have read footnote 2 of <em>Nollan </em>\"too broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clearly, I am not expansively interpreting \"the right to build on one\u2019s property . . . subject[] to legitimate permitting requirements\u201d to include some interest broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>than or different from the right to build on one\u2019s property subject to legitimate permitting requirements. <em>Nollan, supra, </em>p 834, n 2. The majority\u2019s explanation for the alleged overbreadth of my reading of footnote 2, as well as for the inconsistency described above, is, simply, that <em>\"Nollan </em>is a taking case.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 77, n 22. This explanation includes a tacit acceptance of the incredible proposition that the right to build on one\u2019s property subject to legitimate permitting requirements is only a government benefit when property happens to be discussed in the framework of a Fourteenth Amendment due process claim, but is a property interest when considered in the context of a Fifth Amendment claim. The basic similarity between this case and <em>Nollan, </em>however, is too close to be glossed over by an unspoken, and, in my opinion, unjustified assumption. Despite the majority\u2019s statement that the plaintiffs in <em>Nollan </em>\"were <em>entitled </em>to build on their land,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 77, n 22 (emphasis in original), there is no suggestion in <em>Nollan </em>that the plaintiffs needed to show an entitlement; indeed, there is explicit language to the contrary. <em>Nollan, </em>p 833, n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It may be true that a legitimate entitlement inquiry, when properly undertaken in a true government benefit case, is a question of law. The disposition of such a legal question, however, requires the court to resolve preliminary factual issues. As noted above, Judge Giovan determined that if the dedication requirement had been imposed, then Electro-Tech was deprived of <em>property </em>without due process. See section hi. Had the city challenged Judge Giovan to explain the factual basis of his conclusion of law that Electro-Tech\u2019s right to property had been deprived without due process, Judge Giovan could have justified his conclusion on the basis of the testimony adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>at trial. Fred Campbell, president of the construction company with whom Electro-Tech contracted for the erection of Electro-Tech\u2019s building, testified that \"as far as our plans and our specifications are concerned, the job met all of those conditions and we were poised to give [Mr. Beauchamp] the service that he expected.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The majority offers the unsupported conclusion, however, that the four remaining contingencies \"were never satisfied.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 77, n 22.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Assuming, still, that a government benefit analysis were proper, Judge Giovan\u2019s conclusion that Electro-Tech was deprived of <em>property </em>without due process would encompass the conclusion that Electro-Tech had demonstrated an entitlement to build on its land. Because there was support at trial for this conclusion, it cannot be said that Judge Giovan\u2019s conclusion had no basis in fact. The majority is thus reaching out without explanation to resolve a factual matter which Electro-Tech was never called upon to address in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Because the satisfaction of the four legitimate conditions was not a material issue at trial,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> it would be somewhat understandable if the majority explicitly chose to overlook the city\u2019s failure to object to the factual b\u00e1sis of Judge Giovan\u2019s conclusion. Assuming the applicability of a government benefit/entitlement test in this case, the very worst Electro-Tech should have to endure would be a remand to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether in fact the four conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>had been satisfied. Even if I were persuaded that a government benefit analysis were justified, I would nevertheless not be inclined to remand this case. The satisfaction of the four remaining conditions would not have made a whit of difference in the outcome of Electro-Tech\u2019s application. As explained above in the context of the majority\u2019s misdirected finality analysis, which the majority\u2019s equally misdirected government benefit analysis so closely resembles, the plaintiff ought not be put through exercises in futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The practical effect of the finality and entitlement analyses endorsed by the majority is to reward obdurate action on the part of a governmental agency aiming to obfuscate or delay permit applications of those, like Electro-Tech, to whom the agency had no intention of granting a building permit under lawful conditions. The majority thus imposes upon the plaintiff the burden of engaging in impractical maneuvers in distant anticipation of litigation which are entirely inconsistent with intelligent business operations and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In light of <em>Nollan v California Coastal Comm, supra, </em>there can be little doubt that the dedication condition imposed by the City of Westland, which deprived Electro-Tech of its right to improve its property, was arbitrary and irrational. The utter absence of any colorable justification for the dedication requirement coupled with the city\u2019s admission on appeal that the city\u2019s actions were \"clearly wrong\u201d compel this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Like Electro-Tech, the Nollans sought to build on their property. The Nollans wished to demolish a dilapidated bungalow on their beachfront property and replace it with a three-bedroom house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The California Coastal Commission, like the City of Westland, approved the landowner\u2019s application on the condition that the landowners consent to a \"permanent physical occupation\u201d of a portion of their property. <em>Id., </em>p 832.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court observed that the commission could not simply have required the Nollans to convey the easement without compensation without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>pp 833-834. The Court further acknowledged that a governmental body could impose a permit condition pursuant to its police power if the condition serves the same legitimate purpose as an outright refusal to issue the permit. <em>Id., </em>pp 836-837. With regard to the conveyance requirement imposed by the commission, however, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">The evident constitutional propriety disappears ... if the condition substituted for the prohibition utterly fails to further the end advanced as the justification for the prohibition. When that essential nexus is eliminated, the situation becomes the same as if California law forbade shouting fire in a crowded theater, but granted dispensations to those willing to contribute $100 to the state treasury. While a ban on shouting fire can be a core exercise of the State\u2019s police power to protect the public safety, and can thus meet even our stringent standards for regulation of speech, adding the unrelated condition alters the purpose to one which, while it may be legitimate, is inadequate to sustain the ban. Therefore, even though, in a sense, requiring a $100 tax contribution in order to shout fire is a lesser restriction on speech than an outright ban, it would not pass constitutional muster. <em>Similarly here, the lack of nexus between the condition and the original purpose of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>building restriction converts that purpose to something other than what it was. The purpose then becomes, quite simply, the obtaining of an easement to serve some valid governmental purpose, but without payment of compensation. Whatever may be the outer limits of \u2019\u2019legitimate state interests\u201d in the takings and land-use context, this is not one of them. In short, unless the permit condition serves the same governmental purpose as the development ban, the building restriction is not a valid regulation of land use but \u201dan out-and-out plan of extortion.\u201d [Id., </em>p 837. Citations omitted, emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Noting that a governmental entity may not rely on its police power to abridge property rights unless the effect of its action is to <em>substantially </em>advance a legitimate state interest, the Court warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">We are inclined to be particularly careful about the adjective where the actual conveyance of property is made a condition to [sic] the lifting of a land-use restriction, since in that context there is heightened risk that the purpose is avoidance of the compensation requirement, rather than the stated police power objective. <em>[Id., </em>p 841.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">While the commission in <em>Nollan </em>attempted to persuade the Court that there were legitimate reasons for imposing the conveyance requirement,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the City of Westland does not contend that the dedication requirement was justified, for example, by a projected increase in traffic attributable to the expansion of Electro-Tech\u2019s building.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Nollan, </em>the city\u2019s \"imposition of the permit condition cannot be treated as an exercise of its land use power . . . <em>Id., </em>p 839. As Justice Stevens has explained with regard to substantive due process claims,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">the constitutional violation is complete as soon as the prohibited action is taken; the independent federal remedy is then authorized by the language and legislative history of \u00a7 1983. <em>[Daniels, supra, </em>p 338 (Stevens, J., concurring)][<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">By arbitrarily forcing Electro-Tech to choose between two constitutionally protected property rights, the city violated Electro-Tech\u2019s right to substantive due process.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Further comparison of the instant case to <em>Nollan </em>persuades me that Electro-Tech should prevail on its substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">In both cases, the government compelled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>landowners to yield either (1) the right to build on their property (subject to legitimate permitting requirements), or (2) the right not to have their land taken by a permanent physical occupation without just compensation. In <em>Nollan, </em>the imposition of the unconstitutional permit condition forced the Nollans to choose between \"surrendering] either a restrictive covenant or a lateral easement over [their] land.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Here, the imposition of the dedication requirement by the city after it had approved Electro-Tech\u2019s application offered Electro-Tech a similar Hobson\u2019s choice. The difference between <em>Nollan </em>and this case is not the choice forced upon the landowners by the government, but rather the <em>reaction of the landowners </em>to the government\u2019s extortionate demand. In <em>Nollan, </em>the landowners, faced with a choice of relinquishing one of two constitutionally protected rights, chose not to give up their right to build on their property. While their petition for a writ of mandamus to strike the conveyance requirement was on appeal in the California courts, the Nollans proceeded to raze the bungalow and erect a new house without notifying the commission and without complying with the easement condition.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> They then sought to prevent the government from enforcing the easement requirement, which would have violated their independent right not to have property taken without just compensation, i.e., they sought to be kept whole. The Supreme Court agreed with the Nollans and held that <em>if </em>the government wished to \"take\u201d the Nollans\u2019 property, <em>then </em>it would have to give the Nollans just compensation. Thus, <em>Nollan </em>was framed as a \"tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ing\u201d case, because the <em>condition </em>imposed \u2014 which threatened a permanent physical occupation of a portion of the real property \u2014 violated the Taking Clause, not because an actual \"taking\u201d of the Nollans\u2019 property had already occurred. By analogy, consider a situation in which a city council conditions approval of a parade permit on participants\u2019 consent to unreasonable searches. A participant who refuses to allow such a search may have the condition removed not because the participant was actually subjected to an unconstitutional search, but because the <em>condition </em>violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Electro-Tech, however, made the choice opposite to that of the Nollans. Declining to take the bull by the horns, Electro-Tech did not resort to self-help by proceeding with construction without the required building permit, as did the Nollans. By obeying the law and refraining from building without the required permit, Electro-Tech instead refused to relinquish its right not to have its property taken without compensation. Electro-Tech\u2019s insistence on retaining this latter right cost Electro-Tech its <em>independent </em>right to improve its property subject to legitimate permitting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">For these reasons, this case is a due process case while <em>Nollan </em>was not. <em>Nollan </em>was a taking case because the condition the Nollans sought to invalidate violated the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment); the instant case is a due process case because Electro-Tech\u2019s refusal to allow a violation of the Taking Clause caused the deprivation of its independent property rights. The Nollans sought to prevent a Fifth Amendment violation; Electro-Tech sought to be made whole for the interference with its right to build on its property, which the jury found to have caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Electro-Tech substantial injury. In terms of the aforementioned hypothetical parade permit, unlike the claim of a person seeking to <em>invalidate </em>the search condition, Electro-Tech\u2019s claim is analogous to that of a person <em>seeking redress </em>for harm to First Amendment rights resulting from a refusal to submit to the unconstitutional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Finally, I believe that if the Nollans\u2019 rights could be vindicated despite their defiance of the law (building without the required permit), certainly Electro-Tech should not be punished or subjected to more difficult procedural hurdles for obeying the law and then seeking a remedy (\u00a7 1983) for the unconstitutional deprivation which resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">I do not believe that the principles recently applied by the Court in <em>Graham v Connor, </em>490 US \u2014; 109 S Ct 1865; 104 L Ed 2d 443 (1989), require us to employ a Fifth Amendment taking analysis to the exclusion of substantive due process theories in cases involving the regulation of land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In <em>Graham, </em>the Court rejected the proposition that claims alleging an excessive use of force by law enforcement officers under \u00a7 1983 are governed by a single \"generic\u201d standard. <em>Id., </em>104 L Ed 2d 453. This standard, applied under the title of substantive due process, was not derived from any specific source of constitutional protection. As the Court observed, however, citizens are protected against government conduct amounting to excessive force by three different constitutional provisions. The \"reasonableness\u201d standard of the Fourth Amendment guards against the excessive use of force in the course of an arrest or other seizure of a free citizen, whereas the less protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tive Eighth Amendment standard applies following conviction. <em>Id., </em>104 L Ed 2d 457. Pretrial detainees are protected by the Due Process Clause (although the Court left open the possibility that pretrial detainees may also enjoy Fourth Amendment protection). <em>Id., </em>104 L Ed 2d 455, n 10. Thus, the indiscriminate application by lower courts of the generic excessive force standard without regard to the applicability of any specific constitutional provision (including the Due Process Clause) improperly converted \u00a7 1983 into a source of substantive federally protected rights, contrary to the Court\u2019s repeated admonishments that \u00a7 1983 is merely a vehicle for \"vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>104 L Ed 2d 454 (citation omitted). The application of the generic excessive force standard by the lower court in <em>Graham </em>was neither derived from, nor compatible with, the Fourth Amendment, which already provided protection against government conduct amounting to excessive force in the course of an investigatory stop. The Court held that all claims of excessive force during the course of \"seizures\u201d are to be treated under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The due process analysis I have undertaken today bears little resemblance to the generic excessive force standard rejected by the Court in <em>Graham. </em>It should be emphasized that <em>Graham </em>does not call into question the viability of substantive due process analyses generally, or in the particular context of excessive force cases. Since pretrial detainees continue to enjoy the protection of the Due Process Clause against the excessive use of force amounting to punishment, <em>id., </em>104 L Ed 2d 455, n 10, and since the legitimacy of such uses of force do not depend on the \"fairness of the <em>procedures </em>used to implement them,\u201d <em>Daniels, supra, </em>p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>331 (emphasis added), the conclusion is unavoidable that the substantive component of the Due Process Clause is a specific source of constitutional protection even in excessive force cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The due process theory outlined above is not a generalized or generic theory potentially applicable to any and all government decisions affecting property. Rather, it is called into play only where it is alleged that government conduct amounting to an arbitrary and deliberate abuse of power has caused a deprivation of life, liberty or property. It would be appropriate, for example, to apply the Taking Clause, but not the Due Process Clause, where rational, nonarbitrary governmental actions cause a physical invasion of a landowner\u2019s property; or to apply the Equal Protection Clause, but not the Due Process Clause, where a facially constitutional land use law has the unforeseen effect of discriminating on the basis of race when applied in particular situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Not only is the due process theory employed in this case not a generic standard, it is not a free-floating standard unanchored to any specific constitutional provision. In language I have already quoted, the Court has clearly and forcefully stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">guarantee of due process has been applied to <em>deliberate </em>decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property. . . . [T]he Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta . . . was \" 'intended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers by government\u2019 \u201d . . . . [B]y barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them ... it serves to prevent governmental power from being \"used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for purposes of oppression\u201d .... <em>[Daniels, supra, </em>p 331. Emphasis in original.][<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On the other hand, the Taking Clause (unlike the Due Process Clause and the Fourth and Eighth Amendments with respect to governmental conduct amounting to excessive force) does not provide \"an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against [the] sort of . . . governmental conduct\u201d undertaken by the City of Westland in the instant case. <em>Graham, supra, </em>104 L Ed 2d 454 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">As its language indicates, and as the Court has frequently noted, [the Fifth Amendment] does not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power. This basic understanding of the Amendment makes clear that it is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights <em>per se, </em>but rather to secure <em>compensation </em>in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking. Thus, government action that works a taking of property rights necessarily implicates the \"constitutional obligation to pay just compensation.\u201d <em>[First English, supra, </em>pp 314-315. Citations omitted; emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">I reemphasize that the conditions imposed in this case and in <em>Nollan </em>did not effect a taking of property; rather, they threatened a taking. The Taking Clause, however, is not concerned with threats, but with <em>actual </em>uncompensated takings of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Any preference for using the Fifth Amendment as the specific constitutional theory of choice in land use regulation cases, to the exclusion of the Due Process Clause, is also questionable as a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ter of constitutional interpretation. As Judge Posner observed in <em>Coniston Corp v Village of Hoffman Estates, supra, </em>p 464:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">One might have thought that the takings clause would occupy the field of constitutional remedies for governmental actions that deprive people of their property, and hence that the plaintiffs\u2019 waiver of their takings claim would drag their due process claims down with it. But this is not correct; pushed to its logical extreme, the argument would read \"property\u201d out of the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">For these reasons I do not agree that the Taking Clause is the appropriate constitutional vehicle for analyzing Electro-Tech\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, or that Electro-Tech has shown a \"taking\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Electro-Tech was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">I would squarely reject the city\u2019s contention that <em>Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527, 541; 101 S Ct 1908; 68 L Ed 2d 420 (1981), should bar Electro-Tech\u2019s substantive due process claim. <em>Parratt, </em>a procedural due process case, addressed negligent, random, and unauthorized acts of low-level state employees and is not applicable in the instant context.

In <em>PruneYard Shopping Center v Robins, </em>447 US 74; 100 S Ct 2035; 64 L Ed 2d 741 (1980), the Court considered a claim that a state law permitting individuals to exercise First Amendment rights on the property of a privately owned shopping center effected a denial of property without due process. The Court, relying on <em>Nebbia v New York, </em>291 US 502, 525; 54 S Ct 505; 78 L Ed 940 (1934), rejected the claim because the law was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. <em>Robins, supra, </em>pp 84-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> See also <em>Cryderman v City of Birmingham, </em>171 Mich App 15, 23-25; 429 NW2d 625 (1988) (following <em>Kropf).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> Judge Giovan further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">Plaintiffs here were complaining of a very specific act, and whether that act, if done by the City, did violate Section 1983 is a question of law.

While I agree with Judge Giovan\u2019s conclusions, see the discussion of <em>Nollan </em>in section v(b), I note here that the city did not challenge Judge Giovan on the record to specify either the precise source of the constitutional violation or the precise property right violated. The city\u2019s only request directly addressing a particular constitutional provision was that the jury be instructed that due process imposes a shocking-to-the-conscience standard.
