Whelan, quotes a lengthy paragraph from a book written by Francis Ianni, a former Columbia University sociology professor, entitled, <em>A Family Business </em>\u2014 Kinship <em>&amp; Social Control in Organized Crime. </em>The paragraph outlines, as an example of interfamily alliances, the relationship between the Tocco and Zerilli families, and contains the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\">Antoinette (Meli) Tocco\u2019s cousin Marie is married to William Bufalino, reputedly a leading member of an upstate New York family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Plaintiff contends that this statement is false and defamatory to the extent that it links him with an organized crime \"family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Plaintiff filed this action against these defendants and others in September, 1981. In July, 1984, all of the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a motion for summary disposition, claiming a qualified privilege to make the statement under two distinct theories. Defendants first claimed a privilege under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s \"public figure\u201d status. <em>New York Times v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964); <em>Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc, </em>418 US 323; 94 S Ct 2997; 41 L Ed 2d 789 (1974). They also claimed a qualified privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>under the common law of this state, since the statement commented upon a matter of \"public interest.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Kurz v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>144 Mich App 205; 375 NW2d 391 (1985); <em>Peisner v Detroit Free Press, </em>82 Mich App 153, 158; 266 NW2d 693 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Both kinds of privilege, defendants argued, required plaintiff to show \"actual malice\u201d on the part of defendants in publishing the statement. Since plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to allege any facts which would support such a claim, defendants continued, they were entitled to summary disposition for plaintiff\u2019s failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Hearings on the motion were held on August 6, 1984, and August 21, 1984. At the conclusion of the second hearing, the trial court granted the motion with respect to a number of individual defendants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but denied the motion as to the instant defendants. The court\u2019s stated reasons for the denial both at the hearing and in its eventual order are brief and of limited value. At the hearing, the court essentially stated only that it believed there to be a \"genuine issue of material fact involved in this case.\u201d It did not identify that issue as whether actual malice existed, nor did it indicate that it was relying on that standard at all, either on the basis of the federal constitutional argument or the common-law qualified privilege claim. The court did state, however, that it would leave the question of plaintiff\u2019s public-figure status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>for purposes of the constitutional defense for \"the jury to decide.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Defendants sought an immediate appeal in the Court of Appeals, raising essentially the same arguments as were raised before the trial court, and claiming additionally that the trial court had erred in leaving the question of plaintiff\u2019s public-figure status to the jury. The Court of Appeals granted leave to appeal and ultimately reversed the decision of the lower court. The Court concluded initially that plaintiff was a public figure as a matter of law, having conceded that very issue in his complaint;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> thus, actual malice was the standard of defendants\u2019 liability. It then found that the trial court had erred in denying the motion for summary judgment, since plaintiff\u2019s general allegations of actual malice were com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>pletely unsupported by any facts from which malice could be inferred, and therefore they failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact for submission to a jury. The Court did not consider defendants\u2019 claim of qualified privilege under this state\u2019s common law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal, limited to the threshold question whether plaintiff is a public figure for purposes of this action. 431 Mich 870 (1988).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon review of the record and the Court of Appeals opinion, we now conclude that the Court of Appeals never properly examined the question of plaintiff\u2019s public-figure status, and that this case therefore should be remanded to that Court for plenary consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The Court of Appeals found plaintiff to be a public figure because he had \"concede[d] as much\u201d in his amended complaint, which, again, alleges his \"national reputation\u201d as, among other things, a labor leader, a poet, a lawyer, and a lecturer. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-9\">It is not necessary to trace the history of qualified privilege or to set out the standards defining those persons against whom the defense of quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>fled privilege might be asserted in a libel case. The applicable case law clearly expresses the controlling principles and sets forth the guidelines for making appropriate determinations. <em>For the limited purposes of this matter, we conclude that the plaintiffs concede in their complaint that they are public f\u00edgures, (supra, </em>amended complaint, paragraphs 60-65) and, as such, that defendants are granted the right of qualified privilege in reporting and/or commenting upon plaintiffs. [Citations omitted. <em>Bufalino v Detroit Magazine, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam, decided August 24, 1987 (Docket Nos. 80533, 81253), slip op pp 2-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">We disagree that plaintiff conceded his public-figure status in his complaint. The allegations contained in plaintiff\u2019s complaint clearly do <em>not </em>amount to a concession of his <em>legal </em>status as a public figure. Moreover, at the risk of reaching the same sort of unsupported conclusion at which the Court of Appeals arrives, it seems safe to conclude that the allegations do not <em>alone </em>suffice to establish that status under the rigorous standards announced in the \"applicable case law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The Court\u2019s error in concluding that plaintiff had conceded this issue is significant to our disposition of this case, since as a result, and despite its references to \"applicable case law\u201d and \"controlling principles,\u201d etc., it failed to engage in any truly substantive legal analysis in support of its conclusion. It failed, for example, to indicate whether plaintiff should be considered a general-purpose or limited-purpose public figure. Even assuming that it intended plaintiff to be viewed as a limited-purpose public figure, the Court also failed to identify the particular \"public controversy\u201d with which plaintiff can properly be associated. In short, the Court of Appeals, because it thought plaintiff had simply conceded the question, failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>to discuss in any meaningful way the merits of defendant\u2019s claim in terms of the \"applicable case law\u201d found in <em>New York Times, Gertz, </em>and their progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">It thus appears that this Court has open to it two alternatives. We can, as a practical matter, simply decide the merits of the issue on the basis of the record before us. While the question whether a person is a public figure for purposes of a defamation action is initially a question for the trial court, the determination is in effect one of law, and can be made by a reviewing court in the first instance on the record as submitted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In this case, the issue was raised by the motion and argued by the parties. On appeal, the same issue was raised, and the trial court was assigned error for leaving the question to the jury. There are no \"factual disputes\u201d involved here. Plaintiff does not claim, for example, that he was never investigated by the United States Senate, or that he has not been mentioned in books dealing with organized crime and been the subject of numerous newspaper articles.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor does he, like Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Levin, challenge the \"authenticity]\u201d of any of defendants\u2019 proofs. Thus, the determination of plaintiif\u2019s status is clearly one of law, to be made on the basis of the existing record, and as such may be made by a reviewing court. <em>Bonnette v West Ottawa Public Schools, </em>165 Mich App 460; 419 NW2d 593 (1987); <em>Capac Bus Drivers Ass\u2019n v Capac Community Schools Bd of Ed, </em>140 Mich App 542; 364 NW2d 739 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The fact that the question has been briefed and argued in this Court weighs in favor of a disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>tion on the merits. The other avenue open to this Court, however, is to remand the case to the Court of Appeals for plenary consideration of the issue. We choose this course for two reasons. First, should the Court of Appeals reach the correct conclusion, on the basis of a proper analysis, after full consideration of the issue, it would be unnecessary for this Court to address the matter further. In addition, should further appellate review be required, we would have available the reasoning of the Court of Appeals. In sum, despite the fact that arguments have been heard in this Court on the merits of the question, we conclude that both the parties and this Court would best be served by remand to the Court of Appeals for full consideration of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We therefore remand this case to the Court of Appeals for plenary consideration of the question whether plaintiff is a public figure for purposes of this libel action. We caution the Court of Appeals that, in doing so, this Court does not wish to be seen as preferring a particular result in this case. A remand is required in this instance not because the Court of Appeals reached the wrong conclusion on this issue, but because it failed, perhaps understandably, to engage in any substantive legal analysis in support of that conclusion. On remand, the Court of Appeals is to reach the result it finds compelled by the entire record before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b894-6\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b894-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuA\">The question presented is whether plaintiff, William E. Bufalino, Sr., is a public figure for purposes of this libel action.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>The subject of the alleged libel is a passage from a September, 1981, Monthly Detroit article entitled \"Jack Tocco: Mob Boss or Model Citizen?\u201d The plaintiff was named in the article as one of thirty-five persons in a single paragraph quoted from a book<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whom the author highlighted as examples of intermarriage among leading organized crime families. The article quoted the following pertinent passage from the book:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">Antoinette (Meli) Tocco\u2019s cousin Marie is married to William Bufalino, reputedly a leading member of an upstate New York family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The parties to this action appear to agree that the word \"family\u201d refers to an organized crime family.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Bufalino commenced this action against the publisher of the magazine and its distributors, among others, and the defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment except as to Monthly Detroit and its distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">On appeal by Monthly Detroit and its distributors, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that summary judgment should have been granted under the rule of <em>New York Times v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964), because Bufalino was a public figure as a matter of law and because there was insufficient evidence of actual malice to raise a genuine issue of material fact for submission to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The Court of Appeals stressed the allegations in the complaint that Bufalino has a \"national repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tation for being a labor leader\u201d and a \"reputation\u201d in other endeavors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal to consider whether Bufalino is a public figure. I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court. An evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether Bufalino is a public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><em>New York Times v Sullivan, supra, </em>pp 279-280, was the first of a number of decisions by the United States Supreme Court that have reordered the balance in state defamation law between the constitutional protections of free speech and press and protection of a person\u2019s reputational interest. <em>Sullivan </em>held that the First Amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires a person who is a public official to establish by clear and convincing evidence that a defamatory statement is false and made with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Several rationales were mentioned by the Court. Discussion on issues of public concern \"should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open [although] it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 270. The Court reasoned that vigorous public debate necessarily would result in some false statements, and that failure to protect even false statements would result in acts of self-censorship destructive to the principle of vigorous public debate. The Court also sought to protect defendants from self-censorship which might result from threats of prospective litigation. <em>Id., </em>pp 271-272, 278-279.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In <em>Curtis Publishing Co v Butts, </em>388 US 130, 154; 87 S Ct 1975; 18 L Ed 2d 1094 (1967), the Court extended <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>free speech and press protections to defamation actions brought by persons who were not public officials, who were found to command \"a substantial amount of independent public interest at the time of the publications,\u201d and \" 'public figures.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The Court subsequently distinguished between a general-purpose public figure and a limited-pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>pose public figure. The former achieves such status through \"clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the aifairs of society . . . .\u201d <em>Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc, </em>418 US 323, 352; 94 S Ct 2997; 41 L Ed 2d 789 (1974); 75 ALR3d 616, 623. The latter become so by \"being drawn or voluntarily injecting [themselves] into . . . particular public controversies]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the aifairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. <em>[Gertz v United States, supra, </em>p 345.][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Although the Court spoke of a \"public figure for all purposes,\u201d it indicated that the general-purpose public figure designation should sparingly be found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\">We would not lightly assume that a citizen\u2019s participation in community and professional affairs rendered him a public figure for all purposes. Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the <em>nature and extent of an individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation. [Id., </em>p 352. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The Court has found four persons <em>not </em>to be public figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In <em>Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc, supra, </em>pp 351-352, the Court declared that, although active in the community and professional affairs, plaintiff attorney, who was an officer of local civic groups and professional organizations and an author, was not a public figure where he achieved no fame or notoriety in the community nor discussed the subject litigation with the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">In <em>Time, Inc v Firestone, </em>424 US 448; 96 S Ct 958; 47 L Ed 2d 154 (1976), the Court declared that a socialite and former wife of a member of a wealthy family was not a public figure, although she was a \"400\u201d member of Palm Beach society and an active member of a sporting set whose activities predictably attracted the attention of a sizeable portion of the public, so much so that she subscribed to a press-clipping service.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">In <em>Hutchinson v Proxmire, </em>443 US 111; 99 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>2675; 61 L Ed 2d 411 (1979), the Court ruled that the plaintiff, a scientist, researcher, professor, government employee, and recipient of federal grants, was not a public figure as a result of receiving Senator Proxmire\u2019s \"Golden Fleece\u201d award, indicative of wasteful government spending.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In <em>Wolston v Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>443 US 157; 99 S Ct 2701; 61 L Ed 2d 450 (1979), the Court held that the plaintiff, interviewed in 1957 by the fbi respecting his relationship to an aunt and uncle who pled guilty of espionage in the Rosenberg case, was not a public figure although he had pled guilty of contempt for failing to appear before a federal grand jury investigating Soviet espionage activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The Court of Appeals found that Bufalino was a limited-purpose public figure, but did not identify the \"particular public controversy\u201d into which he was \"drawn\u201d or \"voluntarily inject[ed] himself.\u201d The Court rested its decision on Bufalino\u2019s allegations in his complaint about his reputation as a labor leader, leader in the fight for fair housing, civil rights, and ethnic equality without identifying a particular public controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Bufalino is an attorney. For many years, he was closely associated with Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters Union. Bufalino is a cousin of Russell Bufalino, a twice-convicted organized-crime figure in Pennsylvania. Organized-crime investigations, by a committee of the United States Congress and by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have reported Russell Bufalino\u2019s involvement in organized crime, William Bufalino\u2019s relationship with Russell Bufalino, and William Bufalino\u2019s involvement in activities under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Bufalino has commenced lawsuits alleging libel and filed a petition with the Congress for redress of grievances respecting alleged injuries resulting from federal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Monthly Detroit has provided the following more detailed summary of the evidence presented in support of the motions for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In 1947, Bufalino became president of Local 985 of the Teamsters Union and commenced a long association with Teamster president Jimmy Hoffa. Over twenty-five years before the article was published, in 1953, a House subcommittee, chaired by Representative Clare E. Hoffman, began investigating racketeering in Detroit. The Hoffman Committee focused on Hoffa and Bufalino as Local 985\u2019s president. The report of the committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">[T]here existed a gigantic, wicked conspiracy to, through the use of force, threats of force and economic pressure, extort and collect millions of dollars not only from unorganized workers but from members of unions who are in good standing, from independent businessmen, and, on occasion, from the Federal Government itself. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">The teamsters union, Local 985, through its president William E. Bufalino, is the principal offender and perpetrator of the racketeering, extortion, and gangsterism. . . . The union attempted, and to some extent succeeded, in obtaining a monopoly in the \"juke-box\u201d business.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Bufalino drew the attention of the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, known as the \"McClellan Committee.\u201d Senate Report No. 1139, part 3, pp 836-837. The report of the committee stated:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Bufalino complained before the committee that he had been associated unjustly with underworld figures that had met at Apalachin, N.Y., in November 1957. However, he refused to deny under oath that a relationship did exist between him and, among others, Russell Bufalino. The committee discovered a letter Bufalino wrote to the Billboard after the Apalachin meeting, in which he extolled the virtues of Russell Bufalino, a man he stated he had known all his life. Testimony established that Bufalino was closely associated in business with hoodlums and racketeers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">The committee\u2019s reaction was summarized at the termination of Bufalino\u2019s testimony:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">\"The Chairman. . . . The operations of Local 985 of the Teamsters Union, headed by Mr. Hoffa\u2019s associate, William E. Bufalino, represent a most disgraceful type of unionism. It is a leech preying upon working men and women to provide personal aggrandizement for Mr. Bufalino and his friends. . . . [NJowhere in this hearing is there to be found one scintilla of evidence that local 985 has done anything to help the wages and working conditions of its members in those industries. To the contrary . . . members of Mr. Bufalino\u2019s local had their wages drastically reduced after they became union members and their employers signed contracts with local 985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">\"[T]he operations of local 985 amount to nothing less than a shakedown and extortion of businessmen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">\"[T]hey perpetrate a dastardly fraud upon human beings the way this union operates. I don\u2019t want any misunderstanding about the Chair\u2019s conclusion. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">\"It is also clearly shown that Bufalino got his start in the jukebox business in 1946 in partnership with and with the backing of certain key figures of the Detroit underworld . . . jukebox companies operating with underworld backing have also had the assistance of Mr. Bufalino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">\"Thus we find a union in alliance with racketeers and which fails to in any way exercise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>proper obligations of labor unionism toward its members and toward the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">An exhibit was introduced during the course of those hearings which reflects the results of a study of organized crime relationships. The chart shows the marriage of Bufalino and his wife as establishing a relationship between the Angelo Meli family of Detroit and the Russell Bufalino family of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Bufalino\u2019s association with organized crime was also the subject of comment by another Senate subcommittee. In its 1965 <em>Report on Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics, </em>the Subcommittee on Investigation of the Committee on Government Operations identified Bufalino as a \"criminal associate\u201d of Russell Bufalino. Senate Report No. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In the 1960\u2019s, Bufalino was appointed by a federal court, at the request of the Teamsters, as a representative on a court-established Board of Monitors which governed the Teamsters Union while Hoffa was incarcerated. During the course of the investigation of the disappearance of Hoffa, Bufalino represented several grand jury witnesses and, as a result of his manner and method of representing those persons, received a substantial amount of publicity. On three different occasions in connection with his representation of Hoffa or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the disappearance of Hoffa, he offered rewards ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. He brought defamation actions against Robert F. Kennedy, Hoffa\u2019s son, James P.

He has also been in business, including as an officer of a union local. Those activities do not distinguish him from many attorneys who have a local and national reputation with various constituencies, and who are also involved in business activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Gertz </em>sought to protect against the conclusion that attorneys, by their involvement in activities unrelated to the law, have become public figures, by requiring that it be shown that they have been \"drawn or voluntarily inject[ed] . . . into a particular public controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">When a defendant in a libel action claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the plaintiff is a public figure, a court must decide both whether there is a particular public controversy and what the parameters of that controversy may be.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has rejected equating \"public controversy\u201d with \"all controversies of interest to the public,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Firestone, supra, </em>p 454, thus making clear that public attention and media interest do not, in and of themselves, necessarily justify a finding that a person is a \"public figure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">The Court of Appeals found that Bufalino was, \"[f]or the limited purposes of this matter,\u201d a \"public figure\u201d because he \"concede[s]\u201d that he is one in his complaint. For this conclusion, the Court noted solely that Bufalino, in his amended complaint, alleged that he has a national reputation for being a labor leader, and a reputation for being a leader in the fight for civil rights, fair housing laws, a leader in the struggle for ethnic equality, a poet, a lawyer and citizen who protects his good name, and a lecturer at several universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Bufalino\u2019s complaint did not concede that he is a \"public figure.\u201d The term \"public figure\u201d expresses a legal conclusion. The legal analysis undertaken by the Court of Appeals on the issue whether Bufalino is a public figure consisted of the statement that \"[t]he applicable case law clearly ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>presses the controlling principles and sets forth the guidelines for making appropriate determinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">It appears that the Court of Appeals melded the general-purpose public figure and limited-purpose public figure analyses. While holding that Bufalino was a public figure \"[f]or the limited purposes of this matter,\u201d and thus suggesting that the scope of the Court\u2019s analysis was directed to whether Bufalino was a limited-purpose public figure, the Court delineated neither a particular public controversy nor how Bufalino was drawn into or thrust himself into the forefront of that controversy by, as his complaint alleges, having reputations in a number of fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Alternatively, if the Court of Appeals concluded that Bufalino, by alleging that he had reputations in a number of areas, was a general-purpose public figure, it did not explain how such allegations gave Bufalino such \"pervasive power and influence,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and such \"pervasive fame or notoriety,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as those terms are understood,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as to have enabled him to become a general-purpose public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Monthly Detroit contends that Bufalino is a general-purpose public figure.

It was not about William Bufalino. Nor was it about Jimmy Hoffa, Frank Fitzsimmons, Senator John McClellan, Robert F. Kennedy, Tony Provenzano, or other persons whom the defendants make some effort to associate as being in the news with Bufalino. Nor was the article about the Teamsters Union or a Senate committee report issued by Senator McClellan about twenty years before the article was published. If the Monthly Detroit article had concerned the Teamsters Union or the McClellan report, a different question would be presented.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The Monthly Detroit article might be said to focus on the issue of organized crime. The defendants so contend. It is unclear what Bufalino has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>done to thrust himself, in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved, into the forefront of a public controversy about organized crime, or how he has been drawn into a public controversy concerning organized crime as distinguished from other possibly newsworthy events.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Bufalino has brought actions in the past against others for allegedly defaming him, but such resort to legal process does not make him a public figure for the purposes of that particular controversy even if such actions were newsworthy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Bufalino in his capacity as an attorney might have represented notorious clients.
