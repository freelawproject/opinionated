The Court of Appeals in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>145 Mich App 405; 377 NW2d 397 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 895 (1986), determined that \u00a7 69 apportionment relief is appropriate when any one element of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity, as represented in its adjusted tax base, is not accurately reflected under the statutory apportionment formula, notwithstanding the fairness of the resulting apportionment. The <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court also approved of an alternate two-step apportionment/ allocation method<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whereby the taxpayer\u2019s tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>base was apportioned under the standard formula exclusive of the \u00a7 9 adjustment for compensation expense. The taxpayer\u2019s actual compensation expense was then directly allocated to determine the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted tax base. We are asked to review the propriety of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">After due consideration, we reject the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>rule. To determine whether the apportionment provisions of the act fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer\u2019s Michigan business activity a reviewing court or tribunal must first find, upon a showing of clear and cogent evidence by the challenging party, that the total business activity attributed to Michigan is out of all appropriate proportion to the actual business transacted in this state or leads to a grossly distorted result. The <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court erroneously concluded that the apportionment provisions of the act failed to fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s total business activity because the formula distorted <em>one </em>element of that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We find greater wisdom in this Court of Appeals panel\u2019s rejection of the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>rule: Since the final apportionment percentage is the <em>average </em>of three component percentages (property, payroll, and sales), it will in all cases be larger than at least, one of the component percentages unless by fortuity all of the components are equal. Thus, the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>rule transforms the \u00a7 69 relief provision into an all-purpose tax equity provision. We agree with this Court of Appeals panel and reject that construction of \u00a7 69. We affirm with modification the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the Court of Claims and remanding this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Trinova is an Ohio-based corporation which manufactures and distributes automobile components nationwide. Its activity in Michigan is confined primarily to a small sales office employing fourteen office and clerical workers who solicit sales orders for Trinova\u2019s glass division and who also provide liaison with its Michigan customers. For the tax year 1980, Trinova\u2019s sales in Michigan totaled $103,981,354, constituting over twenty-six percent of its total sales. Under the act, Trinova was assessed a tax of $293,528 which it paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Approximately one month after the Court of Appeals decided <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, </em>Trinova timely filed with the state an amended tax return claiming a refund of its single business tax for the year 1980. Trinova also sought permission to use an alternative method of apportionment under \u00a7 69, similar to that approved in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Trinova\u2019s requested 1980 tax base apportionment would have resulted in a <em>negative </em>adjusted tax base of $2,042,458, reducing its tax liability for that year to zero.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trinova\u2019s refund and apportionment relief request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Trinova then filed suit in the Court of Claims, seeking the apportionment relief previously requested, as well as $293,528 it claimed as an overpayment for 1980..<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary disposition, the Honorable Robert Holmes Bell agreed with Trinova that the statutorily provided apportionment formula did not fairly represent its 1980 business activity and ordered the state to accept Trinova\u2019s amended tax return for the year 1980. Relying on the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, </em>Judge Bell further ordered the refund of any overpayment and interest due on the basis of Trinova\u2019s alternative apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Court of Claims, specifically rejecting the analysis of the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court. The Court concluded that relief under \u00a7 69 \"was available only where application of the apportionment formula resulted in an unfair representation of the taxpayer\u2019s Michigan-based business activity taken as a whole.\u201d <em>Trinova v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>166 Mich App 656, 663; 421 NW2d 258 (1988). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Court further concluded that 1987 PA 39 was intended to apply retroactively, <em>id., </em>p 665, but did not reach the issue as to whether retroactive application of 1987 PA 39 was constitutional. Rather, the case was remanded to the Court of Claims for further factual development and reconsideration in light of 1987 PA 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Trinova appealed that ruling to this Court, and we granted leave to appeal. 430 Mich 876 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Our resolution of this dispute does not require that we scrutinize the mechanics of the Single Business Tax Act in detail. However, to appreciate the issues raised on appeal, a basic understanding of the components and workings of the single business tax will be helpful. The single business tax is a form of value added tax, although it is not a pure value added tax. <em>Town &amp; Country Dodge, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>420 Mich 226, 234; 362 NW2d 618 (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \"Value added is defined as the increase in the value of goods and services brought about by whatever a business does to them between the time of purchase and the time of sale.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In short, a value added tax is a tax upon business activity. The act employs a value added measure of business activity, but its intended effect is to impose a tax upon the privilege of conducting business activity within Michigan. It is not a tax upon income. MCL 208.31(4); MSA 7.558(31X4)._</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Value added, or business activity, is subject to calculation by two equivalent methods. The first method begins with the taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts from which all outside purchases are subtracted. The residual figure represents the value added by the internal operations of the taxpayer. The second method is additive. All internal payments representing factors of production such as wages, rent, interest, together with the taxpayer\u2019s profit are totaled and constitute the value added by the taxpayer\u2019s efforts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The act employs a modified additive method of value added computation. <em>Mobil Oil Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>422 Mich 473, 495-497; 373 NW2d 730 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The computation of the tax involves several steps beginning with the calculation of the taxpayer\u2019s tax base.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the act, \"tax base\u201d is defined as business income (or loss) before apportionment subject to certain adjustments. MCL 208.9; MSA 7.558(9). \"Business income\u201d is essentially federal taxable income. MCL 208.3(3); MSA 7.558(3)(3). Common adjustments to business income include additions to reflect the business consumption of labor and capital. Those include adding back compensation, depreciation, dividends, and interest <em>paid </em>by the taxpayer to the extent deducted from federal taxable income. Common deductions from business income include dividends, interest, and royalties <em>received </em>by the taxpayer to the extent included in federal taxable income.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>is deducted for the purpose of value added computation because it does not result from capital expenditure by the taxpayer. Kasischke, <em>Computation of the Michigan single business tax: Theory and mechanics, </em>22 Wayne L R 1069, 1081 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Once the taxpayer\u2019s tax base is determined, it must then be allocated to the state where the business activity of the taxpayer can be fairly attributed. \"As a general principle, a State may not tax value earned outside its borders.\u201d <em>ASARCO, Inc v Idaho State Tax Comm, </em>458 US 307, 315; 102 S Ct 3103; 73 L Ed 2d 787 (1982). For example, if a business conducts its business activity exclusively in Michigan, its entire \u00a7 9 tax base would be allocated to Michigan and subject to taxation under the act. MCL 208.40; MSA 7.558(40). If, however, the taxpayer\u2019s business activity was only partially attributable to Michigan, only a portion of that activity may constitutionally be taxed. Consequently, the act provides a formula for apportioning a taxpayer\u2019s tax base between two or more taxing states. MCL 208.45; MSA 7.558(45). The apportionment formula is an average computed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">1. value of taxpayer\u2019s Michigan property _ x average value of taxpayer\u2019s total property ~</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>2. total wages paid in Michigan_ total wages paid by the taxpayer = Y<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">3. sales within Michigan total sales _ z</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">4. X + Y + Z 3 = \u00a745 apportionment percentage<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">5. Section 9 tax base X \u00a7 45 apportionment <em>% \u2014 </em>taxpayer\u2019s apportioned tax base subject to tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Once apportioned, the tax base is then subject to certain adjustments which are not significant for the purpose of this description. The taxpayer, under limited circumstances, also may elect to reduce its apportioned tax base as provided under \u00a7 31 to compensate for high labor compensation costs<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or if its tax base is large in relation to its gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>receipts. MCL 208.31(2), (5); MSA 7.558(31)(2), (5).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Once apportioned and adjusted, the tax base is then multiplied by 2.35 percent to determine the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. MCL 208.31(1); MSA 7.558(31X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">At the heart of this dispute is an additional provision applicable when the taxpayer demonstrates that the apportionment formula provided in \u00a7 45 does not fairly represent the extent of its business activity in the state. MCL 208.69; MSA 7.558(69), prior to 1987 PA 39, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">(1) If the apportionment provisions of this act do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the commissioner may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity, if reasonable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">(a) Separate accounting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">(b) The exclusion of any 1 or more of the factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">(c) The inclusion of 1 or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">(d) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s tax base.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">(2) An alternate method will be effective only if it is approved by the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">At issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals properly rejected Trinova\u2019s request for \u00a7 69 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">We are first asked to consider the propriety of the Court of Appeals ruling in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp, supra, </em>which was relied upon by the Court of Claims and rejected by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Appeals in the instant case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In that case, Jones &amp; Laughlin challenged its tax base apportionment as derived under the statutory three-factor formula for the tax years 1976, 1977, and 1978. For those years the three-factor formula resulted in the apportionment of compensation expense to Michigan which exceeded the taxpayer\u2019s actual compensation expense by an average of sixty-two percent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Further, the compensation component comprised between eighty-five and ninety-four percent of Jones &amp; Laughlin\u2019s adjusted tax base. On the basis of this information, Jones &amp; Laughlin successfully argued that the statutory apportionment formula failed to fairly reflect its Michigan business activity and also gained approval of an alternate apportionment formula which is similar to that used by Trinova in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The apportionment method approved by the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court applied the statutory three-factor formula to the taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 9 tax base exclusive of the adjustment for compensation. To this figure the taxpayer\u2019s actual Michigan compensation was allocated. The sum of these two figures was then multiplied by the statutory rate to determine the single business tax liability. The Court found this method preferable because it employed the taxpayer\u2019s actual compensation figure rather than an approximated amount which \"excessively attributed compensation to Michigan.\u201d <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, </em>p 413. The Court specifically re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>jected the state\u2019s claim that \u00a7 69 relief was warranted only if the apportionment formula resulted in an unfair tax liability. Rather, the Court ruled that when any element of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity as reflected in its tax base is shown to be inaccurately represented, \u00a7 69 relief is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We reject the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>rule because it effectively negates those sections of the act specifying the method for calculating apportioned tax base and thereby converts \u00a7 69 into an all-purpose tax equity provision. We believe that the error of the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court may be traced to an incorrect understanding of the concept of fair apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Legislature has determined that \u00a7 69 apportionment relief may be obtained \"[i]f the apportionment provisions of this act do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state . . . .\u201d Our first task is to determine what is meant by \"fairly represent\u201d as it relates to the proper operation of the statutory apportionment formula. Obviously, from the taxpayer\u2019s perspective, fair business activity representation is that which results in the lowest possible apportioned tax base and resulting tax liability. From the viewpoint of the state, fair representation translates into accountability for every activity of the taxpayer which under the law may be taxed by this state. While the result might be the same under either approach, in practice they are not compatible viewpoints. Consequently, unless the concept of fairness is rooted in something other than the conflicting values of the state and taxpayer or vague notions of equity, it is useless as a demarcation of entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We therefore begin with the unchallenged premise that a fair representation of business activity in this case must be directed to the purpose of apportionment. The central purpose of any apportionment scheme is to \"ensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.\u201d <em>Goldberg v Sweet, </em>488 US 252; 109 S Ct 582, 588; 102 L Ed 2d 607 (1989). Thus, a fair representation of business activity is one which ensures that each state taxes only its share of interstate transactions. With that central function in mind, it becomes obvious that \u00a7 69 functions essentially as a constitutional \"circuit breaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Taxation of the intrastate activity of an interstate enterprise presents the potential for Due Process and Commerce Clause violations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To preserve the constitutionality of the act, \u00a7 69 allows the use of an alternate method of apportionment if the apportionment provisions result in the unconstitutional taxation of a unitary business.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, we believe that \u00a7 69 applies only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the most unusual of circumstances \u2014 when the statutory method operates unconstitutionally to tax the extraterritorial activity of the taxpayer. While admittedly the taxpayer gains from the operation of \u00a7 69 by a reduction of its apportioned tax base, the primary role of \u00a7 69 is to safeguard the act and not to shelter the taxpayer. Only when read in light of this basic constitutional foundation does \"fairness\u201d as a guiding principle serve the function of objective measure. Consequently, we turn to established constitutional doctrine to ascertain the guideposts of \"fairness\u201d in our review of the act\u2019s formulary apportionment scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As a general rule, a state may not \"tax value earned outside its borders.\u201d <em>ASARCO, Inc; supra, </em>p 315. \"In the case of a more-or-less integrated business enterprise operating in more than one state, however, arriving at precise territorial allocations of 'value\u2019 is often an elusive goal, both in theory and in practice.\u201d <em>Container Corp v Franchise Tax Bd, </em>463 US 159, 164; 103 S Ct 2933; 77 L Ed 2d 545 (1983). Because of the nebulous nature of value or, in this case, business activity, and the difficulty confronted when attempting to identify purely intrastate value, the United States Supreme Court has refused to require the use of one formula to the exclusion of all others. <em>Id.; Goldberg v Sweet, supra, </em>109 S Ct 588. \"Such an apportionment formula must, under both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, be fair.\u201d <em>Container Corp, supra, </em>p 169. See also <em>Shell Oil Co v Iowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>488 US 19; 109 S Ct 278; 102 L Ed 2d 186, 199 (1988) (the function of an apportionment formula is to determine the portion of a unitary business\u2019 income that can be \"fairly\u201d attributed to in-state activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The first component of fairness in an apportionment formula has been termed \"internal consistency.\u201d <em>Id..</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To be internally consistent, a formula must result in no more than one hundred percent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity being taxed if all taxing jurisdictions employed the same formula. In this case, the apportionment provisions of the single business tax are internally consistent because no multiple taxation would result if every state were to adopt the act. The business activity of any unitary business would be apportioned by each taxing jurisdiction using the identical method. Trinova does not contest the internal consistency of the act\u2019s apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The second component of a fair apportionment formula is \"external consistency.\u201d External consistency requires that the choice of factors used in the formula \"must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how [the business activity] is generated.\u201d <em>Id.; Goldberg v Sweet, supra, </em>109 S Ct 589. The constitution does not require an exact apportionment, and an apportionment formula will not be judged to be unfair if \"it <em>may </em>result in taxation of some [business activity] that did not have its source in the taxing State . . . .\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg Co v Bair, </em>437 US 267, 272; 98 S Ct 2340; 57 L Ed 2d 197 (1978). An apportionment formula will be struck as being externally inconsistent only upon a showing by the taxpayer of \"clear and cogent evidence\u201d that the business activity attributed to the state is \"out of all appropriate proportions\u201d to the business transacted in that state, or \"has led to a grossly distorted result.\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg Co, supra, </em>p 274; <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R Co v Missouri </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>State Tax Comm, </em>390 US 317, 326; 88 S Ct 995; 19 L Ed 2d 1201 (1968).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, </em>the Court of Appeals ignored these principles of fair apportionment. Rather, it found the statutory apportionment formula to unfairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s intrastate business activity because compensation, as reflected in the \u00a7 9 tax base, was \"over-apportioned or excessively attributed\u201d to Michigan. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, </em>p 413. We cannot agree with this conclusion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">First, while we agree with the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>Court that the test for fairness is not whether the taxpayer\u2019s final tax liability is reasonable when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>weighed against its intrastate business activity, we disagree with the standard adopted by that Court. The Court of Appeals determined that the statutory formula yielded an unfair apportionment because 1) eighty-five to one hundred percent of the taxpayers\u2019 adjusted tax bases consisted of compensation; 2) use of the three-factor formula overstated compensation more than fifty percent; and 3) the taxpayers\u2019 actual Michigan compensation could be precisely calculated. On these facts, the Court held that the taxpayers had \"presented clear and convincing evidence 'that the statutory formula inadequately or inaccurately represented] [their] unitary business activity in the taxing state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, </em>p 413, quoting, <em>Donovan v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>126 Mich App 11, 21; 337 NW2d 297 (1983). As noted, however, the test for fair apportionment is not whether a formula results in inadequate or even inaccurate apportionment. The test is whether the use of a particular method of apportionment results in business activity being attributed to this state which is \"out of all appropriate proportions\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s intrastate business activity, or has \"led to a grossly distorted result.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As explained earlier, \"fairness\u201d in the context of multistate tax or tax base apportionment must be considered under Due Process and Commerce Clause analysis. The opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>is wholly lacking in consideration of internal consistency. Even assum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ing that the Court\u2019s analysis was directed towards the concerns of external consistency, we do not believe that identifying a fifty-percent overstatement of compensation, which is but one element of the taxpayer\u2019s intrastate business activity, demonstrates by \"clear and cogent evidence\u201d that the business activity attributed to this state was \"out of all appropriate proportion\u201d to the business transacted in the state, or has led \"to a grossly distorted result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As a precondition to \u00a7 69 relief, a showing must be made that the taxpayer\u2019s business activity within this state is unfairly represented. Under the Single Business Tax Act, \"business activity\u201d is defined as encompassing any transfer of property, performance of services, or a combination thereof \"with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage.\u201d MCL 208.3(2); MSA 7.558(3)(2).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The subject of the act thus encompasses the complete range of entrepreneurial activities of which compensating employees is but one part. Consequently, to conclude that a taxpayer\u2019s business activity is not fairly apportioned because a single component of that activity, when examined by geographical accounting, is not accurately reflected under the statutory apportionment scheme belies the very definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>business activity. \"The problem with this method is that formal accounting is subject to manipulation and imprecision, and often ignores or captures inadequately the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the components of a single enterprise.\u201d <em>Container Corp, supra, </em>pp 164-165.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Obviously, compensation will be a substantial portion of the tax base in most businesses. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the integrated nature of formulary apportionment which rejects separate accounting as a means to identify business activity by reference to a discrete geographic boundary. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, it is \"precisely the sort of formal geographical accounting whose basic theoretical weaknesses justify resort to formula apportionment in the first place.\u201d <em>Container Corp, supra, </em>p 181.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Further, while admittedly the three-factor formula is not perfect, and its application in a value added tax scheme is relatively unique, the constitution requires neither a perfect formula nor a perfect apportionment. The United States Supreme Court long ago upheld the constitutionality of formulary apportionment. See, e.g., <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons, Inc v North Carolina, </em>283 US 123; 51 S Ct 385; 75 L Ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>879 (1931). Further, the Court has specifically found that property, payroll, and sales may be appropriate ingredients of an apportionment formula, <em>Butler Bros v McColgan, </em>315 US 501, 509; 62 S Ct 701; 86 L Ed 991 (1942). Indeed, the three-factor formula is viewed as \"something of a benchmark against which other apportionment formulas are judged.\u201d <em>Container Corp, supra, </em>p 170. See also <em>Amerada Hess Corp v New Jersey Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>490 US \u2014; 109 S Ct 1617; 104 L Ed 2d 58 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In short, while we recognize that certain components of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity are subject to accurate geographic attribution, we do not believe that \"business activity\u201d as defined under the act is susceptible to accurate analysis when only one component of the total business effort is examined. To properly judge the propriety of a taxpayer\u2019s apportioned business activity, we must view the activity as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">THE APPLICATION OP \u00a7 69 TO TRINOVA</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In the present case, Trinova sought \u00a7 69 apportionment relief on the ground that its apportioned 1980 compensation was approximately forty times greater than its actual Michigan compensation, and that its apportioned depreciation was approximately one thousand times greater than its actual Michigan depreciation. On the basis of these two facts, Trinova persuaded the Court of Claims that the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>rule entitled it to relief because the act\u2019s apportionment formula failed to accurately represent its Michigan business activity. We do not believe that these two facts show by \"clear and cogent evidence\u201d that the statutory apportionment provisions attributed business ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tivity to Michigan which was \"out of all appropriate proportion\u201d to Trinova\u2019s actual business transacted in Michigan, or \"has led to a grossly distorted result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">As calculated under \u00a7 45, the apportionment formula resulted in an apportionment percentage of 8.9717. More specifically, of Trinova\u2019s \u00a7 9 tax base of $221,125,319, approximately nine percent was apportioned to Michigan resulting in an apportioned tax base of $19,838,700. We simply cannot conclude as a matter of law that this amount is out of all appropriate proportion to Trinova\u2019s Michigan business activity or results in a grossly distorted apportionment figure. Trinova\u2019s actual Michigan compensation was $511,774, and its actual property as reflected in its depreciation expense was $2,152. While these figures obviously represent a very small percentage of Trinova\u2019s total business activity, they are offset by its Michigan sales figure of $103,981,354.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When viewed as a whole, we believe the averaged ratios of Trinova\u2019s payroll, property, and sales \"actually reflect a reasonable sense of how [its Michigan business activity was] generated,\u201d clearly satisfying the constitutional requirements of internal and external consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We emphasize that \u00a7 69 was not intended as an all-purpose tax equity provision. However, assuming arguendo that the Legislature intended \u00a7 69 as a tax equity provision, we would nevertheless reject Trinova\u2019s petition<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for relief. Our reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>MCL 208.68(1); MSA 7.558(68)(1) indicates that certain businesses which do not own or rent real estate or tangible personal property in Michigan and which do not have gross sales in Michigan in excess of $100,000 may use an apportioned tax base consisting only of sales. Thus, it is clear that the Legislature was aware that business activity heavily weighted toward sales might better be taxed upon a different base. However, the Legislature provided relief in only the more extreme cases. The apportionment formula proposed by Trinova under \u00a7 69<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> uses a tax base identical to that provided in \u00a7 68, yet Trinova does not meet any of the qualifying criteria imposed by the Legislature. We find it most difficult to believe that the Legislature intended to provide relief under the general provision of \u00a7 69 which it expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>precluded under the more specific \u00a7 68. See, generally, 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 51.05, pp 499-500. It is indeed the careful and specific drafting of the Single Business Tax Act which leads us to the conclusion that the Legislature saw no need for an all-purpose tax equity provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In passing, we also note that the sales at issue were not \"at retail,\u201d MCL 205.51; MSA 7.521, and therefore do not fall within Michigan\u2019s General Sales Tax Act, MCL 205.52; MSA 7.522. Therefore, if Trinova\u2019s construction of the Single Business Tax Act is correct, $103,981,354 in sales will be entirely untaxed. Considering the two acts in pari materia, <em>County Rd Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Bd of State Canvassers, </em>407 Mich 101, 118-119; 282 NW2d 774 (1979),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we believe that this result was not within the intentions of the Legislature in enacting the single business tax. Again, we observe the express legislative intent that the \"tax so levied and imposed is upon the privilege of doing business . . . .\u201d MCL 208.31(4); MSA 7.558(31X4).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">While we do not adopt all of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this case, we agree with its conclusion that Trinova has failed to demonstrate an entitlement to tax-base relief under \u00a7 69. To the extent that the decision in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>is inconsistent with this opinion, it is overruled.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We hold that \u00a7 69 apportionment relief may obtain upon a showing by the challenging party of clear and cogent evidence that the total business activity attributed to the state is out of all appropriate proportion to the taxpayer\u2019s intrastate business activity or has led to a grossly distorted result. Here, the challenging party, Trinova, has failed to show that its total business activity attributed to Michigan is out of all appropriate proportion to the taxpayers intrastate business or has led to a grossly distorted result.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We therefore affirm that aspect of the Court of Appeals decision reversing the decision of the Court of Claims.

In our view, \u00a7 69(1) clearly requires that a taxpayer petition for relief before an alternate apportionment formula will be considered. Further, \u00a7 69(2) specifically mandates that \"[a]n alternate method will be effective only if it is approved by the commissioner.\u201d MCL 208.69(2); MSA 7.558(69)(2). It is undisputed that the taxpayers in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>neither petitioned for, nor obtained commissioner approval of the apportionment formula ultimately used. The Tax Tribunal excused this requirement in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>because of a lack of procedural rules for the evaluation of an alternate formula. We cannot so easily disregard the express language of \u00a7\u00a7 69(1) and 69(2).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae5\">The petition requirement of \u00a7 69(1) and the prior approval requirement of \u00a7 69(2) are in no way dependent upon the adoption of formal procedural rules for the evaluation of an alternate apportionment formula. We cannot condone a ruling which permits clear legislation to be ignored. In short, the Court of Appeals in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>failed to properly determine the fairness of the statutory apportionment formula under accepted constitutional measures and further failed to enforce the express procedural requirement of \u00a7\u00a7 69(1) and 69(2) before approving the taxpayers\u2019 requests for apportionment relief. This is clarified in the amended \u00a7 69(4). In remanding this matter, we do not preclude the defendant from raising this issue in the Court of Claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\"> See n 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> As explained in 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 51.03, p 468, the guiding principle for whether statutes are in pari materia is whether it is natural and reasonable to think that the understanding of members of the Legislature would be influenced by the other statute. In our view, it is natural and reasonable to think that the Legislature considered the scope of the General Sales Tax Act in drafting the Single Business Tax Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> We also are asked to decide whether 1987 PA 39 was intended by the Legislature to apply retroactively to tax years prior to 1987, and, if so, whether that enactment is constitutional. The Attorney General argues that even if <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>correctly construed the act prior to amendment, 1987 PA 39 must be applied retroactively to defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Trinova\u2019s claim. Trinova itself seeks no relief under the amendment. Therefore, in light of our rejection of the rule of <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>and Trinova\u2019s claim for apportionment relief, we find it unnecessary to reach these remaining two issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
