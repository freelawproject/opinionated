That issue requires that we determine whether the defendant\u2019s request for appointed counsel at arraignment invoked the right to counsel under <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), and thus prohibited subsequent police-initiated custodial interrogation on unrelated charges. We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in extending the no-access rule of <em>Michigan v Jackson, </em>475 US 625; 106 S Ct 1404; 89 L Ed 2d 631 (1986), to a charge unrelated to that for which the defendant had invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Once a defendant has been formally charged, the Sixth Amendment guarantees prohibit subsequent police-initiated postarraignment interrogations on the charges. <em>Michigan v Jackson, supra. </em>Under the facts in this case, there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the defendant had not been formally charged with the bank robbery at the time of either interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">In regard to defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel, <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981), and <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Paintman, </em>412 Mich 518; 315 NW2d 418 (1982), cert den 456 US 995 (1982), prohibit police-initiated interrogation only after a suspect has invoked his right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>during a custodial interrogation. In addition, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s most recent Fifth Amendment confession decision, <em>Arizona v Roberson, </em>486 US 675; 108 S Ct 2093; 100 L Ed 2d 704 (1988), holds that a suspect\u2019s request for counsel during a custodial interrogation on any charge could not be circumvented by police-initiated interrogation on a new charge while the defendant remained in continuous custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In this case, the defendant did not invoke his right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>in the context of a custodial interrogation, and thus, a subsequent police-initiated interrogation in relation to the bank robbery charge was not prohibited. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable waiver of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>was valid, and his statements were admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Further, while the United States Supreme Court refused to comment on the specific issue in <em>Michigan v Jackson, supra, </em>whether a defendant invokes his Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights to counsel at an arraignment, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that the rationale of <em>Roberson </em>for extending the right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>to separate investigations while an individual remains in continuous custody supports extending a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel invoked at an arraignment to postarraignment interrogations on unrelated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals that defendant\u2019s statement should have been suppressed and reinstate the determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The defendant was charged with and convicted of bank robbery<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after a bench trial in Ingham Circuit Court and was sentenced to serve from ten to twenty years in prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">At the preliminary examination, defense counsel objected to the admission of defendant\u2019s statement incriminating himself in the robbery, which he made during an interrogation initiated by fbi agents on May 7, 1985.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argued he asserted his right to remain silent when Detective Miller of the Lansing Police Department questioned him on May 6, 1985, about the same robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The magistrate addressed the issues regarding the effect of later questioning once a person has invoked his right to counsel and to silence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>conducted a <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing inquiring into the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession and the events occurring prior to, and during both interrogations, as well as the arraignment on unrelated charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Detective Miller questioned the defendant regarding the bank robbery at approximately 11:30 a.m. on May 6, 1985, while the defendant was in custody on other charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The detective testified he advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the defendant signed a waiver, indicating a willingness to talk. He further testified that the defendant never said he did not want to talk or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>wished to remain silent, and that when the defendant denied any knowledge of the bank robbery the interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">On direct examination, the defendant testified that the questioning stopped because he would not give answers to Detective Miller\u2019s questions concerning the robbery. However, on cross-examination he admitted he never said he did not want to answer questions, only that he did not wish to speak anymore after saying that he had not been involved in the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Later that same day, the defendant was arraigned on the charges of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling and assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, and was cited for failure to appear for trial on an outstanding bench warrant for an unrelated offense. The judge first questioned the defendant regarding the failure to appear for trial,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and then addressed the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the arraignment the defendant ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>cepted the court-appointed counsel for the breaking and entering and assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The next day, after the arraignment, two fbi agents conducted another interrogation regarding the bank robbery. The defendant testified that FBI Agent Askin readvised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that he talked to the agents voluntarily and of his own free will.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Agent Askin testified that while at first the defendant denied knowledge of the robbery, when she told the defendant that fingerprints had been taken from the bank, he said he would talk, but wanted other people \"to go down with him.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant then dictated a state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ment to Agent Askin implicating himself in the robbery, which he proofread before signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Afterwards, the trial judge agreed to accept briefs addressing the issues whether after arraignment and request for counsel a defendant can be questioned on other charges,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> whether the indication by the interrogator that certain proofs were in existence affected the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s subsequent statement, and whether the advice pertaining to <em>Miranda </em>rights given prior to the second interview were sufficient in light of the evidence that in the first interview there was some indication from the defendant that he did not want to answer any further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The judge subsequently denied the motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statement<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>eluded the preliminary examination, holding that on the basis of all the evidence, including the statement, the crime charged in the complaint had been committed, and there was probable cause to believe the defendant committed it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Prior to trial, defense counsel brought motions to quash and suppress the defendant\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On September 4, 1985, Judge Bell conducted proceedings on the matter and, in his opinion denying the motion, held in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">From a review of the preliminary examination transcript and testimony given on September 4, 198[5], before This Court it appears the evidence demonstrates the defendant at no time told Detective Miller he did not want to talk with him, that he didn\u2019t have anything to say or that he wished to remain silent. The record more clearly indicates the defendant stated he had no knowledge of the bank robbery and wasn\u2019t involved in it. The second interview by the fbi some twenty-seven hours later, again, contained no evidence of defendant not wanting to talk or wishing to remain silent. Thus, the record does not support defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>contention that he asserted his right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">This Court is constrained to find no fifth amendment assertion took place at the first interrogation and therefore subsequent questioning was permissible. Even if it were to be assumed that the initial questioning resulted in defendant\u2019s assertion of fifth amendment rights, the scrupulous nature with which Detective Miller terminated the interview, the twenty-seven hours [sic] interval between questioning and the second giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, by itself does not render the subsequent incriminating testimony involuntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">[W]here the defendant was charged and arraigned on unrelated charges and apparently was to receive court appointed counsel on these charges, recent caselaw would suggest he could not be interrogated as to these unrelated charges without presence of counsel, unless he initiated the conversation with the police. <em>People v Bladel (After Remand), </em>421 Mich 39 [365 NW2d 56] (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">The question presented, then, is whether the defendant\u2019s assertion of his sixth amendment right to counsel on unrelated matters vitiates his waiver of fifth amendment right to remain silent on this charge. This Court does not believe that it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">The facts here suggest that defendants [sic] request for Court appointed counsel, or the Courts [sic] initiation of the request, was made as a routine arraignment manner [sic]. It is nowhere suggested that at the arraignment the defendant was interrogated or that an atmosphere of coercion existed. In fact quite the contrary, the evidence suggests that the sixth amendment right was conferred upon him as it pertained to judicial proceedings held in the unrelated charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">Further, it appears that a clear and unambiguous waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights preceded the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>interview by Special Agent Askin. Accordingly, This Court determines that the assertion of sixth amendment right to counsel did not render the subsequent waiver of counsel on unrelated matters invalid.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">At trial, the defendant admitted he robbed the bank and that he told the fbi agent he understood his rights during the interrogation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On the basis of the teller\u2019s testimony, the trial judge found beyond a reasonable doubt that a robbery occurred and that there appeared to be no contest as to the truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s confession which the court previously had found constitutionally sound:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">This Court is satisfied that the standard for determination of voluntariness is made based upon [sic] a preponderance of the evidence. It appears that this Court has issued an opinion and order following considerably well-drafted briefs, and well-prepared reasoning by both parties on 25th of September of 1985. . . . [T]his Court concluded that on the three issues that the Court had before it, that in fact, constitutionally, there was no violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>to counsel, both as it pertained to the alleged existence of the counsel on the date that the statement was made, and this was never shown to be in existence. There was shown to have been a request or demand either made by the court or by the defendant for court-appointed counsel, and it appears further that the issue of waiver of rights to counsel as it pertains to this matter is not before this Court, because this Court has concluded previously, and it does so conclude today, that there was a requisite giving of the so-called <em>Miranda </em>rights in their full and complete context by Agent Askin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">This Court has to conclude, based upon [sic] the incorporation of its earlier rulings on September the 25th, together with the findings of fact that it has just now made, that this statement was in fact a free, voluntary statement made by the Defendant after a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights on the particular day of the \u2014 I believe it\u2019s the 7th of May of 1985.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On appeal,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of its belief that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the written confession made by the defendant to the fbi agents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">When defendant requested counsel at his arraignment on the charges of breaking and entering and felonious assault, we presume that he was invoking both his Sixth Amendment right to be represented at every critical stage of the prosecution of those two charges as well as his Fifth Amendment right to be represented during interrogation on the breaking and entering and assault charges or on any other crime for which he may have been a suspect. Thus, the fbi\u2019s interrogation of defendant after the arraignment violated defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to be represented by counsel during custodial interrogation. [170 Mich App 403, 408; 427 NW2d 634 (1988).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The Court of Appeals found the reasoning employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States ex rel Espinoza v Fairman, </em>813 F2d 117 (CA 7, 1987), persuasive and adopted the analysis of that court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">[T]he Seventh Circuit concluded that an individual who requests an attorney at arraignment invokes both Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections since that individual is essentially requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>an intermediary in his or her dealings with the government. Citing <em>Michigan v Jackson, </em>475 US 625; 106 S Ct 1404; 89 L Ed 2d 631 (1986), the Court noted that a request for counsel must be broadly rather than narrowly interpreted and that an individual unskilled in the law cannot generally be expected to articulate the particular authority under which his or her constitutional right to counsel is being invoked. The Seventh Circuit held that the authorities should presume that a request for counsel at arraignment invokes both Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections. <em>[Crusoe, supra, </em>p 407.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Recognizing that its opinion conflicted with the opinion in <em>People v Buckles, </em>155 Mich App 1; 399 NW2d 421 (1986),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals certified this case as a conflict. <em>Crusoe, supra, </em>p 409.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">This Court granted leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether the trial court erred in holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was admissible because the defendant had waived his rights under <em>Miranda v Arizona, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">As a rule, the admissibility of an accused\u2019s confession made during a police-initiated custodial interrogation depends on the results of two distinct inquiries. First, courts must determine whether the accused actually invoked his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>counsel.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Second, where the accused has invoked his right to counsel, his later statement is admissible only upon a finding that the defendant initiated further discussions with the police and knowingly and intelligently waived the right he had invoked. <em>Smith v Illinois, </em>469 US 91, 95; 105 S Ct 490; 83 L Ed 2d 488 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The Court of Appeals held that the defendant effectively invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> with respect to the bank robbery charge when he availed himself of his Sixth Amendment<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>right to counsel at his arraignment on different and unrelated charges. <em>Post, </em>p 697. This then, according to the panel, invoked the rule of <em>Edwards v Arizona </em>and <em>People v Paintman </em>that a criminal suspect undergoing custodial interrogation who has expressed a desire to deal with police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available, unless the suspect initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversation with the police. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>pp 484-485.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Accordingly, because Crusoe\u2019s subsequent statements concerning the bank robbery were made during a police-initiated questioning following his request for counsel at the arraignment on other charges, the Court of Appeals essentially concluded that Crusoe\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination was violated, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s apparently voluntary and knowledgeable waiver of this right.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">This case requires the resolution of two distinct issues: (1) whether a defendant\u2019s request for appointment of counsel at an arraignment invokes both Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights to counsel and, if not (2) whether the Court should extend Fifth Amendment protections to prohibit subsequent police-initiated questioning following a defendant\u2019s request for court-appointed counsel at an arraignment on unrelated charges while a suspect remains in custody.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In concluding that when the defendant requested counsel at his arraignment he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to be represented during interrogation on those charges or any other crime for which he may have been a suspect, <em>Crusoe, supra, </em>p 408, the Court of Appeals adopted the reasoning employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Espinoza v Fairman, supra. </em>The <em>Espinoza </em>court, relying on <em>Michigan v Jackson, supra, </em>held that individuals who assert the right to counsel at an arraignment invoke both their Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights to counsel. However, in my opinion, the <em>Espinoza </em>court\u2019s reliance on <em>Jackson </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In <em>Jackson, </em>the Court held only that the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel guarantees that right at postarraignment interrogations on those charges because such interrogations represent \"critical stages\u201d of adversary judicial proceedings to which the Sixth Amendment applies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>pp 629-630. The Court recognized a defendant\u2019s invocation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is as protected as is the invocation of the right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>at a custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">[A]fter a formal accusation has been made \u2014 and a person who had previously been just a \"suspect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>has become an \"accused\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment \u2014 the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel is of such importance that the police may no longer employ techniques for eliciting information from an uncounseled defendant that might have been entirely proper at an earlier stage of their investigation. <em>[Michigan v Jackson, supra, </em>p 632.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The Court extended the rule of <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>finding that \"if police initiate interrogation after a defendant\u2019s assertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>p 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">This Court, from which <em>Jackson </em>was appealed, held that the defendant\u2019s request for counsel at his arraignment implicated only his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, <em>Bladel, supra, </em>p 52, relying on the holding in <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291, 298; 100 S Ct 1682; 64 L Ed 2d 297 (1980), that the Fifth Amendment right to counsel attaches only when an accused is in custody and is subjected to interrogation. Accordingly, we concluded that the arraignment process did not implicate a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, because it involves no compulsion of the accused to give evidence having testimonial significance. <em>Bladel, supra, </em>p 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">We recognize that the United States Supreme Court did not pass judgment on the validity of this Court\u2019s Fifth Amendment analysis in <em>Jackson.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Nevertheless, the Court did not hold that the invocation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at an arraignment also invokes a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Espinoza, supra, </em>pp 122-123. The <em>Espinoza </em>court\u2019s conclusion that \"[T]he <em>Jackson </em>Court specifically observed that an individual who has been arraigned has both a Sixth Amendment and a Fifth Amendment right to counsel at a 'post-arraignment custodial interrogation,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>p 123, citing <em>Jackson, supra, </em>was based on this language from <em>Jackson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">The question is not whether respondents had a right to counsel at their postarraignment, custodial interrogations. The existence of that right is clear. It has two sources. The Fifth Amendment protection against compelled self-incrimination provides the right to counsel at custodial interrogations. <em>Edwards, </em>451 US at 482; <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 470 (1966). The Sixth Amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel also provides the right to counsel at postarraignment interrogations. The arraignment signals \"the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings\u201d and thus the attachment of the Sixth Amendment, <em>United States v Gouveia, </em>467 US 180, 187, 188 [104 S Ct 2292; 81 L Ed 2d 146] (1984); thereafter, government efforts to elicit information from the accused, including interrogation, represent \"critical stages\u201d at which the Sixth Amendment applies. <em>[Id., </em>pp 629-630.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We disagree with the conclusion reached by the <em>Espinoza </em>court upon which the Court of Appeals relied that from <em>Jackson, </em>which bars police-initiated interrogation after indictment in the absence of counsel, it follows that once an accused\u2019s Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Amendment right to counsel attaches his Fifth Amendment rights become unwaivable in the context of a separate investigation. In <em>Jackson, </em>the Court rejected the state\u2019s claim that a defendant\u2019s request for counsel at arraignment should be limited to the right to assistance at court proceedings and should not extend to subsequent custodial interrogations on the charges; however, the Court did not hold that the request indicated \"a desire for legal assistance at subsequent custodial interrogations\u201d on other unrelated charges, as inferred by the dissent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>p 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">This conclusion ignores the fact that the constitutional basis upon which the right to counsel is invoked determines both when the right attaches and what constitutes a valid waiver of the right.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Project, <em>Eighteenth annual review of criminal procedure, </em>77 Geo L J 489, 647 (1989). In <em>Maine v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>Moulton, </em>474 US 159, 180; 106 S Ct 477; 88 L Ed 2d 481 (1985), the Supreme Court distinguished the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">[T]o exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public\u2019s interest in the investigation of criminal activities. Consequently, incriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are inadmissible at the trial of those charges, notwithstanding the fact that the police were also investigating other crimes, if, in obtaining this evidence, the State violated the Sixth Amendment by knowingly circumventing the accused\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s conclusion, the Supreme Court has never rejected <em>Moulton </em>as authority in the context of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>Roberson, </em>the Court simply rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that the rationale employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Moulton<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> could be used to exclude \" 'statements about different offenses, developed at different times, by different investigators, in the course of two wholly independent investigations,\u2019 \u201d finding the defendant\u2019s statement in <em>Roberson </em>that \" 'he wanted a lawyer before answering <em>any </em>questions\u2019 \u201d invoked his right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>and prohibited subsequent police-initiated interrogations while he remained in custody.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Roberson, supra, </em>p 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">At issue in the case before this Court is whether the defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>was valid and whether his statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>admissible at trial. We find no authority for the adoption of a rule that a defendant\u2019s request for court-appointed counsel at an arraignment invalidates a waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel per se under <em>Miranda </em>during a subsequent police-initiated interrogation concerning a different and unrelated offense.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>United States v Roberts, </em>869 F2d 70, 74 (CA 2, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Accordingly, we find the defendant\u2019s subsequent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights during the police-initiated interrogation concerning the bank robbery offense was not rendered invalid under the rule of <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>and, in light of the inapplicability of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Paintman, supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s statements implicating himself in the robbery are admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The dissent finds that <em>Crusoe </em>requires us to reevaluate the analysis in <em>Bladel, </em>noting that <em>\"Bladel\u2019s </em>Fifth Amendment analysis is inconsistent with other portions of that opinion expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>Jackson, </em>and with other reasoning in the <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Roberson </em>decisions,\u201d concluding that the holding of <em>Arizona v Roberson,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that police-initiated interrogation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>suspect is prohibited without providing counsel where the suspect has previously cut off interrogation, is applicable to this situation where \"the suspect\u2019s request for counsel occurs not during a preceding custodial interrogation, but during a preceding arraignment on another charge.\u201d Post, p 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The dissent\u2019s rationale for extending the holdings of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Roberson </em>is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">when defendant requested counsel at his arraignment, he felt that he was not \"sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly\u201d [and] [h]is request expressed a desire for a lawyer\u2019s help, not just with formal legal proceedings, but with all subsequent adversarial confrontations, including custodial interrogation. His request was as effective an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel as a request to a police officer during interrogation would have been. <em>[Post, </em>p 706.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">However, this conclusion does not take into consideration that the two prerequisites that trigger <em>Miranda </em>procedural safeguards are <em>custody and </em>interrogation,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and, assuming that the suspect is in a sufficiently coercive atmosphere to even warrant <em>Miranda </em>protections,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> that there must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>an indication by the suspect that he wishes to consult an attorney before speaking<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> in order to bar any further police-initiated questioning.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The request for counsel reflects the subjective belief of the defendant that he is uncomfortable with the pressures of custodial interrogation, and is \"precisely the state of mind that <em>Edwards </em>presumes to persist unless the suspect himself initiates further conversation about the investigation . . . .\u201d <em>Roberson, supra, </em>p 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In <em>Roberson, </em>the Supreme Court found that it is reasonable to assume that when an accused undergoing custodial interrogation about one charge asserts he wants counsel before making a statement, he wants counsel before making statements concerning any charges while he remains in continuous custody.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, a request for counsel at an arraignment does not reflect a similar sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>jective belief on the part of the defendant, which is the significant factor in both <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Roberson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Therefore, absent the <em>Edwards </em>concern \"with police conduct that might badger an accused into abandoning a previously invoked right,\u201d or evidence that the defendant\u2019s arrest on the unrelated charges was a sham intended to make him available for questioning on the bank robbery charge, we do not agree that <em>Roberson </em>supports the argument that this Court should presume that a request for counsel invoked at an arraignment reflects the desire for legal assistance during custodial interrogation on different and unrelated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The dissent\u2019s interpretation would hold that once an accused has asserted his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, <em>Edwards </em>acts as a bar to any valid waiver of the right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>in an investigation of a wholly new incident, thus making it \"impossible for a suspect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>waive his right to counsel and for questioning on a new offense to proceed if the accused had asserted his right to counsel at any earlier point in his dealings with the authorities.\u201d <em>Roberts, supra, </em>p 74. While this result has the superficial appeal of a bright-line rule, it fails to take into account distinctions the Court itself has but recently articulated, as well as the Court\u2019s long-established view that society has a legitimate interest in obtaining a defendant\u2019s statement and in investigating criminal activities. <em>Moulton, supra, </em>p 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The United States Supreme Court has not yet interpreted the Sixth Amendment of the federal constitution as requiring that after an arraignment police-initiated interrogation on unrelated charges is prohibited, or that a voluntary statement obtained during a custodial interrogation on unrelated charges after appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warnings must be suppressed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> While the Court\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence makes prediction perilous, lacking further guidance from the Court, we would reject the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Edwards </em>rule has been so broadened that it places a blanket exclusion on all postindictment interrogation about unrelated, as yet uncharged offenses.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Under the facts of the case before this Court, we agree with the conclusion reached by the trial court that this defendant\u2019s request for appointed counsel was made as a routine arraignment matter.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Properly initiated interrogation on entirely new charges does not intrude into an accused\u2019s previously invoked right at an arraignment on unrelated charges, and we see no constitutional objective that would be served by such an extension of <em>Edwards </em>or the suppression of the defendant\u2019s statement in this case.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The trial court correctly found that there was a voluntary waiver of the defendant\u2019s rights, and that the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to counsel on unrelated matters did not vitiate his waiver of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s subsequent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights with regard to the unrelated crime should not be deemed invalid merely because it came in response to police-initiated questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In sum, we find that the defendant\u2019s request for counsel at his arraignment invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel which is limited to the specific crimes for which the state has initiated adversarial proceedings. Further, the defendant\u2019s request did not invoke his right to counsel under <em>Miranda </em>prior to the police-initiated interrogation concerning the bank robbery. Thus, the defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights at the interrogation was valid and his statement was admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the trial court that the defendant\u2019s confession was admissible at trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b815-8\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-9\"> See <em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682, 688-689; 92 S Ct 1877; 32 L Ed 2d 411 (1972).

As Justice White has explained, \"the accused having expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the authorities\u2019 insistence to make a statement without counsel\u2019s presence may properly be viewed with skepticism.\u201d <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96, 110, n 2; 96 S Ct 321; 46 L Ed 2d 313 (1975) (concurring in result).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In <em>Roberson, </em>the Court held that the <em>Edwards </em>rule applied even when the crime investigated in the subsequent police-initiated interrogation was unrelated to the crime investigated at the interrogation in which the suspect requested counsel.

During interrogation, each defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and then incriminated himself. Both defendants argued that their postarraignment statements were obtained in violation of their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel because each had previously asked the arraigning magistrate for appointed counsel. <em>Id., </em>p 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We held in <em>Bladel </em>that the defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment right to counsel was not \"implicated.\u201d We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">Although defendants were in custody at the time of their arraignments, they were not subjected to interrogation. In addition, they did not specifically request counsel for any subsequent custodial interrogations which might be conducted. Defendants requested appointed counsel because they were financially incapable of retaining an attorney and were unwilling to represent themselves. See <em>State v Sparklin, </em>296 Or 85, [90-91]; 672 P2d 1182, 1185-1186 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The trial courts found that defendants never invoked their Fifth Amendment right to counsel before or during their post-arraignment interrogations. Furthermore, defendants knowingly and voluntarily waived their <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to their statements. Our independent review of the record does not disclose that these findings are clearly erroneous. <em>[Bladel, supra, </em>pp <em>52-53.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Regarding the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment claims, however, we held in <em>Bladel </em>that each defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was inadequate to ensure a valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Reviewing our decision, the United States Supreme Court agreed with our Sixth Amendment analysis. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>pp 629-636. The Court, however, expressly declined to \"comment on the validity of\u201d our Fifth Amendment analysis that found that \" 'defendants\u2019 request to the arraigning magistrate for appointment of counsel implicated only their Sixth Amendment right to counsel, . . . because the request was not made during custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Jackson, supra, </em>p 630, n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">This case requires us to reevaluate the analysis in <em>Bladel </em>on which the United States Supreme Court refused comment. We do not feel bound today by the two-paragraph Fifth Amendment analysis in <em>Bladel. </em>The Fifth Amendment analysis was not determinative of the disposition of either case considered in <em>Bladel. </em>We resolved defendants\u2019 right to counsel challenges under the Sixth Amendment because the statements each defendant sought to suppress concerned the same charge on which each defendant was arraigned. More importantly, <em>BladeFs </em>Fifth Amendment analysis is inconsistent with other portions of that opinion expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in <em>Jackson, </em>and with other reasoning in the <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Roberson </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">A suspect\u2019s request for an attorney during custodial interrogation demonstrates that the suspect wants a lawyer to help him deal with police questions. The request triggers the waiver protections of <em>Edwards. </em>A suspect\u2019s expression of the same desire in contexts other than custodial interrogation, at arraignment for instance, deserves the same respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Plaintiff argues that a defendant requesting counsel at arraignment does not express a need for help with questioning, but instead seeks legal assistance only \"to help him with the adversary proceedings on the charged offense.\u201d Plaintiff asks this Court to conclude first, that at the time defendant requested counsel at arraignment, he wanted counsel only to help him with the charges on which he was arraigned and second, that defendant wanted assistance only with \"adversary proceedings\u201d and not with custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Although reading the mind of any defendant is admittedly a difficult task, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions offer some guidance. In <em>Roberson, supra, </em>p 684, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">Roberson\u2019s unwillingness to answer any questions without the advice of counsel, without limiting his request for counsel, indicated that he did not feel sufficiently comfortable with the pressures of custodial interrogation to answer questions without an attorney. This discomfort is precisely the state of mind that <em>Edwards </em>presumes to persist unless the suspect himself initiates further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>conversation about the investigation; unless he otherwise states, see <em>Connecticut v Barrett </em>[479 US 523; 107 S Ct 828; 93 L Ed 2d 920 (1987)], there is no reason to assume that a suspect\u2019s state of mind is in any way investigation-specific, see <em>Colorado v Spring </em>[479 US 564; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Roberson </em>undermines plaintiff\u2019s argument that we must find that when defendant requested counsel at his arraignment on the assault and breaking and entering charges he desired legal assistance on those charges alone. Indeed, when defendant requested counsel at his arraignment on the assault and breaking and entering charges, he had already been questioned about the robbery. As in <em>Roberson, </em>\"there is no reason\u201d in this case \"to assume that [defendant\u2019s] state of mind [was] in any way investigation-specific.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 684.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson </em>undermines plaintiff\u2019s other contention \u2014 that defendant\u2019s arraignment request did not evince a desire for legal assistance at subsequent custodial interrogations. In <em>Jackson, supra, </em>pp 632-633, the Court specifically rejected the almost identical claim that a defendant who requests counsel at arraignment does not intend his request to encompass representation during later interrogation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">The State also relies on the factual differences between a request for counsel during custodial interrogation and a request for counsel at an arraignment. The State maintains that respondents may not have actually intended their re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>quest for counsel to encompass representation during any further questioning by the police. This argument, however, must be considered against the backdrop of our standard for assessing waivers of constitutional rights. Almost a half century ago, in <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458 [58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461] (1938), a case involving an alleged waiver of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the Court explained that we should \"indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. For that reason, it is the State that has the burden of establishing a valid waiver. <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US [387, 404; 97 S Ct 1232; 51 L Ed 2d 424 (1977)]. Doubts must be resolved in favor of protecting the constitutional claim. This settled approach to questions of waiver requires us to give a broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation to a defendant\u2019s request for counsel \u2014 we presume that the defendant requests the lawyer\u2019s services at every critical stage of the prosecution. We thus reject the State\u2019s suggestion that respondents\u2019 requests for the appointment of counsel should be construed to apply only to representation in formal legal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The Court expressly agreed with our \"comments\u201d in <em>Bladel </em>concerning \"the nature of an accused\u2019s request for counsel\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">\"Although judges and lawyers may understand and appreciate the subtle distinctions between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, the average person does not. When an accused requests an attorney, either before a police officer or a magistrate, he does not know which constitutional right he is invoking; <em>he therefore should not be expected to articulate exactly why or for what purposes he is seeking counsel. It makes little sense to afford relief from further interrogation to a defendant who asks a police officer for an attorney, but permit further interrogation to a defendant who makes an identical request to a judge. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>The simple fact that defendant has requested an attorney indicates that he does not believe that he is sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly.\u201d [Jackson, supra, </em>pp 633-634, n 7 (quoting <em>Bladel, supra, </em>pp 63-64). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In light of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Roberson, </em>we conclude that when defendant requested counsel at his arraignment, he felt that he was not \"sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly.\u201d His request expressed a desire for a lawyer\u2019s help, not just with formal legal proceedings, but with all subsequent adversarial confrontations, including custodial interrogation. His request was as effective an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel as a request to a police officer during interrogation would have been.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Plaintiff argues its position is supported by language in <em>Maine v Moulton, </em>474 US 159, 179-180; 106 S Ct 477; 88 L Ed 2d 481 (1985). <em>Moulton </em>does not control the decision in this case. First, <em>Moulton </em>was a Sixth Amendment case and did not consider directly the Fifth Amendment issue presented here. See <em>Roberson, supra, </em>pp 684-685 (rejecting <em>Moulton </em>as authority in the Fifth Amendment context). Second, the Court in <em>Moulton </em>was discussing suppression of statements \"simply because <em>other charges were pending at the time,\" id., </em>p 180. It did not address suppression due to a prior, and, at the time of the interrogation, still unful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>filled,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>request </em>for counsel made at arraignment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the Court\u2019s analysis in the later cases of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Roberson </em>has replaced the <em>Moulton </em>dicta on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Plaintiff also argues that application of the <em>Edwards </em>rule to this situation \"severely hampers ongoing investigations by police officers as to unrelated charges.\u201d \"[T]he police will simply be unable to approach one who is in custody on a charged offense and who has requested or has counsel at arraignment.\u201d Policy arguments predicting crippling effects on effective law enforcement have invariably been advanced in cases following <em>Miranda, </em>and have generally been rejected. Most recently, in <em>Roberson, supra, </em>pp 688-689, the Court was unswayed by the dissenters\u2019 contention that the Court\u2019s ruling</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">will in many instances deprive our nationwide law enforcement network of a legitimate investigative technique now routinely used to resolve major crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">It is a frequent occurrence that the suspect is wanted for questioning with respect to crimes unrelated to the one for which he has been appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>hended. The rule announced today will bar law enforcement officials, even those from some other city or other jurisdiction, from questioning a suspect about an unrelated matter if he is in custody and has requested counsel to assist in answering questions put to him about the crime for which he was arrested. [Kennedy, J., dissenting.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Like the Court in <em>Roberson, supra, </em>pp 681-682, we find that a bright-line rule would have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">\"the virtue of informing police and prosecutors with specificity as to what they may do in conducting custodial interrogation, and of informing courts under what circumstances statements obtained during such interrogation are not admissible. This gain in specificity, which benefits the accused and the State alike, has been thought to outweigh the burdens that the decision in <em>Miranda </em>imposes on law enforcement agencies and the courts by requiring the suppression of trustworthy and highly probative evidence even though the confession might be voluntary under traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.\u201d [Quoting <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 718.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contentions, suspects remain free to give statements to the police after requesting counsel at an arraignment. \"[A]ny 'further communications, exchanges, or conversations with the police\u2019 that the suspect himself initiates, . . . are perfectly valid.\u201d <em>Roberson, supra, </em>p 687.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>dant\u2019s statements should have been suppressed<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b827-5\">Levin and Archer, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> Defendant does not continue to argue in this Court that he invoked his right to silence during the first interrogation, or that his statements were the product of police trickery. Therefore, we do not reach whether or not the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning these separate Fifth Amendment claims were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">It is also unnecessary to review the trial court\u2019s decision that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred. We agree with the trial court that no Sixth Amendment right to counsel had yet attached on the robbery charge at the time of either interrogation. See <em>People v Bladel (After Remand), </em>421 Mich 39, 51-52, (Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches \"only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the accused\u201d). However, we observe that New York has adopted the rule that once a defendant requests the assistance of counsel on one charge, defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel on that charge can only be adequately protected by suppressing all uncounseled statements taken at subsequent police-initiated custodial interrogation on <em>any </em>crime. See <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167; 422 NYS2d 18; 397 NE2d 709 (1979); <em>People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225; 440 NYS2d 894; 423 NE2d 371 (1981); <em>People v Robles, </em>72 NY2d 689; 536 NYS2d 401; 533 NE2d 240 (1988); note, <em>Prior representation and the duty to inquire: Breaching New York\u2019s \u201dOnce-an-Attorney\u201d rule, </em>10 Cardozo LR 259 (1988). Defendant argued in the trial court that Michigan should follow this New York rule. There can be little doubt that in the real world of multiple charging, habitualization of offenses, and plea bargaining, \"unrelated\u201d offenses significantly affect the ultimate disposition of the custodial charge. However, because the grant order is limited, this Sixth Amendment theory was not briefed or argued in this Court, and we express no opinion about the New York rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\"> Compare <em>United States v Roberts, </em>869 F2d 70, 74 (CA 2, 1989), with <em>United States ex rel Espinoza v Fairman, </em>813 F2d 117 (CA 7, 1987), cert den 483 US 1010 (1987), and <em>United States v Wolf, </em>879 F2d 1320 (CA 6, 1989) (Fifth Amendment right invoked at arraignment on separate charge).
