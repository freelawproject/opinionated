Upon dissolution of a marriage, \u00a7 17a grants the court jurisdiction to require either parent to make payments for the support of each child until the age of eighteen years, and in the case of \"exceptional circumstances,\u201d support payments may be required after a child \"attains that age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">We find that the amendments of the child support and custody statutes enacted subsequent to the passage of the Age of Majority Act, which employ the restrictive term \"minor child,\u201d evidence a legislative intent to authorize support payments for the benefit of <em>minor </em>children only. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Further, the history of appellate court interpretation of \u00a7 17a supports the conclusion that the duration of child support payments is limited by the age of majority statute. Therefore, we conclude that the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a is a legal nullity and that support payments may not be awarded beyond the age of majority, eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Accordingly, we find that the Court of Appeals erred in authorizing postmajority child support payments upon a finding of \"exceptional circumstances.\u201d Thus, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">I. PACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The Washtenaw Circuit Court granted Mary Carien Smith and Michael Clarke Smith a judgment of divorce on August 30, 1973. The parties had one child, Aimee, who suffers physical and mental deficiencies as a result of birth defects. These deficiencies have been diagnosed to be permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">In August of 1984, plaintiff filed a motion to increase child support and to extend support beyond Aimee\u2019s eighteenth birthday. The trial court denied the motion, holding that it lacked authority to award postmajority support. However, the Court of Appeals authorized the trial court to award postmajority support and remanded the case to determine whether Aimee\u2019s condition constituted an \"exceptional circumstance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant sought leave to appeal, which we granted on June 22, 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>II. ANALYSES</p>\n<p id=\"A-z\">A. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The child support statute upon which the issue centers is MCL 552.17a; MSA 25.97(1). The pertinent part of \u00a7 17a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The court shall have jurisdiction in making such order or judgment relative to the minor children of such parties as authorized in this chapter to award custody of each child to 1 of the parties or a third person until each child has attained the age of 18 years and may require either parent to pay such allowance as may be deemed proper for the support of each child until each child shall have attained that age and may in case of exceptional circumstances, require payment of such allowance for any child after he attains that age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the event of exceptional circumstances, Michigan courts have consistently authorized support payments beyond the prescribed statutory age, but limited such support to the age of majority, which was then twenty-one years. <em>Titus v Titus, </em>311 Mich 434, 437; 18 NW2d 883 (1945); <em>Johnson v Johnson, </em>346 Mich 418, 426; 78 NW2d 216 (1956).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the subsequent amendment of the Age of Majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Act, which reduced the age of majority to eighteen years, put in question the legal validity of the exceptional-circumstances provision of \u00a7 17a.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We begin our analyses by looking at the first sentence of \u00a7 17a which provides: \"The court shall have jurisdiction in making such order or judgment relative to the <em>minor children </em>of such parties as authorized in this chapter . . . MCL 552.17a; MSA 25.97(1) (emphasis added). Following this sentence, \u00a7 17a uses the word \"child\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> five additional times. <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1985) defines the term \"child\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">2a: a young person esp. between infancy and youth; b: a childlike or childish person; c: a person not yet of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Given this commonly accepted definition of \"child\u201d and the use of the words \"minor children\u201d in the first sentence of \u00a7 17a, we are persuaded that the Legislature intended the word \"child\u201d in \u00a7 17a to apply exclusively to minor children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Moreover, it is important to note that at the time the Legislature enacted \u00a7 17a, the age of majority in Michigan was twenty-one. Thus, absent exceptional circumstances, \u00a7 17a statutorily limited support payments up to the time of a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, three years before the age of majority. It was this Court in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>that interpreted the exceptional-circumstances clause to allow support payments beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, but not beyond the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">After MCL 722.52; MSA 25.244(52) reduced the age of majority to eighteen years, in our judgment, amendments of the child support and custody laws evidence the intention of the Legislature to leave intact the <em>Johnson </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">MCL 552.15; MSA 25.95 governs the care, custody, and support of <em>minor </em>children <em>during </em>the pendency of an action to dissolve a marriage. Specifically, \u00a7 1 of the current version of this statute, 1985 PA 214,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> uses the term \"minor children\u201d three times; whereas, the preamendment version of \u00a7 1 referred only once to \"minor children,\u201d and once to \"children.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Similarly, MCL 552.16; MSA 25.96 governs the care, custody, and support of <em>minor </em>children <em>after </em>a divorce judgment. Again, the pertinent segment of the statute, \u00a7 16(1), refers only to \"minor children.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">There can be no dispute that \u00a7\u00a7 15 through 17a of Michigan\u2019s divorce laws, MCL 552.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.81 <em>et seq., </em>address the issue of child custody and support pursuant to a divorce action. Statutes in pari materia should be construed together. <em>Webster v Rotary Electric Steel Co, </em>321 Mich 526, 531; 33 NW2d 69 (1948). Thus, \u00a7 17a, by its initial reference to \"minor children,\u201d coupled with \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 16 which refer exclusively to \"minor children,\u201d evidence the intent of the Legislature to align the child support laws with the rationale that payments are to be limited by the age of majority, currently eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Consistent with the legislative intent of \u00a7\u00a7 15 through 17a is the 1980 amendment of the Child Custody Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 1980 PA 161, \u00a7 1 amended \u00a7 7(1) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the Child Custody Act <em>by deleting the \"exceptional circumstances\u201d clause. </em>Now, pursuant to \u00a7 7(1), a circuit court has authority to award support payments only until a child becomes eighteen years of age. Reference to \"exceptional circumstances\u201d has been completely omitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Finally, 1972 PA 16 amended 1968 PA 293<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for the specific purpose of reconciling the statute with the Age of Majority Act. 1972 PA 16, \u00a7 1 amended the definition of the term \"minor\u201d to \"a person under the age of <em>18 </em>years,\u201d from \"a person under the age of <em>21 </em>years.\u201d MCL 722.1(a); MSA 25.244(l)(a). The saving clause of this amendment, 1972 PA 16, \u00a7 2, preserves all rights and duties of a person incurred prior to January 1, 1972, \"[a]s if [1971 PA 79] had not been passed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 1972 PA 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>also amended \u00a7 4(l)(b) of the emancipation statute which now provides: \"(1) An emancipation occurs by operation of law: (b) When a person reaches the age of 18 years.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In fact, throughout the entire emancipation statute, <em>reference is only made to </em>\"a minor.\u201d See MCL 722.4; MSA 25.244(4).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The amendments of the Child Custody Act and the emancipation statute exemplify how the Legislature has acted to conform the laws governing the protection and support of children with the Age of Majority Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Quoting from Kaimowitz, <em>Legal emancipation of minors in Michigan, </em>19 Wayne L R 23, 24 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">If a legislative body wishes, for whatever purpose, it can wave a magic wand and emancipate him [a minor] to suit its convenience. Though 21 usually is the dividing line between minority and majority, the age of majority in Michigan is now 18. The state seemingly can be as arbitrary as it pleases in raising or lowering the barrier for all or just some purposes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">While the Legislature has the ability to \"waive a magic wand,\u201d this Court is bound to interpret \u00a7 17a in accordance with the intent of the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ture. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and art 4, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The power to statutorily limit the duration of child support payments is within the exclusive discretion of the Legislature. Though nearly a century old, the holding of <em>Detroit v Wayne Co Circuit Judge, </em>79 Mich 384, 387; 44 NW 622 (1890), is applicable. (\"It is one of the necessary and fundamental rules of law that the judicial power cannot interfere with the legitimate discretion of any other department of government.\u201d) See also <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>93 Mich App 114, 121; 286 NW2d 62 (1979) (\"The judiciary will not interfere with the discretionary actions of the legislative bodies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The Legislature has taken affirmative action to amend the child support laws, the Child Custody Act, and the Emancipation of Minors Act. All of the amendments evidence a legislative intent to retain the longstanding rule that support payments are to be limited by the age of majority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is the intent of the Legislature, supported by its affirmative actions, which we find persuasive.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The contention by the dissent that we are \"relying on legislative silence,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 652, is wholly un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>founded and in disregard of the actions of the Legislature. When a legislature enacts or amends a statute, it must be presumed to have knowledge of existing statutes and laws. <em>People v Rosecrants, </em>88 Mich App 667, 670; 278 NW2d 713 (1979). Therefore, we conclude that the exceptional-circumstances clause of MCL 552.17a; MSA 25.97(1) is legally void.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We acknowledge that this conclusion is contrary to MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b), originally adopted by this Court in 1972 as GCR 1963, 729.2(1).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, this Court has said that court rules may take precedence over statutory language only in matters involving judicial rules of practice and proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>dure. See <em>Perin v Peuler, </em>373 Mich 531; 130 NW2d 4 (1964). The child support provision of \u00a7 17a is a matter of <em>substantive </em>law and, as such, supersedes MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Furthermore, because the court\u2019s jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding is defined by statute, the court rule cannot expand jurisdiction to authorize child support beyond a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. <em>Felcoski v Felcoski, </em>159 Mich App 762; 407 NW2d 11 (1987). Therefore, we hold that MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b) does not provide a court authority to award postmajority child support. Moreover, insofar as this court rule may interfere with any legislative act governing substantive law, the court rule is without legal effect.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">While the dissent does not contradict the rule that substantive statutory language supplants a contradictory court rule, it does make the claim that MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b) \"is a further indication that the appellate courts of this state have not clearly resolved this issue, and that, therefore, the Legislature cannot be held to have acquiesced in what the appellate courts of this state have not finally resolved.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Ironically, Justice Cavanagh participated in a Court of Appeals decision which addressed this precise issue, involving the same statute and the same court rule. In <em>McNames v McNames, </em>93 Mich App 477, 480; 286 NW2d 892 (1979), the Court cited verbatim <em>Price v Price, </em>51 Mich App 656, 660-661; 215 NW2d 756 (1974), which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\"The problem arises when we attempt to insert the court rule in place of the statutory language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The Supreme Court itself has indicated that court rules may take precedence over statutory language only in matters involving judicial rules of practice and procedure. <em>Perm v Peuler, </em>373 Mich 531; 130 NW2d 4 (1964). This being a matter of the substantive law, the legislative enactment must control. <em>The trial court\u2019s reliance on GCR 1963, 729.2(1) to justify an award of support to a child who has reached the age of majority contravenes the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent in the statute enabling a circuit court to award any support at all, </em>as interpreted by decisions of the Supreme Court. Until such time as the Legislature sees fit to settle the inconsistency between the support statute and the Age of Majority Act, we are bound to follow its mandate.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">The correctness of this reasoning was not assailed by our Supreme Court when it reversed the result in <em>Price v Price, </em>395 Mich 6; 232 NW2d 630 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Thus, the conclusion of the dissent is not only in conflict with the prior position of its author, it contravenes the history of Michigan jurisprudence. Notwithstanding the present matter before us and its progeny, no final Michigan appellate decision has sustained an award of postmajority child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">B. JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">This Court has consistently held that support payments may be required only until a child attains the age of majority. This principle was recognized over 120 years ago in <em>Chaffee v Chaffee, </em>15 Mich 184, 190 (1867), when Justice Christiancy wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">The daughter is above the age of majority, and however desirable it might be that she should be provided for with the mother, I can discover no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>recognized principle upon which it can be done by a decree in this proceeding.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The \"exceptional circumstances\u201d clause was addressed when continued support was sought beyond the statutory age limit of seventeen years to allow a child to achieve a high school diploma. In interpreting 1940 CL 12739-1,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the precursor of today\u2019s \u00a7 17a, this Court held that extended support for educational purposes did constitute an exceptional circumstance. However, it extended the support payments for only eighteen months beyond the child\u2019s seventeenth birthday, well before he reached the age of majority, twenty-one years. <em>Barry v Barry, </em>291 Mich 666; 289 NW 397 (1939). Similarly, the Court held that educational pursuit constituted an exceptional circumstance in <em>Titus, supra. </em>Again, the support was specifically limited by the age of majority: \"[T]he allowance must thereupon cease, and shall cease in any case upon [the child\u2019s] arrival at majority . . . .\u201d In <em>Rybinski v Rybinski, </em>333 Mich 592; 53 NW2d 386 (1952), the Court once more held that support could not be ordered after the child had reached her majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\"><em>Barry, Titus, </em>and <em>Rybinski </em>all provided the framework for the <em>Johnson </em>decision, which prohibited required support beyond a child\u2019s majority age even though exceptional circumstances existed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">After the Age of Majority Act became effective, this Court and the Court of Appeals continued to follow the same line of reasoning, which effectively negated the legal authority of the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a._</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>This issue was addressed in <em>Price v Price, </em>51 Mich App 656; 215 NW2d 756 (1974), rev\u2019d on other grounds 395 Mich 6; 232 NW2d 630 (1975), when the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">The clear intent of the Legislature, as expressed in this enactment and as authoritatively interpreted by decisions of the Michigan Supreme Court, indicates that there is no right to receive support payments after the age of majority is reached. The statute explicitly provides that the above jurisdiction is \"relative to the <em>minor </em>children\u201d of the parties. (Emphasis supplied.) The succeeding clauses allowing support for children attaining the age of 18 must be read, then, in the context of <em>minor </em>children. When the statute was enacted, it was possible for a minor child to be over the age of 18, since the age of majority was 21. [51 Mich App 658.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Additionally, the <em>Price </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">Since the Legislature has made an 18-year-old an adult for all purposes whatsoever, <em>notwithstanding any law to the contrary, </em>support cannot properly be awarded to a child who has reached the age of 18. [51 Mich App 660. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In reviewing the <em>Price </em>decision, the Court chose not to invalidate the lower court\u2019s reasoning, but rather to reverse on the basis of the saving clause of the Age of Majority Act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Price, </em>the rights of the child accrued prior to the effective date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>MCL 722.52; MSA 25.244(52). Therefore, the eighteen-year age of majority was not applicable, and the twenty-one-year age of majority did apply. Accordingly, this Court granted support payments until the child attained the applicable majority age, twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Though the courts have never dissented from the rule that the age of majority limits the duration of child-support payments, this saving clause has been used, when applicable, to provide for support up to a child\u2019s twenty-first birthday. See <em>Charlton v Charlton, </em>397 Mich 84; 243 NW2d 261 (1976); <em>Milbrand v Milbrand, </em>66 Mich App 730; 239 NW2d 730 (1976); <em>Barbier v Barbier, </em>45 Mich App 402; 206 NW2d 464 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Price </em>decisions provided the foundation for a series of cases which, absent an express agreement to the contrary, negate the obligation of a parent to provide child support payments beyond the age of majority, eighteen years. See <em>Arndt v Kasem, </em>135 Mich App 252; 353 NW2d 497 (1984), <em>Boyd v Boyd, </em>116 Mich App 774; 323 NW2d 553 (1982), <em>Sumerix v Sumerix, </em>106 Mich App 7; 307 NW2d 727 (1981), <em>McNames v McNames, supra, </em>and <em>Allen v Allen, </em>63 Mich App 475; 235 NW2d 22 (1975).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The only indication that appears contrary to this significant body of case law is in footnote 5 of <em>Price.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, this footnote has no value as a legal precedent and was identified as merely \"dicta\u201d by the Court of Appeals. <em>Parrish v Parrish, </em>138 Mich App 546, 551; 361 NW2d 366 (1984) (parents have no obligation to support their adult children).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">While this footnote does provide that \"[t]he Age of Majority Act does not purport to deprive persons between the ages of 18 and 21 of any rights theretofore enjoyed by them . . . ,\u201d the saving clause of the Age of Majority Act<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> specifically provides that rights \"incurred before the effective date of this act may be continued or instituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>under and in accordance with the law in force at the time of the . . . right accruing, accrued or acquired . . . MCL 722.54; MSA 25.244(54). Although the Age of Majority Act did not purport to deprive anyone of existing rights, these rights were nonetheless restricted by law existing prior to January 1, 1972. The law prior to January 1, 1972, authorized support payments only until a child attained the age of majority. <em>Johnson, supra. </em>Therefore, the inference of the footnote is frustrated by the same legal authority from which it appears to have been borne.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Again, we note that since the release of the <em>Price </em>decision by this Court fourteen years ago, the rationale behind this footnote, and the inference implicit therein, has never been persuasive in any proceeding before a Michigan appellate court save in the matter before us today and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The dissent asserts that our decision is based \"[primarily in reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Post, </em>pp 643-644. The dissent goes on to claim that we have employed a \"dubious analysis of legislative intent . . . that is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>contrary to express statutory language . . . .\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 658. Finally, it argues that we are attempting to \"reduce [our] responsibility for this result by stating that the result reflects the will of the Legislature and that to hold otherwise would be a usurpation of legislative power.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Not so. What we have done by our decision today is recognize that the overriding responsibility of this Court is to act within the limits of its authority as expressed in the constitution of this state.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The authority to determine the duration of child support payments is vested in the Legislature, not this Court. See Kaimowitz, <em>ante, </em>p 617. The dissent fails to acknowledge, or even to address, the fact that the amendments of \u00a7\u00a7 15-17a of the child support laws enacted by the Legislature after the reduction of the age of majority have resulted in an increased use of the limiting word \"minor.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>pp 611-619.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Furthermore, the dissent, in mischaracterizing our opinion as being based \"primarily in reliance\u201d on <em>Johnson, </em>totally disregards Michigan\u2019s history of judicial interpretation regarding the duration of child support payments. Our decision is based on the express actions of the Legislature and on an analysis of how legislative action has been interpreted by our appellate courts. While persuasive, <em>Johnson </em>is but one instance in a forty-five-year survey of Michigan case law. See <em>ante, </em>pp 621-626.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">C. OTHER JURISDICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">A review of other jurisdictions reveals that states which provide for postmajority support can be broken down into two categories: (1) those which have enacted specific statutory language, and (2) those in which courts have interpreted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>support statute to include adult children when the statute merely refers to \"child,\u201d as opposed to the term \"minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In the first category, the child support statute of each state provides express jurisdiction. Examples of states with express jurisdiction include Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Oregon, and Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The Illinois Marriage &amp; Dissolution Act provides \"relevant factors\u201d for a court to consider when determining a reasonable amount of support that \"either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child of the marriage\u201d must pay.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> One of the factors, \u00a7 505(2)(d) is \"the physical and emotional condition of the child . . . .\u201d The Illinois statute does not limit the duration of child support by use of the term \"minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Similarly, the Indiana dissolution of marriage laws include the \"physical or mental condition of the child and his educational needs\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> as relevant factors to consider in awarding child support.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indiana takes one step further to add the provision that the \"duty to support a child under this chapter ceases when the child reaches his twenty-first (21st) birthday unless ... (2) the child is incapacitated in which case the child support continues during the incapacity or until further order of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Iowa has provided for postmajority child support in its statutory definition of the word \"support.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Here, support includes obligations \"for a child who is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two years who is regularly attending an accredited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>school . . . leading to high school diploma or its equivalent . . . vocational-technical training ... a full-time student in a college, university, or area school. . <em>or a child of any age who is dependent on the parties to the dissolution proceedings because of physical or mental disability\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Prior to lowering its age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen years in 1971, Washington recognized only a duty to provide support for minor children.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, Washington revised its Divorce Act in 1973. The Dissolution of Marriage Act of 1973 was amended to provide, \"the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of support to any child of the marriage dependent upon either or both spouses to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for his support.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In <em>Childers v Childers, </em>89 Wash 2d 592, 597; 575 P2d 201 (1978), the Washington Supreme Court held, \"[w]e construe the dissolution act as basing any support obligation on dependency, not minority, and ending the obligation at emancipation, not majority.\u201d One of the factors the court found persuasive was the fact that the Washington Legislature <em>removed all reference to the term \"minor\u201d </em>when it revised the dissolution act in 1973. <em>Child</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>ers </em>at 596. Washington courts continue to cite <em>Childers </em>as authority for the award of postminority child support. See <em>In re Marriage of Nielsen, </em>52 Wash App 56; 757 P2d 537 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In the second category, state courts have relied on the lack of restrictive language in the child support statutes for their decisions. The fact that the word \"minor\u201d did not appear before the word \"child\u201d in the statute was interpreted as to allow a court jurisdiction to award postmajority child support. Examples of these states include New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">However, in the State of New Hampshire, after its supreme court held that the statute did not preclude postmajority child support,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> its legislature amended the statute to expressly limit support until a child reaches the age of eighteen. Yet, the legislature added a provision to award postmajority support for handicapped children: \"If the order involves a handicapped child, the court shall specify the duration of the order, which may be beyond the time when the child reaches the age of 18.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Our legislative analysis and case-law review make it evident that the factors which have led to the award of postmajority child support in other jurisdictions do not exist in the present Michigan statute. A thorough analysis of the cases cited by the dissent serves only to buttress this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The dissent cites <em>Ex parte Brewington, </em>445 So 2d 294 (Ala, 1983), wherein the Alabama Supreme Court held that the Alabama child support laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>should not be interpreted as limiting support only to \"minor\u201d children. The primary reason for the decision was the fact that the Alabama child support laws did not use the word \"minor\u201d before the word \"children.\u201d Therefore, the application of the <em>Brewington </em>court reasoning to the Michigan child support laws, which employ the word \"minor,\u201d leads to a result consistent with our opinion. Thus, Alabama falls under the category of states whose courts have relied on the lack of restrictive language in their child support statutes. See <em>ante, </em>p 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The dissent quotes <em>Koltay v Koltay, </em>667 P2d 1374 (Colo, 1983), in which the Colorado Supreme Court interpreted that state\u2019s child support law. The Colorado law, based on the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act, provides for child support which is to terminate upon a child\u2019s \"emancipation.\u201d The court held that a physically or mentally disabled child who is incapable of self-support is not emancipated. However, the <em>Koltay </em>court employed a review of the history of Colorado\u2019s dissolution of marriage legislation that is similar to the legislative analysis we have employed. See <em>ante, </em>pp 611-619. The Colorado Supreme Court found persuasive the fact that in 1958 the Colorado Legislature amended its dissolution of marriage legislation to remove the word \"minor,\u201d and again enacted new legislation in 1971 when it replaced the Colorado divorce statute with the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The current Colorado statute, interpreted by the <em>Koltay </em>court, authorized support for a \" 'child of the marriage\u2019 after considering several factors, including the . . . physical and emotional condition [of the child].\u201d <em>Koltay </em>at 1377. Therefore, Colorado falls under the category of jurisdictions that provide specific statutory language which au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>thorizes postmajority child support. See <em>ante, </em>pp 628-630.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Finally, the dissent cites cases from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and from the Supreme Court of Ohio.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, both of these cases are based on the <em>absence </em>of any statutory provision contrary to postmajority child support.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As amply demonstrated by this opinion, Michigan\u2019s statutory provisions are expressly contrary to the award of postmajority child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Section 17a <em>does </em>contain the limiting language of \"minor child.\u201d Moreover, amendments of \u00a7\u00a7 15-16 of the child support statute that occurred <em>after </em>the change of the majority act have only increased the use of this restrictive language. As one commentator has noted, \"where statutes limit support orders to minors, only a legislative change can remove the obstruction.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As inequitable as it may appear, Michigan remains in the majority of states that do not provide postmajority child support.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We have considered the legislative amendments of the child support statutes and the voluminous case law regarding the issue of postmajority child support. In weighing these factors against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>Price </em>footnote, we conclude that current Michigan law does not provide for postmajority child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">In <em>Price, </em>this Court reiterated the words of the Court of Appeals <em>Price </em>decision: \"[The Court of Appeals] sent a veiled message to the Legislature to 'settle the inconsistency between the support statute [\u00a7 17a] and the Age of Majority Act.\u2019 \u201d 395 Mich 9. The Legislature has declined the invitation this Court extended fourteen years ago in <em>Price. </em>We urge the Legislature to reconsider the child support laws in order to align them with the laws of those states that have expressly provided for postmajority child support. For, as desirable as it may be, we are restricted by the constitution of our state from reforming the moral obligation of a divorced parent of an adult child into that of a legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The inescapable conclusion to be drawn is that the Legislature has acquiesced in the judicial construction given \u00a7 17a pursuant to the passage of the Age of Majority Act. Therefore, we hold that the Age of Majority Act renders nugatory the exceptional-circumstances provision of \u00a7 17a. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-6\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> MCL 722.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.244(51) <em>et seq., </em>effective January 1, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> 163 Mich App 423; 414 NW2d 906 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AhT\"> 430 Mich 890 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> The <em>Titus </em>Court interpreted 1939 PA 255, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">The court shall have jurisdiction in making such order or decree relative to the minor children of such parties as authorized in this chapter to award custody thereof to one of the parties or a third person until such children attain the age of 17 years and may require the husband to pay such allowance as may be deemed proper for their support until they respectively attain that age and may in its discretion in case of exceptional circumstances requiring the same, require payment of such allowance for any such child after he attains that age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">1939 PA 255 was then amended by 1954 PA 2 (interpreted by the <em>Johnson </em>Court).

However, \u00a7 1 of the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\"><em>Any married parent </em>who has a minor child or children living with him or her and who is living separate and away from his or her spouse who is the noncustodial parent of the child or children, and who is refused financial assistance by the noncustodial parent to provide necessary shelter, food, care, and clothing for the child or children, if the spouse is of sufficient financial ability to provide such assistance, may complain to the circuit court for the county where either parent resides for an order for support for himself or herself and the minor child or children.

After observing that this Court\u2019s <em>Price </em>decision was based on the saving provision of the Age of Majority Act, the dissent again cites footnote 5 for the proposition that \"[although the Court in <em>Price </em>did not directly resolve the issue presented here, it stated that the two provisions [Age of Majority Act and \u00a7 17a] should be read so as to avoid rendering nugatory the exceptional-circumstances provision.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 649. However, it is interesting to note that had the Court chosen to read the exceptional-circumstances clause as providing for postmajority support, it could have provided the child with support for the full <em>four </em>year college curriculum. Yet instead, it resolved the matter pursuant to the saving provision, thereby limiting college support to <em>three </em>years (at the relevant majority age of twenty-one years, the child would have only completed three years of college).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> See ns 17,18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\"> Ill Ann Stat, ch 40, \u00b6 505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\"> A 1983 amendment of the Oregon child support statute employs similar language.

I agree with Chief Justice Riley that the Age of Majority Act, MCL 722.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.244(51) <em>et seq., </em>\"renders nugatory\u201d the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a of the divorce statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governing the support of the minor children of divorced parents.

I write separately, however, to iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>tify the legal foundation upon which I believe we must base this clearly exceptional conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The defendant in this case argues that the reduction in the age of majority from age twenty-one to age eighteen by the Age of Majority Act has called into question the effect of the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a. That clause, by its terms, authorizes the circuit courts to grant support for a child even after the child has attained the age of eighteen; however, the clause has been consistently read by this Court not to allow such support after the child has reached the age of majority. Since the age of majority has been lowered to eighteen, the defendant argues, the exceptional-circumstances clause can no longer be given any practical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Although the defendant has not specifically identified it as such, his fundamental legal argument, in my view, and as stated by both Justice Cavanagh and the Court of Appeals, is essentially that the Age of Majority Act repeals the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a by necessary implication. Try as I might, I am unable to disagree with the defendant. I reach this conclusion despite my understanding that, as Justice Cavanagh observes, the repeal of statutes by implication is strongly disfavored:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\"Repeal by implication is not permitted if it can be avoided by any reasonable construction of the statutes. <em>Couvelis v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>281 Mich 223 [274 NW 771 (1937)]; <em>People v Hanrahan, </em>75 Mich 611 (4 LRA 751) [42 NW 1124 (1889)]. If by any reasonable construction 2 statutes can be reconciled and a purpose found to be served by each, both must stand, <em>Garfield Twp v A B Klise Lumber Co, </em>219 Mich 31 [188 NW 459 (1922)]; <em>Edwards v Auditor General, </em>161 Mich 639 [126 NW 853 (1910)]; <em>People v Harrison, </em>194 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>363 [160 NW 623 (1916)]. The duty of the courts is to reconcile statutes if possible and to enforce them, <em>Bd of Control of the Michigan State Prison v Auditor General, </em>197 Mich 377 [163 NW 921 (1917)]. The courts will regard all statutes on the same general subject as part of 1 system and later statutes should be construed as supplementary to those preceding them, <em>Wayne Co v Auditor General, </em>250 Mich 227 [229 NW 911 (1930)].

As interpreted by this Court in <em>Johnson v Johnson, </em>346 Mich 418; 78 NW2d 216 (1956), the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a allows a circuit court to award support for a child <em>after </em>he attains the age of eighteen, but only until he reaches the age of majority. The Age of Majority Act states that the age of majority is eighteen. The conflict between these two acts is thus clear and unavoidable. Given the reduction in the age of majority to eighteen, there can be no time during which support can be awarded after a child attains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the age of eighteen, but before he reaches majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">It is, of course, very tempting to follow the course taken by Justice Cavanagh in his dissent, of simply overturning the decision in <em>Johnson, </em>along with the earlier decisions upon which it relied,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and finding that under the literal language of the clause support can be awarded after the child reaches the age of eighteen and for as long as the exceptional circumstances exist. Were it not for the actions of the Legislature itself following these decisions, Justice Cavanagh\u2019s position might be persuasive. However, while I believe that Justice Cavanagh\u2019s admonition against relying too heavily on legislative silence when construing statutory provisions applies with some force here, <em>post, </em>pp 652-653,1 find myself unable to accept his solution in light of the subsequent reenactment of \u00a7 17a in 1970, only shortly before the Age of Majority Act, but long after the limited construction had, without fail, been given to the exceptional-circumstances clause by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The Legislature is presumed to know of existing interpretations of legislation. <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675, 691; 377 NW2d 804 (1985); <em>Smith v Detroit, </em>388 Mich 637, 650; 202 NW2d 300 (1972); <em>Jeruzal v Wayne Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>350 Mich 527, 534; 87 NW2d 122 (1957). Thus, it is a well-established rule of statutory construction that when the Legislature, with this presumed knowledge of prior judicial interpretation, reenacts a statute or provision in substantially the same form as that interpreted, it is deemed to have adopted the interpretation into the language of the statute or provision. As stated in <em>Jeruzal, supra, </em>p 534:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In passing this legislation, the legislature is presumed to have known of the [prior] judicial interpretation of this Court [of the language of the statute], . . . and, also, to have known that <em>when a statute, clause or provision thereof, has been construed by the court of last resort of this State and the same is substantially re-enacted the legislature adopts such construction, unless the contrary is clearly shown by the language of the act. </em>See <em>People v Powell, </em>280 Mich 699 (111 ALR 721) [274 NW 372 (1937)].

Since the Legislature failed to make any substantive change in the language of the clause,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we must conclude that it intended to adopt the construction of the clause found in those cases. This is true even though we are unable to conclude that the Legislature actually reconsidered that language in light of our judicial interpretations when it amended and reenacted the provision, leaving the exceptional-circumstances clause substantially intact as interpreted. The purpose of the presumption, obviously, is to recognize precisely that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Were we construing the exceptional-circumstances clause for the first time today, I think a persuasive case could clearly be made for the interpretation given it by Justice Cavanagh. The language of the statute, after all, does appear to be open-ended. However, the consistent, limited construction of the exceptional-circumstances clause over the years by this Court, including that in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>along with the Legislature\u2019s reenactment of \u00a7 17a without any truly substantive changes in the language of the clause despite that limited construction, in my view requires us to conclude that the open-ended interpretation sought by Justice Cavanagh is simply no longer available to this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"Apz8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">I am well aware that today\u2019s decision by the majority to declare that these two provisions are in irreconcilable conflict, and that the earlier exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a must therefore be seen as repealed by necessary implication by the later Age of Majority Act, is, as Justice Cavanagh states, an \"extraordinary step.\u201d I am not convinced, however, that this result is any more extraordinary than that which Justice Cavanagh himself proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">It is not our function in this case to determine what the \"best\u201d rule regarding the payment of child support by a noncustodial divorced parent is or properly should be. Such a decision, as both the Chief Justice and Justice Archer point out, is the province of our state Legislature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor should we in this case merely take our best guess as to what the Legislature intended to do when it enacted the Age of Majority Act, or as to what it might do in response to this decision. If that were true, the analysis would have to focus heavily, as that of the Chief Justice in some respects does, upon the action of the Legislature in amending in 1980 the Child Custody Act, MCL 722.21 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.312(1) <em>et seq., </em>specifically, \u00a7 7(1) of that act, to <em>delete </em>the exceptional-circumstances clause providing support for children between the age of eighteen and the age of majority, once the conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>between it and the Age of Majority Act was noticed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Rather, we are left in this case, in the absence of any specific indication of legislative intent with respect to the effect of the Age of Majority Act upon \u00a7 17a, with the task of determining that intent in light of established principles of statutory construction and interpretation. In this case, those principles require us to conclude that since we cannot reasonably reconcile these two provisions, the earlier exceptional-circumstances clause must be the one to fall.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"> MCL 522.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.81 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> See, e.g., <em>Rybinski v Rybinski, </em>333 Mich 592; 53 NW2d 386 (1952); <em>Titus v Titus, </em>311 Mich 434; 18 NW2d 883 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> As stated in 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 49.09, p 400:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">Where reenactment of a statute includes a contemporaneous and practical interpretation, the practical interpretation is accorded greater weight than it ordinarily receives, as it is regarded as presumptively the correct interpretation of the law.

The branch empowered, in this particular case, to give a moral obligation the full force and effect of law is distinct from that responsible for adjudicating whether a legal duty has been breached. In the present case, as the majority intimates, the power to render into a legal duty a parent\u2019s moral obligation to support a disabled adult child rests exclusively with the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">I join with the majority and again urge the Legislature to reconsider the child support statute in light of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b759-5\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiN\">(dissenting). The majority of the Court has taken an extraordinary step and has declared the \"exceptional circumstances\u201d clause of MCL 552.17a; MSA 25.97(1) null and void. In spite of the clear language of the statute, which authorizes circuit courts to order the payment of postmajority child support when exceptional circumstances are present, the majority has held that circuit courts do not have the jurisdiction to award extended parental support for the disabled adult children of divorced parents. The result of this decision is that the financial responsibility of providing for the care of these disabled children will fall solely on the state and on custodial parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">I cannot agree that the decision of the majority is compelled by either an analysis of the legislative history of the child support and custody statutes or by prior decisions of this Court. Not only does the decision violate principles of statutory construction and judicial restraint, it also cannot be justified in view of the public policy considerations that support giving meaning to the clear language of the statute. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and would hold that exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>circumstances are present when a child\u2019s mental or physical disabilities make it impossible for the child to be self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">When the Washtenaw Circuit Court granted a judgment of divorce to Michael and Mary Carien Smith on August 30, 1973, the judgment provided that defendant Michael Smith was to pay for the support and maintenance of the couple\u2019s minor daughter, Aimee, \"until the minor child shall attain the age of eighteen years, or until further order of the court . . . .\u201d It was later discovered that Aimee was born with genetic abnormalities. Aimee suffers from acute mental and physical handicaps, and there is, unfortunately, little hope that her condition will improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Plaintiff Mary Carien Smith filed a motion for an increase in support in August of 1984 and then amended the motion to include a request that child support be continued beyond Aimee\u2019s eighteenth birthday. When plaintiff filed the amended motion in October of 1984, Aimee was fifteen years old. The defendant, who became a practicing dentist after the divorce, agreed to the increase in child support, and on November 26, 1985, the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s request for increased support.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">After reviewing the pertinent statutes and appellate court decisions, however, the trial court also ruled that it was bound to follow certain decisions in which the Court of Appeals ruled that the Age of Majority Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prevents any court from extending support payments beyond a child\u2019s eighteenth year unless the original divorce judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>contains a reservation or agreement for extended payments. The trial judge noted that this Court had not yet ruled on this important issue, and he added his personal view that \"[t]he facts established in the present case are very heartrending and equities for support of the minor child of the parties are very compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to extend defendant\u2019s child support obligations beyond Aimee\u2019s eighteenth birthday and remanded the case so that the circuit court could consider whether exceptional circumstances exist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted leave<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to consider whether a court in a divorce proceeding has the authority to order a parent to pay child support for a disabled adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">This Court held in <em>Johnson v Johnson, </em>346 Mich 418; 78 NW2d 216 (1956), that an award of support was properly granted under the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a in order to enable a child to attend college. The Court also ruled, however, that because the age of majority was twenty-one years, courts had no authority to award extended parental support for education expenses under the exceptional-circumstances clause once a child reached the age of twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The question for this Court to resolve, then, is whether the Legislature, in reducing the age of majority to eighteen years, intended to implicitly repeal the exceptional-circumstances clause of the child support statute and preclude circuit courts from ordering extended support for the disabled adult children of divorced parents. Primarily in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson, </em>the majority of the Court has concluded that the exceptional-circumstances clause is a legal nullity and that support payments may not be awarded beyond the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">I disagree. In order to preserve the validity of the <em>Johnson </em>decision, the majority has reached a result that requires a radical departure from established rules of statutory construction, a result that is not supported by the current language of the statute, the applicable court rule promulgated by this Court, or considerations of public policy. Furthermore, although a review of the case law of other jurisdictions reveals that courts have employed a variety of rationales in order to provide for support for disabled adult children, the present majority has held null and void a statutory provision that clearly provides for such support and has shifted the burden to the Legislature to amend the statute to add more precise language.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The resolution of this case turns on an interpretation of \u00a7 17a of the Michigan divorce statute, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">The court shall have jurisdiction in making such order or judgment relative to the minor children of such parties as authorized in this chapter to award custody of each child to 1 of the parties or a third person until each child has attained the age of 18 years and may require either parent to pay such allowance as may be deemed proper for the support of each child until each child shall have attained that age and may in case of exceptional circumstances, require payment of such allowance for any child after he attains that age.

When the language of a statutory provision is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary or appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hiltz v Phil\u2019s Quality Market, </em>417 Mich 335, 343; 337 NW2d 237 (1983). \"Every word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplus-age or rendered nugatory if at all possible.\u201d <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639, 665; 297 NW2d 387 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Section 17a of the support statute outlines the extent of a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction regarding its authority to award child support and plainly authorizes the court to require payment of child support \"in case of exceptional circumstances\u201d for <em>any </em>child after the child reaches the age of eighteen years. In spite of the clear language of the provision, the majority of the Court has concluded that the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \"minor children\u201d in the first sentence of \u00a7 17a and the use of the word \"child\u201d five more times in the provision is an indication that the Legislature intended the word \"child\u201d to apply exclusively to minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The frequent use of the word \"child\u201d in a statute governing the authority of courts to award child support is not surprising and certainly should not be considered determinative of the significant issue presently before the Court. The exceptional-circumstances clause is an exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the general rule that child support is for the benefit of minor children. The clause provides for an extension of the court\u2019s authority to order child support when certain exceptional facts are present and pertains to \"any child\u201d of the parties after the child attains the age of eighteen. In view of this clear language, I am unpersuaded by the majority\u2019s conclusion that each and every time the word \"child\u201d is used, it is a reference only to minor children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">As the Court of Appeals stated, \"[u]nless we attribute to the Legislature an intent to impliedly repeal the exceptional circumstances clause, we must assume that this provision, read in conjunction with the Age of Majority Act, contemplates the extension of support beyond the age of majority.\u201d 163 Mich App 427._</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The Age of Majority Act provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a person who is 18 years of age but less than 21 years of age when this act takes effect, and a person who attains 18 years of age thereafter, is deemed to be an adult of legal age for all purposes whatsoever and shall have the same duties, liabilities, responsibilities, rights and legal capacity as persons heretofore acquired at 21 years of age. [MCL 722.52; MSA 25.244(52).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">I find nothing in this provision to indicate that the Legislature intended to explicitly repeal the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a. Section 3 of the act, MCL 722.53; MSA 25.244(53), lists a number of provisions which the act supersedes. Although \u00a7 3 specifically states that the list is not all-inclusive, it is significant that none of the affected statutes listed concerns child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">When construing a statute, courts \"must read the language of the statute in light of the general purpose to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Wymer v Holmes, </em>429 Mich 66, 76; 412 NW2d 213 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is simply no indication that the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the Age of Majority Act, which deals with duties, liabilities, responsibilities, and rights of individuals between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, was to limit the extent of a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to award child support to a custodial parent. As this Court stated in <em>Price v Price, </em>395 Mich 6, 11, n 5; 232 NW2d 630 (1975), the \"Age of Majority Act does not purport to deprive persons between the ages of 18 and 21 of any rights theretofore enjoyed by them . . . .\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>act certainly does not purport to divest circuit courts of jurisdiction to order the payment of child support to custodial parents when exceptional circumstances are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">There is also no indication that the Legislature intended to implicitly repeal the exceptional-circumstances clause. Repeals by implication are not favored. One commentator has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">Repeal by implication is . . . disfavored and will be applied only where there is no rational basis for harmonizing two conflicting statutes and where the statutes are so inconsistent that concurrent operation is not possible. Implied repeal will only be effected if the statute or part of it is repugnant. Normally the courts will consider and attempt to harmonize all statutes on the same subject or with the same general purpose. Further, all sections of the support statute will be read together as a whole, and courts will avoid a construction that renders part of a statute meaningless.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In <em>Attorney General ex rel Owen v Joyce, </em>233 Mich 619, 621; 207 NW 863 (1926), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">When the intention of the legislature can be ascertained, it is the duty of the courts to give it force and effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">But,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">\"The presumption is always against the intention to repeal where express terms are not used, and the implication, in order to be operative, must be necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">\"Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be indulged in if there is any other reasonable construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">\"The intent to repeal must very clearly appear, and courts will not hold to a repeal if they can find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>reasonable ground to hold the contrary.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">There is certainly another reasonable construction of \u00a7 17a beyond that offered by the majority, and we should be reluctant to conclude that the Legislature repealed the exceptional-circumstances clause by implication. Although it would repudiate the rationale of the decision in <em>Johnson, </em>we should interpret the statute so as to give effect to the exceptional-circumstances provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We were reluctant to conclude in <em>Price v Price </em>that the exceptional-circumstances clause had been repealed by implication. The Court of Appeals in <em>Price </em>reasoned that even if the Legislature had not intended to dictate that all support beyond age eighteen must cease regardless of exceptional circumstances, that was \"the exact effect of the support statute when read in conjunction with the Age of Majority Act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead of ruling directly on the issue whether the Age of Majority Act had any effect on a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to award postmajority support, this Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals due to the saving clause of the act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the petition was pending when the act took effect, we concluded that it fell within the saving provision. Thus, the circuit court had the authority to require the defendant to pay support for his son\u2019s college education \"until that son became 21 years old.\u201d 395 Mich 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Although the Court in <em>Price </em>did not directly resolve the issue presented here, it stated that the two provisions should be read so as to avoid rendering nugatory the exceptional-circumstances provision._</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>While our disposition in this case rests upon the applicability of the saving provision, we are also inclined to the view that even after the effective date of the Age of Majority Act a court may enter an order or amend an order to provide for the college education of a person for whom a support order had been entered before he or she was 18. The Age of Majority Act does not purport to deprive persons between the ages of 18 and 21 of any rights theretofore enjoyed by them, but instead grants to persons of 18 the rights and legal capacities formerly withheld until they were 21. . . . Further, to interpret the two statutes otherwise would render nugatory the entire provision concerning \"exceptional circumstances\u201d in the support statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">Special needs such as whether the individual may be handicapped mentally or physically or in need of other special training, or whether he or she is particularly gifted, are also relevant. <em>[Id., </em>p 11, n 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Upon the basis of the Legislature\u2019s actions subsequent to <em>Price, </em>we would not conclude that \"the Legislature has acquiesced in the judicial construction given \u00a7 17a pursuant to the passage of the Age of Majority Act.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 633. Until the issuance of the opinion in this case, which is the first time this Court has considered \u00a7 17a\u2019s exceptional-circumstances clause as it applies to a disabled child over whom jurisdiction was obtained prior to the age of eighteen, this Court has not exhibited any intention to declare that the Legislature intended to implicitly overrule the clause when it adopted the Age of Majority Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">In fact, the opposite is true, as the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the majority directly contradicts MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b), which states that a support order must \"provide for payment for a child until the child reaches the age of majority or graduates from high school, whichever is later, or, in exceptional circumstances, until further order of the court.\u201d The lead opinion reasons that because court rules cannot take precedence over statutory language except in matters involving judicial rules of practice and procedure, the court rule is also without legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">It is simply not necessary to consider whether court rules may expand a court\u2019s jurisdiction or take precedence over statutory language,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> since the language of \u00a7 17a, if given effect by this Court, is not in conflict with the court rule. The conflict perceived by the majority only arises when this Court declares that a portion of the statute is null and void. The existence of the court rule, however, is a further indication that the appellate courts of this state have not clearly resolved this issue, and that, therefore, the Legislature cannot be held to have acquiesced in what the appellate courts of this state have not finally resolved._</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>This conclusion is supported by recent decisions of the Court of Appeals, including its decision in this case, which indicate that the Court has not been entirely consistent regarding its treatment of this issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In view of the split of authority in the Court of Appeals, the language of MCR 3.209(B)(1)(b), and the fact that this Court has never addressed the precise issue presented here, there is no settled judicial construction of \u00a7 17a in which the Legislature could have acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Moreover, the recent authority of the Court of Appeals illustrates the danger in relying on legislative silence when construing statutory provisions which appear to be inconsistent, especially when the inconsistency arises due to prior judicial interpretations of the provisions rather than from the plain language of the statutes themselves. As Justice Rutledge explained in his concurring opinion in <em>Cleveland v United States, </em>329 US 14, 23-24; 67 S Ct 13; 91 L Ed 12 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">The danger of imputing to Congress, as a result of its failure to take positive or affirmative action through normal legislative processes, ideas entertained by the Court concerning Congress\u2019 will, is illustrated most dramatically perhaps by the vacil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>lating and contradictory courses pursued in the long line of decisions imputing to \"the silence of Congress\u201d varied effects in commerce clause cases. That danger may be and often is equally present in others. More often than not, the only safe assumption to make from Congress\u2019 inaction is simply that Congress does not intend to act at all. Cf. <em>United States v American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, </em>310 US 534, 550 [60 S Ct 1059; 84 L Ed 1345 (1940)]. At best the contrary view can be only an inference, altogether lacking in the normal evidences of legislative intent and often subject to varying views of that intent. In short, although recognizing that by silence Congress at times may be taken to acquiesce and thus approve, we should be very sure that, under all the circumstances of a given situation, it has done so before we so rule and thus at once relieve ourselves from and shift to it the burden of correcting what we have done wrongly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Due to the clear language of \u00a7 17a, which grants circuit courts the jurisdiction to order postmajority child support when exceptional circumstances are present, and out of deference to established principles of statutory construction, I am unwilling to attribute to the Legislature an implied intent to repeal the exceptional-circumstances clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The decision of the majority not only runs counter to principles of statutory construction by the bold declaration that the exceptional-circumstances clause is a legal nullity, this decision also will create conflicts and inconsistencies in the child support and custody laws. It is significant that the Family Support Act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which applies when a marriage is still legally intact but one spouse is not supporting the children of the marriage, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>provides for the authority of the court to order the payment of postmajority child support. Section 2 of the act states that \"[i]n unusual circumstances, the court may order support for the child after the child reaches 18 years of age and until he or she reaches 21 years of age, or until the further order of the court.\u201d MCL 552.452(1); MSA 25.222(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Consequently, due to today\u2019s holding by the majority, circuit courts have the authority, when \"unusual circumstances\u201d are present, to order a parent who has abandoned a disabled child to pay postmajority child support, but are without authority to compel divorced parents to support their disabled adult children. This is an incongruous result which I do not believe the Legislature intended.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The age of majority was reduced from twenty-one to eighteen years of age, effective January 1, 1972. In spite of the fact that \u00a7 2 of the Family Support Act has been amended since the Age of Majority Act took effect,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Legislature has not deleted the clause providing for the extension of child support in \"unusual circumstances.\u201d This is an indication of the Legislature\u2019s intention to retain, not to repeal, provisions authorizing the courts to require the payment of postmajority support in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">It is undoubtedly extremely difficult if not impossible for those who are severely mentally or physically disabled to support themselves. Paren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tal support can be required for disabled adult children under Michigan\u2019s poor law,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MCL 401.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.121 <em>et seq., </em>which defines a \"poor person\u201d as one \"who does not have property, exempt or otherwise, and who is unable, because of physical or mental disability or age, to earn a livelihood . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 5<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provides for the priority of liability of the relatives of the poor person. The obligation to support falls first on the person\u2019s spouse, if that person has a spouse and the spouse has the financial ability, and then on the person\u2019s parents. Thus, the poor law contains a distinct category for those who, without regard to age, are unable to provide for their own support. This provision is analogous to the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a and the unusual-circumstances clause of the Family Support Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">It may be burdensome to make the parents of a disabled child financially responsible for the child\u2019s support, especially since the responsibility might extend for the duration of the child\u2019s life. As one commentator has observed, however, \"the child must be supported by someone, and the parent, who \u2014 however blamelessly \u2014 brought the child into the world, would appear to bear a greater responsibility for his maintenance than does anyone else, including the state or deficit-ridden federal government.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As Chief Justice Cooley commented in <em>Stilson v Gibbs, </em>53 Mich 280, 282; 18 NW 815 (1884), \"there is always a contingent liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the support of children who are over age, in case they become a public charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">As the majority states, no final Michigan appellate decision has sustained an award of postmajority child support. The majority fails to acknowledge, however, that this Court has never directly considered or resolved the question whether mental or physical disabilities may constitute exceptional circumstances under \u00a7 17a.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, it is significant that the majority\u2019s review of the treatment of this issue by other jurisdictions attempts to merely categorize those cases in which postmajority support has been found permissible, but points to no case in which the final appellate court of any jurisdiction has stricken an exceptional-circumstances clause and denied support to adult handicapped children._</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The majority divides the jurisdictions in which postmajority support is extended into two categories, those in which the applicable statute contains a specific authorization for extended support for handicapped children and those in which the statute does not limit support to minor children. The majority states that the Michigan statute does not fit within either category, a position it claims to be shared by a majority of jurisdictions. The majority suggests that this Court is restrained by the Michigan Constitution from reaching a contrary result, and concludes by urging the Legislature to reconsider the child support laws to expressly provide for postmajority child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">First, even though the Michigan statute does not expressly provide for postmajority support for disabled or handicapped children, it does contain an express provision for extended support in the exceptional-circumstances clause. Second, that clause is not limited by age and confers jurisdiction upon circuit courts to order extended support for <em>any </em>child after the child attains the age of majority. Although a more precise statutory provision would be desirable, \u00a7 17a as presently drafted clearly provides for extended support beyond a child\u2019s majority when exceptional circumstances are present. The statute does not define what circumstances may be considered exceptional, but it is certainly within the authority of this Court to determine whether mental or physical disabilities that render a child incapable of self-support may be considered exceptional circumstances and give rise to an extended duty of parental support.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In short, the statute already provides the authority for extended support that the majority of the Court now urges the Legislature to restore. The fact remains that the majority has employed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>dubious analysis of legislative intent to reach a harsh result that is clearly contrary to express statutory language and considerations of public policy. It then attempts to reduce its responsibility for this result by stating that the result reflects the will of the Legislature and that to hold otherwise would be a usurpation of legislative power. I find this analysis wholly unpersuasive. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s attempt to persuade to the contrary, it is not the language of the statute or the intent of the Legislature that leads to this harsh result, but this Court\u2019s refusal to consider the validity of the decision in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Furthermore, I take issue with the majority\u2019s statement that Michigan remains in the majority of states that do not provide postmajority child support for disabled children absent an express statutory provision or a statute that does not refer to \"minor children.\u201d The Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Ex parte Brewington, </em>445 So 2d 294 (Ala, 1983), rejected prior decisions in that jurisdiction which held that absent a statute or agreement, no common-law authority existed to impose upon a noncustodial parent the obligation to support an adult child. The court stated that \"the majority trend is to recognize an exception to this rule when the adult child is so mentally and/or physically disabled as to be unable to support himself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The <em>Brewington </em>court repudiated a prior decision which held that the term \"children\u201d as used in the Alabama child support statute was meant to apply only to <em>minor </em>children. The court explained that the statute did not express such a limitation, and it found such a narrow interpretation unacceptable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>[W]e believe the legislature intended that support be provided for <em>dependent </em>children, regardless of whether that dependency results from minority, or from physical and/or mental disabilities that continue to render them incapable of self-support beyond minority. [Id]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The exceptional-circumstances clause in the Michigan statute also does not refer to <em>minor </em>children, but expressly provides for support for <em>any </em>child beyond the age of eighteen upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. As did the court in <em>Brewington, </em>I find unacceptable the present majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u00a7 17a.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals also recently held that the common law imposes a duty on the part of a parent to support a child after the child reaches majority if the child is physically or mentally disabled. <em>Nelson v Nelson, </em>548 A2d 109 (DC App, 1988). In reaching that decision, the court commented that \"it is clear that the great majority of jurisdictions have accepted the existence of a continuing duty on the part of parents to support disabled children beyond the age of majority, if not by virtue of statute enacted by the legislature, then by rule of law adopted by the courts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 114. The court referred to a trend among courts \"to recognize the parental duty of support for the adult disabled child as a <em>natural extension </em>of the common-law obligation of support for minor children.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 116.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The Supreme Court of Colorado has employed the concept of delayed emancipation. In <em>Koltay v Koltay, </em>667 P2d 1374, 1376 (Colo, 1983), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>explained that the attainment of the age of twenty-one only creates a presumption of emancipation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">If, by reason of some serious physical or mental disability, the child is incapable of self-support, the child is not \u201cemancipated.\u201d A different interpretation would be wholly inconsistent with the independence that the word \"emancipation\u201d connotes. If a child is physically or mentally incapable of self-support when he attains the age of majority, emancipation does not occur, and the duty of parental support continues for the duration of the child\u2019s disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from a review of the case law of other jurisdictions is that when the question has been presented, the vast majority of jurisdictions have concluded that noncustodial parents may be ordered to support their disabled children beyond their minority. Although the result has been reached in a variety of ways, either through statutory interpretation or by an extension of the common law, courts have almost uniformly held that postmajority support for physically or mentally handicapped children is both permissible and desirable. The majority does not point to a single case, and my research reveals no case, in which a final appellate court has stricken a clause that provides for such support. The fact remains that the majority of this Court has reached its conclusion in spite of language in the Michigan statute that permits postmajority support, the weight of authority from other jurisdictions that suggests the desirability of that result, and public policy considerations which compel a determination that extended support for disabled children is permissible in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Unlike the lead opinion suggests, this is not a case in which there is \"voluminous\u201d case law supporting the decision of the majority and merely a footnote that infers to the contrary. There is, after all, the plain language of the statute and a court rule promulgated by this Court. In addition, established principles of statutory construction and considerations of public policy, considerations which have led a majority of jurisdictions to hold to the contrary, weigh against the decision of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I would hold that because the Legislature reduced the age of majority to eighteen years but retained the exceptional-circumstances clause in the support statute, it had no intention to implicitly repeal the provision for extended parental support. It is the rationale of the decision in <em>Johnson, </em>not the statutory provision itself, which is no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">If the support statute is given effect as it is written, as long as a court obtains jurisdiction over a child when the child is a minor, the court has the authority to award postmajority support upon a showing of exceptional circumstances until those circumstances no longer exist. I would also hold that mental or physical disabilities may constitute exceptional circumstances under \u00a7 17a and would remand this case to the circuit court<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to determine whether exceptional circumstances are present.</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Brickley, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\"> MCL 722.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.244(51) <em>et seq., </em>effective January 1, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\"> 163 Mich App 423; 414 NW2d 906 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\"> 430 Mich 890 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> Clear and unambiguous support statutes are not considered subject to modification by construction and, as is frequently stated, plain meaning is given to the terms used in these statutes.

It is equally plausible to explain the <em>Johnson </em>decision by looking to the language of \u00a7 17a in effect when <em>Johnson </em>was decided, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\"The court shall have jurisdiction in making such order or decree relative to the minor children of such parties as authorized in this chapter to award custody of each such child to 1 of the parties or a third person until each such child has attained the age of 18 years and may require the husband to pay such allowance as may be deemed proper for the support of each such child until each such child shall have attained that age and may in its discretion in case of exceptional circumstances requiring the same, require payment of such allowance for any such child after he attains that age.\u201d <em>[Johnson, supra, </em>pp 423-424.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">At the time of the <em>Johnson </em>decision, then, the exceptional-circumstances clause of the statute authorized extended support \"for any such child,\u201d specifically referring back to \"the minor children\u201d of the parties. The statute was amended by 1970 PA 182, so that the provision for extended support now refers to \"any child\u201d of the parties and is not limited to minor children. Thus, the majority\u2019s analysis of the language of the statute is not supported by a plain reading of the provision or a review of its history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> In <em>Paaso v Paaso, </em>170 Mich App 628, 635; 428 NW2d 724 (1988), the Court of Appeals commented that \"[t]he self-evident purpose of the child support statute is to ensure financial stability for the children of divorced parents through their formative years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b766-14\"> 3A Sands, n 4 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 68.08, p 412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\"><em> Price v Price, </em>51 Mich App 656, 659; 215 NW2d 756 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\"> MCL 722.54; MSA 25.244(54).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b769-5\"> The Court of Appeals in <em>Paaso </em>v <em>Paaso, </em>n 6 <em>supra, </em>pp 637-638, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">We believe the court rule is consistent with the intent and purpose of the jurisdictional statute, which is to provide for the support of one\u2019s child through the formative years. . . .

In <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Titus, </em>this Court concluded that the 1939 Legislature, in enacting in \u00a7 17a that child support might be contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ued in exceptional circumstances until arrival at majority, intended that support might in such a case be continued until the age, twenty-one, then the age of majority. By construction, there was thus read into \u00a7 17a the concept, expressed in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Titus, </em>that child support could be awarded in exceptional circumstances beyond eighteen until, but not beyond, twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">It is contended that, in reducing the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen, the 1971 Legislature repealed by implication the authority conferred in \u00a7 17a to award child support in exceptional circumstances until twenty-one. Clearly, child support is not a \"duty], liability], responsibility],\u201d or \"legal capacity\u201d of the child within the meaning of the Age of Majority Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While child support might be a \"right\u201d of the child, the Age of Majority Act provides generally that rights theretofore acquired at twenty-one henceforth would be acquired at eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The language employed does not appear to reduce the rights of a person who is eighteen but who has not yet reached twenty-one. The Age of Majority Act does not appear to concern, or have as its purpose reducing, rights acquired at or before birth, but rather accelerating the age of acquisition of rights theretofore not acquired until twenty-one. Nor has our attention been directed to anything in the history of the enactment of the Age of Majority Act that justifies the majority\u2019s conclusion that the 1971 Legislature intended that the exceptional-circumstances clause of \u00a7 17a \u2014 not concerning a right theretofore acquired at twenty-one nor enumerated in the list of acts \"superseded\u201d \u2014 be repealed by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">There are two other straws in the wind.
