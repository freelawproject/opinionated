We note, however, that in the context of this question as certified, we understand the term \"resident\u201d to refer not only to those insureds who actually live within this state and who must therefore purchase no-fault automobile insurance policies written in this state which provide the compulsory security requirements of MCL 500.3101(1); MSA 24.13101(1) for the owners or registrants of motor vehicles required to be registered in this state, but also to certain insureds who do not live within this state but who are nonetheless required to register, and thus insure, their vehicles in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The cca is an organization comprising all insurance companies who write insurance in this state. It was created by the Legislature in 1978 in response to concerns that Michigan\u2019s no-fault law provision for unlimited personal injury protection benefits placed too great a burden on insurers, particularly small insurers, in the event of \"catastrophic\u201d injury claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Its primary purpose is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>indemnify member insurers for losses sustained as a result of the payment of personal protection insurance benefits beyond the \"catastrophic\u201d level, which has been set at $250,000 for a single claimant. MCL 500.3104; MSA 24.13104 governs its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">In practice, the cca acts as a kind of \"reinsurer\u201d for its member insurers. Initially, \u00a7 3104(1) requires membership in the cca as a condition of authority to write insurance in this state for all insurers \"engaged in writing insurance coverages which provide the security required by section 3101(1) within this state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Membership in the cca entitles the insurer to indemnification for certain losses under \u00a7 3104(2), which provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The association shall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of $250,000.00 in each loss occurrence. As used in this section, \"ultimate loss\u201d means the actual loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>amounts which a member is obligated to pay and which are paid or payable by the member, and shall not include claim expenses. An ultimate loss is incurred by the association on the date which the loss occurs.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Like any insurer, the cca charges each of its members a premium for the coverage it provides, which is based on the number of car years of insurance the member writes in Michigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In this case, plaintiff Preferred Risk paid Michigan no-fault benefits in excess of $250,000 to an Illinois resident whom it had insured under a policy written in that state, but who was injured in an automobile accident in Michigan. Plaintiff\u2019s insured was a passenger in a car owned and insured by a Michigan resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s liability for such benefits is not contested here. The parties agree that \u00a7 3163(1) of the no-fault act required plaintiff, as an insurer authorized to write insurance in this state, to provide Michigan no-fault benefits to its insured in the event that he traveled to Michigan and was injured in an automobile accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>also agree that \u00a7 3114(1) of the no-fault act, which requires that the insured first seek personal protection benefits from his own insurer, established plaintiff as the primary insurer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">There is also no question that at the time of this claim plaintiff was a member insurer of the cca. A member need not write all of its automobile liability insurance in this state, although some do, and while it also wrote insurance coverages in other states, plaintiff was clearly \"engaged in writing insurance coverages which provide the security required by section 3101(1) within this state.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvgT\">Plaintiff eventually paid over $340,000 in personal injury protection benefits to the claimant in this case. It applied to the cca for indemnification for the amount over $250,000, reasoning that while it had provided insurance coverage to an Illinois resident, for an Illinois-registered vehicle, it had paid Michigan no-fault benefits, which should be reimbursable under \u00a7 3104(2). The cca denied plaintiff\u2019s application, however, claiming that under its plan of operation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>was limited to losses paid out \"under policies of insurance issued to residents of the State of Michigan . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Following the denial of its claim by the cca, plaintiff instituted the present action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division). Both parties moved for summary judgment. Plaintiff claimed that since it was a member insurer who had paid benefits under the Michigan no-fault system in excess of $250,000, the cca was obligated under \u00a7 3104(2) to provide it with \"indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss\u201d it had sustained over that amount, regardless of the nonresident status of its insured, and it was required to accept such indemnification. The \"resident only\u201d requirement imposed by the cca in its plan of operation, plaintiff argued, conflicted with the language and purpose of \u00a7 3104, and was beyond the cca\u2019s authority to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The cca argued in response that its plan of operation, including its limitation of indemnification to coverages written for residents of this state, was a valid interpretation of \u00a7 3104. Specifically, the cca claimed that the Legislature had left it up to the association to determine, through its plan of operation, which particular policies were subject to indemnification under \u00a7 3104, and that its limitation of indemnification to policies written for residents was in any event consistent with \u00a7 3104(7)(d), which allows it to charge premiums only on the basis of insurance coverages written in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Preferred Risk. The association appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which, after oral argument, granted its motion to certify the question to this Court. The question as certified asks whether the cca must indemnify its member insurers for losses suffered over $250,000 under policies issued to insureds who are not \"residents\u201d of this state but who were injured here.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We believe that the cca has properly interpreted the indemnification requirement of \u00a7 3104(2). For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that \u00a7 3104(2) requires indemnification only when the member insurer has paid benefits in excess of $250,000 under a policy which was written in this state to provide the security required by \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act for the \"owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state . . . .\u201d The cca, whose policy of restricting indemnification to \"residents of this state\u201d is the subject of this dispute, has acknowledged that for purposes of indemnification under \u00a7 3104(2) it considers all owners or registrants of motor vehicles required to be registered here to be \"residents] of the State for purposes of the Act,\u201d regardless of whether they actually live within this state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>this acknowledgment in mind, we must conclude, in answering the question as certified, that the cca is required to indemnify member insurers only for losses paid to \"residents\u201d of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We wish, however, to emphasize that the analysis which follows in support of this conclusion is based solely upon our interpretation of the Catastrophic Claims Act itself. In particular, we emphasize that our analysis does not rest upon any finding by this Court that the association\u2019s plan of operation constitutes a \"reasonable interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 3104 in light of the Legislature\u2019s deference to its expertise in this area. In our opinion, the Legislature did not leave it up to the cca to decide who will receive indemnification. As plaintiff aptly argues, the requirement in \u00a7 3104(2) that the cca \"shall provide\u201d indemnification for losses in excess of $250,000 can hardly be called deferential. Thus, while we agree with the cca\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3104(2)\u2019s indemnification requirement, we do so on the basis of the language of the statute itself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\">The question before the Court essentially asks on which coverages will the cca be liable for indemnification in the event of a catastrophic loss. The answer to that question lies, of course, within \u00a7 3104(2), which again provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">The association shall provide and each member shall accept indemnification for 100% of the amount of ultimate loss sustained under personal protection insurance coverages in excess of $250,000.00 in each loss occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Plaintiff contends that the phrase \"personal protection insurance coverages\u201d in \u00a7 3104(2) refers generally to any coverages under which it may be required to pay Michigan no-fault benefits, regardless of where or for whom written. According to plaintiff, once it had established that it was a member of the association and that it had sustained a loss under a \"personal protection insurance coverage\u201d in excess of $250,000, the language of \u00a7 3104(2) \"clearly and unambiguously\u201d obligated the cca to reimburse it for that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">It is axiomatic, as plaintiff states, that this Court must enforce \"clear and unambiguous\u201d statutory provisions as written. <em>Owendale-Gagetown School Dist v Bd of Ed, </em>413 Mich 1, 8; 317 NW2d 529 (1982); <em>Dussia v Monroe Co Employees Retirement System, </em>386 Mich 244; 191 NW2d 307 (1971). This rule of statutory construction must be applied, however, with the understanding that \"[w]hat is 'plain and unambiguous\u2019 often depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\u201d <em>Shiffer v Gibraltar School Bd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>of Ed, </em>393 Mich 190, 194; 224 NW2d 255 (1974). That frame of reference is supplied, in most cases, by the entire act of which the provision to be interpreted and applied is only a part. As this Court has often observed \"[a] statute must be read in its entirety and the meaning given to one section arrived at after due consideration of other sections so as to produce, if possible, an harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>State Treasurer v Wilson, </em>423 Mich 138, 145; 377 NW2d 703 (1985). See also <em>Williams v Secretary of State, </em>338 Mich 202, 207; 60 NW2d 910 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The fundamental purpose of any rule of statutory construction, of course, is to assist the court in discovering and giving effect to the intent of the Legislature. It is thus equally axiomatic that \" 'the intention of the Legislature, when discovered, must prevail, any existing rule of construction to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Council No 23 v Oakland Co Prosecutor, </em>409 Mich 299, 318-319; 294 NW2d 578 (1980), quoting <em>Michigan Central R Co v Michigan, </em>148 Mich 151, 156; 111 NW 735 (1907). As justice Williams elaborated in <em>Metropolitan Council No 23:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">Neither clinical construction nor the letter of the statute nor its rhetorical framework should be permitted to defeat the act\u2019s purpose and intent as gathered from consideration of the whole act. As eloquently stated by Justice Grant in <em>Common Council of Detroit v Rush, </em>82 Mich 532, 542; 46 NW 951 (1890): \"[A] thing which is within the spirit of a statute is within the statute, although not within the letter; and a thing within the letter is not within the statute, unless within the intention.\u201d This principle was more recently stated in <em>Aikens v Dep\u2019t of Conservation, 387 </em>Mich 495, 499; 198 NW2d 304 (1972): \"It is well settled that the proper construction of any statute is for the court. The purpose of the court in interpreting a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>is to give effect to the legislative intent. If there is a conflict, the spirit and purpose of the statute should prevail over its strict letter.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>[Id., </em>p 319.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Ultimately, \" '[t]he particular inquiry is not what is the abstract force of the words or what they may comprehend, but in what sense were they intended to be understood or what understanding do they convey as used in the particular act.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Lynch, </em>410 Mich 343, 354; 301 NW2d 796 (1981), quoting 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 46.07, p 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In our opinion, when \u00a7 3104 is read as a whole, and \u00a7 3104(2) is examined in the proper context of the entire section, it becomes clear that the reference to \"personal protection insurance coverages\u201d under which the cca may be liable for indemnification in the event of a catastrophic loss is not simply a general reference to all insurance coverages under which an insurer might be required to pay Michigan no-fault benefits. Rather, it is a shorthand reference to the no-fault personal protection insurance coverages that are generally the subject of the act, i.e., those which were written in this state to provide the compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act for the \"owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state\u201d \u2014 \"residents,\u201d in the language of the cca\u2019s plan of operation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this case, plaintiff did not pay benefits in excess of $250,000 under a policy issued pursuant to \u00a7 3101(1) to a \"resident,\u201d but rather paid benefits to a nonresident pursuant to its certification under \u00a7 3163._</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we note initially that the only other reference in \u00a7 3104 to \"insurance coverages\u201d is found in \u00a7 3104(1), which makes membership in the association mandatory for each insurer \"engaged in writing insurance coverages which provide the security required by section 3101(1).\u201d Section 3101(1), again, requires only the owner or registrant of a motor vehicle \"required to be registered in this state\u201d to maintain personal protection, property protection, and residual liability insurance on the vehicle.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By its terms, \u00a7 3101(1) does not apply to vehicles that are not required to be registered in Michigan. See <em>Parks v DAIIE, </em>426 Mich 191; 393 NW2d 833 (1986).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">It is upon \u00a7 3104(7)(d), however, that we squarely rest our finding of a legislative intent to limit indemnification under \u00a7 3104(2). Section 3104(7)(d) provides the manner and method in which the cca is to calculate and assess to member insurers the premiums which fund its operation. Under that section, the cca first arrives at a figure which represents its expected losses and costs for the assessment period. This \"total premium\u201d is divided by the total earned car years of insurance \"providing the security required by section 3101(1) . . . written in this state\u201d by all insurers to arrive at an average premium per car. The average premium is then multiplied by each member\u2019s total earned car years of insurance \"providing the security required by section 3101(1) . . . written in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>state\u201d to arrive at that member\u2019s total premium for the assessment period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In our view, the fact that the Legislature granted the cca the authority to charge premiums only with respect to policies written in Michigan providing the security required by \u00a7 3101(1) for the owners or registrants of vehicles required to be registered in the state, compels the conclusion that it intended to similarly limit the cca\u2019s liability for indemnification under \u00a7 3104(2). Put simply, we can think of no reason why the Legislature would want to provide such indemnification coverage to insurers, even member insurers who do a significant amount of business within this state, absolutely free of charge or, perhaps more appropriately, at no cost <em>to them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The language of \u00a7 3104(7)(d) confirms initially the clear purpose behind the creation of the cca to reduce, in <em>this state\u2019s </em>insurance market, both the inequity of competition resulting from the unpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>dictability of catastrophic claims and the inherent inability of insurance companies, both large and small, to effectively manage this particular kind of liability. Thus, it is important to realize that any benefits paid by an insurer such as plaintiff to its out-of-state insureds are paid by virtue of the certification filed pursuant to \u00a7 3163(1), under a policy actually written and sold in another state\u2019s insurance market, rather than by virtue of a policy providing the security required by \u00a7 3101(1) written and sold in this state\u2019s insurance market. We simply cannot believe that the Legislature could have intended to provide indemnification for losses under both kinds of coverage and yet deny the cca the ability to charge premiums with respect to the former.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We find unpersuasive plaintiff\u2019s proffered rationale that since \u00a7 3163(1) subjects the insurers of nonresidents (if they write coverages in Michigan) to liability under the Michigan no-fault system, including its open-ended personal protection benefits provisions, they likewise should be entitled to all of its protections. Clearly, as to those out-of-state insureds, such insurers have not paid for this particular protection. This conclusion is perhaps best illustrated by reference to another provision of \u00a7 3163._</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Under \u00a7 3163(2), an insurer not otherwise authorized to write insurance coverages in this state may voluntarily file the written certification described in \u00a7 3163(1) similarly subjecting itself and its insureds to the Michigan no-fault system. Although such voluntary filing is perhaps not a frequent occurrence, neither is it unheard of. See, e.g., <em>Kriko v Allstate Ins Co of Canada, </em>137 Mich App 528; 357 NW2d 882 (1984).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An insurer who so files under \u00a7 3163(2) does not become a member of the cca, since it is not engaged in writing any policies under \u00a7 3101(1). It is thus obviously not entitled to indemnification under \u00a7 3104(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">As a practical matter, however, it would make little sense to provide such an insurer with the protection of \u00a7 3104, even though it had paid Michigan no-fault benefits, since the insurer who has paid benefits pursuant to \u00a7 3163(2) has not paid any kind of premium to the cca for such protection. The same reasoning must certainly apply to the plaintiff insurer who is required tq provide benefits under \u00a7 3163(1) because it is authorized to write policies in Michigan. As to its out-of-state insureds, whatever percentage of its business they make up, the plaintiff simply has not paid for the protection of \u00a7 3104.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s general assertion that its liability under \u00a7 3163 entitled it to \"all of the rights and immunities under the Michigan no-fault law irrespective of\u201d the nonresident status of its insured, including the right of catastrophic loss protection under \u00a7 3104, is simply unfounded. As defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>cca points out, \u00a7 3163(3) st\u00e1tes that the insurer and insured shall have the rights and immunities of \"personal and property protection insureds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 3104 is not intended to protect or benefit no-fault insureds. The rights and benefits it establishes flow only to insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that \u00a7 3163(3) generally provides insurers who file the proper certification with all the rights of an insurer who has written a policy pursuant to \u00a7 3101(1) \u2014 a question not before this Court \u2014 we would still be unable to find a right to indemnification in this case. It is \u00a7 3104 itself which limits the right to indemnification to insurers who have provided coverages pursuant to \u00a7 3101(1). As a specific and subsequently enacted provision \u00a73104 must control as against the more general \u00a7 3163(3). Thus, the \"system\u201d of which plaintiff contends it is a part as a result of its certification under \u00a7 3163(1) does not in fact establish plaintiff\u2019s right to indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We must remember that insurers such as plaintiff ran the risk of exposure to such catastrophic claims as a result of \u00a7 3163 long before the cca was created. Plaintiff in this case did not gain additional exposure as a result of the creation of the cca. Moreover, to the extent that the liability of the cca is limited to policies of insurance written in this state for Michigan-registered vehicles, insurers such as plaintiff remain free to seek reinsurance elsewhere or act otherwise to limit that risk. Plaintiff\u2019s argument that it thought it was somehow \"precluded\u201d from seeking reinsurance elsewhere for its out-of-state insureds by the \"shall accept\u201d language of \u00a7 3104(2) is without merit. The association\u2019s plan of operation quite clearly explained that the indemnification was to be provided only for policies written for Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>residents. Plaintiff was therefore not justified in believing that it was precluded from seeking, and accepting, other reinsurance with respect to its nonresident insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Finally, our conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to confer such a substantial benefit upon such insurers is confirmed by our view that it did not intend to impose so substantial a burden upon those who would be ultimately liable for the cost of such coverage, that is, this state\u2019s no-fault insurance consumers, to whom any and all costs of such indemnification coverage inevitably would be passed. Under plaintiff\u2019s reading of the statute, these insureds would be required to cover not only the costs of the claims made by their fellow Michigan insureds, who, it must be remembered, have also actually contributed to the fund through passed-on premiums, but also the costs of the claims of insureds from other states, who have not paid into the fund in the same manner. Plaintiff\u2019s reading of the statute would thus undoubtedly have a great effect on the cost to consumers of buying insurance in Michigan. Quite obviously, if the cca were required to take into account the possible claims of nonresidents in arriving at its total premium, the average premium per car, which, again, is passed on only to resident insureds, would necessarily be higher.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In sum, unlike plaintiff, we see no inequity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>treating an insurer differently depending upon whether it has paid benefits to its out-of-state insureds pursuant to its certification under \u00a7 3163 or pursuant to a policy of insurance written in this state for a vehicle registered here. While the language of \u00a7 3104(2) does state only that indemnification shall be provided where catastrophic losses are sustained under \"personal protection insurance coverages,\u201d we believe that the Legislature clearly intended that phrase to refer only to such coverages as are written in this state for the owners and registrants of vehicles required to be registered here. Again, we are simply unable to conclude that the Legislature intended the cca to be liable on policies of insurance for which it has not charged, and in fact cannot charge, its members premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has asked this Court to consider whether the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 3104(2) of the no-fault act to indemnify member insurers for losses incurred over $250,000 for personal protection benefits applies where such benefits are paid to a nonresident pursuant to \u00a7 3163.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">We answer that the cca has correctly interpreted \u00a7 3104(2) to apply only to personal protection insurance coverages written for \"residents\u201d of this state, who, as that term is intended under the cca\u2019s plan of operation, include not only those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>insureds who actually live within the state, but also out-of-state residents who have purchased such coverages in this state as a result of the compulsory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1).</p>\n<judges id=\"b849-4\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b849-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9e\"><em>(separate </em>opinion).

The obvious problem is that the small or medium-sized companies have substantially fewer cars over which to spread the costs of potential losses, which means that the costs of providing unlimited medical and other benefits is higher per car for such companies, putting them at a competitive disadvantage in the state\u2019s insurance market. In addition to this competitive disadvantage, the Legislature considered the practical \"business difficulties\u201d confronting all insurers as a result of such possible catastrophic claims, such as the difficulty in determining the amount of reserves to keep on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">It was thought that the creation of such an association of insurers would alleviate the competitive inequity of these catastrophic claims by spreading their cost throughout the industry, and also increase the statistical basis for prediction of the overall cost of such claims, making the management of these liabilities easier. See House Legislative Analysis, SB 306, March 13, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> MCL 500.3101(1); MSA 24.13101(1) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">The owner or registrant of a motor vehicle <em>required to be registered in this state </em>shall maintain security for payment of benefits under personal protection insurance, property protection insurance, and residual liability insurance.

We do not discuss, for example, plaintiff\u2019s claim that the restriction violated the cca\u2019s obligation to provide an economical, fair and nondiscriminatory plan of operation under \u00a7 3104(17). We also need not address the question whether the cca\u2019s plan of operation was properly promulgated under the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq., </em>which issue we have taken up in <em>League General Ins Co v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>lv gtd 431 Mich 870 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">Moreover, we do not express any opinion as to whether the cca would be obligated to provide indemnification to an insurer who has written a policy in this state for a nonresident pursuant to \u00a7 3102(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>MCL 500.3303(b); MSA 24.13303(b) appears to indicate that nonresidents who intend to reside in this state for thirty days or more are entitled to purchase insurance in this state upon making a written statement of such intention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\"> As we stated in <em>Elba Twp </em>v <em>Gratiot Co, </em>287 Mich 372, 394; 283 NW 615 (1939), \"[i]n ascertaining the true intent and meaning of a statute often allowance must be made for attempted brevity of expression.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\"> See n 3 for the full text of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\"> We also note the language of \u00a7 3104(3), which provides that \"[a]n insurer may withdraw from the association only upon ceasing to write insurance which provides the security required by section 3101(1) in this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\"> Section 3104(7)(d) provides that the association shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">[i]n a manner provided for in the plan of operation, calculate and charge to members of the association a total premium sufficient to cover the expected losses and expenses of the association which the association will likely incur during the period for which the premium is applicable.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\"> Although we recognize that such sources are of limited value, and are clearly not dispositive of legislative intent, we do find some measure of support for our reading of \u00a7 3104(2) in this case in the language of two different legislative analyses of \u00a7 3104. The House Legislative Analysis of SB 306, <em>ante, </em>n 2, notes that the cost of catastrophic coverages would be spread among the cca\u2019s members, \"[a]ll auto insurers <em>in the state,\u201d </em>who would be billed according to their respective shares of the auto insurance market so that \"in practice, each policyholder in the state would be paying the same amount... for unlimited pip coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The Department of Commerce Analysis of SB 306 similarly notes the favorable effect of \u201cequitable distribution of catastrophic claims among all of the state\u2019s motorists,\u201d and also points out that the cost of providing such coverage would be \"predictable,\u201d since the \"base of cars would be all insured cars in Michigan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\"> In <em>Kriko, </em>the defendant, a Canadian insurance company, apparently \"sought to make its insurance policies more attractive to potential customers who might be regular travellers in the State of Michigan and/or sought to avail itself of the potential benefits provided by Michigan\u2019s no-fault system by filing its certification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\"> Lastly, we reject the argument advanced by amici curiae that to deny indemnification coverage for policies issued to out-of-state insureds or for nonregistered vehicles violates the insurers\u2019 equal protection rights. As we have stated many times before, the test for an equal protection claim under both the Michigan and the United States Constitutions is whether the legislation bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate goal of the Legislature. See, e.g., <em>Automatic Music &amp; Vending Corp v Liquor Control Comm, </em>426 Mich 452, 459; 396 NW2d 204 (1986); <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In our opinion, providing coverage for policies written in this state for vehicles registered in this state quite clearly advances the goals of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the Legislature with respect to ensuring fair competition within <em>this state\u2019s </em>no-fault insurance market. We do not believe that a scheme which limits indemnification coverage to those who have paid for it is irrational or arbitrary. Nor do we believe that the state must offer such coverage to all insurers with respect to their out-of-state insureds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
