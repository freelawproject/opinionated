Because the vehicle was \"parked\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3106(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the time of the accident, and none of the \u00a7 3106(1) exceptions is applicable, plaintiff is not entitled to no-fault benefits, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff, a resident of Grosse Pointe Farms, was told by the city that the broken and uneven sidewalk in front of his house had to be leveled or replaced. Plaintiff decided to do the work himself, and he borrowed a tow truck and an operator from a friend who owned a neighborhood gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Plaintiff decided that each of three large concrete slabs should be raised in order that the soil underneath could be leveled. The tow truck was backed over the curb, and a hook at the end of the winch cable was positioned over each slab as it was to be lifted. After a slab had been raised two or three feet, wood bracing was put in place to hold the slab, and plaintiff then proceeded to cut out roots and to remove or add soil where needed to level the ground. At one point while this cutting and filling took place, the operator drove the tow truck back to the gas station. Upon its return, the truck was used to relift each slab while the brac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>ing was removed; the slab then was lowered to the ground. When this procedure was completed, plaintiff concluded that the slabs still were not level, and he decided that the process should be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In each instance when it was used to assist plaintiff, the truck was positioned perpendicular to the street, with its back wheels almost at the sidewalk. Although the wheels were not blocked, the operator set the hand brake and the front wheels were against the curb so as to immobilize them. With the truck in neutral gear, the operator raised or lowered the hook by operating controls located outside and at the back of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">While one of the slabs was being raised for the third time, plaintiff, without inserting wood bracing, put his hand underneath the slab in order to level the last high spot. At that point a piece of the concrete broke off at the hook, and the slab fell, resulting in serious injury to plaintiff\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">After insurance coverage was denied, plaintiff filed this action against defendant Automobile Club of Michigan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> insurer of his personal automobile, seeking pip benefits under the no-fault act. Defendant moved for summary disposition on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s injuries did not \"arise[ ] out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3105(1) of the act. Defendant also argued that even if the truck was being used as a motor vehicle, plaintiff\u2019s recovery was barred under \u00a7 3106(1) because the truck was \"parked\u201d when the accident occurred and none of the \u00a7 3106(1) exceptions was applicable._</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Relying on <em>Johnston v Hartford Ins Co, </em>131 Mich App 349; 346 NW2d 549 (1984), lv den 419 Mich 893 (1984), the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, holding that when the accident occurred the tow truck was being used, not as a motor vehicle, but as a mobile winch or crane. Thereafter, while the instant case was pending before the Court of Appeals, we decided <em>Bialochowski v Cross Concrete Pumping Co, </em>428 Mich 219; 407 NW2d 355 (1987). Concluding that <em>Bialochowski </em>had \"implicitly overruled\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the tow truck was being used as a motor vehicle. The appeals panel also determined that the truck was parked; however, it read this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Miller v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 633; 309 NW2d 544 (1981), as authority to conclude that \u00a7 3106(1) does not exclude coverage on these facts. The panel went further and reasoned that even if <em>Miller </em>did not apply, plaintiff would be entitled to recover under a broad interpretation of. the exception set forth in \u00a7 3106(l)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal. 430 Mich 891 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">While conceding that the tow truck was \"a motor vehicle,\u201d defendant argues that the truck was not being used \"as a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3105(1) of the no-fault act. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">Under personal protection insurance an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>subject to the provisions of this chapter. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Defendant contends that the tow truck was being used as a stationary crane. Defendant further argues that in order to satisfy the \"as a motor vehicle\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3105(1) something more must be shown than that the injury arose out of the \"use of a motor vehicle.\u201d Defendant maintains that the Legislature intended to include within the ambit of no-fault coverage only those accidents which result from the <em>vehicular </em>involvement of a motor vehicle in an accident. Before responding to these arguments, we believe a brief review of several cases is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>the plaintiff was injured when his automobile fell on him while he attempted to replace a pair of shock absorbers. The <em>Miller </em>Court focused upon \"tension\u201d it found to exist between \u00a7 3105(1) which covers injuries incurred in the \"maintenance\u201d of a motor vehicle, and \u00a7 3106<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which at the time appeared to exclude coverage of injuries incurred in the maintenance of a \"parked\u201d motor vehicle. Observing that virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>all maintenance is performed on a vehicle while it is parked, the <em>Miller </em>Court undertook the task of resolving this perceived conflict between the two provisions of the act. In an opinion by Justice Levin, the Court examined policies which underlie each provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">The policy embodied in the requirement of \u00a7 3105(1) that coverage extend to \"injury arising out of the . . . maintenance ... of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d thus is to provide compensation for injuries, such as Miller\u2019s, incurred in the course of repairing a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">The policy underlying the parking exclusion is not so obvious but, once discerned, is comparably definite. Injuries involving parked vehicles do not normally involve the vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle. </em>Injuries involving parked vehicles typically involve the vehicle in much the same way as any other stationary object (such as a tree, sign post or boulder) would be involved. There is nothing about a parked vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle </em>that would bear on the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Each of the exceptions to the parking exclusion thus describes an instance where, although the vehicle is parked, its involvement in an accident is nonetheless directly related to its character as a motor vehicle. The underlying policy of the parking exclusion is that, except in three general types of situations, a parked car is not involved in an accident <em>as a motor vehicle. </em>It is therefore inappropriate to compensate injuries arising from its non-vehicular involvement in an accident within a system designed to compensate injuries involving motor vehicles as motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">The policies underlying \u00a7 3105(1) and \u00a7 3106 thus are complementary rather than conflicting. Nothing of the policy behind the parking exclusion \u2014to exclude injuries not resulting from the involvement of a vehicle as a motor vehicle \u2014 conflicts with the policy of compensating injuries in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>curred in the course of maintaining (repairing) a motor vehicle. <em>[Miller, supra, </em>pp 639-641. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In <em>Bialochowski, </em>this Court considered the \"as a motor vehicle\u201d requirement in connection with the use of a dual-purpose vehicle. In that case, the plaintiff was injured when the boom of a cement truck collapsed on him. The injured plaintiff claimed that the truck was being used \"as a motor vehicle\u201d when the accident happened; however, the insurer argued that it was being used \"as a piece of construction machinery, a cement pump, which poured concrete at elevated levels.\u201d <em>Bialochowski, supra, </em>p 226. In determining that the \"as a motor vehicle\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3105(1) had been met, the <em>Bialochowski </em>Court focused upon the fact that the cement truck was a motor vehicle and that it was being used for its intended purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Motor vehicles are designed and used for many different purposes. The truck involved in this case is a cement truck capable of pouring cement at elevated levels. Certainly one of the intended uses of this motor vehicle (a motor vehicle under the no-fault act) is to pump cement. The accident occurred while this vehicle was being used for its intended purpose. We hold that the phrase \"use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d includes this use. <em>[Id., </em>pp 228-229.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The <em>Bialochowski </em>Court distinguished <em>Johnston v Hartford Ins Co, supra, </em>wherein a crane operator had been injured when he slipped while entering the crane\u2019s cab which contained the driving controls. At the time of the injury, the crane could not be driven or moved. It had been immobilized by the placement of outriggers and counterweights, an operation that took three days to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>accomplish. The <em>Johnston </em>panel determined that although the crane was a motor vehicle which could travel on the highway, the crane was not being used \"as a motor vehicle\u201d at the time in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Bialochowski </em>Court, in an opinion by Justice Cavanagh, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnston </em>is misplaced .... [T]he truck in the present case is dissimilar to the crane in that it did not require three days and the attachment of counterweights and outriggers to immobilize it. Rather, although this truck was parked and stabilized, the stabilizers could have been disengaged, the truck started, and then driven away. <em>[Id., </em>pp 227-228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Applying a \"broad remedial interpretation,\u201d the <em>Bialochowski </em>Court also said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">[W]e believe that the Court of Appeals in <em>Johnston </em>interpreted the statutory phrase \"use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d contained in \u00a7 3105 too narrowly. The no-fault act is remedial in nature, as evidenced by the fact that the act \"was offered as an innovative social and legal response to the long payment delays, inequitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>payment structure, and high legal costs inherent in the tort (or 'fault\u2019) liability system.\u201d The nof\u00e1ult act was designed \"to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d In exchange for a more certain recovery under the no-fault act, an injured person\u2019s right to recover damages from a negligent owner or operator of a motor vehicle in a tort action is limited. This remedial nature of the no-fault act would be advanced by broadly construing its provisions to effectuate coverage. <em>[Id., </em>p 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Although <em>Bialochowski </em>utilized the interpretive tool of liberal construction, the reach of its holding should not be exaggerated. Insofar as it related to the \"as a motor vehicle\u201d language, <em>Bialochowski </em>decided a narrow issue: whether a dual-purpose vehicle is necessarily not in use as a motor vehicle when it is being used for a nonlocomotive purpose. <em>Bialochowski </em>held that coverage is not necessarily precluded solely because there was no \"vehicular movement\u201d at the time of the injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Against that background, we turn now to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In'this case, the tow truck was stopped; there was no \"vehicular movement.\u201d Thus, we are required to determine whether the vehicle was parked and, if so, whether any of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 3106(1) is applicable. At the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury, \u00a7 3106(1) provided:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Accidental bodily injury does not arise out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a <em>parked </em>vehicle as a motor vehicle unless any of the following occur:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">(a) The vehicle was parked in such a way as to cause unreasonable risk of the bodily injury which occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">(b) Except as provided in subsection (2), the injury was a direct result of physical contact with the equipment permanently mounted on the vehicle, while the equipment was being operated or used or property being lifted onto or lowered from the vehicle in the loading or unloading process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">(c) Except as provided in subsection (2) for an injury sustained in the course of employment while loading, or unloading, or doing mechanical work on a vehicle, the injury was sustained by a person while occupying, entering into, or alighting from the vehicle. [Emphasis supplied.][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Plaintiff contends that the tow truck was <em>not </em>parked, and for that reason reference to \u00a7 3106(1) is unnecessary. Plaintiff argues that a vehicle should not be considered as being \"parked\u201d unless it has been abandoned by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">We need only refer to the language set forth in \u00a7 3106(l)(a)-(c) to demonstrate that such a restrictive definition was not intended. In particular, the words used in subparagraph (b) and (c) of \u00a7 3106(1) make clear that the Legislature contemplated that a vehicle, while parked, would not be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The Court of Appeals found, and we agree, that the tow truck in this case was \"parked\u201d within any reasonable definition of that term. The truck was positioned perpendicular to the street with the front wheels against the curb, and the hand brake was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Although the Court of Appeals determined that the tow truck was parked, it pointed to <em>Miller </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>found \u00a7 3106(1) to be inapplicable on the facts of this case. The panel reasoned that since the tow truck was \"involved in the accident while being used as a motor vehicle,\u201d it would be unnecessary, under Miller, to satisfy any of the \u00a7 3106(1) exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">As already noted, <em>Miller </em>involved an injury which occurred while the plaintiff was performing maintenance repairs on his vehicle. The <em>Miller </em>Court did determine that because the injury arose out of \"maintenance\u201d of the vehicle, it was unnecessary to consider whether the vehicle was parked.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we caution that the <em>Miller </em>holding is limited to the narrow circumstances of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In the instant case \"maintenance\u201d of a motor vehicle is not involved, and absent that involvement, we detect no \"tension\u201d between \u00a7 3105(1) and \u00a7 3106(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In limiting no-fault benefits to injuries \"arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle,\u201d the Legislature realized that it would be inherently difficult to determine when a <em>parked </em>vehicle is in use \"as a motor vehicle.\u201d Accordingly, the Legislature specifically described in subsections (a)-(c) of \u00a7 3106(1) the limited circumstances when a parked vehicle is being used \"as a motor vehicle.\u201d Thus it is apparent that if a vehicle is \"parked\u201d coverage otherwise available under \u00a7 3105(1) is qualified by the provisions of \u00a7 3106(1). In the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>because the tow truck was parked, coverage is excluded by \u00a7 3106(1) unless one of its exceptions is applicable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to coverage under one or both of the \u00a7 3106(l)(b) exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The first prong of subsection (b) allows coverage if the injury is \"a direct result of physical contact with equipment permanently mounted on the vehicle, while the equipment was being operated or used . . . .\u201d In this case, plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred when a concrete slab disengaged from the hook of the tow truck and fell upon his hand. It is undisputed that the hook was permanently affixed to the tow truck and that it was being used. We therefore focus upon what is meant by the words \"direct result of physical contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Plaintiff argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that direct physical contact between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>plaintiff and the equipment itself is not necessary. The panel considered it sufficient that the injury was a direct result of contact made with the slab of concrete being lifted or lowered. This interpretation of the statute separates the requirements of \"physical contact\u201d and \"direct result,\u201d and emphasizes the latter. Such an interpretation of the statutory language would not require actual physical contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The alternative interpretation, obviously supported by defendant, is that the injury must directly result from actual physical contact between the injured person and the equipment. See, e.g., <em>Frohm v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>148 Mich App 308; 383 NW2d 604 (1985), lv den 425 Mich 857 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We believe that this latter interpretation accords the term \"direct\u201d the meaning that the Legislature intended in enacting \u00a7 3106(l)(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the Legislature had intended broader coverage, it could easily have used the phrase \"arising out of\u201d rather than \"was a direct result of.\u201d The former phrase would connote coverage in the absence of physical contact between the injured person and the injury-producing instrument. Moreover, insertion of the word \"physical\u201d in the subsection fortifies a legislative intent that the injured person\u2019s body must come into contact with the equipment. Once again, had the Legislature not intended this requirement, it could have stated simply that ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>efits were recoverable if the equipment \"caused\u201d the injury. The Legislature\u2019s choice of terminology was deliberate, and this Court must give it the effect dictated by the language and the purpose of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In the case before us, plaintiff did not, in contrast with the plaintiff in <em>Bialochowski, </em>come into contact with the hook or winch of the truck. Rather, he was injured when the cement slab fell from the hook onto his hand. Since the injury to plaintiff was only indirectly the result of use of the equipment, we must hold that plaintiff cannot recover benefits under the first prong of \u00a7 3106(1)0\u00bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The second prong requires that the injury be a direct result of physical contact with \"property being lifted onto or lowered from the vehicle in the loading or unloading process.\u201d \u00a7 3106(l)(b). The Court of Appeals found that this requirement was fulfilled, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">Additionally, although declining to engage in any extensive analysis, we do not adopt defendant\u2019s argument that the exception for property being lifted or lowered from the vehicle in the loading or unloading process does not apply as well. We see little significance in drawing a line between, for example, loading articles onto the bed of a truck, and the type of lifting that the tow truck was utilized for in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">We disagree. It is undisputed that the cement slab in the instant case was not being lifted onto or lowered from the tow truck. No such operation was attempted. The sole purpose of lifting the sidewalk slab was to enable plaintiff to work under it. At no time did anyone intend to load the slab onto the tow truck. Thus, we hold that the requirements of \u00a7 3106(l)(b) have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The tow truck in the instant case was not being used \"as a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3105(1) because it was \"parked\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3106(1) and none of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 3106(1) is applicable. Thus, we conclude that plaintiff is not entitled to no-fault pip benefits.

I agree with the majority of the Court that the tow truck was in use \"as a motor vehicle\u201d when plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred. The truck was being used for its intended purpose, and in accordance with the decision in <em>Bialochowski v Cross Concrete Pumping Co, </em>428 Mich 219; 407 NW2d 355 (1987), the truck was in use \"as a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3105(1) of the no-fault act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that because none of the exceptions to the parked vehicle exclusion outlined in \u00a7 3106(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is applicable, no-fault coverage is not available to plaintiff. In <em>Miller v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 633, 641; 309 NW2d 544 (1981), the Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to no-fault coverage for injuries incurred during the maintenance of his vehicle as a motor vehicle without regard to whether the vehicle might be considered \"parked\u201d at the time of the injury. The Court referred to the policies underlying \u00a7\u00a7 3105(1) and 3106(1), stating:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The policy underlying the parking exclusion is not so obvious but, once discerned, is comparably definite. Injuries involving parked vehicles do not normally involve the vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle. </em>Injuries involving parked vehicles typically involve the vehicle in much the same way as any other stationary object (such as a tree, sign post or boulder) would be involved. There is nothing about a parked vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle </em>that would bear on the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">Each of the exceptions to the parking exclusion thus describes an instance where, although the vehicle is parked, its involvement in an accident is nonetheless directly related to its character as a motor vehicle. The underlying policy of the parking exclusion is that, except in three general types of situations, a parked car is not involved in an accident <em>as a motor vehicle. </em>It is therefore inappropriate to compensate injuries arising from its non-vehicular involvement in an accident within a system designed to compensate injuries involving motor vehicles as motor vehicles. <em>[Miller, supra, </em>pp 639-641. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that reference to the policies underlying these two statutory provisions is no less appropriate in the present case than in <em>Miller. </em>The purpose behind the parked vehicle exclusion would not be advanced by applying the provision so as to prevent coverage for plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">I would hold that once it is determined that a dual-purpose vehicle, such as the cement truck in <em>Bialochowski </em>and the tow truck in this case, was being used for one of its intended purposes and was, therefore, in use \"as a motor vehicle\u201d under \u00a7 3105(1), no-fault coverage is available for injuries which arose out of that use without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>whether the vehicle might be considered \"parked.\u201d For this reason, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-5\">Archer, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> MCL 500.3105(1); MSA 24.13105(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> MCL 500.3106(1); MSA 24.13106(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
