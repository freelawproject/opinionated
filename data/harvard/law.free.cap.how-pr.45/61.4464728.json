On the 6th day of November, 1871, the plaintiff lent the defendant, who was then a widow, the sum of twenty-six dollars, payable on demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-13\">This action, which was at first commenced in a justice\u2019s court, but withdrawn because service could not be obtained upon the defendant, was brought to recover said sums of money. The only question raised upon the trial was in regard to the liability of the defendant upon said promissory note, the defense being based upon the fact that at the time said note was given the defendant was a married woman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-14\">The referee reported that the defendant was not liable upon said note and the plaintiff brings this appeal. The following facts are undisputedThat the consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>note in question was the sum of forty dollars, which Polly Kinne, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, lent to the defendant person- \u2022 ally; that at the time the defendant borrowed said sum, she represented that she had interest money paid to her from her husband every year, and that there was an agreement between her and her husband that he should pay her interest on a certain sum annually, and that she could do what she wished to with it, give it to her children, or anything else; that on a subsequent occasion, when said Polly Kinne lent the defendant $200 more, the defendant stated that she had property down east, where her brother lived, and could sell it and get the money at any time; that at about the same time- the defendant tried to borrow money of different persons, stating that she was sure of having a certain amount of money the coming spring, so many thousand dollars in the spring; that she could give security on land for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">It further appeared that the defendant, prior to her marriage with Esop .Kinne, her last husband, entered into an ante-nuptial agreement-with him, whereby upon her marriage she became entitled to $1,000 interest in his estate, which sum was to be paid to her one year after her husband\u2019s death, with interest from the date of said agreement; that her husband paid her annual interest on said $1,000, and took her receipt therefor; that the defendant once owned a lot of land in this state, which she held for two years and then sold. The defendant was not sworn at all, and no witness disputed the foregoing facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">I. The defendant, a married woman, borrowed forty dollars of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor and gave her own note therefor, and she is liable thereupon, whether she had any separate estate aside from the money borrowed at the time of the transaction or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\"><em>Vide </em>section 3 of the act of April 10th, 1862, amending the seventh section of the act of March 20th, 1860 (4 <em>R. S., </em>515-16). The section is as follows: \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-8\">\u00a7 3. Any married woman may, while married, sue and <em>be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>sued </em>in all matters having relation to her sole and separate property, <em>or which may hereafter come to her </em>by descent, devise, <em>bequest,purchase </em>or the <em>gift </em>or <em>grant </em>of any person, <em>in the same marnier as if she were sole.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">By analyzing this section it naturally resolves itself into two divisions or classes of cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">1. Any married woman may, while married, sue and be sued in all matters having relation to her sole and separate property in the same manner as if she were sole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">2. Any married woman may, while married, sue and be sued in all matters having relation to property which may come to her by descent, devise, bequest, purchase, or the gift or grant of any person, in the same manner as if she were sole,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">If the note in question, therefore, is a matter having relation either to</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\"><em>(a.) </em>The <em>\u201c </em>sole and separate property \u201d of the defendant, or</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\"><em>(b.) </em>To property'which may have come to the defendant by descent, devise, bequest, purchase, or the gift or grant of any person,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-11\">Then the defendant is liable to be sued thereupon in the same manner as if she were sole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-12\">It is conceded that said note was given for borrowed money, which was placed in the hands of the defendant at the time the note was delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-13\">Two questions, therefore, arise:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-14\"><em>(c.) </em>Was the forty dollars borrowed money after it came into the possession and under the control of the defendant as her own money, her <em>\u201c </em>sole and separate property ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-15\"><em>(d.) </em>Was the forty dollars borrowed money after it came into the possession and under the control of the defendant as her own money, property that came to her by descent, devise, bequest, purchase, or the gift or grant of any person?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-16\">\u2022 If <em>either </em>or <em>both </em>of these questions are answered by the court in the affirmative, then the defendant is liable on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>If they are <em>both </em>answered in the negative, then she is not liable, unless the plaintiff shows a further separate estate belonging to the defendant. What, then, is the sole and separate property of a married woman ? It is whatever property she possesses <em>free from her Jmsband\u2019s control (Briggs </em>agt.

S, </em>513, 515, 516).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">The test is to ascertain whether or not the husband has any interest in or control over it, and whether or not it is liable for his debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">The act of March 20th, 1860, entitled an act concerning the <em>rights </em>and <em>liabilities </em>of husband and wife, provides in its first section that (1) the property both real and personal which any married woman now owns;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">(2.) That which comes to her by descent, devise, bequest, <em>gift </em>or <em>grant;</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">(3.) That which she acquires by her trade, business, labor, etc.;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">(4.) That which a woman, married in this state, owns at the time of \"her marriage, shall be and remain her sole and separate property, * * * and shall not be subject to the interference or control of her husband or liable for his debts, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">Was this forty dollars, after it was placed in the defendant\u2019s hands, her own money, so as to be free from her husband\u2019s control ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-11\">Could-a creditor of her husband\u2019s have levied upon it or compelled her to pay it over to a receiver? And could not a judgment creditor of the defendant have reached it and have compelled her to apply it on his debt ? <em>(Leitch </em>agt. <em>Wells, </em>48 <em>N. Y., </em>585.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>No matter what she <em>intended </em>to do with the money after she borrowed it, it was hers to do what she chose with. She could squander it or invest it; could lend it to her son or lend it to a bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">If she had an intention at the time she borrowed it to dispose of it in a particular way, she could have changed her mind at any time and diverted it to another channel. If she intended at the time she borrowed it to let her son have it, she could notwithstanding have changed her mind at any time and have deposited it in a bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">This change of intention could not affect the rights of the person from whom she borrowed the money. And had she deposited this money, and if it remained on deposit to her credit still, could she defend against this note ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">But in addition to\" matters having relation to her sole and separate property, a married woman can also be sued in relation to property which may have come to her by descent, devise, bequest, <em>purchase\u25a0, </em>or the <em>gift </em>or <em>gramt </em>of any person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">These six ways include the only' legal means of acquiring title to property that has belonged to another. If a person has any property except his own productions, through agriculture, etc., it must have been acquired in some one of these six methods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">This forty dollars, borrowed money, was acquired by <em>purchase, </em>or possibly by <em>gift </em>or <em>grant. Purchase </em>means the acquisition of property by a party\u2019s own act, as distinguished from acquisition by act of law <em>(Burrills Law Dict., </em>842; <em>Steph. Com., </em>355; 4 <em>Kent Com., </em>373).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\">Britton speaks of purchasing by occupancy. He says purchase may be made even by shutting up bees, fish, or other wild animals ([ib.). It includes every lawful mode of acquiring property by the act of the party as opposed to the act of the law <em>(ib.). </em>A <em>loan </em>(for consumption) is a transfer of personal property such as corn or money, to be consumed by the borrower, and to be returned to the lender in kind and quality <em>(Bourier Law Dict., vol. </em>2,p. 156, <em>title Mutuum; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Story on Bailments, </em>\u00a7 228). The title to the articles borrowed rests in the borrower, and hence the defendant may be said to have purchased the money \"in question, or she may be said to have acquired the money by grant, which, as applied to personal property, is a method of transferring chattels distinguished from a gift by being always founded on some consideration or equivalent <em>(Burrills Law Dict., vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>548, <em>title Grant}).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">In this case the \"consideration was the promise, express or implied, to return an equivalent in kind. This forty dollars, then, was the defendant\u2019s sole and separate property, because her husband had no control over it. She is liable on her promise to repay it, because the statute declares that a married woman may sue and be sued in all matters having relation to her sole and separate property,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">Further, she acquired this forty dollars by purchase or grant, as we have seen, and is hence liable, as the statute also declares that a married woman may sue and be sued in relation to any property that she may acquire by grant, purchase, the same as if she were sole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">II. The defendant had a separate estate independent of the one acquired by borrowing the forty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">This appears:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">1. From the defendant\u2019s own statements, which are uncontradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">2. From the ante-nuptial agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">The defendant after making such statements, calculated if not true to mislead the plaintiff and his assignor, is estopped from claiming that she had no separate property. Moreover, by the ante-nupti\u00e1l contract the defendant had an absolute interest to the extent of $1,000, with interest thereon, in the estate of her husband. This contract was ante-nuptial, and the subsequent marriage was a good consideration for it. Even if destroyed, the defendant\u2019s interest in it continued^the same, for if her husband destroyed it during her absence or without her consent such destruction would not bind her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>she could not legally consent to its destruction, for the law would presume <em>conclusively </em>that her consent was owing to the compulsion of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">This was an interest that she could sell or pledge, and thereby raise money on it. The annual interest, which seems to have been paid every year, as Was probably the understanding of the'parties, notwithstanding the wording of the contract, was hers, free from her husband\u2019s control. Her husband\u2019s creditors could not have taken this interest from her, but her own creditors could.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">III. This borrowed money benefited the separate estate of the defendant, because it at once increased the value of her estate <em>as a whole. </em>If she was worth $500 before she borrowed this money she was worth $540 after she borrowed it, subject of course to the debt created by the act of borrowing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">The law presumes that when a married woman, possessing a separate estate, borrows money, it benefits her estate, whether the use to which she actually applies it proves a benefit or an injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">IY. The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs to abide the event.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-9\">Eben Butler, <em>for defendant and respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">On the first day of April, 1869, the defendant \"borrowed forty dollars of one Polly Kinne and gave her promissory note therefor, payable in one year from date, with interest. The defendant, Bachael Kinne, was at the time a married woman, residing with her husband at Syracuse. There is no evidence for what purpose the money was borrowed or to what use it was appropriated. <em>**</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-11\">There is no evidence that the defendant had any trade or carried on any-business separate from her husband. There is no evidence that the defendant had or owned any property or separate estate, but on the contrary it appears impliedly that she had none. There is no evidence that any of the money was used either directly or indirectly for her benefit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>There is no evidence that the money was loaned upon the strength of her statements or representations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">I. In order to reverse the judgment, counsel for the appellant must contend that an action at law can now be maintained against a married woman upon her promissory note the same as though she were a <em>feme sole. </em>At common law the promissory note of a married woman is absolutely void <em>(Barton </em>agt. Beere, 21 <em>How., </em>309; <em>Cobine </em>agt. <em>St. John, </em>12 <em>id., </em>333; <em>Vansteenburgh </em>agt. <em>Hoffman, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>28).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">II. An action is not maintainable, under the laws of this state against a married woman to recover for articles sold her when she is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business, and has no separate property or estate <em>(Brown </em>agt. <em>Herman, </em>14 <em>Abb., </em>395; <em>Schmitt </em>agt. <em>Casta, </em>3 <em>ib. </em>[N. S.], 188; <em>Barton </em>agt. <em>Beere, </em>21 <em>How., </em>309).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">III. In order to maintain this action the plaintiff must show affirmatively that the debt was contracted either for the purpose of carrying on a separate trade or business, or for the benefit of her separate estate, or for her own benefit upon the credit of her separate estate <em>(Yale </em>agt. <em>Dederer, </em>18 <em>N. Y, </em>265; <em>S. C., </em>22 <em>ib., </em>450; <em>Owen </em>agt. <em>Cawley, </em>36 <em>ib., </em>603; <em>Ballin </em>agt. <em>Dillaye, </em>37 <em>ib., </em>38; <em>White </em>agt. <em>McNett, </em>33 <em>ib., </em>371).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-8\"><em>By the Court, </em>Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">This action, so far as any question is raised in it for the decision of the court, was brought upon a promissory note of forty dollars, made by the defendant, when, as the referee finds, she was a married woman and had no separate estate, and was not, engaged in any business separate from her husband. The contracts of married women are still invalid at common law, when not given in the cases allowed by the statute of March 20th, 1860, entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act concerning the rights and liabilities of husband and wife.\u201d This note is not saved by this or any other statute. The fact that the defendant had at the time an expectation to receive money upon the death of her husband, upon an ante-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>nuptial agreement, does not vary the case or make the note valid. It was clearly void when given, and the decision of the referee holding it void was clearly right. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">(This case is now in the Court of Appeals.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
