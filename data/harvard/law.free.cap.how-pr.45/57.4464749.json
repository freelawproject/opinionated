He says: <em>\u201c </em>Where, upon an uncontroverted state of facts, the point involved remains doubtful, or, upon undisputed facts, inferences may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>be drawn either way, the question is one properly for the jury, and their finding should be conclusive. In all such cases the unanimous concurrence of twelve minds in the jury box is as satisfactory a mode of reaching a right conclusion as to attempt to work it out by legal deductions or logical reasoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In respect to the point raised, that the account was charged in the plaintiff\u2019s book directly to Mrs. Day, with the words \u201cM. H. Dodge, reference or responsible,\u201d added after her name, which, it is urged, shows that he regarded Mrs. Day and not the defendant as the principal, and rendered the services upon her credit, it is sufficient to say that nothing of the kind appears in the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">If any evidence given on the trial disclosed such to be the case, it should have been returned to us by the justice; and if he failed to do so, the appellant could have procured an order for an amended return.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">But it is plain that we cannot, on appeal, assume a state of facts to exist, regarding which there is no allusion in the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">As to the plaintiff presenting Mrs. Day with a \u2022 bill for these same services, the evidence discloses that he did so at her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">And, besides, it does not appear in whose name the bill was made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">For aught that we know to the contrary, the defendant may have been named therein as the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Daly, <em>Ch, J., </em>and Bobinson, <em>J., </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">Note.\u2014Let us see how this thing works: We will take as an illustration an almost every-day occurrence arising in the country, A. B. is taken suddenly 'and seriously ill in the night-time, and sends to his neighbor C. D., living in the next house to his, to have him go after the doctor as soon as he can, for he is in great pain and distress. 0. D. jumps out of bed without hesitation and hastily dresses himself, and goes out to his barn and takes a horse from the stable, and not waiting to put on a saddle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>or bridle, jumps on to the horse with the halter only, puts him at full speed for the doctor\u2019s office, some two or three miles distant. On arriving there he finds the doctor absent from home, but his clerk is there, and 0. D. at once says, tell the doctor to call on A. B., who has been taken suddenly sick; tell him to come as soon as possible. In accordance with this message, the doctor calls upon A. B. and prescribes for and attends him professionally for several days. After a reasonable time the doctor sends in his bill to A. B., and it not being paid as soon as the doctor desires, he calls on C. D. and requests him to pay the bill. C. D., with perfect astonishment, asks why he is to pay it. The doctor informs him that he made himself liable to pay the bill, because when he delivered the message he did not tell the clerk that he came for the doctor by the request of A. B,, nor that he acted as agent of A. B. in delivering his message. Well, saysC.D.', the fact was I did go at the request of A. B., and merely acted as his agent in delivering the message, and I will swear to these facts if necessary. The doctor insists that it will do him no good if he should give such testimony, for the law is settled on that point, as just such a case has recently been decided in New York under just such a state of facts, where the jury in the justices\u2019 court found a verdict for the doctor for the amount of his bill, and on appeal by the defendant to the general term of the New York common pleas, that court unanimously sustained the verdict of the jury and affirmed the judgment of the court below. Well, says 0. D., if that is the law, I think I will wait awhile before I go after a doctor again as an act of neighborly kindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It appears to us that this case ought never to have got as far as the jury box. If, as it seems to be inferred from the case, it not being stated in terms, that the defendant was sworn as a witness on his own behalf, that he acted only as the messenger or agent of Mrs. D. in delivering the message to the doctor, and his testimony was unimpeached, it was a clear case for a nonsuit, there being nothing for the jury to decide, at least only formally under the direction of the court. And if the defendant was not sworn and testified, and the case was left standing upon the memorandum, there was only an inference of law from the facts, which were very simple and undisputed, which the court should have decided, and that inference must have been whether or not this was an original undertaking on the part of the defendant to pay the debt of another; for there was no pecuniary consideration nor beneficial interest resulting to the defendant which could establish his liability. It used to be considered that it required a pretty good lawyer and a pretty good judge to determine in given cases what constituted an original undertaking, but if it has been transferred to the jury box of twelve good men to determine this question, and their determination is to be considered unreversible on appeal, it may be quite a relief to the courts, although the community generally may not feel, that confidence in such a settlement of the law as they would on the decision of the courts in such cases.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
