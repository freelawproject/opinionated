On the trial evidence was admitted, against plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception, which tended to show that the water which caused the injury did not coin\u00e9 from the ditch, but from the sewer or the connection with the sewer, and that the injury was the result of a defective sewerage system in that vicinity. We think the evidence was properly received. Although under the requirements of section 149 of the Code new matter must be-pleaded, and consequently the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>defenses of payment, release, accord and satisfaction of arbitrament, and many other entire and partial defenses, which, while they do not deny the cause of action stated in the complaint, yet seek-to avoid or to bar it, and which were formerly available under the general issue; must now be set up in the answer before evidence in support thereof can be received <em>(McKyring </em>agt. <em>Bull, </em>16 <em>N. Y., </em>297), yet under a general or specific denial of any part of the complaint, which the plaintiff is required to prove to maintain his action, the defendant, upon principle and authority, is' at all times at liberty td prove anything tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s allegation is untrue ( <em>Wheeler </em>agt. <em>Billings, </em>38 <em>N. Y., </em>263; <em>Greenfield </em>agt. <em>Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>47 <em>id., </em>430).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The testimony' of the parties was conflicting, and therefore presented a proper case for the jury. Plaintiff conceded that by refraining from moving for the direction of <em>a </em>verdict subject to an assessment of damages <em>(Rowe </em>agt. <em>Stevens, </em>44 <em>How., 10; S. C., </em>12 <em>Abb. N. S., </em>389).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The case having been submitted to the jury under a charge, to which no valid objection lies, and plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the refusal of the court to charge otherwise, as requested, and to the rulings of the court upon the questions of evidence that arose during the trial, appearing to be clearly untenable, the judgment and order appealed from must be severally affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Curtis and Van Vorst, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
