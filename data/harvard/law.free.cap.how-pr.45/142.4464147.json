Hill Fowler, an attorney,- to pay to Wilmerdings &amp; Mount the sum of $963 T9^-, with interest from the 14th December, 1869, and in default of such payment an attachment issue against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">On the 14th November, 1866, one Mentheim Lowenstein consigned to Wilmerdings &amp; Mount, auctioneers, a lot of merchandise, which realized, after deducting advances and expenses, $963.36. This sum Lowenstein sold and transferred to Bernard Rice. On the 27th November, 1852, Nathaniel H. Fowler and others, being the same N. Hill Fowler, recovered judgment against Lowenstein for $804.85. In 1867 proceedings supplementary were instituted against Lowenstein on the Fowler judgment, and a receiver was appointed. Wilmerdings <em>&amp; </em>Mount were served with a copy of the order of the appointment of such receiver, with notice not to pay over the money. A suit was then commenced against Wilmerdings <em>&amp; </em>Mount by Lowenstein\u2019s assignee, Bernard Rice. When the suit was commenced Fowler assured the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>attorney for Wilmerdings <em>&amp; </em>Mount that there was a good defense to the action, and furnished certain papers which tended to establish it. During the pendency of the Eice action one of the firm of Wilmerdings <em>&amp; </em>Mount was examined <em>ex parte </em>in proceedings supplemental by Fowler on his judgment and an order procured from judge Barnard that said firm pay forthwith to said Fowler the sum standing to the credit of said Lowenstein. Fowler suppressed the fact that a suit was then pending against Wilmerdings for the same sum. The action of Eice against Wilmerdings <em>&amp; </em>Mount was tried and resulted in a verdict against them. A motion was then made before judge Ingraham that Fowler pay over the money he received from Wilmerdings &amp; Mount or that an attachment issue. This motion was denied. An application was then made for a reargument on the ground that \u00a1Nathaniel H. Fowler and \u00a1N. Hill Fowler were one and the same person, and the motion was granted, and an order made that he pay the money and in default thereof an attachment issue. The defendant appealed to the general term of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\">C.

Hill Fowler obtained the money in bad faith, and by suppression of the fact that there was a suit pending against Wilmerdings &amp; Mount for the same sum he obtained from them. A party may be as guilty of a fraud by suppressing the truth as by expressing a falsehood. The fraud he perpetrated accomplished his object.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\"><em>Second. </em>In all .cases of this nature the remedy is by attachment against the attorney <em>(In the Matter of Knight, </em>1 <em>Bing., </em>91; <em>S. C., </em>8 <em>E. C. L. R., 259; In the Matter of De Wolf, </em>2 <em>Chitty, </em>68; <em>S. C., </em>18 <em>E. C. L.

The Revised Statutes declares that <em>\u201c </em>any counselor, attorney or solicitor who shall be guilty of any deceit or collusion with intent to deceive the court or any party shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the court. He shall also forfeit to the party injured by his deceit treble damages, to be recovered in a civil action (2 <em>R. S., </em>287, \u00a7 68; 2 <em>R. S., Edm. ed., </em>298, \u00a7 68).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>The case of <em>Langley </em>agt. <em>Warner </em>(3 <em>Comst. R., </em>327), which will be relied .on <em>by </em>Fowler, has no application to the case at bar. In that case the plaintiff brought an action against Warner to recover moneys that Walsh had paid over to him from a judgment which Walsh had obtained against Langley, and which judgment was afterward reversed. The question in that case was one of agency, and did not involve the question of the liability of an attorney wKo had' received moneys fraudulently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\"><em>Fifth. </em>It is submitted that the order should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\">A.

S.], 91; 18 Howard, 96; 3 <em>Sandf. R., </em>676).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\"><em>Sixth. </em>It is respectfully submitted that the order appealed from should be reversed with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-8\"><em>By the </em>Court, Gilbert, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGs\">It is testified by the attorney of Messrs. Wilmerdings &amp; Mount, and not denied by Mr. Fowler, that when the latter obtained the moneys in controversy he knew the fact that said moneys were claimed by Mr. Rice, and that an action, brought by him, against Wilmer-dings <em>&amp; </em>Mount to recover the same was then pending. There is nothing in the papers to show that Mr. Fowler had any reason to question the title of Mr. Rice to the moneys. On the contrary, it is a fact of some significance that it is not made to appear that Lowenstein, the judgment debtor, on his examination stated that the moneys belong to him. That examination is not before us, and all that appears respecting the contents of it is set forth in Mr. Fowler\u2019s affidavit, dated October 23d, 1871. The statement there is, that on the examination of the judgment debtor he stated and swore that the relators (Messrs. W. &amp; M.) had owed him the money in question. The title of Mr. Rice has been judicially established.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Mr. Fowler obtained the moneys upon an <em>ex parte </em>deposition of Thomas A. Wilmerding that there was a balance of $963.36 remaining with his firm to the credit of the judgment debtor. Mr. Wilmerding was not interrogated respecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>claim of Bice, or whether such balance was, in point of fact-, the property of the judgment debtor ,\u2022 nor did Mr. Fowler state to the justice, who made the order directing Wilmerding &amp; Mount to pay the money to him, the fact that the judgment debtor had assigned said moneys to Bice, or anything concerning Bice\u2019s claim thereto. <em>Nothing whatever is shown to justify or excuse such a \u00bfuyopression of material facts. </em>As the case is now presented, that suppression can be regarded in no other aspect than that of an imposition on the justice who made the order. In such a case there can be no question- of the power and duty of the court, by appropriate means, to compel a restitution of the moneys to the parties thus illegally deprived of them <em>(Slater </em>agt. <em>Phoenix Bank, </em>33 <em>N. Y. R., </em>25, <em>and cases cited). </em>And where the person proceeded against is an attorney, the remedy by attachment is the proper one. \u00a1No embarrassment arises from the statement of'Mr. Fowler that he has paid over the moneys to the plaintiffs. \u00a1Nor is it necessary to pass upon the legal effect of such a fact, if it existed, for Mr. Fowler is one of. the plaintiffs, and the statement would be literally true if he retained the moneys and charged himself therewith in account with his firm. It appears one Bamberger is the person entitled to receive the moneys from Fowler, and there is no pretense that, they have been paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The appeal from the order made by Mr. justice Ingbaham was waived by the motion under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Upon the whole case, therefore, we think the order appealed from should be affirmed with costs.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> The defendant appealed to the court of appeals, and on the 15th of May, 1878, the order was affirmed with costs, the court holding that the order of judge Babnabd, under which the money was paid, having been procured by fraud, was a nullify, and that an attachment was the proper remedy and applicable in such cases to any person guilty of obtaining <em>money </em>by fi'aud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
