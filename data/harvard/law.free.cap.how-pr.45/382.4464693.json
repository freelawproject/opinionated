Evidence was admitted against objection, and exception, that the sum to be paid was $250, and not $450, mentioned in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">I think this was error. While in deeds and some other instruments you may, for certain purposes, prove the considerations to be different from that expressed, it is not admissible to contradict an agreement or covenant to pay a certain sum. The case was tried upon this theory,.and by it a verdict given for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">So, too, the principle that previous oral negotiations are merged \"in the writing is a reason why such proof should not be admitted in the absence of fraud or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">2d. The oral evidence disclosed that the parties to the action between themselves fixed $450 as the sum to be paid entirely for the purpose of obtaining from another party a portion-of that sum, whereas as between themselves $250 was all that was to be paid by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">If this was true, it was a fraud which a party is not allowed to set up in defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The judgment should be set aside, new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
