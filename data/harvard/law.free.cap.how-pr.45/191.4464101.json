In rejecting this evidence the court below erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>By the laws of this state the carrying on or conducting of a business fpr the sale of lottery tickets is unlawful, and every contract made for the purpose of aiding, assisting or furthering the same is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">If, therefore, it was understood between the parties, at the time of making the agreement for the lease, that the store in question should be used and occupied by the defendant as a lottery office, and that, as would seem from the latter\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff subsequently fitted the same up with the view that it should be so used and occupied, then the lease was void and the plaintiff cannot recover under it <em>(Updike </em>agt.

The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bobietson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
