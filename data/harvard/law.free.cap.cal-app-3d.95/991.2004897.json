Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664 and 187); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>kidnaping to commit robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209) with bodily harm; and robbery in the first degree (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) with intentional infliction of bodily injury. Each contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict as to the robbery count, and that his motion for a separate trial should have been granted. Dean contends that: 1) the court erred in ordering his appearance at the preliminary hearing without adequately protecting his due process rights; 2) there was insufficient evidence to hold him for a preliminary examination; 3) his Penal Code section 995 motion should have been granted; 4) the court erred by denying his motions to exclude his trial identification by the victim; 5) the court failed to exclude codefendant Green\u2019s out-of-court statement; 6) he had a right to prevent the testimony of codefendant Green as the jury was instructed on aiding and abetting; and 7) his sentence for kidnaping and attempted murder was in violation of Penal Code section 654. Green also contends that he is eligible for parole and that the prohibition against parole must be stricken from the judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we have concluded that each judgment must be modified to stay the imposition of sentence for the attempted murder and robbery, and as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The record reveals the following pertinent facts: On the evening of November 3, 1976, shortly after 6 p.m., Mrs. Virginia Emery drove her 1976 Volkswagen bus to the juvenile hall facility in San Leandro to take some medication to her son. She parked her vehicle in the parking lot adjacent to the front entrance of the building, locked it, and returned about 15 minutes later with her keys in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">As Mrs. Emery walked around the rear of the bus, and just before she reached the driver\u2019s door, she was grabbed from behind by her hair. In the darkness, she was not able immediately to see who had grabbed her. A knife was stuck in the side of her throat, and she was addressed as a \u201chonkie bitch\u201d and instructed to open the driver\u2019s door. After she had unlocked and opened the driver\u2019s door, the inside light of the vehicle went on, and she was able to take a close look at her assailant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He got in first, pulled her into the driver\u2019s seat by the hair, and sat in the passenger seat. He continued to hold onto her hair. Then, a second man<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> climbed in through the driver\u2019s door, over Mrs. Emery, and crouched in the aisle behind the two front bucket seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>Green ordered Mrs. Emery to start the vehicle and to drive them to 98th Avenue in Oakland. She was nervous, and stalled the vehicle, but then backed up and drove down the driveway of the juvenile hall facility. Meanwhile, Dean asked Green to give him Mrs. Emery\u2019s purse which she had placed beside her on the front floorboard. Green told Dean to wait for a while before taking the purse and advised Mrs. Emery to not \u201cdo anything stupid.\u201d Dean several times repeated that he wanted the purse; Green repeatedly instructed him to \u201ccool it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">When Mrs. Emery arrived at the stop sign at the end of the driveway, she saw a third man and believed that he might be associated with her assailants. When the vehicle came to a stop, she heard the sliding door of the van open, but was not able to turn around, as Green still held her by her hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Green ordered Mrs. Emery to drive down Fairmont Boulevard, turn right, enter the MacArthur Freeway and head west toward Oakland. She drove in the right-hand lane on the freeway at approximately 50 miles per hour. Dean continued to ask for her purse and Green repeatedly indicated \u201clater.\u201d After they had driven on the freeway for some distance, Dean said: \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of her\u201d; Green did not reply. Mrs. Emery was terrified and told them that they could have the van and her purse as long as they did not kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">While she was driving, Mrs. Emery was aware that the lock and latch on the driver\u2019s door were moving as Dean manipulated them from behind her. As soon as they were open, Dean moved to the driver\u2019s seat, and pushed her out the door while Green let go of her hair and pushed her with his foot. She managed to grasp the door handle and steering wheel, but let go of the latter when the two men began smashing her fingers. Then her legs hit the ground and flipped her over and eventually she was bounced free of the vehicle and by her momentum rolled along the freeway in the slow lane. She escaped being hit by oncoming vehicles and came to a stop in the right-hand shoulder. Her purse, which contained $500 in cash, was left in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">At that time, Edmond Mikula was also driving in the slow westbound lane of the MacArthur Freeway. He saw a human body being ejected from the left side of the vehicle and managed to drive around it and avoid hitting it. He followed the Volkswagen bus and first saw one person and then a second jump from the right side of the bus onto the shoulder of the freeway. He watched the bus slow down, veer off the road, stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>tip over about 250 feet from Mrs. Emery. Mikula pulled up behind it and, after ascertaining that no one was inside, stopped another motorist to summon the police and an ambulance, and walked back to Mrs. Emery. The distance between the juvenile facility parking lot and the location where the Volkswagen bus was overturned was 1.7 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Officer Glen Ward of the California Highway Patrol responded to the call and immediately recognized Mrs. Emery as he customarily took his uniforms to her cleaning establishment. He spoke to her briefly and then retrieved her purse from the bus. At this time, Ward did not know that any crimes had been committed. When he returned, he discovered that Mrs. Emery was being attended by a physician.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ward remained at the scene for an hour and a half until a tow truck arrived to take the Volkswagen bus to the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s substation. Ward then drove directly to Fairmont Hospital and turned over custody of Mrs. Emery\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Schorr, the criminalist who was summoned immediately, and his colleague, Siam, spent five hours lifting 34 latent fingerprints from the vehicle. The following day, Barnum, a fingerprint comparison expert, positively identified as Green\u2019s one of the latent fingerprints that had been obtained from the front passenger window of Mrs. Emery\u2019s Volkswagen bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On the evening of November 3, 1976, Probation Officer Lawler was working in the kitchen of the juvenile hall complex on Fairmont Drive in San Leandro. Between 5:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., Lawler observed two black males on the patio near the kitchen doors, a place \u201coff limits\u201d to the public. When one of the two men stuck his head through the door, Lawler told him to leave and return to the administration building. From prior contacts, Lawler recognized this person as Green, but did not recognize the second man. Green and the other man left the area and walked in the direction of the administration building, located about a 10-minute walk from the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Between 5:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on the evening of November 3, 1976, Deputy Probation Officer Dunn was on duty on the first floor of one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>the dormitories of the juvenile hall facility in San Leandro. He looked out the window and saw two young men, subsequently identified as Green and Dean, walk in the direction of the dining hall; several minutes later the pair returned and entered the dormitory. After one of the men identified himself as \u201cAntone Williams\u201d and engaged Dunn in conversation for a few minutes, both left the dormitory and proceeded in a northwest direction towards the exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Several days after the incident, sheriff\u2019s officers interviewed Dunn and showed him various photographs. At that time, Dunn positively identified Green as the man who had identified himself on November 3 as \u201cAntone Williams.\u201d At trial, Dunn indicated that he was \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d that Dean was the person who had been with Green that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On November 13, 1976, Officer Scott and three other officers went to 1105 66th Avenue in Oakland to serve an arrest warrant on Green. Green was hiding in the apartment\u2019s attic crawl space and was taken into custody immediately. On the morning of November 23, 1976, Detective Tellardin of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department and three other officers went to apartment H at 1537 8th Avenue in Oakland to serve an arrest warrant on Dean. When Tellardin knocked, a woman answered and opened the door. Tellardin identified himself and told her that he was looking for Dean. The woman left and several minutes later, a black male appeared at the door. After a brief conversation, the officers were allowed to enter the back bedroom from which they had heard some unusual noises. Dean was hidden inside the closet and after being ordered out said: \u201cOK, man, you got me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Dean was then taken to the sheriff\u2019s substation, advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and made a statement admitting his participation in the crimes. He admitted that he got into the Volkswagen van with the intent of stealing Mrs. Emery\u2019s purse. His statement was edited to excise all references to Green, and as so edited, was read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We turn first to defendants\u2019 contention concerning the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment and verdict as to robbery. Each maintains that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the requisite dominion and control of Mrs. Emery\u2019s vehicle and purse to constitute a taking within the meaning of Penal Code section 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The above summary of the facts indicates that there is ample substantial evidence to support the first degree robbery conviction of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Green and Dean. The uncontroverted evidence established that Mrs. Emery was compelled, at knife point and while Green held onto her hair, to drive her vehicle a certain distance and was then forcibly thrown out of the vehicle. The vehicle and her purse were left with defendants who had dominion over both. Thus, a sufficient time interval elapsed for a \u201ctaking\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, </em>25 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 [102 Cal.Rptr. 71]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>274 Cal.App.2d 170, 174 [79 Cal.Rptr. 18]). In <em>Price </em>and <em>Martinez, supra, </em>the courts were presented with a substantially identical factual situation and noted that robbery does not necessarily entail the robber\u2019s manual possession of the loot. All that is required is that the robber acquire dominion over it, although the distance is very small and the property is moved by a person under his control, including the victim. Thus, the completed offense of robbery was committed and there is no merit to Green\u2019s contention that he could be found guilty only of attempted robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Dean, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 672 [33 Cal.Rptr. 383], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 383 [19 Cal.Rptr. 839], also argues that the completed offense of robbery was not committed in this case because the robbers were unable to \u201cescape with the loot\u201d to a \u201cplace of temporary safety.\u201d <em>Masters </em>and <em>Phillips, supra, </em>however, pertain to the issue of when liability for the robbery <em>terminated, </em>and the term \u201ccompleted\u201d was used only in that different sense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d, p. 580). No authority supports his contention that liability for the \u201ccompleted\u201d offense of robbery (as opposed to a mere attempt) does not <em>commence </em>until the robber has escaped with the loot to a place of temporary safety. Rather, the law is well settled to the contrary. No extended asportation is required for the offense to pass from the attempt stage to the consummated offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>274 Cal.App.2d, p. 174; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d pp. 577-578; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 909 [100 Cal.Rptr. 493]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 526, 548 [90 Cal.Rptr. 866], which distinguish <em>Masters, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 672, on this very ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The contention that the court erred in denying each defendant\u2019s motion for severance<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is equally without merit. Given the state of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>record, we are left without any indication as to the grounds for severance argued below.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 860, at page 862 [76 Cal.Rptr. 193]: \u201c\u2018For an appeal to engage the consideration of an appellate court, it must be brought up on a record which, in addition to being otherwise formally sufficient, shows the error calling for correction. Such error is never presumed, but must be affirmatively shown, and the burden is upon the appellant to present a record showing it, any uncertainty in the record in that respect being resolved against him.\u2019 This basic rule is a corollary of the equally fundamental principle that all presumptions and intendments are in favor of the regularity of the action of the lower court in the absence of a record to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We note that defendants were jointly charged. The charges depended upon common evidence, and their defenses, contrary to their contentions, were not in conflict since each merely tried to minimize his role in forcing the victim out of the vehicle. Accordingly, the denial of each motion<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to sever was proper and did not constitute an abuse of discretion (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1098; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romo, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 976, 984 [121 Cal.Rptr. 684]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>13 Cal.App.3d 608, 617 [91 Cal.Rptr. 643]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>276 Cal.App.2d 547 [81 Cal.Rptr. 16]).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In view of the absence of particular grounds, we need not discuss in detail each of the alleged evidentiary matters that required severance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>There was here no \u201cprejudicial association\u201d of defendants (see e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie, </em>66 Cal.2d 899 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869]). Given Dean\u2019s complete confession, the evidence against both defendants was equally strong; their culpability in all three crimes was mutual and not disproportionate. Furthermore, neither had a criminal background, a reference to which might have prejudiced the other. Contrary to Dean\u2019s contentions, there were no <em>Aranda </em>problems as to him, and there was not the slightest confusion as to the culpability of each defendant for each of the three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\"> We turn next to Dean\u2019s contentions that the superior court erred in denying his Penal Code section 995 motion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as: 1) there was insufficient evidence of his identity adduced at the preliminary hearing to hold him to answer; 2) the in-court identification by Mrs. Emery was tainted as it was unduly suggestive; and 3) there was insufficient evidence of his specific intent to steal as to the robbery. The latter contention has already been disposed of above and need not be rediscussed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">As to the identification procedures at the preliminary hearing, the record indicates that on June 6, 1976, counsel for each defendant indicated that he wanted his client to be absent to avoid identification by Mrs. Emery on the record. Accordingly, each defendant personally waived his right to be present during the preliminary examination. The magistrate ruled preliminarily that both defendants could be absent during Mrs. Emery\u2019s initial examination, but reserved deciding whether or not she could be given an opportunity to view and identify defendants, after they had had an opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">After Mrs. Emery testified and was cross-examined, the magistrate heard additional arguments from defense counsel about their motion to prevent an in-court identification. Both defendants expressly refrained from requesting that an in-court lineup be conducted and the prosecution noted this fact. Ultimately, the magistrate ruled that the People were entitled to have the victim identify the perpetrators in open court in order to meet their evidentiary burden, notwithstanding the fact that the circumstances of the courtroom identification were indeed suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>Then both defendants were brought back into the courtroom and Mrs. Emery proceeded to make identifications of both men. When Dean\u2019s counsel moved to strike her in-court identification, the magistrate denied the motion and observed that he was aware of no case law that \u201crequired me to hold that the presence of the defendants at the preliminary examination is <em>impermissibly </em>suggestive\u201d (italics added). Thereafter, the magistrate grant\u00e9d the request of both defense counsel for a continuance of the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">When the preliminary hearing resumed on January 25, 1977, Dean\u2019s counsel renewed his motion to strike Mrs. Emery\u2019s in-court identification. Again, his motion was predicated on the unduly suggestive nature of the in-court identification, although, as indicated above, he had affirmatively declined to request a lineup to avert any prejudice flowing from the confrontation. He argued that since the defense had no \u201cburden\u201d to request a lineup, necessarily it was the duty of the prosecutor to do so if he intended to go forward with an identification in open court. The magistrate again denied the motion to strike, indicating that she believed herself powerless to order a lineup on her own motion over the objection of counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing on January 25, 1977, the magistrate rejected the arguments of counsel regarding the sufficiency of the evidence and held both defendants to answer on all the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We think that the magistrate did not err in permitting the victim to identify her assailants at the preliminary hearing. The People had a right to adduce evidence pertaining to the identity of the perpetrators of the crimes in the form of the in-court identification testimony of the eyewitness-victim in order to meet their evidentiary burden in the proceeding. Contrary to Dean\u2019s argument below, he had no right to <em>waive </em>his presence at the preliminary hearing. Penal Code section 977, subdivision (b) provides, so far as pertinent: \u201cIn all cases in which a felony is charged, the accused <em>must </em>be present. . . during the preliminary hearing. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Italics added.) In any event, the People were empowered to compel defendant\u2019s presence in court for the purpose of adducing evidence of identity sufficient to support a resulting holding order by the magistrate (cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 872, 1331-1332).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">A defendant\u2019s appearance at the preliminary hearing is analogous to giving real or physical evidence and therefore beyond the purview of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>the privilege against self-incrimination and also does not violate any due process rights (cf. <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Tyars, </em>23 Cal.3d 131, 139 [151 Cal.Rptr. 653, 588 P.2d 793]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 544, 552 [134 Cal.Rptr. 566]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Breckenridge, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d 913, 936 [125 Cal.Rptr. 425]).  If a criminal defendant <em>anticipates </em>that an in-court identification may be suggestive, he has a readily available remedy to avert any prejudice expected to result from the courtroom showup procedure: he may demand that a lineup be conducted preliminary to any in-court identification <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>11 Cal.3d 617, 625 [114 Cal.Rptr. 121, 522 P.2d 681]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vallez, </em>80 Cal.App.3d 46, 56 [143 Cal.Rptr. 914].)  However, where, as here, a defendant knowingly and deliberately <em>rejects </em>the preliminary availability of a lineup as a tactic merely to forestall a legitimate identification by a victim in court, objections should be deemed as waived. Here, Dean was well aware prior to the in-court identification made by Mrs. Emery on January 6, 1977, of his right to request a lineup. He specifically refused to exercise this right. Consequently, he should not be heard to complain now that the identification at the hearing made by Mrs. Emery was tainted by the suggestiveness of the circumstances in the courtroom. We hold that both the magistrate and the superior court properly concluded that the identification procedure in question did not violate Dean\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">As to the sufficiency of the evidence, Dean argues that Mrs. Emery\u2019s identification of him at the preliminary hearing was not certain \u00abenough to provide the magistrate with probable cause to believe that Dean was one of the perpetrators of the crimes. This claim, likewise, is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Mrs. Emery\u2019s testimony, set forth below,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was the only evidence of Dean\u2019s identity adduced at the preliminary hearing on January 6 and January 25.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>The applicable rules relating to the review of holding orders were concisely summarized in <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court, 67 </em>Cal.2d 471, at page 474 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197], as follows: \u201cEvidence that will justify a prosecution <em>need not be sufficient to support a conviction. </em>[Citations.] \u2018 \u201cProbable cause is shown if a man of ordinary caution or prudence would be led to <em>believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused.\u201d </em>\u2019 [Citations.] An information will not be set aside or a prosecution thereon prohibited <em>if there is some rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it. </em>[Citations.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-4\">\u201cA reviewing court may not substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence for that of the magistrate, and, <em>if there is some evidence to support the information, the court will not inquire into its sufficiency.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">All legitimate inferences must be drawn in favor of the information <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dickinson, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d, 320-321). Applying these rules to Mrs. Emery\u2019s above quoted testimony, we conclude that there was some rational ground for believing that Dean was one of the perpetrators of the offenses on Mrs. Emery. Accordingly, Dean\u2019s section 995 motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Dean also contends that the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to prevent his in-court identification by Mrs. Emery at trial. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The record indicates that a hearing on Dean\u2019s motion was held on April 18, 1977. At that hearing, Mrs. Emery indicated that she was then not certain of her preliminary hearing identification of Dean as the second assailant. She had only been able to get two brief glimpses of him: the first, before she entered the van; the second as he climbed into the van' over her and got behind her. She had no opportunity to turn around and look at him as the first person who sat in the passenger seat was holding her by the hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Under these circumstances, the court below properly concluded that since Mrs. Emery now was <em>unable </em>then to make an in-court identification of Dean, there was no prospective evidence for the court to exclude or suppress. The record also indicates that while Mrs. Emery positively identified Green at trial as the first man who wielded the knife and held her hair, she was unable, and made no effort, to identify Dean as the second assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>Dean next argues that the trial court erred by permitting his edited confession to be received in evidence at the trial. He urges that his statement was not properly admitted pursuant to the <em>coconspirator </em>exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1223); and also that the admission of the edited version pf the confession was improper pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, 530-531 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], as it was not possible to effectively delete the material that implicated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">As to Dean\u2019s first argument, the record indicates that Dean\u2019s confession was offered by the People against Dean as an admission and not as a statement of a coconspirator. Thus, Dean\u2019s analogies and argument predicated on <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>15 Cal.3d 419 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296], and Evidence Code section 1223 are inappropriate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">As to his <em>Aranda </em>contention, Dean does not specify what material in the edited confession should not have been presented.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, in the context of the instant case, the \u201ceffective deletion\u201d rule on which Dean relies does not pertain to him as he is the declarant. The rule inures to the benefit of Green, the codefendant, who had the constitutional right to exclude references to him in Dean\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Dean further complains that he was prejudiced by Green\u2019s testimony at trial. He particularly points to Green\u2019s cross-examination in which the prosecution at length asked Green about Dean\u2019s involvement in the crimes. Dean asserts that this cross-examination violated his rights, and contends that: a) under the circumstances, the trial court should have prevented Green from testifying on his own behalf; b) the court should have given a limiting instruction <em>sua sponte </em>on accomplice testimony; c) Green\u2019s testimony on his own behalf, which also inculpated Dean, was not adequately corroborated and, therefore, cannot sustain a conviction against Dean; d) Green should not have been allowed to answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>questions only about Dean\u2019s participation in the crimes; and e) most of Green\u2019s testimony on cross-examination should have been excluded as being beyond the scope of direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Preliminarily, we note that Dean\u2019s contentions border on the frivolous since Green\u2019s right to testify in his own behalf was guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as well as article I, section 15 of the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Contrary to Dean\u2019s argument, no <em>sua sponte </em>cautionary instruction on accomplice testimony (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111) was required about codefendant Green\u2019s testimony. The record indicates that Green\u2019s testimony <em>was not offered or relied upon by the prosecution </em>but rather by the defense. Thus, such a cautionary instruction would have severely prejudiced Green\u2019s own case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>2 Cal.3d 362, 398-399 [85 Cal.Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961]). We also note that no cautionary instruction was requested by Dean at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The record also reveals that Green\u2019s testimony implicating Dean in the crimes was adequately corroborated by all of the evidence pertaining to Dean and by the People in their case-in-chief. Aside from Dean\u2019s confession, there was the testimony of Dunn, who saw Dean at juvenile hall with Green shortly before the commission of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Furthermore, Green, a percipient witness to all of the events surrounding the crimes, was qualified to present evidence solely about Dean\u2019s role and participation. Green\u2019s personal observations were relevant to numerous material factual issues at trial and possessed immense probative value on all material issues (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 210, 351).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The record also does not support Dean\u2019s assertion that Green\u2019s responses on cross-examination were beyond the scope of his direct testimony.  Once Green had voluntarily discussed the circumstances of the commission of the crimes on direct, the prosecution was entitled to explore the identical subject matter- in much greater detail (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 761, 773, subd. (a)). The record also indicates that no objections on this ground were made by Dean. Thus, Dean has no basis for raising this matter for the first time on appeal (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Next we note that the People, with commendable objectivity, concede that the judgment as to each defendant must be modified to conform to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>the prohibition against double punishment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654). Accordingly, we deal with this issue summarily. The record reveals that the court sentenced each defendant to a term in state prison on each of the (three) counts: attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 664), kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)), and robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). The record indicates that execution of each prison sentence imposed on the attempted murder and robbery counts was stayed; no stay was imposed as to the sentence for the aggravated kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The People concede that all three crimes were part of one indivisible transaction and that the primary criminal objective of each defendant was to rob the victim of her purse and vehicle.  Accordingly, the kidnaping and the attempted murder were incidental to the robbery and were perpetrated to facilitate a successful getaway with the proceeds of the robbery. Thus, the superior court erred by imposing prison sentences as to each of the three convictions, even though the execution of the attempted murder and robbery terms was stayed <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laster, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 381, 393-395 [96 Cal.Rptr. 108]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Panky, </em>82 Cal.App.3d 772, 781-784 [147 Cal.Rptr. 341]; contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>Guevara, </em>88 Cal.App.3d 86, 91 [151 Cal.Rptr. 511]). The proper procedure, pursuant to Penal Code section 654 is to stay <em>imposition </em>of sentence as to two of the convictions, with the stay to become permanent upon the completion of the sentence imposed as to the third conviction <em>(Panky, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.3d at pp. 783-784). Accordingly, each judgment of conviction must be modified to stay imposition of sentence as to the convictions for attempted murder and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">However, Dean is wrong in urging that the court also should have stayed the sentence for the attempted murder and kidnaping convictions, and sentenced him only for the robbery. The sentence established for the aggravated kidnaping conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)), life without possibility of parole, was more onerous than that established either for the robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 213, two, three, four years), or the attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 664, five, six, seven years). Dean was entitled to have imposition of sentence stayed as to the <em>less </em>onerous of the multiple terms of imprisonment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laster, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d, p. 395; <em>People </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 348, 359 [125 Cal.Rptr. 855]). As the term for the aggravated kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209) was the most severe, the court properly did not stay the sentence on the kidnaping count.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Finally, we turn to Green\u2019s contention that he is entitled to have the prohibition against parole stricken from the judgment pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.2<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as to the aggravated kidnaping count. As the instant offenses were committed on November 3, 1976, the defendants were sentenced pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which provided a punishment of life imprisonment without possibility of parole if the victim of the kidnaping or robbery suffered bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Subsequently, Penal Code section 209 was amended (effective Aug. 11, 1977) so that after that date, kidnaping for the purpose of robbery is punishable by \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for life <em>with </em>possibility of parole\u201d (italics added). Thus, the existence of bodily injury is no longer a factor relevant to punishment for the base offense. The language of Penal Code section 1170.2, subdivision (e), quoted below,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> clearly indicates that as to parole eligibility, the new reduced penalty for section 209 convictions is to be applied retroactively. Accordingly, if the instant kidnaping had been committed after July 1, 1977, defendants would have suffered for their convictions of aggravated kidnaping a penalty of life imprisonment <em>with </em>possibility of parole. Thus, they are entitled to such a mitigation of their respective ISL sentences which precluded the possibility of parole under the then applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">However, the judgments here need not be modified to reflect defendants\u2019 eventual <em>eligibility for parole </em>pursuant to the new sections 209 and 1170.2, subdivision (e). <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, </em>74 Cal.App.3d 425 [141 Cal.Rptr. 442], held at page 427, that Penal Code section 1170.2, subdivision (e) is to be implemented solely by the CRB. As indic\u00e1ted above, the abstracts of judgment do not mention parole eligibility and, therefore, require no <em>correction. </em>If and when the CRB fails to properly apply the section to defendants\u2019 terms for aggravated kidnaping, habeas corpus is available to them. It follows that they are not entitled to relief from this court at this time (see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gonzales), </em>78 Cal.App.3d 134, 137-140 [144 Cal.Rptr. 89]).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>Each judgment of conviction is modified to stay imposition of sentence as to the convictions for attempted murder and robbery, with the stay to become permanent upon the completion of the sentence imposed as to the kidnaping conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Panky, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.3d, pp. 783-784).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">As so modified, each judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Rouse, J., and Miller, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Appellants\u2019 petitions for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied September 12, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\">As separate notices of appeal were filed, the matter was assigned two separate numbers in this court: Dean, No. 17209, and Green, No. 17021.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">At the trial, Mrs. Emery positively identified the man with the knife as defendant Green.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Although Mrs. Emery was unable to positively identify the second assailant at the trial, other evidence indicated that he was codefendant Dean.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Mrs. Emery, who was 47 years old at the time of the accident, sustained multiple fractures of her pelvis and legs and other parts of her body.

We assume that oral motions were made as 1) the trial court alluded to them on April 18, 1977. Presumably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>the motions were heard either on the afternoon of April 18, 1977, or the morning of April 19, 1977; 2) just before noon recess on April 20, 1977, the trial court stated \u201cthat motion is denied\u201d with reference to the joint motion for severance. The clerk\u2019s minutes indicate that the court and counsel conferred in chambers from noon until 4 p.m. on April 18, 1977. On April 20, 1977, the court ruled from the bench that \u201cDefendants\u2019 motions to sever trial <em>is </em>denied.\u201d From the use of the plural we assume that: a) a severance motion was made by each defendant; b) the singular verb was an oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\">On the basis of a handwritten notation dated \u201c4/19/77\u201d on the edited version of Dean\u2019s confession, Green urges that his severance motion was founded upon <em>Aranda </em>objections to use of the edited statement in a joint trial. Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>66 Cal.2d 536, 558 [58 Cal.Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908], he attempts to argue that certain ambiguities in the statement could have been interpreted by the jury to implicate him. However, an examination of the edited statement read to the jury by the People at trial reveals that there is not only no mention of Green personally as a coparticipant in the crimes, but also no reference to any other perpetr.ator. Thus, the argument as to an <em>Aranda </em>error as to Green is without merit (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 102, 151 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romo, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 984; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>36 Cal.App.3d 676, 680-681 [111 Cal.Rptr. 772, 58 A.L.R.3d 594]) and the court properly denied Green\u2019s motion to sever <em>(People </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 299, 307 [89 Cal.Rptr. 1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">While the rulings of the magistrate at the preliminary hearing are not directly reviewable on appeal from the judgment of the superior court (Pen.

At the April 18, 1977, hearing, Mrs. Emery was much less certain of her identification of Dean and the superior court duly noted that fact (cf. <em>People </em>v.
