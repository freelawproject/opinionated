In such a case, the interrogatories and request should be vacated rather than pruned, as it is counsel\u2019s burden to draft and serve proper interrogatories and demands, and the courts will not correct palpably bad ones <em>(see, e.g., Martino v Mid-Island Hosp., </em>73 AD2d 592; <em>Itzkoff v Allstate Ins. Co., </em>59 AD2d 854; <em>Cramp v Cramp, </em>114 AD2d 835). Mangano, J. P., Bracken, Weinstein, Lawrence and Kooper, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
