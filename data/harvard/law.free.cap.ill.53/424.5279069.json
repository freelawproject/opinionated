Jurisdiction in chancery. Under a law requiring the proceedings, notices and\u2019 ordinances of a city to be published in the newspaper printed in the German language having the largest daily circulation, the common council of the city designated a certain newspaper for that purpose. The i proprietors of another newspaper, claiming to be entitled to the printing under the law in question, filed their bill in chancery praying an injunction against the city authorities and the designated newspaper, in respect to the matter of the printing, and praying for general relief in the premises: Held, that while there might be grave doubts whether a court of chancery would take jurisdiction for the mere purpose of compelling the proper execution of such law, on the part of the common council, yet having acquired jurisdiction for a purpose clearly within the province of that court, that of awarding an injunction\", it might retain the bill for the purpose of ascertaining and enforcing all the rights of the parties properly involved in the subject' matter in controversy.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-11\" pgmap=\"428(21) 429(58)\">This is an application of \u201c The Illinois Staats-Zeitung Company,\u201d for a writ of mandamus, to compel the common council of the city of Chicago to designate the German newspaper printed and published by the said company in the city of Chicago, and known as \u201c The Illinois Staats-Zeitung,\u201d to publish the proceedings, notices and ordinances of said city and the departments thereof, as fully as they are required to be published in the corporation newspaper.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429\">The alleged right sought to be enforced, arises under a law requiring the matters mentioned to be published in the newspaper printed in the German language having the largest daily circulation.

Stiles, for the respondents.</attorneys><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\" pgmap=\"430\">Assuming that the law requires the publication of the ordinances, etc. to be made in the German newspaper having the largest circulation, the only tribunal empowered by the legislature to \u201c designate\u201d such newspaper, is the common council. It has already discharged that duty, and has designated a newspaper other than the one represented by the relator. Mandamus will not lie to compel the common council to annul or reverse its decision. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad v. Wilson, 17 Ill. 128; Chase v. Blackstone Canal Com. 10 Pick. 244; Strong, Petitioner, 20 Pick. 848; Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Peters, 513.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430\">The act of the common council in designating the newspaper having the largest circulation, required the exercise of judgment and discretion, and the duty thus to be discharged was of a judicial and not of a ministerial character. In such cases mandamus will not lie. People v. Pierson and cases cited, 2 Scam. 204 j People v. City of Rochester, 21 Barb. 656; People v. The Contracting Board, 27 N. Y. 381; Same v. same, 33 N.
