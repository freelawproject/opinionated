Shank v. Nichols, 49 Ill. 517, that the board of supervisors, in exercising their power of equalizing assessments between the different towns of the county, must add or deduct the same per cent upon all the real estate in any one township. This is decisive of the present case. See, also, State v. Allen, 43 Ill. 456.</p> <p id=\"b482-12\" pgmap=\"482\">Another fatal objection to the judgment is, that the record shows no notice by the collector of his intended application for judgment.</p> <p id=\"b482-13\" pgmap=\"482\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
