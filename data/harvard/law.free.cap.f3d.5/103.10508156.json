Joseph Rankin (Rankin) alleges that Appellant used excessive force on him while he was an inmate in the Harris County Jail. Gregory Pinkins (Pinkins), a Deputy Sheriff in Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>County, Texas, asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity from Appellee\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit. We hold that the district court erred in applying <em>Hudson v. </em>McMillian<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the second prong of the bifurcated inquiry into Pin-kins\u2019 qualified immunity defense, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Rankin was incarcerated at the Harris County Jail in 1986. He was placed in a large holding cell with 150-200 other inmates awaiting court appearances. A group of female prisoners passed in front o'f the holding cell, and the inmates therein began shouting and otherwise creating a disturbance. Deputy Pinkins attempted to'restore order to the holding area, so that the processing of the inmates could continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Rankin alleges that Pinkins singled him out from the others in the holding cell and forcibly removed him. The ensuing events are disputed; however, Rankin contends that Pinkins placed him in a \u201ccompliance hold,\u201d slammed him against a wall and the jail\u2019s floor, handcuffed him and \u201cstomped\u201d on his back and legs. Rankin suffered injuries to his knee, throat and a finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Appellee filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. Appellant moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) he did not apply excessive force to Appellee; and, (2) he was entitled to qualified immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The court initially indicated that it would grant Pinkins\u2019 motion, but delayed .ruling until Appellee responded. Rankin, in his response, moved to stay the proceedings pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), <em>rev\u2019g </em>929 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir.1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court agreed, and stayed the, proceedings. After the Supreme Court decided <em>Hudson, </em>Pinkins renewed his motion for summary judgment. The court denied it and Pinkins timely appealed. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2814, 2815, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (rulings which deny qualified immunity are appealable under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d exception to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">When Pinkins filed his petition for review, he also requested that the district court stay the \u00a7 1983 action pending this appeal. The district court granted this motion. In the stay order the court explained that it had denied Pinkins\u2019 summary judgment request based on the standards announced <em>in Hudson. </em>R. 901. Pinkins now appeals, arguing that the court should have evaluated his defense under the law in place at the time of the incident instead of retroactively applying <em>Hudson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">In assessing a claim of qualified immunity, we engage in a bifurcated analysis., <em>See Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 305 (5th Cir.1992). First, we determine whether the plaintiff has \u201callege[d] the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u201d <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). If so, we then decide if the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable, because \u201c \u2018[ejven if an official\u2019s conduct violates a constitutional right, he is entitled to qualified immunity if the conduct was objectively reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>Spann v. Rainey, </em>987 F.2d 1110, 1114 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Salas, </em>980 F.2d at 310). Because this matter was resolved by summary judgment, \u201c[o]ur review is plenary accepting the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Salas, </em>980 F.2d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-22\">Appellee has alleged that Pinkins used excessive force against him, -thereby violating his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. R. 7. At the outset, we note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that Appellee, at the time of his incarceration, had not yet been convicted of the crime with which he was charged (forgery). Generally, this would require us to review his claim as one alleging a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation, in light of his status as a pretrial detainee. <em>See, e.g. Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1872, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (pretrial conditions or restrictions that amount to \u201cpunishment\u201d implicate due process concerns). However, at the time of his arrest, Rankin was on parole from the Texas Department of Corrections, where he was serving his sentence for an earlier burglary conviction. <em>See </em>R. 108-09 (Rankin deposition). This would seem to warrant review under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See, e.g. Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1088, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986) (Eighth Amendment is primary source of protection against the official use of force on convicted prisoners).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In <em>Valencia v. Wiggins, </em>981 F.2d 1440 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 113 S.Ct. 2998, 125 L.Ed.2d 691 (1993), we were confronted with a an excessive force claim brought by a pretrial detainee who had been confined for three weeks. The plaintiff-detainee was involved in a small-scale disturbance, and alleged that a guard used excessive force on him in attempting to squelch the ruckus. The <em>Valencia </em>court, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhHz\">[W]hen a court is called upon to examine the amount of force used on a pretrial detainee for the purpose of institutional security, the appropriate analysis is that announced in <em>Whitley </em>and <em>Hudson: </em>whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering depends on \u201cwhether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcE\"><em>Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1446 (quoting <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 995, 998, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Both <em>Whitley </em>and <em>Hudson </em>are Eighth Amendment cases involving convicted prisoners; however, the <em>Valencia </em>court concluded that these cases provided the proper framework for analyzing a pretrial detainee\u2019s excessive force claim, when the force was applied in an effort to preserve institutional security: \u201c[I]t is impractical to draw a line between convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees for the purpose of maintaining jail security.\u201d 981 F.2d at 1446. The court found further guidance from Hudson\u2019s intimation \u201cthat many of [the Supreme Court\u2019s] concerns in <em>Whitley </em>were not limited to Eighth Amendment claims but \u2018arise <em>whenever </em>guards use force to keep order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1446 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 112 S.Ct. at 996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">The instant case fits squarely into the holding of <em>Valencia. </em>We are reviewing a detainee\u2019s claim stemming from force applied when a jailer attempted to restore institutional order. Even if our review hinged upon Appellee\u2019s parolee status, the same standards would govern our analysis. Appellee had been detained for approximately two weeks when the incident with Deputy Pinkins occurred. Additionally, at the time of the incident Pinkins was attempting to restore order to the holding cell area. We conclude that the Eighth Amendment is the proper benchmark against which Rankin\u2019s claim should be analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Having identified what constitutional criteria govern Appellee\u2019s claim, we look to see if he has alleged a constitutional violation. We must utilize currently applicable constitutional standards to make this assessment. <em>See Spann v. Rainey, </em>987 F.2d 1110, 1115 (5th Cir.1993) (applying Fourth Amendment excessive force standards announced in <em>Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir.1989) (en banc), to incident which occurred in 1987); <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>929 F.2d 1014, 1015 (5th Cir.1990) (applying Eighth Amendment excessive force standards announced in <em>Huguet v. Barnett, </em>900 F.2d 838 (5th Cir.1990), to incident which occurred in 1983), <em>rev\u2019d </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-19\">Pinkins urges that the district court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>have applied <em>Shillingford v. </em>Holmes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in analyzing whether or not Appellee\u2019s complaint sufficiently stated a constitutional violation. <em>Shillingford </em>articulated this court\u2019s standard governing excessive force claims at the time Pinkins allegedly injured Rankin. <em>See Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in its retroactive application of <em>Hudson </em>to the first prong of his qualified immunity defense is without, merit: \u201cOur conclusion that <em>Whitley </em>and <em>Hudson </em>provide the correct standard for excessive force suits brought by pretrial detainees means that this Circuit\u2019s test in <em>Shillingford </em>has no continuing force.\u201d <em>Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1447; <em>accord Shabazz v. Lynaugh, </em>974 F.2d 597, 598 (5th Cir.1992) (remanding dismissal of prisoner\u2019s excessive force claim for reconsideration in light of Hudson); <em>Tijerina v. Plentl, </em>958 F.2d 133, 138 (5th Cir.1992) (vacating judgment entered after jury trial and remanding case after Hudson). Consequently, to state an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim, a prisoner (or pretrial detainee engaged in disrupting institutional security), must show that force was applied not \u201cin a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,\u201d but rather that the force complained of was administered \u201cmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 112 S.Ct. at 999 (citing <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)); <em>see Valencia </em>981 F.2d at 1446.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">In this case, the district court concluded that the summary judgment evidence was \u201cat least sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact on each of the <em>post-Hudson </em>elements essential to Rankin\u2019s claim.\u201d R. 904. The court analyzed Appellee\u2019s claim using the <em>Johnson v. </em>Morel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> factors, sans the requirement that the injury be \u201csignificant.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These factors roughly parallel those we announced in <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>962 F.2d 522, 523 (5th Cir.1992), after that case was remanded from the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because of the plenary nature of our review, we turn to an evaluation of the <em>Hudson </em>factors, \u201caccepting the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 305 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\"><em>Hudson </em>removed the \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d injury requirement we previously held necessary to show an Eighth Amendment violation. \u201cThe absence of serious injury is therefore relevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, but does not end it.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 112 S.Ct. at 999. Rankin claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that Pinkins\u2019 actions either caused or aggravated a knee injury, which ultimately led to corrective surgery. Appellee also sought treatment for an injury to his throat, and complains that his finger was injured in the melee. In cases <em>post-Hudson, </em>\u201c[c]ertainly <em>some </em>injury is still required.\u201d <em>Spann, </em>987 F.2d at 1115 n. 7. Appellee\u2019s injuries suffice to meet this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Appellant asserts that action was needed to restore order to the holding cell area. In his deposition testimony, Pinkins stated that he ordered Rankin from the holding cell in order to squelch the disruptive activity. R. 523. He further testified that Appellee\u2019s hostile motions necessitated a forceful response. Needless to say, Appellee paints a different picture of this encounter, and offers evidence in support of his contentions. This factor, along with <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>third and fourth components (the relationship between the need and force used, and the threat reasonably perceived by Pinkins), are dependent on a fact-sensitive inquiry and credibility determinations. Because we must draw factual inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, we agree with the district court that summary judgment is not a proper vehicle for the resolution of these disputed issues. As for the final <em>Hudson </em>factor, another officer did order Rankin removed from Pinkins\u2019 control, after he observed Pinkins shove Rankin \u2014 who by this time was handcuffed \u2014 into the cement wall a second time. While this did \u201ctemper the severity of a forceful response,\u201d it tends to indicate that, initially at least, unnecessary force may have been used against Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Again, because this matter is before us following denial of summary judgment, we make no intimations regarding the correctness <em>vel non </em>of either party\u2019s factual assertions. Reviewing these allegations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, it is clear that, under the controlling standards announced in <em>Hudson, </em>Appellee has stated a claim for violation of a constitutional right. <em>See Spann, </em>987 F.2d at 1115; <em>Shabazz, </em>974 F.2d at 598; <em>Hudson, </em>962 F.2d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from civil liability, \u201cas long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); <em>see Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1447. In evaluating this second prong of the bifurcated inquiry into qualified immunity, we part from the subjective intent standard of <em>Hudson (i.e. </em>was the force applied maliciously or sadistically to cause harm). \u201cWhether a defendant asserting qualified immunity may be personally liable turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s actions assessed in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Mouille v. City of Live Oak, 918 </em>F.2d 548, 551 (5th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. at 3038).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">When evaluating whether a plaintiff stated a constitutional violation, we looked to currently applicable constitutional standards. <em>See Spann, </em>987 F.2d at 1115; <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>929 F.2d 1014, 1015 (5th Cir.1990), <em>rev\u2019d </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). However, \u201c[t]he objective reasonableness of an official\u2019s conduct must be measured with reference to the law as it existed at the time of the conduct in question.\u201d <em>Mouille, </em>918 F.2d at 551 (citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)); <em>see Spann, </em>987 F.2d at 1115; <em>Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1448.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">In July 1986, our standard for Eighth Amendment excessive force claims was <em>Shillingford v. Holmes, </em>634 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1448. In <em>Shillingford, </em>we held that to maintain an excessive force claim a plaintiff had to prove that the official\u2019s actions \u201ccaused severe injuries, was grossly disproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances and was inspired by malice rather than merely careless or unwise excess of zeal so that it amounted to an abuse of official power that shocks the conscience.... \u201d <em>Shillingford, </em>634 F.2d at 265; <em>accord Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir.1989) (en banc) (replacing the \u201csevere\u201d injury element with \u201csignificant\u201d injury component).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">In assessing Pinkins\u2019 qualified immunity defense, the district court retroactively ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>plied <em>Hudson </em>to both prongs of the inquiry\u2014 1) whether Appellee presented a constitutional claim, and 2) the objective reasonableness of Appellant\u2019s conduct. As stated, the court should have reviewed the objective reasonableness of Pinkins\u2019 conduct under the standards announced in <em>Shillingford, </em>which was the constitutional benchmark for excessive force claims in 1986. Because the district court did not make factual findings under the <em>Shillingford </em>standards, and because the outcome of such an inquiry is not obvious from the record on appeal, we remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We are not unmindful that the bifurcated qualified immunity analysis leads to a somewhat schizophrenic approach; <em>i.e. </em>the application of <em>Hudson </em>to the question of constitutional violation coupled with the application of <em>Shillingford </em>to the objective reasonableness question, even though <em>Hudson </em>jettisoned Shillingford\u2019s severe injury element.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this is the proper framework to apply. <em>See Spann, </em>987 F.2d at 1114; <em>Valencia, </em>981 F.2d at 1448-49; <em>Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 305 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Mouille, </em>918 F.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Accordingly, we VACATE the order denying Appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and REMAND this case for further proceedings. Specifically, the district court should evaluate the objective reasonableness of Pinkins\u2019 actions with reference to the law that existed at the time of the events in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Motions to file record excerpts in excess of 40 pages and to file supplemental letter briefs are GRANTED; all other motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">. - U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), rev\u2019g 929 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\">.
