We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">Tom Hunt owns a small independent insurance agency which sells State Farm insurance policies. After working for Hunt for fifteen years, Marlene Deal was discharged by him. Deal sued Hunt and State Farm alleging that the discharge violated Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">Hunt and State Farm moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction arguing that they were not \u201cemployers\u201d within the meaning of Title VII or the ADEA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hunt argued that he was not an \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII or the ADEA because he never employed the requisite number of employees. State Farm contended that it could not be Deal\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d because there was no employment relationship between it and Deal. The district court granted the motions. Deal appeals claiming that the district court erred because (1) she is an employee of State Farm and (2) Hunt is an agent of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">Deal\u2019s first contention is that State Farm was her employer. In determining whether an employment relationship exists within the meaning of Title VII and the ADEA, we apply a \u201chybrid economic reali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ties/common law control test.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>906 F.2d at 1019 (citing <em>Mares v. Marsh, 777 </em>F.2d 1066 (5th Cir.1985)). The right to control an employee\u2019s conduct is the most important component of this test. <em>Fields, </em>906 F.2d at 1019. When examining the control component, we have focused on whether the alleged employer has the right to hire and fire the employee, the right to supervise the employee, and the right to set the employee\u2019s work schedule. <em>See Id. </em>at 1020; <em>Mares, 777 </em>F.2d at 1068. The economic realities component of our test has focused on whether the alleged employer paid the employee\u2019s salary, withheld taxes, provided benefits, and set the terms and conditions of employment. <em>See Mares, 777 </em>F.2d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">State Farm did not control Deal, and the economic realities of her relationship with State Farm did not suggest an employer/employee relationship. Hunt was solely responsible for hiring, supervising, and firing her and setting her work schedule. Deal was also dependent on Hunt as a matter of economic reality because he paid her salary, withheld taxes from her paycheck, provided her benefits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and established the terms and conditions of her employment. Therefore, Deal had an employment relationship with Hunt, not State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In support of her contention that she is an employee of State Farm, Deal refers to an employee handbook which Hunt provided to his employees. The handbook states, \u201cWe are committed to comply with all federal and state statutes and regulations.\u201d Deal contends that \u201cwe\u201d refers to Hunt and State Farm. Other than her eonclusory assertions, she offers no evidence to support her argument. Even if \u201cwe\u201d referred to Hunt and State Farm, this would not be sufficient to establish an employment relationship between State Farm and Deal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Deal\u2019s second theory of jurisdiction is that Hunt is an agent of State Farm. Title VII and the ADEA define \u201cemployer\u201d as a person who has a certain number of employees and any agent of such person. Although Hunt is a State Farm insurance agent, he is not an agent of State Farm within the meaning of Title VII and the ADEA. We agree with the other courts that have addressed this issue and hold that an agent under Title VII. and the ADEA must be an agent with respect to employment practices. <em>See York v. Tennessee Crushed Stone Ass\u2019n, </em>684 F.2d 360, 362 (6th Cir.1982) (finding that an \u201cagent\u201d for the purposes of Title VII and the ADEA is limited to supervisory or managerial employees to whom employment decisions have been delegated by an employer); <em>Fike v. Gold Kist, </em>514 F.Supp. 722 (N.D.Ala.) (holding that Title VII requires an \u201cagency relationship which establishes an employment nexus\u201d), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>664 F.2d 295 (11th Cir.1981); <em>Konieczny v. Derickson, </em>43 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 251, 1987 WL 56671 (S.D.Ill.1987) (holding that a State Farm insurance agent is not an agent within the meaning of Title VII). Because Hunt was solely and independently responsible for all employment related decisions, he was not acting as State Farm\u2019s agent with respect to employment practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">For the forgoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Deal\u2019s claims is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\">; Deal named the following State Farm companies: State Farm County Mutual Insurance Company of Texas, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm General Insurance Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, State Farm Lloyds Insurance Company, and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. We refer to these companies collectively as \"State Farm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-13\">. The ADEA defines employer as \u201ca person ... who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year [and] any agent of such a person.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b). Title VII defines an employer as \"a person ... who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-22\">Determining whether a defendant is an \"employer\u201d under Title VII or the ADEA involves a two-step process. First, the defendant must fall within the statutory definition. Second, there must be an employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. <em>See generally, Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>906 F.2d 1017, 1019 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1026, 111 S.Ct. 676, 112 L.Ed.2d 668 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. When selecting a retirement and medical plan for himself and his employees, Hunt chose State Farm insurance products. Deal incorrectly argued that this meant that State Farm provided her benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-23\">. <em>Cf. Mares, </em>777 F.2d at 1069 (stating that \"the mere fact that [commissary workers] must comply with certain Army regulations is not enough to make them employees of the Army\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
