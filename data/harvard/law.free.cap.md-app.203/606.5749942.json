Whether the circuit court erred in entering declaratory judgment in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s claims for an easement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">II.

Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in striking appellant\u2019s second and fourth amended complaints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">IV. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s claims without ruling on appellant\u2019s motions to compel discovery?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer each question in the negative and shall, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">This case concerns appellant\u2019s claim of entitlement to an easement to access property he owns in Sandy Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. The property is a two acre lot which appellant purchased on September 27, 2002, for $40,000. On October 1, 2002, appellant recorded a quitclaim deed for the property. Gold Mine Road lies to the north of appellant\u2019s property, and Brooke Road lies to the south. Appellant alleges entitlement to an easement identified as Farm Road, running in a northerly direction from Brooke Road across his property and continuing northward through a Commission conservation easement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> until its termination at Gold Mine Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Appellant claims that Farm Road, his means of ingress and egress to the property <em>(i.e. </em>how he reached Gold Mine Road and Brooke Road), was blocked, thereby depriving him of access to his property and landlocking the property. According to appellant, Farm Road is a \u201chistoric right-of-way\u201d or an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Before the circuit court, in the third amended complaint, appellant alleged that Brown and his attorney, Alper, hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the MHG Group to conduct a survey and prepare subdivision plans and record plats for the Dellabrooke subdivisions that were allegedly prepared inaccurately and failed to include Farm Road. Appellant alleged that Farm Road\u2019s access to Gold Mine Road \u201cwas permanently cut\u201d in 1994, with the initial approval of Brown\u2019s subdivisions, and that northward access of Farm Road to Gold Mine Road was prohibited, in 2001, with approval of the Dellabrooke subdivisions and the \u201crecordation of Plat 21707.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MHG prepared Plat 21707 and according to appellant, \u201cdid not include or recognize the Farm Road and related rights-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">On June 9, 2006, appellant filed a Complaint for Equitable Relief and Declaratory Judgment Granting an Easement and Action to Quiet Title Based on Adverse Possession.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the complaint, appellant alleged that the Commission and its predecessor, the Montgomery County Department of Planning, \u201cacted impermissibly, by in effect abandoning the Historic Chandlee Mill Road Lalso identified as Farm Road] and rendering [appellant] landlocked, without recording any appurtenant easements for properties affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">On November 8, 2006, appellant filed an amended complaint, alleging that he had employed a professional land surveyor who concluded that a \u201chistoric right-of-way does indeed exist as the \u2018Old Chandlee Mill Road\u2019 that has been described as the \u2018Farm Road\u2019 in various deeds.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant alleged entitlement to an \u201ceasement by prescription\u201d or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201ceasement by necessity under the common law.\u201d On December 7, 2006, the Commission filed an answer to the amended complaint, raising several affirmative defenses, including lach-es, estoppel, waiver, and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On September 21, 2007, appellant filed a second amended complaint, adding Brown, the Commission Group, and the MHG Group, among others, as defendants<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and causes of action \u201cbased upon recently obtained evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In a section labeled \u201cOverview,\u201d appellant alleged that he \u201crecently learned the events that led to [] lost ingress/egress access and other property rights were caused by a series of fraudulent acts perpetrated in a concert of action among the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On September 27, 2007, Christine Hill filed a motion to strike the second amended complaint, urging the circuit court \u25a0 to strike the complaint for failure to comply with Maryland Rule 2-303.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendants, including the Commission, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Areys, Alper, Hanson, Daniel, Hamer, Crawford, the MHG Group, Wright, Johnson, Krasnow, the Messes, and Gardner joined in and filed motions to strike the second amended complaint. Other defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint, including the Maryland Department of the Environment, arguing that appellant failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Local Government Tort Claims Act (LGTCA), and Brown, arguing that appellant\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Appellant filed oppositions to many of the motions to strike and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On January 30, 2008, McCants &amp; Associates filed an answer to the second amended complaint, a cross-claim against the defendants, and a motion to file the answer and cross-claim out of time. The Commission Group, Johnson, and Alper each moved to strike the cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On March 13, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions to strike and dismiss the second amended complaint. During the hearing, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">The aspect of this case that stands out, from my perspective, at this point is the current posture of the pleadings and that primarily is the second amended complaint ..., which is 58 pages and names a number of individuals, causes of action against individuals. And in reviewing the motions to strike, it\u2019s clear to me that the 58-page second amended complaint does violate Rule 2-303 in that it includes argument, unnecessary recitals of law, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">I don\u2019t like striking complaints because I just think in essence it prolongs the inevitable, but in this instance, given the contents of the paragraph contained within the second amended complaint that there is an overriding interest to have the complaint conform with the pleadings\u2019 require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ments\u2014and I certainly will give [appellant] an opportunity to amend[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">After hearing argument from counsel, the circuit court granted the motions to strike the second amended complaint, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">Since [appellant] is being required to file a third amended complaint in the requirement will be that that third amended complaint is to comply with the rules that govern pleading, that it is to be simple, concise, and direct, contain only such statements of fact as may be necessary to show the pleaders\u2019 entitlement to relief. And that the third amended complaint will supersede all previous complaints that have been filed and will operate as the complaint in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">So, I\u2019m going to grant the motions to strike the second amended complaint. I\u2019m going to defer on the motion to dismiss with respect to the statute of limitations pending the filing of the third amended complaint. I\u2019m going to establish a new set of dates within which events must take place and, essentially, this operates as a new scheduling order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The third amended complaint is to be filed by March 28th.</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">On March 13, 2008, consistent with its oral ruling, the circuit court issued a Nunc Pro Tunc Order providing, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">1. The Motion to Dismiss [Appellant\u2019s] Second Amended Complaint filed by the Defendant, State of Maryland Department of Environment ... is GRANTED; and [Appellant\u2019s] Second Amended Complaint is DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">4. Defendants\u2019 Motions to Strike [Appellant\u2019s] Second Amended Complaint filed by Defendant Christine Hill [], Maryland Capital Park and Planning Commission [ ], Paul and Sara Arey [ ], Richard Alper [ ], Douglass Riggs and Marcis Hendricks and Glascock, PA [ ], Royce Hanson, <em>et al. </em>[], Warren Brown [], Audrey Hill [], Gwen Wright [], Milton Johnson [ ], Rose Krasnow [ ], Charles and Marilyn Mess [ ], and Adrian Gardner [ ] are GRANTED, without Prejudice with Leave to Amend by filing a Third Amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Complaint by March 28, 2008 which complies with Maryland Rule 2-308(b); and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">ORDERED, that the Third Amended Complaint supersedes all previous Complaints as the only operative Complaint requiring responses from the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Third Amended Complaint and Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On March 28, 2008, in compliance with the circuit court\u2019s ruling, appellant filed a third amended complaint for the purpose of \u201cadding additional Defendants based upon recently obtained evidence and [ ] providing a consolidated pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The nine counts set forth in the second amended complaint remained in the third amended complaint. Christine Hill and the Commission Group moved to dismiss the third amended complaint, arguing that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The MHG Group moved to dismiss the third amended complaint, arguing that appellant\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations or, in the alternative, that the MHG Group did not owe a duty of care to appellant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">On June 17, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on the pending motions. Following argument, the circuit court dismissed the third amended complaint, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">The defendants have filed a motion, several motions, to dismiss the third amended complaint that\u2019s been filed, which is actually the fourth complaint that\u2019s been filed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The legal proceedings in this case began, the initial filing, in June of 2006. There have been subsequent defendants added, subtracted; amendments have been made. The Court has granted leave to make the amendments to the complaint; to comply with the rules of the pleading. And the defendants are making a motion to dismiss on the substantive basis that the statute of limitation precludes [appellant\u2019s] claim with respect to Counts 3 through 9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The undisputed facts in this case reveal that on January 11, 2001, plat 21707 was recorded. The undisputed facts reveal that [appellant] took title to the[] property, which was subsequently recorded on October 1st, 2002. The law is clear that [appellant was] on notice at the time that [he] took title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">As to what is contained in the[ ] actual chain of title, even if [he] had not seen it, heard it, or imagined that it existed, accordingly the statute of limitations applies to Counts 3 through 9 in [the] third amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">In addition, the local government Tort Claims Act applies with respect to the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss. With respect to [the MHG Group], there was a failure to state a claim against those defendants based upon a lack of duty owed by those defendants to [appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">The remaining issues before me with respect to Counts 1 and 2, and that is the failure to state a claim in the third amended complaint. The difficulty that I\u2019m having is that this has been a torturous proceeding. The remaining defendants that would apply to those counts need to be on notice as to what it is they are alleged to have done so that they can respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">I have reviewed the third amended complaint in an effort to make that determination. To determine whether or not there is sufficient allegations contained within the third amended complaint that would permit the remaining defendants to respond to the causes of action that have been alleged against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I can\u2019t find that there are sufficient causes of action that have been alleged in the amended complaint. I can\u2019t find that there is relief that\u2019s being sought against those defendants for any causes of action that they are alleged to have done. Accordingly, I am going to grant the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim with respect to Counts 1 and 2 of the third amended complaint without leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On June 17, 2008, the circuit court issued Orders consistent with its oral ruling, including: (1) an Order granting the Commission Group\u2019s motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice, without leave to amend; (2) an Order granting the MHG Group\u2019s motion to dismiss the third amended complaint \"with prejudice; (3) an Order granting Christine Hill\u2019s motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice; (4) an Order granting Audrey Hill\u2019s motion to dismiss the third amended complaint as to the claims asserted against her; (5) an Order granting Milton Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the case against him with prejudice; (6) an Order granting Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice; and (7) an Order granting the Areys\u2019 motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">On July 7, 2008, appellant filed a motion to alter or amend. On August 6, 2008, the circuit court issued an Order denying the motion. On September 5, 2008, appellant noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">On September 30, 2009, this Court issued an Order remanding the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County without affirmance or reversal, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">It appears from the record of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in the above-captioned matter that appellants\u2019 third amended complaint requested the circuit court to \u201cdeclar[e] the existence of an express ... easement from the Bacon\u2019s [sic] property to Brooke Road and/or Goldmine Road, as identified in Exhibit 1, and order that this easement shall be the ingress/egress for the Plaintiffs,\u201d or, \u201cin the alternative order that the Plaintiffs possess landlocked property and that an implied easement by neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>sity along the Farm Road ... is the ingress/egress for the Plaintiffs\u2019 property....\u201d Some, but not all, defendants filed motions to dismiss appellants\u2019 amended complaint. On June 17, 2008, after a hearing on the motions to dismiss appellants\u2019 amended complaint, the circuit court (Rupp, J.) dismissed all claims against the movants. In that oral ruling, the court specified dismissals as to certain movants and then dismissed the case as to \u201cthe remaining defendants,\u201d and the docket reflects a dismissal as to the \u201cremaining defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">It further appears that defendant McCants <em>&amp; </em>Associates, allegedly joined in an earlier complaint as a necessary party by virtue of ownership of property along the Farm Road in question, filed a cross-claim in response to that earlier complaint. The docket does not reflect an adjudication of that cross-claim. Appellant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and noted that the record did not contain orders as to all parties. The court denied the motion on August 7, 2008, and Appellant noted this appeal on September 5, 2008. The appellant and some appellees have filed briefs in this Court, and the appeal is presently scheduled for argument on October 7, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">The oral ruling and docket entry dated June 17, 2008 do not conform to the principle that a trial court should declare in writing the rights of all parties who properly seek declaratory relief. <em>Griffin v. Anne Arundel County, </em>25 Md.App. 115, 137 [333 A.2d 612], <em>cert. denied </em>275 Md. 749 (1975); <em>Secure Financial Service, Inc. v. Popular Leasing USA Inc., </em>391 Md. 274, 281 [892 A.2d 571] (2006) (\u201c[W]hen entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment.\u201d). Additionally, the record does not reflect a final judgment as to the cross-claim filed by McCants and Associates and does not reflect a clear intention by the court to dismiss appellants\u2019 claims against each party who had not moved for dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Until the circuit court addresses the claim for declaratory relief and adjudicates the cross-claim, neither the orders entered on June 17, 2008 nor the order entered on August 7, 2008 is a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602. Since those orders are not certified under subsection (b), they are not yet appealable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">It is, therefore, this 30th day of September, 2009, by the Court of Special Appeals, on its own initiative,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">ORDERED, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-604(d), that the case is hereby remanded to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, without affirmance or reversal, for further proceedings, including, without limitation, a declaration of the respective rights of the parties and adjudication of all of the claims in the action in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-602. Each party is to bear its own expenses in the above-captioned matter; and it is further ORDERED that following the declaration of the rights of the parties on remand, any aggrieved party may note an appeal to this Court and may file a motion in this Court for waiver of filing fees as to that appeal. The parties may also file a motion in this Court to use the briefs and record extracts filed in No. 1616, September Term, 2008, and to be permitted to file supplemental memoranda addressing only the judgment on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">(Alterations and omissions in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">On April 6, 2010, in response to the remand order, the circuit court held a hearing and discussed the remand order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">This order doesn\u2019t express any views one way or the other on the merits. It just says basically we keep telling the Circuit Courts in declaratory judgment cases to enter a piece of paper that says declaratory judgment. It doesn\u2019t matter who wins. Just set out what with the rest of the party, do it, and then we\u2019ll look at it and tell you whether you messed it up or not. That\u2019s what they told me to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvI\">At the hearing, the circuit court directed the parties to submit proposed \u201cforms of declaratory judgment\u201d with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>third amended complaint, within forty-five days, by May 21, 2010, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">[L]et\u2019s assume that the operative pleading is the third amended complaint. Let\u2019s assume that Judge Rupp dismissed all of the claims in there, which he apparently did for the reasons that you all think he did it. Submit your proposed declaratory judgments in respect to the third amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">And each side will incorporate in its proposed form of declaratory judgment the rulings that it believes Judge Rupp made or the rulings it wishes Judge Rupp had made, and brief it. I will read it. And if we need to do anything else we\u2019ll be in touch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">On May 21, 2010, appellees filed responses in accordance with the circuit court\u2019s directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The Fourth Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">On May 21, 2010, appellant filed two pleadings: (1) a Fourth Amended Complaint for Equitable Relief and Declaratory Judgment and Damages<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (2) a Motion for Declaratory Judgment as to Counts I, II and III of [Appellant's Verified Fourth Amended Complaint for Equitable Relief and Declaratory Judgment. The fourth amended complaint contained eleven counts, adding two counts not included in the third amended complaint\u2014Count Three for Declaratory Relief, alleging that appellant had an implied easement by prescription, and Count Eleven for Injunctive Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">On June 8, 2010, the Commission Group filed a motion to strike the fourth amended complaint and a motion for declaratory judgment, arguing that the filing of the amended complaint and motion \u201c[was] undertaken without leave of the Court, and without citation to any legal authority.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Commission Group argued that pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322(c), if the court orders dismissal of an action, a party may only file an amended complaint with express leave of the court to amend, and, in this case, no such leave was given.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On June 15, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions and discussed the remand order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Well, as I read the entirety of [the remand order], as I read it that the panel was of the view that the case was not in a posture before them to decide the merits. And that what they were sending it back to the Circuit Court for was number one, to enter a declaration consistent with Judge Rupp\u2019s rulings, and two, to dispose of, resolve, make final decisions on any ancillary matters such as the hanging cross-claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court granted the motion to strike the fourth amended complaint, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The motion to strike is granted for three reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">Number one, as I read the directions from the Court of Special Appeals that in the main, they\u2019ve indicated quite clearly that the Circuit Court was to do a number of things so that there was a final judgment that could be properly reviewed. And that was the purpose for the remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">Number two. While the Court of Special Appeals was being polite to the Circuit Court in saying, well, we\u2019re not tying your hands, the notion, I\u2019ve read enough remand orders I think in my life both as a trial Judge and as a lawyer to know what they mean. So without being presumptuous as to what the panel members were subjectively thinking, it\u2019s clear to me based on their jurisprudence of the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals is that they have gotten the message from the Court of Appeals, and they are no longer willing to expend their judicial resources reviewing cases, making decisions, only to be told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>by the Court of Appeals there is no final judgment. So they\u2019ve now made it clear to the trial Court, give me a final judgment, then we\u2019ll do our job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">Those two reasons. Actually there are four reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">The third reason is that when Judge Rupp who had the case before me granted the motion to dismiss, he did not grant leave to amend.

In <em>Sharp, </em>with Judge Ellen L.

In other words: \u201cA dominant tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate that benefits from an easement\u2019; a servient tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate burdened by an easement.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">... [T]here are several ways to create an easement. \u201cAn easement may be created by express grant, by reservation in a conveyance of land, or by implication.\u201d An express easement, whether by grant or reservation, must be created by a written memorandum that satisfies the Statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Frauds; and \u201ca right[] of way created by deed\u201d must satisfy \u201c \u2018the mode and manner prescribed by the recording statutes.\u2019 \u201d... \u201cAn express easement by reservation often arises when a property owner conveys a portion of his property to another, which would otherwise render the retained part inaccessible, so the reservation permits a right-of-way.\u201d In contrast, an easement by implication \u201c \u2018may be created in a variety of ways, such as by prescription, necessity, the filing of plats, estoppel and implied grant or reservation where a quasi-easement has existed while the two tracts are one.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61,13 A.3d 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">(2) Express Easements</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In <em>Kobrine v.

[W]e limited that requirement to rights of way created by deed and held that a right of way, otherwise sufficiently described, could validly be created by a memorandum that complied with the Statute of Frauds, <em>ie., </em>a writing signed by the party to be charged or that party\u2019s authorized agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">In interpreting an instrument creating an express easement, the Court of Appeals outlined the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">\u201cIn construing the language of a deed, the basic principles of contract interpretation apply. The grant of an easement by deed is strictly construed.... The extent of an easement created by an express grant depends upon a proper construction of the conveyance by which the easement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>created----\u201cThe primary rule for the construction of contracts generally\u2014and the rule is applicable to the construction of an easement\u2014is that a court should ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made, if that be possible.\u201d ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cA court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intend it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give [way] to what the parties thought the agreement meant or intended it to mean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em>White v.

The doctrine of easement by necessity is based upon public policy, which is favorable to full utilization of land and the prescription that parties do not intend to render land unfit for occupancy. The public policy exists in recognition that to allow a landlocked parcel inadvertently to be created affects not only the initial owner of that parcel, but every subsequent owner as well. By cutting off the land from all access to public ways, landlocking a parcel renders the land unuseable for virtually any future purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyS\"><em>Sharp, </em>197 Md.App. at 166-67, 13 A.3d 1 (citations, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In <em>Stansbury v.

The Court of Appeals observed, however, that the evidence \u201csuggested that complainants could acquire access to the county road by a rear route\u201d by constructing a bridge over the creek in the rear of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 41 A.2d 66. The Court noted that complainants had acquired a parcel of land adjacent to the parcel in dispute, which provided another means of access to the county road by way of a 10-foot road. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that where a grantee of an implied easement by necessity \u201cacquires a new way to the estate previously reached by the way of necessity, the way of necessity is thereby extinguished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321-22, 41 A.2d 66 (citation omitted). The Court stated it would \u201cnot recognize a way of necessity if another road to the public highway c[ould] be made without unreasonable expense, even though the other road may be much less convenient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 41 A.2d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In <em>Johnson v.

Johnson eventually signed the deed, but the deed failed to include a reservation for an express easement. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 338 A.2d 88. The chancellor determined that if Johnson had an easement, it would have been an implied reservation easement by necessity, \u201cas she [sought] a right of way across property which she conveyed for the benefit of property which she retained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 338 A.2d 88.

The Pipers, owners of an approximate fifteen acre tract in Frederick County recorded a plat establishing two one-acre lots, bisected by a roadway designated as \u201cGeorge Street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683-83, 484 A.2d 630.

The Pipers conveyed the two lots bounded by George Street to others, in deeds that referenced the Piper Estates plat, and then conveyed the remainder of their interest in the original fifteen acre tract to the Bouchers. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 484 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>A.2d 630. The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cBouchers ha[d] an implied easement over George Street by virtue of the reference in their deed to the Piper Estates plat, which depicts George Street as a right of way to their property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 484 A.2d 630. The Court stated that \u201ca deed that is silent as to the right of way but refers to a plat that establishes such a right of way creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the right of way in the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 484 A.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">D.

In entering declaratory judgment, the circuit court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Review of the express terms of [appellant\u2019s] Deed\u2014which was prepared by [appellant] Gregg Bacon\u2014reflects no language express detailing an ingress/egress easement. A further review of the Third Amended Complaint reveals no averments of any express language contained in any deed or record of title specifically creating an ingress/egress easement servicing [appellant\u2019s] property. In the absence of any averments establishing a prima facie claim for an express easement, the Court must declare the absence of an ingress/egress easement servicing [appellant\u2019s] property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">As the Court of Appeals has held, an express easement can be created only through a written instrument containing \u201cthe names of the grantor and grantee, a description of the property sufficient to identify it with reasonable certainty, and the interest or estate intended to be granted.\u201d <em>Kobrine, </em>380 Md. at 636, 846 A.2d 403 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of the third amended complaint, the Lawrence Map, and appellant\u2019s deed reveals that appellant has not alleged the existence of a written instrument expressly granting or reserving an easement over Farm Road for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>property. In the third amended complaint, appellant alleges that there is an express easement \u201cidentified by way of the deed reference to Farm Road that traverses [appellant\u2019s] property[,]\u201d that \u201cFarm Road is referenced on numerous deeds, and shown on historic tax maps along with a historic survey[,l\u201d and that his \u201cchain of title ... show[s] an express easement.\u201d Neither the Lawrence Map nor appellant\u2019s deed to his property includes any express language granting or reserving an easement over Farm Road servicing appellant\u2019s property. The fact that other deeds between other parties may have referenced Farm Road as a boundary or that historic tax maps showed Farm Road, as appellant alleged in the third amended complaint, does not create an express easement for appellant\u2019s property.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Absent \u201caverments of any express language contained in any deed or record of title specifically creating an ingress/egress easement servicing [appellant\u2019s] property[,]\u201d we agree with the circuit court that appellant does not have an express easement for ingress and egress over Farm Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">(2) Implied Easement by Necessity</p>\n<p id=\"afl-dedup-0\">Upon review of the third amended complaint and the record as a whole, we conclude that the circuit court properly entered declaratory judgment in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s claim for an implied easement by necessity. In granting declaratory judgment, the circuit court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>appellant was required to \u201cplead three elements\u201d in order \u201c[t]o establish a prima facie claim for an implied easement by necessity]/]\u201d The circuit court outlined the elements set forth in <em>Stansbury, </em>390 Md. at 489, 889 A.2d 403, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">A review of the Third Amended Complaint demonstrates that [appellant] sought to have the ingress/egress easement impinge upon or cross approximately 16 separate parcels of property identified in Exhibit 1 to the Third Amended Complaint [the Lawrence Map]. [Appellant] failed to plead: (1) that these 16 parcels initially had unity in title; (2) how unity in title amongst the 16 parcels was severed; and/or (3) how the usage of the ingress/egress easement was necessary, at the time of the severance of the unity in title for each property, for [appellant\u2019s] predecessor in title to access the subject property. In the absence of any averments establishing a prima facie claim for an implied easement by necessity, the Court must declare the absence of an ingress/egress easement servicing [appellant\u2019s] property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">From our review, the \u201cSecond Count\u201d in the third amended complaint includes three paragraphs alleging an implied easement by necessity. In none of the paragraphs has appellant alleged any of the three elements required for finding an implied easement by necessity. In the \u201cSecond Count,\u201d appellant alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">46. [Appellant] incorporate^] by reference all paragraphs in this pleading as if fully set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">47. That [appellant] do[es] not have access to the[ ] land. That [appellant is] landlocked if the Court holds that [appellant] do[es] not possess an express easement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">48. In the alternative, [appellant] assert[s] the[ ] claim to a right-of-way under Maryland common law, which allows for this Court to order an easement by necessity as equitable relief for a landlocked parcel of real property such as [appellant\u2019s].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">As the Court of Appeals has noted: \u201cGrants of easements by implication are looked upon with jealousy and are construed with strictness by the courts.\u201d <em>Condry, </em>184 Md. at 321, 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>A.2d 66. As the circuit court observed, appellant failed to allege, for example, unity of title, how unity of title was severed, and that usage of the ingress/egress easement was necessary at the time of severance. Although appellant argues in a reply brief that the Lawrence Map shows unity of title, appellant did not state so in the third amended complaint. Assuming we were to agree that the Lawrence Map shows unity of title, appellant has still failed to plead facts demonstrating the two other elements necessary for creation of an implied easement by necessity as outlined in <em>Stansbury, </em>390 Md. at 489, 889 A.2d 403-how unity of title was severed and that the ingress/egress easement was necessary at the time of severance of the unity of title. We cannot read into the third amended complaint the facts necessary to substantiate a claim for an implied easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the circuit court erred by \u201cfailing to <em>presume </em>the existence of an easement\u201d is unconvincing. A trial court is not required or permitted to presume the existence of an implied easement by necessity where a party has not demonstrated the circumstances necessary to establish such an easement. \u201c[A]n implied easement is based on the presumed intention of the parties at the time of the grant or reservation^]\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 688, 484 A.2d 630 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the circuit court failed to apply \u201cdirect precedent\u201d is similarly unpersuasive. A review of the holdings in <em>Condry, Johnson, </em>and <em>Boucher </em>demonstrates that the cases are obviously distinguishable from this case and support neither appellant\u2019s claim of an easement by necessity nor the claim of an express easement. The issue in <em>Condry, </em>184 Md. at 321-22, 41 A.2d 66 was whether the complainants had another access route to a county road, in which case an implied easement by necessity over a private road on defendants\u2019 property would have been extinguished. In this case, appellant has not pled or established facts sufficient to infer the existence of an implied easement by necessity. <em>Johnson, </em>26 Md.App. at 581-82, 338 A.2d 88, involved two parties who had been in contact with one another for many years, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>that prior to signing a deed, the purchaser had \u201cadequate notice of the existence of an easement\u201d across his property. In this case, there are no facts demonstrating that appellant and another party have been in consistent contact such that the other party had \u201cadequate notice\u201d of an existence of an implied easement by necessity over Farm Road servicing appellant\u2019s property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 694, 484 A.2d 630, the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of an implied easement established by a plat reference, not an implied easement by necessity. Although appellant references Plat 21707, appellant does not claim that the plat provides him with an easement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we agree with the Commission Group that the circuit court properly granted declaratory judgment in favor of all appellees as to appellant\u2019s claims for an express and implied easement as appellant failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201cto establish a prima face case sustaining his two legal theories of an ingress/egress easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">II. The Statute of Limitations and the MHG Group\u2019s Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A. Appellant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"A3v\">(1) Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing his tort and constitutional claims on the ground that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Appellant argues that he learned of the \u201cconcert of action to alienate [his] property rights\u201d in August 2007, and that he timely filed the second amended complaint weeks later. Appellant maintains that the circuit court incorrectly assumed that Plat 21707 was in his chain of title. According to appellant, Plat 21707 is \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>and irrelevant,\u201d and the circuit court erred in finding that appellant should have been aware of the content of the plat and was on notice as to potential claims as early as 2001, upon recording of the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Alternatively, appellant argues that, assuming he learned of the \u201cconcert of action to alienate [his] property rights at the inception of the scheme, the tort is ongoing in nature and continues[.]\u201d According to appellant, \u201cthe time period for bringing a cause of action in [this] case is three years from the date that [a]ppellant knew, or should have known of the tort (in this case August 2007) or <em>three years after the injury ceases, or when [ajppellant is allowed the full enjoyment, use and access of his property.\u201d </em>Appellant contends that appel-lees\u2019 intentional concealment of the existence of Farm Road continues to this day and that, prior to filing suit, he did not \u201chave any reason or cause to believe that the deeded description of Farm Road in [his] chain of title was extinguished by the acts of [a]ppellees.\u201d In his brief, appellant maintains that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until 2007, when Christine Hill blocked access on Farm Road<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the second amended complaint filed September 21, 2007, was filed within the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in granting a blanket dismissal as to all appellees as appellees who did not assert the defense of statute of limitations, in an answer, \u201cmust be deemed to have waived the defense[J\u201d Alternatively, appellant maintains that dismissal on the ground of the statute of limitations is \u201cgenerally considered inappropriate in equity cases where there are allegations of fraud and/or negligence[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">(2) The MHG Group\u2019s Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Relying on <em>Carlotta v. T.R. Stark &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>57 Md.App. 467, 470 A.2d 888 (1984), appellant argues that the MHG Group owed him an implied duty of care to complete an accurate survey. Appellant maintains that the MHG Group\u2019s failure to include Farm Road in the survey \u201cmust be considered a breach of a standard of care to the public, including [a]ppellant.\u201d Alternatively, appellant argues that the MHG Group\u2019s actions are so grievous that they create an immediate apparent duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">B. The Commission Group\u2019s Response<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The Commission Group responds that the circuit court properly dismissed the tort and constitutional claims on the ground that the statute of limitations expired prior to the filing of appellant\u2019s complaint. According to the Commission Group, the circuit court \u201cproperly invoked the January 11, 2001 filing date of Record Plat 21707 as notice to [a]ppellant of the accrual of his constitutional and tort claims when he took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>title to the property on October 1, 2002.\u201d The Commission Group maintains that Record Plat 21707, contained in the public land records, is in appellant\u2019s chain of title. According to the Commission Group, the applicable statute of limitations for the constitutional and tort claims is three years, and the statute of limitations in the case expired on October 1, 2005, as \u201c[ajppellant was clearly on actual or constructive notice as of October 1, 2002, the date he took title to his property, of any harm or injury to the alleged express easement, the [Fjarm [R]oad, caused by Record Plat 21707.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">C. Brown\u2019s Response</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Brown responds that the circuit court correctly dismissed the claims against him based on the statute of limitations. Brown argues that the \u201conly date specifically referenced in the Third Amended Complaint with regards to [his] alleged actions is 1994[,]\u201d or alternatively, Plat 21707 filed on January 11, 2001, both of which occurred \u201cmore than six years before [a]ppellant[ ] named [him] as a defendant^]\u201d Brown argues that the statute of limitations for appellant\u2019s claims of fraudulent concealment, deceit, civil conspiracy, and trespass to land is three years and that the statute of limitations for appellant\u2019s claim of slander of title is one year. Brown contends that the statute of limitations has not tolled under either the fraudulent concealment doctrine or the continuing tort doctrine because Plat 21707 is recorded in the public land records and, as such, the regular limitations periods apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Relying on <em>Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677 (1981), Brown contends that the facts alleged in the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>amended complaint \u201cclearly demonstrate \u2018knowledge of circumstances which ought to have put a person or ordinary prudence on inquiry!.]\u2019 \u201d According to Brown, the statute of limitations as to claims against him expired in 1997, as the third amended complaint\u2019s allegations demonstrate that appellant \u201cwould have been on inquiry notice (if not actual notice) of the alleged actions of Mr. Brown when the northern access to Gold Mine Road was \u2018permanently cut\u2019 \u201d in 1994. Alternatively, Brown maintains that appellant was on notice of all of the facts concerning the property at the time of its purchase in 2002, and that the statute of limitations expired\u2014at the latest\u2014in 2005, before appellant filed a claim against him in 2007.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">D. The MHG Group\u2019s Response</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The MHG Group responds that the circuit court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s claims on the ground of the statute of limitations because \u201cthe limitations period running on claims based on the denial of north access to Gold Mine Road !] expired in 2004, at the very latest!,]\u201d and appellant failed to file a claim against the MHG Group until September 2007, after the statute of limitations had expired. Relying on <em>Bright v. Lake Linganore Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>104 Md.App. 394, 656 A.2d 377 (1995), the MHG Group argues that a property owner is assigned \u201ccomplete knowledge of a chain of title ... irrespective of the owner\u2019s actual knowledge of the same!,]\u201d and accordingly, appellant was on notice when he purchased the property in 2002. Relying on <em>Carlotta, </em>57 Md.App. 467, 470 A.2d 838, the MHG Group contends that they owed no duty to appellant because under Maryland law, \u201ca surveyor of a disputed boundary line does not owe a duty of care to a non-reliant third party adjacent landowner. A surveyor, therefore, cannot be held liable to such a plaintiff.\u201d At oral argument, the MHG Group argued that the requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>a surveyor in Maryland be licensed does not create a duty to adjoining property owners who did not rely on the work completed by the surveyor.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Relying on Maryland Rule 2-321(c), the MHG Group contends that they \u201cdid not waive the[ ] limitations defense\u201d as they \u201cwere not required to file an Answer\u201d until fifteen days after entry of a court order on a motion to dismiss. The MHG Group maintains that they timely filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">E. Standard of Review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">When considering on appellate review the grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">a court must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>ie., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Upon appellate review, the trial court\u2019s decision to grant such a motion is analyzed to determine whether the court was legally correct.

Pishvaian, </em>402 Md. 572, 584, 937 A.2d 233 (2007), the Court of Appeals explained the continuing harm theory as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">This Court and the Court of Special Appeals have recognized the \u201ccontinuing harm\u201d or \u201ccontinuous violation\u201d doctrine, which tolls the statute of limitations in cases where there are continuous violations. Under this theory, violations that are continuing in nature are not barred by the statute of limitations merely because one or more of them occurred earlier in time.... \u201c[C]laims that are in the nature of a \u2018continuous tort,\u2019 such as nuisance, can extend the period of limitations due to their new occurrences over time[.\u201d] Continuing violations that qualify under this theory are continuing unlawful acts, for example, a monthly over-charge of rent, not merely the continuing effects of a single earlier act. LThe] \u201c \u2018continuing tort doctrine\u2019 requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that a tortious act\u2014not simply the continuing ill effects of prior tortious acts\u2014fall within the limitation period[.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYyW\">(Footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">(c) Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"aup-dedup-0\">The defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted may be asserted in a motion to dismiss filed before the answer pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322(b). If the defense is not asserted in a preliminary motion to dismiss, the \u201cdefense[ ] and objection[ ] may be' made in the answer, or in any other appropriate manner after answer is filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The general time for filing an answer to a complaint is \u201cwithin 30 days after being served[.]\u201d Md. Rule 2-321(a). An automatic extension is granted, however, \u201c[w]hen a motion is filed pursuant to Rule 2-322[.]\u201d Md. Rule 2-321(c). In that case, \u201cthe time for filing an answer is extended without special order to 15 days after entry of the court\u2019s order on the motion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, the defense of the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, which must be set forth as a separate defense in an answer. Md. Rule 2-323(g)(15). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adx-dedup-1\">[w]here the limitations defense is apparent from the face of the complaint, it has been held subsumed within the broader defense that the complaint fails to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted, and it therefore may be raised under the aegis of that defense in a motion to dismiss under Md. Rule 2-322(b). But the raising of that broader defense through a motion to dismiss is permissive rather than mandatory. See Md. Rule 2-322(b) and the interplay between Rules 2-322(f)[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] and 2-324.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Suburban Hosp. v.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">(1) Statute of Limitations<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the circuit court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s tort and constitutional claims against all appellees on the ground that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. In dismissing the third amended complaint, the circuit court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">The undisputed facts in this case reveal that on January 11, 2001, plat 21707 was recorded. The undisputed facts reveal that [appellant] took title to the[ ] property, which was subsequently recorded on October 1st, 2002. The law is clear that [appellant was] on notice at the time that [he] took title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">As to what is contained in the[ ] actual chain of title, even if [he] had not seen it, heard it, or imagined that it existed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>accordingly the statute of limitations applies to Counts 3 through 9 in [the] third amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On remand, the circuit court confirmed dismissal of the tort and constitutional claims on the ground of the statute of limitations. In agreement with the circuit court, we conclude that, under the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d appellant\u2019s tort and constitutional claims began to accrue, for purposes of the statute of limitations, when he purchased the property in 2002. At the time that appellant took title to the property, he \u201cknew or, with due diligence, reasonably should have known\u201d that Farm Road\u2019s access north to Gold Mine Road was \u201cpermanently cut\u201d in 1994 as he alleged in the third amended complaint. Indeed, in the original complaint, appellant alleged that, at the time he purchased the property in 2002, the Farm Road was in \u201cremnants\u201d and in need of repair, such that he could not use the road until it was repaired. Of import, appellant alleged that as a result of cleaning up, filling in, and building up Farm Road, \u201che eventually reconstructed substantially all the [Farm Road] from Brooke Road to his Subject Property[,]\u201d i.e. to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Tellingly, appellant has never alleged that he used Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road. In the second amended complaint, appellant alleged that he regularly used Farm Road to Brooke Road until \u201capproximately Eighteen (18) months ago when it was intentionally blocked by Defendant Christine Hill.\u201d In the third amended complaint, appellant alleged as follows as to Brooke Road: \u201cThe southward access to Brooke Road continued until approximately 2005 when it was deliberately blocked by Defendant Christine Hill, who placed a chain barrier prohibiting access to property owners from Brooke Road.\u201d (Emphasis added). At no point did appellant allege that he repaired Farm Road for use to Gold Mine Road to the north. As to actual use of the northern access, appellant has alleged only that landowners in the area \u201chave attested to the fact that the Farm Road has been used on a regular basis for multiple generations and that access to Gold[ M]ine Road was permanently cut with the construction of Defendant Warren Lee Brown\u2019s subdivision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Notably, in the second amended complaint, appellant claims in five separate instances that he should be awarded relief from the date his property rights were violated and that \u201csuch time period shall be deemed [to] begin on December 30, 1994, as the date the tortious taking occurred[.]\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> December 30, 1994, is the date the Conservation Easement Agreement between Brown and the Commission was recorded in the Land Records of Montgomery County. After 1994, as appellant acknowledges in the third amended complaint, in 2001, Brown recorded Plat 21707 in the Land Records of Montgomery County. The combination of these undisputed facts is sufficient under the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to establish that appellant was on inquiry notice, if not actual notice, of his potential claims at the time he purchased the property in 2002. As such, the statute of limitations for the tort and constitutional claims expired on October 1, 2005, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-101, whereas the statute of limitations for the slander of title claim expired on October 1, 2003, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-105. Appellant did not file the original complaint until June 9, 2006, well after the statute of limitations for the claims had expired, thereby barring the claims he sought to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Upon review of the record, including appellant\u2019s deed, the Lawrence Map, and Plat 21707, we agree that Plat 21707 is not included in appellant\u2019s chain of title, but we conclude nonetheless that appellant was, at a minimum, on inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>notice that northern access to Farm Road was not available at the time of his purchase of the property in 2002. In <em>Bright, </em>104 Md.App. at 424-25, 656 A.2d 877, we summarized chain of title notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">An owner\u2019s \u201cchain of title\u201d is simply the preceding recorded deed (or other instruments of transfer, such as a will) going back in time, in order, i.e., the last recorded to first recorded instrument. In Maryland, these deeds or instruments are generally found in the public land records, testamentary records, Orphans\u2019 Court records, and judgment and lien records of the particular county wherein the land is located. A subsequent owner, therefore, has notice of what is contained in his or her actual chain of title even if he or she has never seen it, heard it, or even imagined that it existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-1E\">(Emphasis omitted). According to the Lawrence Map, appellant\u2019s property lies south of the conservation easement created by Plat 21707, and two lots owned by others lie between appellant\u2019s property and the conservation easement. The conservation easement does not abut appellant\u2019s property. Plat 21707 references multiple deeds of adjacent properties, and the deed to appellant\u2019s property is not referenced in the Plat. Nothing on the face of Plat 21707 indicates that the Plat would or should be contained within appellant\u2019s chain of title, as the conservation easement and appellant\u2019s property, while close to each other, are not adjacent properties. As Plat 21707 is not a \u201cpreceding recorded deed (or other instrument[ ] of transfer, such as a will) going back in time,\u201d as to ownership of appellant\u2019s property, the plat is not a part of appellant\u2019s chain of title. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We conclude, nevertheless, that, based on the facts alleged in the third amended complaint, appellant had knowledge of facts sufficient to constitute, at least, inquiry notice for purposes of the statute of limitations as of October 1, 2002, when he took title to the property. In the third amended complaint, concerning Farm Road\u2019s access to Gold Mine Road, as stated earlier, appellant acknowledges two important dates: 1994\u2014 when the Dellabrooke subdivision was initially approved, and 2001\u2014when Plat 21707 was recorded. By stating in the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>amended complaint that the northward access of Farm Road to Gold Mine Road been \u201cpermanently cut\u201d in 1994 and access to Gold Mine Road was prohibited in 2001, appellant, in effect, acknowledged that he \u201creasonably should have known\u201d or with diligent investigation could have known at the time he purchased the property that he could not use Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As appellant acknowledges, he has not used Farm Road at any time to access Gold Mine Road to the north, or even used Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road until a specific date or event. A logical conclusion is that appellant did not use Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road at all, because he knew access was \u201cpermanently cut\u201d by actions taken before he purchased the property. In the final analysis, given that appellant conceded he never used Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road, nothing in the record conflicts with the conclusion that appellant had, at bottom, inquiry notice, at the time he purchased the property in 2002, that access to the north was unavailable, and the facts give rise to the inference that appellant knew access to the north to Gold Mine Road was not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We are unconvinced that a fraudulent concealment theory is applicable in this case. Although appellant alleged fraud and fraudulent concealment in the third amended complaint, the complaint falls far short of setting forth specific allegations of how the fraud kept appellant unaware of a cause of action, how the fraud was discovered, and why there was a delay in discovering the fraud. <em>See Archdiocese of Washington, </em>114 Md.App. at 187-88, 689 A.2d 634 (citations omitted). Rather, appellant generally alleges that appellees \u201cconspired\u201d and \u201cwere aware of, condoned, encouraged and participated in the conspiracy and/or concert of action\u201d which \u201cfalsely\u201d denied the existence of Farm Road. Appellant provides no facts to substantiate that appellees\u2019 alleged fraud kept him in the dark as to a cause of action or how he discovered the fraud, nor does appellant allege facts accounting for any delay in discovering the fraud despite his \u201cexercise of ordinary diligence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>CJP \u00a7 5-203. Absent these specific allegations, we cannot conclude that the fraudulent concealment theory is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Similarly, we are not persuaded that a continuing harm theory is applicable in the case. As the Court of Appeals stated, \u201c[c]ontinuing violations that qualify under this theory are continuing unlawful acts, for example, a monthly over-charge of rent, not merely the continuing effects of a single earlier act.\u201d [The] \u201c \u2018continuing tort doctrine\u2019 requires that a tortious act\u2014not simply the continuing ill effects of prior tortious acts\u2014fall within the limitation period[.\u201d] <em>MacBride, </em>402 Md. at 584, 937 A.2d 233 (citations omitted). In the third amended complaint, appellant alleged that appellees \u201chave been and continue to be engaged in a course of conduct giving rise to the[] causes of actionf.]\u201d Appellant alleged, among other things, that appellees \u201ccontinue to engage in a course of conduct which has deprived, and continues to deprive,\u201d appellant of his \u201cconstitutional protected rights to liberty and property by concealing the existence of the Farm Road.\u201d Bare assertions that there is a continued course of conduct among appellees is not enough to toll the statute of limitations under the continuing harm theory. Indeed, appellant\u2019s allegations are more properly understood as asserting \u201cthe continuing effects of a single earlier act[,]\u201d in that appellant claimed he was denied access to Farm Road and his property by specific acts allegedly done by appellees at a specific time in the past. <em>Id. </em>Appellees are not alleged to be continually blocking appellant\u2019s access by new acts daily or periodically. Rather, the access was allegedly blocked in the past, and appellant argues that he still incurs the effects of those acts. As such, the statute of limitations is not tolled under the continuing harm theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument that some appellees have waived the defense of the statute of limitations by not raising the defense, in an answer, is without merit. A party may raise the defense of the statute of limitations through a permissive preliminary motion to dismiss pursuant to Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Rule 2-322(b), under the broader defense of the complaint failing to state a cause of action upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Suburban Hosp., </em>83 Md.App. at 120-21, 573 A.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">At oral argument, appellant contended that before a motion to dismiss on the ground of the statute of limitations may be granted, appellees must demonstrate prejudice. Appellant did not provide any case law\u2014and this Court is not aware of any case law\u2014requiring that a party demonstrate prejudice before raising the defense of the statute of limitations. At oral argument, appellant contended that in <em>Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677, the Court of Appeals stated the statute of limitations may not be used as a defense against someone who does not know they are being damaged. In <em>Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. at 637, 431 A.2d 677, however, the Court held that the statute of limitations is activated when, either by express knowledge or implied awareness of the circumstances, \u201ca person of ordinary prudence\u201d would have investigated the matter. As such, a person \u201ccannot fail to investigate when the propriety of the investigation is naturally suggested by circumstances known to him; and if he neglects to make such inquiry, he will be held guilty of bad faith and must suffer from his neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Nothing in the record demonstrates that appellant was unaware of the circumstances surrounding his access to the property at the time he purchased it in 2002, such that he should be excused from having investigated until 2006, when he first filed a complaint. The Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Poffenberger </em>does not alter the result in this case. We conclude that, at a minimum, appellant had inquiry, if not actual, notice of his claims in 2002, and that the statute of limitations expired on October 1, 2005, before the original complaint was filed in the case. Accordingly, the circuit court properly dismissed counts III through IX of the third amended complaint as to the Commission Group, the MHG Group, and Brown, as those are the parties alleged to have blocked Farm Road\u2019s access to Gold Mine Road. The circuit court properly dismissed counts III through IX of the third amended com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>plaint as to all remaining appellees, as those causes of action stem from the blocking of access over Farm Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">(2) Duty of Care Owed by the MHG Group</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Although we conclude that the circuit court properly dismissed the claims against the MHG Group on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired, we shall briefly address the issue of whether the MHG Group owed appellant a duty of care. Appellant contends that the MHG Group, as licensed surveyors, owed a duty of care under Maryland law to members of the public, including him, to correctly survey Brown\u2019s property and include Farm Road in the survey. Simply put, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The Court of Appeals has explained the duty requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cThere can be no negligence where there is no duty that is due; for negligence is the breach of some duty that one person owes to another. It is consequently relative and can have no existence apart from some duty expressly or impliedly imposed. In every instance before negligence can be predicated of a given act, back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining, the observance of which duty would have averted or avoided the injury.... As the duty owed varies with circumstances and with the relation to each other of the individuals concerned, so the alleged negligence varies, and the act complained of never amounts to negligence in law or in fact; if there has been no breach of duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\"><em>Doe v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., </em>388 Md. 407, 414-15, 879 A.2d 1088 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThe existence of a legal duty is a question of law, to be decided by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 879 A.2d 1088 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Our holding in <em>Carlotta, </em>57 Md.App. 467, 470 A.2d 838, is instructive. In <em>Carlotta, </em>57 Md.App. at 472, 470 A.2d 838, this Court held that \u201ca surveyor of a disputed boundary line does not owe a duty of care to a non-reliant third party adjacent landowner. A surveyor, therefore, cannot be held liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>such a plaintiff.\u201d The Carlottas filed suit against the Heaths, adjacent property owners, and T.R. Stark &amp; Associates, Inc., a registered land surveyor. <em>Id. </em>at 468-69, 470 A.2d 838. The Carlottas alleged that the Heaths were trespassing on their property and had fraudulently attempted to gain ownership of a portion of their property. <em>Id. </em>The Carlottas claimed that the surveyor \u201chad aided and abetted the Heaths by negligently preparing [for the Heaths] an erroneous survey plat of the disputed property boundary. They alleged that the plat prepared by Stark had been based upon a monument suggested to him by the Heaths as the point of beginning, which the Heaths knew or should have known to be false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 470 A.2d 838. On appeal, the Carlottas relied on authorities from other jurisdictions in an attempt to establish that the surveyor owed them a duty of care. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 470 A.2d 838. Upon review, we found the cases were factually distinctive and not dispositive of the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 470 A.2d 838. For example, we reviewed a Georgia case, <em>Hutchinson v. Dubeau, </em>161 Ga.App. 65, 289 S.E.2d 4 (1982), and observed that in Georgia, a statute \u201cimposed upon registered land surveyors an obligation to assume responsibility to the public for the accuracy of work they certified had been performed accurately.\u201d <em>Carlotta, </em>57 Md.App. at 471, 470 A.2d 838. Given that Maryland does not have a similar statute, we declined to apply the rationale of the Georgia appellate court. <em>Id. </em>Absent Maryland law recognizing the cause of action the Carlottas brought against the surveyor, we held that the surveyor did not owe the Carlottas a duty of care. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 472, 470 A.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">At the heart of this case and <em>Carlotta </em>is whether a surveyor owes a duty of care to other property owners aside from the person who employs him.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Here, there is a dispute concerning a licensed land surveyor who allegedly conducted a survey and \u201cdeliberately omitted\u201d Farm Road as an easement. Applying <em>Carlotta, </em>we hold that the mere licensing of surveyors does not create a private cause of action by members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the general public against those surveyors. As we observed in <em>Carlotta, </em>57 Md.App. at 471, 470 A.2d 838, Maryland does not have a statute imposing a duty on a registered surveyor \u201cto assume responsibility to the public for the accuracy of work they certified had been performed accurately.\u201d Absent any statutory or case law in Maryland demonstrating that a surveyor owed a duty of care to the general public, including appellant, or that Maryland intended to create such a duty through licensing, we decline to find that the MHG Group owed a duty to appellant.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See also Columbia Town Ctr. Title Co. v. 100 Investment Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>203 Md.App. 61, 82-86, 36 A.3d 985 (2012) (We did not extend tort liability to title companies, noting that \u201c[w]e have not been directed to, nor have we found, a statutory obligation in Maryland that imposes on either a title company or a title insurer a duty to exercise due care in performing a title search, such as found in some other jurisdictions.\u201d). For the reasons stated above, the circuit court properly dismissed counts III through IX of the third amended complaint as to the MHG Group upon finding that the MHG Group did not owe a duty of care to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">III. The Second and Fourth Amended Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in striking the second and fourth amended complaints.

On review, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[d]espite the preference for freely permitted amendments, [petitioner] failed to introduce any new facts to cure its inability to produce <em>prima facie </em>evidence of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>land\u2019s personal jurisdiction over [respondents].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 878 A.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In <em>Prudential Securities Inc. v. e-Net, Inc., </em>140 Md.App. 194, 234, 780 A.2d 359 (2001), we held that the trial court abused its discretion in granting appellees\u2019 motion to strike the amended complaint \u201c[i]n light of the policy in this State allowing liberal amendment of the pleadings, and because a trial date was not set at the time the Amended Complaint was filed[.]\u201d In <em>Prudential, </em>140 Md.App. at 206, 780 A.2d 359, appellant filed an amended complaint \u201c[o]n the last day for filing dispositive motions, and prior to filing an opposition to e-Net\u2019s motion for summary judgment!.]\u201d Appellees moved to strike the amended complaint, and the trial court granted both motions to strike as well as appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 780 A.2d 359. Before this Court, appellant argued that the amended complaint was based on recently gathered information not made available to appellant until approximately two weeks before it filed the amended complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 780 A.2d 359. After reviewing and comparing the two complaints, we determined that although appellant alleged facts in the amended complaint not included in the original complaint, the same \u201coperative factual pattern\u201d remained and the amended complaint \u201cmerely contained more factual detail than the original complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 780 A.2d 359. As such, we reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motions to strike. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In this case, we conclude that the circuit court neither abused its discretion in striking the second nor fourth amended complaints. As to the second amended complaint, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motions to strike, but specifically provided appellant leave to amend. The circuit court observed during the hearing of March 13, 2008, that the second amended complaint was long, contained multiple causes of action against a \u201cnumber of individuals,\u201d and violated Md. Rule 2-303(b) by including \u201cargument, unnecessary recitals of law, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>circuit court stated, however, that while there was an \u201coverriding interest to have the complaint conform to the pleading[ ] requirements,\u201d it \u201ccertainly [would] give [appellant] an opportunity to amend[.]\u201d The record reflects that appellant, in fact, filed a third amended complaint by the date specified by the circuit court. Although appellant argues that the circuit court \u201csent mixed signals\u201d regarding the second amended complaint, appellant was given\u2014and took\u2014the opportunity to amend and file a third amended complaint. Based on these facts, we cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing the second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Without doubt, the circuit court properly struck the fourth amended complaint. At the time appellant filed the fourth amended complaint, the case was on remand from this Court. On remand, we ordered the circuit court to enter \u201ca declaration of the respective rights of the parties and adjudicate] all of the claims [including the cross-claim.]\u201d At no point in the remand Order did this Court provide appellant with an opportunity to file a fourth amended complaint. To the contrary, the stated purpose of remand was to adjudicate existing matters, not start anew with another amended complaint. In keeping with this purpose, on remand, the circuit court specifically requested that the parties submit \u201cproposed declaratory judgments in respect of the third amended complaint.\u201d Appellant disregarded the circuit court\u2019s instructions and instead filed a fourth amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Aside from the stated purpose of remand, the Maryland Rules required leave of the circuit court for filing the fourth amended complaint. At the time that appellant filed the fourth amended complaint, appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss the third amended complaint had already been granted by the circuit court. Md. Rule 2-322(c) provides that \u201cif the court orders dismissal, an amended complaint may be filed only if the court expressly grants leave to amend.\u201d Such amended. complaint \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after entry of the order or within such other time as the court may fix.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Nothing in our Order dated September 30, 2009, remanding the case, altered the requirement under the Maryland Rules that appellant seek leave to amend before filing another complaint. We find no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s striking of the fourth amended complaint.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">IV. Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">A.

Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u201cWe review the denial of discovery under the abuse of discretion standard and will only conclude that the trial court abused its discretion where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court[ ] ... or when the court acts without reference to any guiding principles, and the ruling under consideration is clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court[ ] ... or when the ruling is violative of fact and logic.\u201d <em>Beyond Systems, Inc., </em>388 Md. at 28, 878 A.2d 567 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>C.

Joppa Drive-Thru, Inc., </em>195 Md.App. 583, 596, 7 A.3d 160 (2010), we observed that \u201cthe circuit court ... has the inherent power to control and supervise discovery as it sees fit.\u201d (Citation omitted). As such, \u201c[w]hen there is a claim of failure of discovery, the circuit court has broad discretion to fashion a remedy based on a party\u2019s failure to abide by the rules of discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In situations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUV\">when there is no hard and fast rule governing the situation ... the trial judge must exercise his or her judicial discretion. The decision he or she makes, in turn, is reviewed for the soundness and reasonableness with which the discretion was exercised. In making that evaluation, the reviewing court must defer to the trial court. The necessity for doing so is inherent in the very nature of judicial discretion. The exercise of judicial discretion ordinarily involves making a series of judgment calls, not simply the ultimate one, but also those on which the ultimate one depends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 596-97, 7 A.3d 160 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Beyond Systems, Inc., </em>388 Md. at 28-29, 878 A.2d 567, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on a motion to dismiss and denying appellant\u2019s request for discovery because petitioner \u201cwas unable to produce <em>any </em>evidence of a connection between\u201d respondents. (Emphasis in original). Before the Court of Appeals, respondents argued that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying discovery because petitioner \u201cprovided no basis upon which to grant discovery beyond conclusory allegations and bald-faced assertions of [personal] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 878 A.2d 567. On review, the Court of Appeals agreed that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s decision [was] not beyond the decision that a reasonable person would make in light of the fact[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 878 A.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">D. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the dismissal of appellant\u2019s claims prior to completion of the discovery. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>noted above, the circuit court \u201chas the inherent power to control and supervise discovery as it sees fit.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>195 Md.App. at 596, 7 A.3d 160 (citation omitted). We agree with the Commission Group that the circuit court \u201cappropriately exercised its discretion by resolving [] legal questions presented in the preliminary motions prior to resolving the discovery motions.\u201d In this case, there were numerous parties, claims, and preliminary motions and responses filed, raising significant legal issues as to which parties appellant could proceed against and his ability to bring the action. Although discovery had begun in the case, the circuit court properly resolved the preliminary motions to strike and dismiss, rather than permit discovery as to factual matters not related to the legal issues raised by the preliminary motions. Given that the completion of discovery had no bearing on the legal issues before the court, as in <em>Beyond Systems, Inc., </em>388 Md. at 28, 878 A.2d 567, we do not find \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case is beyond the decision that a reasonable person would [have made]\u201d under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Appellant contends that the grant of his property originated from the Gilpin Estate, a large tract of land originally encompassing appellant\u2019s property and the conservation easement, among other parcels.

Appellant failed to identify any language in the 1895 deed describing a right of way via Farm Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">At oral argument, appellant maintained that the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Condry, </em>184 Md. 317, 41 A.2d 66, supports the argument for an express easement by virtue of the 1895 deed. In <em>Condry, </em>184 Md. at 321-23, 41 A.2d 66, the Court of Appeals, however, discussed implied easements by prescription and necessity, not express easements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. At oral argument, relying on <em>Johnson, </em>appellant argued that an implied easement by necessity is required where property would otherwise be landlocked. Conversely, the Commission Group contended that <em>Johnson </em>does not stand for the proposition that an implied easement by necessity must exist when property is landlocked. The Commission Group is correct. In <em>Johnson, 26 </em>Md.App. at 580-81, 338 A.2d 88, although we noted that Johnson would be denied access to her property in the absence of an easement, the holding was premised on the issue of notice, i.e. that the purchaser, Robinson, knew that Johnson had no other access except over the property when he bought from Johnson. Indeed, in <em>Johnson, </em>we posed the following question: \"How can Mrs. Johnson be denied a way necessary to enjoyment of her property through the land of a purchaser who admittedly had notice of the problem before the deed was signed at the instance of that purchaser?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 338 A.2d 88.

A review of <em>Boucher, </em>however, demonstrates that the case involved an implied easement over a private road established by plat reference, not an implied easement by necessity. Nothing in the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Boucher, </em>however, mandates that an easement be implied in order to keep property from being or becoming landlocked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">.

Unlike <em>Prudential Securities, </em>140 Md.App. at 206, 780 A.2d 359, where the plaintiff filed an amended complain! during the motions phase of the case before a trial date was set, in this case, the preliminary motions phase was effectively over as appellant's third amended complaint had been dismissed at ihe time he attempted to file the fourth amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
