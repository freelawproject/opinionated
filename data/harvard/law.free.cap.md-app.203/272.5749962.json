Appellant, Russell Swatek, challenged the decision of appellee, Board of Elections of Howard County, that appellant\u2019s Public Local Law Referendum Petition was insufficient. Appellant subsequently filed a petition for judicial review. The petition was dismissed because appellant failed to submit a memorandum pursuant to Md. Rule 7-207(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant noted an appeal, and in his own words, presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">Did the Circuit Court for Howard County err by dismissing Appellant\u2019s Petition on the basis of a technical violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>despite it being abundantly clear that Appellee was well aware of the issues raised by Appellant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">On February 1, 2010, the Howard County Council passed CB-59-2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CB-59-2009 amended the Howard County Zoning Ordinance (\u201cZoning Ordinance\u201d) in an effort to foster the redevelopment of downtown Columbia. Appellant, in conjunction with Taxpayers Against Giveaways, prepared a Public Local Law Referendum Petition (\u201cPetition\u201d) that sought to change portions of the Zoning Ordinance that were amended. Appellant submitted 3,491 signatures in support of the Petition. Appellee concluded that the Petition was insufficient because 1,352 of the signatures were invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant subsequently filed a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On May 27, 2010, appellee transmitted the record to the circuit court. A hearing was subsequently scheduled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>August 27, 2010. On August 26, 2010, appellee filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d arguing that the petition for judicial review should be dismissed because appellant failed to submit a memorandum in accordance with Md. Rule 7~207(a). In the motion, appellee asserted that the failure to submit a memorandum caused substantial prejudice because: (1) the 2010 general election was sixty days away and the appeal process would not be completed by the required deadlines; (2) CB-59-2009 was delayed while the Petition was pending but was now \u201cin effect;\u201d (3) the public interest would be impaired if the Petition was upheld and delayed until the 2012 general election; and (4) further delay would cause the county to incur additional legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On August 27, 2010, the day of the scheduled hearing, the circuit court heard appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>argued that appellant\u2019s failure to file a timely memorandum was prejudicial because it did not know the factual and legal basis for the petition for judicial review. Appellant countered that there was no prejudice because appellee knew the issues. Appellant further asserted that the issues were \u201cso narrowly known\u201d that appellee had to have been aware of them. Appel-lee responded that it did not know the \u201cspecific factual issues\u201d and was not prepared to proceed without reviewing a memorandum. Appellee added that the purpose of the memorandum was to narrow the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review. In dismissing it, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">That memorandum should\u2019ve been filed by, certainly no later than July the 1st of 2010, probably more like June the 26th.... '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">The [appellant] is not asking\u2014the [appellant] is asking to proceed today. The [appellant\u2019s] position is that [appellee] knows what the issues are, knows what the law is, and should be prepared to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">I disagree with that.... I can\u2014the value of the memorandum is to narrow the issues, to specify the issues and to\u2014and to frame the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">.... The testing of the rule is whether the [appellee] is at\u2014 in this case, is at a disadvantage and I find that the [appellee] is at a disadvantage and is prejudiced by the lack of the filing of a memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">The [appellee]\u2014it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the [appellee] be prepared to respond to whatever the argument may be of opposing counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">It\u2019s unreasonable to expect the [appellee] to be prepared to produce the record necessary to counter whatever arguments might be made. And on top of that, it\u2019s unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to expect the [appellee] to do it in a total vacuum of specific allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">I also find that continuing this matter would not be a suitable remedy in that today is August the 27th. The first votes in the general election are less than two months away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">The\u2014there\u2019s no\u2014there\u2019s not enough time to perform under the rule and even if I was to truncate it and require a memorandum in, say, ten days and response in, say, ten days, that places an undue burden on the [appellee], in that there\u2019s a primary election for the [appellee] to run and there would be no time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">And most importantly, there is the fact of the sample ballots being issued. And they will be\u2014it was a proffer of mid-September. I\u2019m not accepting that as a fact that it\u2019s\u2014 that they would be issued in mid-September, but certainly, they\u2019re issued in advance of the general election, in advance of October the 23rd, and the public would be prejudiced if the question was not on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Md. Rule 7-207(a) provides that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after the clerk sends notice of the filing of the record, a petitioner shall file a memorandum setting forth a concise statement of the questions presented for review, a statement of facts material to those questions, and argument on each question, including citations of authority and references to pages of the record and exhibits relied on.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of [Md. Rule 7-207(a) ] is to inform the opposing parties and the trial court of the issues involved in the case ... in sufficient time for the opposition to respond in kind and for the court to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>Gaetano v. Calvert County, </em>310 Md. 121, 126, 527 A.2d 46 (1987). At bottom, the rule is supposed \u201cto promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice,\u201d and is \u201cmeant to be obeyed.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. 715, 720, 451 A.2d 945 (1982) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In <em>People\u2019s Counsel, </em>we analyzed whether a court was required to dismiss a petition for judicial review when a memorandum was untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 451 A.2d 945. There, we noted that Md. Rule B12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was meant to be followed, but acknowledged that \u201cthe rule does not specify or mandate any particular sanction for its violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720, 451 A.2d 945. Nevertheless, we concluded that dismissing an administrative appeal for failure to comply with Md. Rule B12 was permissible, and \u201cperhaps even [] preferred,\u201d however, it was not mandatory. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we noted that the Court of Appeals \u201cchose not to specify dismissal as a required sanction ...\u201d when it promulgated Md. Rule B12. <em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In <em>Gaetano, </em>310 Md. at 121, 527 A.2d 46, the Court of Appeals established a standard for determining whether an administrative appeal should be dismissed when a memorandum was untimely. There, the Court of Appeals noted that it must \u201clook to the purpose of [Md. Rule B12] ... in light of the circumstances of [the] violation to determine the appropriate sanction for a violation of its provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 527 A.2d 46 (citations omitted). Thereafter, the Court held that \u201cMd. Rule l-201(a), which controls here, states that \u2018[w]hen a rule, by the word \u2018shall\u2019 or otherwise, mandates or prohibits conduct, .... [and] no consequences are prescribed [for noncompliance therewith], the court may compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 527 A.2d 46. Ultimately, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Court of Appeals concluded that not using this standard was an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Prior to <em>Gaetano, </em>there was no rule that provided the appropriate sanctions for the untimely submission of a memorandum. After <em>Gaetano, </em>Md. Rule 7-207(d), which governs sanctions for untimely submission of a memorandum, was promulgated. <em>See </em>Reporter\u2019s Note to Proposed Rule 7-207, Md. Reg., Vol. 19, Issue 26, Wednesday, December 23, 1992. The rule, in relevant, part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">If a petitioner fails to file a memorandum within the time prescribed by [Md. Rule 7-207], the court may dismiss the action if it finds that the failure to file or the late filing caused prejudice to the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Md. Rule 7-207(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appellant filed a petition for judicial review on April 23, 2010. The administrative record was submitted on May 27, 2010. On August 26, 2010, the day before the hearing, no memorandum from appellant had been filed. Appellee, accordingly, submitted a \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d arguing that it was prejudiced by the absence of a memorandum. The circuit court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review on the grounds that appellee was prejudiced by the absence of a memorandum. Appellant argues that the circuit court abused its discretion because there was no prejudice. Specifically, appellant asserts that appellee was familiar with the decision being challenged and knew the relevant law. Appellant, moreover, asserts that any prejudice was \u201cde minimus\u201d because the memorandum would have merely reworded the issues appellee was aware of.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In <em>People\u2019s Counsel, </em>52 Md.App. at 716-17, 451 A.2d 945, an order from the Public Service Commission granting a taxicab rate increase was appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On February 2, 1981, the Public Service Commission sent the record to \u201cMr. Elmer O. Harris, Clerk Circuit Court of Baltimore City[,] Room 425, Civil Court Building 111 N. Calvert Street Baltimore, Maryland 21202[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>A.2d 945 (internal quotations omitted). However, Harris was the clerk of the Baltimore City Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Harris, accordingly, \u201credocketed\u201d the appeal in the Baltimore City Court. <em>Id. </em>Harris then sent People\u2019s Counsel a \u201cNotice Sent In Accordance With Maryland Rule [B12],\u201d dated February 3, 1981, indicating that the case was before the Baltimore City Court. <em>Id. </em>at 718, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Eventually, the appeal was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. <em>Id. </em>On April 3, 1981, the Public Service Commission moved to dismiss the appeal because People\u2019s Counsel failed to file a memorandum within thirty days of the February 3, 1981 notice. <em>Id. </em>On April 10, 1981, People\u2019s Counsel filed a memorandum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The court subsequently denied the motion because the memorandum was filed more than thirty days before the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 718-19, 451 A.2d 945. On appeal, we concluded that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in declining to dismiss the appeal because: (1) there was no evidence that the court or the administrative agency was \u201cinconvenienced, much less prejudiced[;]\u201d (2) the rate increase being challenged remained in effect during the appeal; (3) Md. Rule B12 was new; (4) there was limited publication of Md. Rule B12; and (5) the administrative agency was negligent in \u201cin transmitting the record to the wrong court----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In <em>Gaetano, </em>310 Md. at 122, 527 A.2d 46, the Board of County Commissioners of Calvert County (\u201cBoard\u201d) approved David Van Hoy\u2019s (\u201cHoy\u201d) application to establish a transfer zone of eighty-eight acres. Adjacent landowners and affected neighbors filed an \u201cOrder of Appeal\u201d and a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122-23, 527 A.2d 46. The Board filed a timely answer and served the order and petition on Hoy. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 527 A.2d 46. Hoy neglected to file an answer and was no longer considered a party. <em>Id. </em>After nineteen months of inaction, Hoy filed a \u201cMotion to Intervene,\u201d which was granted. <em>Id. </em>Hoy thereafter filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the adjacent landowners and affected neighbors did not file a memorandum within thirty days of the record being filed in accordance with Md. Rule B12. <em>Id. </em>A memorandum was filed five days later. <em>Id. </em>The lower court dismissed the appeal, concluding Md. Rule B12 mandated dismissal, absent compelling circumstances, when a memorandum was not filed within thirty days <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 527 A.2d 46. On appeal, we articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">The record indicates that on April 3, 1986 a non-jury trial on the merits of the appeal was scheduled for July 22, 1986, some three months after the appellants filed their [Md.] Rule B12 memorandum (April 14,1986). Clearly, the appel-lees were given adequate time to become informed of the issues and the appellants\u2019 arguments as well as to prepare a response to the memorandum. <em>See [Md.] </em>Rule B12 (giving appellees thirty days from receipt of appellants\u2019 memorandum to file an answering memorandum). We simply do not see any prejudice to either appellee in this case caused by the delayed filing. <em>See In re: Darryl D., </em>308 Md. 475, 483, 520 A.2d 712, 716 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 527 A.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Dep\u2019t of Econ. &amp; Employment Dev. v. Hager, </em>96 Md.App. 362, 375, 625 A.2d 342 (1993), the Department of Economic &amp; Employment Development (\u201cDepartment\u201d) failed to submit an answering memorandum within thirty days pursuant to Md. Rule B12. The memorandum was supposed to be filed on May 7, 1992, and on May 27, 1992, Richard D. Hager (\u201cHag-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>er\u201d) filed a \u201cMotion for Default, or in the Alternative, Motion to Compel Filing of Memorandum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). In Hager\u2019s motion, he requested that the court enter default or order the Department to file an answering memorandum \u201cno later than June 12, 1992.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The Department filed an answering memorandum on June 1, 1992. <em>Id. </em>Hager subsequently filed a motion to strike. <em>Id. </em>The lower court denied the pending motions. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Hager argued that the court abused its discretion in denying the motions. <em>Id. </em>at 374, 625 A.2d 342. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">The obvious purpose of the requirement that an answering memorandum be filed within thirty days is to ensure that an appellant will know what an appellee\u2019s arguments are in sufficient time to fully address them when a hearing is held. Here, [] Hager\u2019s counsel had a copy of [the Department\u2019s] answering memorandum more than five weeks prior to the July 9, 1992 hearing. Five weeks was adequate time to prepare fully for the hearing and [ ] Hager was in no way prejudiced by the late filing. <em>[Cf.] Gaetano v. Calvert County, </em>310 Md. 121, 527 A.2d 46 (1987) (dismissal of an administrative appeal was an improper sanction against appellant for late filing of memorandum absent showing of prejudice). Under the totality of the circumstances, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying [ ] Hager\u2019s motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 625 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In <em>Billings v. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>190 Md.App. 649, 665, 989 A.2d 1170 (2010), the lower court granted Eastern Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (\u201cEastern Petroleum\u201d) motion to strike a memorandum filed by Dedra Billings, David B. Johnson, Michelle Coffee, Cheryl Corson, and Friends of Croom Civic Association\u2019s (\u201cPetitioners\u201d), because it was untimely and the untimeliness prejudiced Eastern Petroleum. There, once the parties acknowledged that the memorandum was untimely, the court granted the motion, and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The issue of prejudice is addressed in case law applying Maryland\u2019s former Rule B-12 which was a predecessor to Maryland Rule 7-207. And you have to look at the factors that would mitigate for finding the prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">The purpose of Rule 2-707 is to inform the opposing parties and the trial court of the issues involved in the case and the appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal in sufficient time for the opposition to respond in kind and for the court to make an informed decision and that\u2019s from the ... <em>[Gaetano v.] </em>Calvert County case, ... 310 Maryland 121, 527 A.2d 46 at Page 126. That\u2019s a 1987 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">In [Gaetano] the court found that where a memorandum filed three months before the bench trial provided adequate time for the respondents to become informed of the issues and to prepare a response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">Here the [Pjetitioners\u2019 memorandum was filed 95 days before oral arguments. One distinction between the cases is that in [Gaetano] they filed their memorandum five days after the filing of the motion to dismiss for failure to file a memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">As these cases move through the system, there really truly is a problem in the economic sense where changing business conditions certainly would prejudice a business trying to expand as it is in this case, by failure to comply with these very strict and sometimes difficult rules to navigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 666-67, 989 A.2d 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On appeal, we concluded that the record did not support the conclusion that \u201cchanging business conditions\u201d prejudiced Eastern Petroleum\u2019s business. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 989 A.2d 1170 (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, we concluded that the purpose of Md. Rule 7-207(a) was fulfilled because the memorandum was filed ninety-five days before the scheduled hearing. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, we concluded that the lower court erred when it concluded appellant was prejudiced. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\"><em>People\u2019s Counsel, Gaetano, Hager, </em>and <em>Billings </em>suggest that appellant\u2019s failure to submit a memorandum was prejudicial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>If the hearing would have proceeded, appellee presumably would not have been prepared to address appellant\u2019s arguments. Admittedly, appellee\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d suggests that it had a general grasp of the issues. However, that does not mean appellee would have been prepared for every material argument, given the totality of the circumstances. That said, we find appellant\u2019s failure to file a memorandum curious. Even an untimely memorandum, assuming the date of the submission afforded the opposing party sufficient time to prepare, may have satisfied the purpose of Md. Rule 7-207(a). <em>See e.g.\u2019s Gaetano, </em>310 Md. at 126-27, 527 A.2d 46 (untimely submission of a memorandum satisfied the purpose of Md. Rule B12 because it was submitted approximately three months before the hearing); <em>Billings, </em>190 Md.App. at 667, 989 A.2d 1170 (the purpose of Md. Rule B12 was satisfied because the memorandum was filed five weeks before the hearing); <em>Hager, </em>96 Md.App. at 375-76, 625 A.2d 342 (an untimely memorandum filed ninety-five days before the hearing fulfilled the purpose of Md. Rule 7-207(a)). Nevertheless, because the failure to file a memorandum was prejudicial, the circuit court properly forestalled appellant\u2019s request to proceed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Furthermore, the circuit court was prejudiced by the absence of a memorandum. A memorandum would have narrowed the arguments and framed their issues, thereby assisting the court in making an informed determination. Absent this, appellant may have spearheaded an unguided argument that could have convoluted the purpose of a judicial review. <em>See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994) (\u201c \u2018Judicial review of administrative agency action is narrow.\u2019\u201d). Accordingly, because appellant and the circuit court were prejudiced, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED.

No law making any appropriation for current expenses shall be subject to rejection or repeal under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">(b) <em>Form of petition. </em>A petition may consist of several papers, but each paper shall contain a fair summary of the Act or the part of the Act petitioned upon; and there shall be attached to each such paper an affidavit of the person procuring the signatures thereon that, to the said person\u2019s own personal knowledge, each signature thereon is genuine and bona fide, and that to the best of his or her knowledge, information and belief the signers are registered voters of the State of Maryland and Howard County, as set opposite their names. The Board of Supervisors of Elections shall verify the registration of said petitioners.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. Md. Rule 7-207(a) was derived without substantive change from former Md. Rule B12. <em>See </em>Reporter's Notes to Proposed Rule 7-207, Md. Reg., Vol. 19, Issue 26, Wednesday, December 23, 1992. Md. Rule B12, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">Within 30 days after being notified by the clerk of the filing of the record, the appellant shall file a memorandum setting forth a concise statement of all issues raised on appeal and argument on each issue, including citations of legal authorities and references to pages of the transcript and exhibits relied on.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">. The Baltimore City Court used to be one of many courts under the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, which was unified in 1980 into a \"single, unified, and consolidated Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\u201d <em>See </em>Dan Friedman, The Maryland State Constitution, 250 (G. Alan Tarr, ed., Oxford University Press 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. People\u2019s Counsel provided the following reasons for not filing a memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">(1) [Md. Rule B12] was a new [rule], having taken effect on January 1, 1981; (2) it had not, as of then, been published in Vol. 9C of the Maryland Code, where the other rules are located; (3) the notice in any event was a nullity since it was sent by a clerk who had no jurisdiction over the case; (4) the Commission was not prejudiced by the lapse; and (5) dismissal of the appeal was an unnecessarily harsh sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\"><em>People\u2019s Counsel, </em>52 Md.App. at 718, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\">. Interesting enough, we found no appellate decision addressing the total failure of a party to file a memorandum. The parties in <em>People\u2019s Counsel, Gaetano, Billings, </em>and <em>Hager, </em>at minimum, filed an untimely memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. The circuit court could have continued the matter to accommodate the filing of memoranda. However, a continuance would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prejudicial to the public interest. Howard County Charter provides that when a sufficient referendum petition if filed, \"the law or part thereof to be referred shall not take effect until thirty days after its approval by a majority of the qualified voters of the County voting thereon at the next ensuing election held for members of the House of Representatives of the United States....\u201d The 2010 general election was months away when the judicial review was pending. The record suggests that there would not have been enough time to continue the proceedings, address the petition for judicial review, and then, assuming the circuit court concluded the Petition was valid, have CB-09-2009 on the ballot for the 2010 general election. Thus, the public interest would have been prejudiced because Howard County voters, at best, would have been forced to vote on CB-09-2009 in the 2012 general election if the Petition was determined to be sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
