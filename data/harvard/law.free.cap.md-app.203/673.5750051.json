DAVIS (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The following opening remarks by Judge Hollander, writing for this Court in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City v. Ernest A. Johnson, </em>156 Md.App. 569, 572-73, 847 A.2d 1190 (2004) (footnote omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>387 Md. 1, 874 A.2d 439 (2005), provide an excellent introduction for our discussion in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">A retired firefighter who is also disabled as a result of an occupational disease is entitled under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) to collect both service pension benefits and compensation benefits, in a sum not to exceed the firefighter\u2019s weekly salary. <em>Polomski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 684 A.2d 1338 (1996). In this appeal, we must determine whether a firefighter\u2019s surviving, dependent spouse is similarly entitled to collect both service related pension benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the firefighter\u2019s death results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>from an occupational disease. Resolution of the case requires us to construe several provisions of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol., 2003 Supp.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">Mrs. Johnson claims that, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-503(e), she is also entitled to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits, so long as the total amount does not exceed Mr. Johnson\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the surviving wholly dependent spouse of Ernest Johnson was ruled to be ineligible for dual benefits. The legislative response to the Ernest Johnson case is the starting point for the similar quest for dual benefits by the surviving wholly dependent spouse of another first responder.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">This is an appeal by Janice T. Johnson, claimant, from the decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversing an award of survivor\u2019s benefits by a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant seeks the same relief that was denied Mrs. Ernest Johnson in the above-referenced, celebrated case, but avers that the General Assembly has stepped in to remedy deficiencies in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that led to the denial of dual recovery in the <em>Ernest A. Johnson </em>case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction to consider whether claimant is entitled to collect both the pension for the employee\u2019s time of service as well as her survivor\u2019s compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>benefits, and thus avoid the effect of the Act\u2019s general offset provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we shall hold that appellant is not so entitled, because amendments to the provision at issue may not apply retroactively, and we shall therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The employee, Felix L. Johnson, Jr., served as a firefighter for the City of Baltimore from October 13, 1964 until his retirement on June 9, 1990. On July 2, 1990, the employee and claimant were married. On November 7, 2005, the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ployee died due to a myocardial infarction. Claimant began receiving pension survivorship benefits at the rate of $266.92 per week. On January 10, 2006, claimant filed a dependent\u2019s claim for death benefits under the Act. She alleged that the employee\u2019s demise from \u201cheart disease resulting in death\u201d was due to the fact that he had been \u201ccontinuously exposed to heat, smoke, noxious fumes and the product of combustion[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On October 1, 2009, the claim went to a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. On December 4, the Commission awarded benefits to the claimant. This Order was amended on February 26, 2010 to effect a nominal change in the amount of the award. In the Amended Award, the Commission first ruled that the employee sustained an occupational disease and that he died as a result thereof on November 7, 2005. The Commission further ruled that claimant was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d upon the employee for support and also concluded that the \u201cEmployer and Insurer are entitled to a set off under Section 9-503 of the Labor Article.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect of the Commission\u2019s application of the specific offset provision set forth in Section 9-503(e) was to enhance claimants total recovery and to avoid the dollar for dollar offset at Section 9-610. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol. 2007 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-503(e), 9-610 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d or Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The Employer petitioned for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s award in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. <em>See </em>Section 9-737 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Md. Code (1999, 2008 ReplVol., 2009 Supp.), \u00a7 9-737 of the Labor and Employment Article. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the circuit court. Md. Rule 2-501. On September 1, 2010, following a hearing on these motions, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the Employer and also denied appellant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We recently pointed out that \u201c[ajppellate scrutiny of a workers\u2019 compensation decision depends upon the manner of the circuit court\u2019s judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Doe v. Buccini Pollin Grp., Inc., </em>201 Md.App. 409, 419, 29 A.3d 999 (2011). We there cited to \u201ctwo modalities of judicial review,\u201d <em>viz. </em>a review on the existing record generated before the Commission and a \u201cnew evidentiary hearing and decision before a jury[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 67-68, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006)). These approaches are embodied in LE \u00a7 9-745, which articulates the manner by which judicial proceedings are to be conducted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>In the case before us, the issue was joined and decided on cross-motions for summary judgment. Where the case is in this appellate posture, our review of the circuit court\u2019s judgment is plenary, <em>see Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liab. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>375 Md. 522, 533, 826 A.2d 443 (2003), because a resolution on summary judgment is one of law, and, as Judge Greene recently pointed out for the Court of Appeals, an appellate court reviews the summary judgment decision of the circuit court \u201cfor legal correctness.\u201d <em>Wed Mart Stores, Inc. v. Holmes, </em>416 Md. 346, 358, 7 A.3d 13 (2010). <em>See Muskin v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation, </em>422 Md. 544, 554-55, 30 A.3d 962 (2011); <em>Chesek v.

Buccini, supra, </em>201 Md.App. at 420, 29 A.3d 999 (review of conclusions of law <em>de novo). </em>Judicial review of agency decisions is constrained. Although we accord due respect for the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its organic statute, <em>see Wal Mart v. Holmes, supra, </em>416 Md. at 359, 7 A.3d 13; <em>cf. Kim v. Maryland State Board of Physicians, </em>423 Md. 523, 537, 32 A.3d 30 (2011) (deference to agency interpretation of own regulations), and are mindful that the Commission\u2019s decision is \u201cpresumed to be <em>prima facie </em>correct,\u201d LE \u00a7 9\u2014745(b)(1); <em>Kim, </em>423 Md. at 536, 32 A.3d 30 \u201cthis presumption does not extend to questions of law, which we review independently.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 60, 31 A.3d 191 (2011) (citing <em>Wal Mart v.

Buccini, supra, </em>201 Md.App. at 420, 29 A.3d 999 (citation omitted). Such legislation is remedial and it is to be \u201c \u2018construed as liberally in favor of the injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deibler, </em>423 Md. at 61, 31 A.3d 191 (quoting <em>Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v.

We likewise recognize that worker\u2019s compensation legislation strikes a balance between the competing interests of both employees and employers, <em>Doe v. Buccini, </em>201 Md.App. at 420, 29 A.3d 999 because of the \u201c \u2018need to provide some form of financial benefits to the injured or sick employees and the need, of both employers and employees, to avoid expensive and unpredictable litigation over accidents in the workplace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez v. Potomac Abatement, Inc., </em>417 Md. 76, 82 n. 4, 8 A.3d 737 (2010) (quoting <em>DeBusk v. Johns Hopkins Hospital, </em>342 Md. 432, 438, 677 A.2d 73 (1996)). <em>See Polomski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 76-77, 83, 684 A.2d 1338 (1996) (noting diverse interests). Nonetheless, courts are enjoined to construe workers\u2019 compensation legislation liberally. <em>See Keystone Masonry Corp. v.

In 1972, the scope of \u00a7 64A was expanded to include certain police officers as well, Ch. 282 of the Acts of 1972, and is currently codified and amended as \u00a7 9-503(a)-(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\"><em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 78, 684 A.2d 1338.

The emphasized language reflects an amendment to Section 9-503(e) that extends the dual recovery to qualified surviving dependents. <em>See </em>2007 Md. Laws, Chaps. 350, 351. This is the measure of recovery that has been sought by claimant in the case before us, and had been claimed unsuccessfully by Mrs. Ernest Johnson in 2005. We first review the decisions from this Court and the Court of Appeals in <em>Ernest Johnson v.

Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Ernest Johnson (no relation to the firefighter in the case before us), had served as a Baltimore City firefighter for thirty-two years. He was diagnosed with colon cancer, and died from that disease on March 11, 1994. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>dispute that his illness constituted an occupational disease, or that Mrs. Ernest Johnson was a wholly dependent survivor. She began receiving a service pension benefit from the City. She also filed a claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Both the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and the circuit court concluded that Mrs. Johnson was entitled to both the pension and the compensation benefits, subject to a set-off as provided in LE \u00a7 9\u2014503(e)(2), which capped the total weekly recovery in the amount of the firefighter\u2019s weekly salary, instead of the dollar-for-dollar offset directed by LE \u00a7 9-610, the Act\u2019s general offset provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The City appealed to this Court, which reversed. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City v.

There, we recognized the \u201ccore values\u201d of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, as well as the liberal construction required to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning, <em>id., </em>156 Md.App. at 594, 847 A.2d 1190, but cautioned that we may not \u201cstifle the plain meaning of the Act, or exceed its purposes, [just] so that the injured worker may prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

The needs and expectations of society, in addition to those of the work force, come into play.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 847 A.2d 1190 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that the General Assembly had inadvertently omitted language offering dual recovery in favor of dependents, we pointed out that, \u201c[w]hen an omission in the language of a statute ... appeared to be the obvious result of inadvertence, a court may not invade the function of the legislature by reading missing language into a statute[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>156 Md.App. at 596, 847 A.2d 1190 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed.

In ruling that the language of LE \u00a7 9~503(e) of the Act as written was unambiguous, and that there was no basis to conclude that the dependents of deceased firefighters would be entitled to dual benefits, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">The \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d for firefighters ... does not pertain to the provision for dual benefits found in \u00a7 9-503(e)....

Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000) is instructive. In that case, the Court confronted the issue of retroactive legislation in the context of three paternity actions. Two men who had been adjudged to be fathers sought to obtain blood or genetic testing in the hope of overturning declarations of paternity. The men sought relief under Section 5-1038 of the Family Law Article, as amended subsequent to their paternity adjudications. Md. Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). In short, application of the amended FL \u00a7 5\u20141038(a)(2)(i)2 would permit the men to challenge the adjudication of paternity on the basis of a blood or genetic test that would exclude them as the father. Notwithstanding the logic of their position, the attempts by the adjudicated fathers met with some resistance. The principal stumbling block to the use of new technology, either to ascertain the true father or rule out someone who clearly was not, was the fact that the operative amendments came after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>their paternity adjudications. The mothers asserted that stringent rules governing the revisory authority of the trial courts were to apply. They argued for the application of stringent revisory procedures pursuant to Md. Rule 2-535 that would constrain a circuit court\u2019s authority to revise an adjudication of paternity. This had been the holding of the Court in <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone W., </em>336 Md. 303, 648 A.2d 439 (1994), the case which prompted the General Assembly to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">A majority of the Court of Appeals in <em>Langston </em>ruled that the amendment to FL \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 should apply retroactively to afford relief to the adjudicated fathers, who were thus given the opportunity to rule out their paternity. Instead of the strict revisory rule set forth in Md. Rule 2-535 with its restrictive time constraints, FL \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 afforded access to a post-declaration blood or genetic test. The Court concluded that the General Assembly, in amending the statute, sought to negate the effects of the <em>Tandra S. </em>decision. Mindful of the presumption that amended statutes would be limited to prospective effect, the Court determined that the amendment was remedial and that it was aimed at all paternity claims and declarations. The legislative history of FL \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2 likewise showed the Legislature\u2019s concern with the <em>Tandra S. </em>decision and its implications. The Court explained that, \u201c[cjlearly, the perceived injustices to putative fathers in situations similar to the putative fathers in the <em>Tandra S. </em>case could not be remedied by legislation with a strictly prospective effect.\u201d <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 412, 754 A.2d 389 (footnote omitted). The <em>Langston </em>majority concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">We hold that the extensive legislative history in this case indicates that, in enacting Chapter 248, the General Assembly intended the Act to be remedial in nature. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out below, Chapter 248 \u201cis remedial in that it is an expansion of the equitable grounds on which a court may relieve from the effect of a paternity judgment an adjudged father who later has been determined not to be the biological father of the child in question.\u201d ... More simply, it is procedural and remedial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>that it relieves putative fathers from the effects of the <em>Tandra S. </em>opinion by expanding the procedure for remedying the perceived problem. In this case, it is appropriate to apply section 5-1038 retrospectively, due to the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to restore that provision to its originally intended purpose by providing putative fathers with an additional procedure or remedy to challenge prior paternity declarations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"><em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 417-18, 754 A.2d 389 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Although we recite the facts in <em>Langston </em>at length, we also conclude that <em>Langston </em>is inapt. The remedies and prudential underlay in that case bear little resemblance to the legislative relief fashioned in LE \u00a7 9-503(e). While the value of that decision is the exposition of the applicable law, the facts before us part company with those before the Court in that case because the legislative relief sought for the adjudicated fathers was \u201cprocedural and remedial,\u201d while the amendments to LE \u00a7 9-503(e) are, at bottom, substantive. To place more focus on our inquiry, we turn to an exposition of relevant law as set forth by Judge Wilner, writing for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASIO\">We have, over the years, stated a number of rules regarding the application of statutes to events that occurred prior to their effective date, and, although we have generally applied those rules consistently, we have not always been consistent in articulating them. In <em>WSSC v. Riverdale Heights Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 563-64, 520 A.2d 1319, 1323 (1987), we confirmed four basic principles of Maryland law: (1) statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent appears; (2) a statute governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending in court when the statute becomes effective; (3) a statute will be given retroactive effect if that is the legislative intent; but (4) even if intended to apply retroactively, a statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. We have restated several of those principles in subsequent cases, and they remain the framework for analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>When an issue is raised regarding whether a statute may be given retroactive effect, we engage in a two-part analysis. First, we must determine whether the Legislature intended the statute to have the kind of retroactive effect that is asserted. That implicates the first and third principles. Applying the presumption of prospectivity, a statute will be found to operate retroactively only when the Legislature \u201cclearly expresses an intent that the statute apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Waters v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>337 Md. [15] at 28, 650 A.2d [712] at 718 [ (1994) ]. The issue of intent sometimes becomes clouded when, as here, a statute can be regarded as being prospective in one sense and retroactive in another. As noted in <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Rel v. Amecom Div. [of Litton Sys.], </em>278 Md. 120, 123, 360 A.2d 1, 3-4 (1976), \u201ca statute, though applied only in legal proceedings subsequent to its effective date and in that sense, at least, prospective, is, when applied so as to determine the legal significance of acts or events that occurred prior to its effective date, applied retroactively.\u201d Context becomes important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">If we conclude that the Legislature <em>did </em>intend for the statute to have retroactive effect, we must then examine whether such effect would contravene some Constitutional right or prohibition. That implicates the second and fourth principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 289-90, 829 A.2d 611 (2003). <em>See generally, Pautsch v. Maryland Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>423 Md. 229, 263-64, 31 A.3d 489 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Claimant emphasizes that two of the basic principles apply to this case, the second and third, and that their application dictates a retroactive application of LE \u00a7 9-503(e). To reiterate, the four principles announced in <em>Kim </em>and prior cases are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">(1) statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent appears; (2) a statute governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending in court when the statute becomes effective; (3) a statute will be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>retroactive effect if that is the legislative intent; but (4) even if intended to apply retroactively, a statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aax-dedup-0\"><em>Kim, </em>376 Md. at 289, 829 A.2d 611. The first principle is always in play in a case such as this. The default presumption is that an amendment is forward-looking. Claimant also makes much of the fact that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a remedial statute, and avers that the amendments to LE \u00a7 9-503(e) must be judged in this context. To be sure, that is the special nature of such legislation. Nevertheless, the fact that the statute is remedial is not dispositive where other interests are at work, viz., substantive or vested rights that are affected by a change in the law. The amendment to LE \u00a7 9-503(e) is not procedural, and while respectful of the general remedial nature of workers\u2019 compensation legislation and, further assuming that the General Assembly sought to remedy what was considered a \u201cdefect\u201d in the existing law, we decline claimant\u2019s invitation to accept the retroactive temporal reach of the amended LE \u00a7 9-503(e). Although claimant\u2019s argument that the amendment to the Act is a remedial measure, her contention lacks sufficient force.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We may even assume that, absent clear language to that effect in the amendment, the General Assembly intended a retroactive application of the amendment to LE \u00a7 9~503(e). We recognize that there is language in both legislative bills that amended LE \u00a7 9-503 to suggest that the General Assembly thought that the prior version of LE \u00a7 9-503(e) authorized dual benefits to wholly dependent survivors such as the claimant before us. The title clause for each bill, Senate Bill 752 and House Bill 1117, states that the amendments were proposed \u201c[for] the purpose of <em>clarifying </em>that surviving dependents of certain individuals are eligible to receive the same workers\u2019 compensation benefits as the individual received at the time of death[.]\u201d In <em>Chesek v. Jones, </em>the Court noted that the use of the term \u201cclarifying\u201d in the purpose clause of a bill would be one factor in legislative interpretation. <em>Chesek, </em>406 Md. at 462, 959 A.2d 795. Certainly, there is authority from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>sister jurisdictions to the effect that a \u201cclarifying\u201d statute merely pronounces what has always been the law. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Fellows, </em>39 Cal.4th 179, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 49, 138 P.3d 200, 202 (2006). We are likewise mindful of expectations by legislators that are consistent with this view, and suggestions that, in practice, wholly dependent survivors had always been granted dual benefits. This is the manner of legislative debate and comment that is relevant to ascertaining legislative intent when other interpretive tools fall short, because legislative testimony that is well taken and remarks by legislators themselves shed light on the intent behind a proposed enactment. <em>See Toft v. State of Nevada ex rel. Pimentel, </em>108 Md.App. 206, 216, 671 A.2d 99 (1996). Yet, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Johnson </em>is conclusive\u2014LE \u00a7 9-503(e), the law in effect prior to the 2007 Amendments did not authorize dual benefits such as are sought in the case before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">... <em>even if intended to apply retroactively, a statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Assuming that the General Assembly sought to endow LE \u00a7 9-503(e) with the temporal reach that claimant seeks, the inquiry does not end with a finding of legislative intent. <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 418, 754 A.2d 389. This implicates the fourth principle set forth in <em>Kim </em>and related cases <em>viz., </em>\u201ca statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.\u201d The Court has observed that \u201ca remedial or procedural statute may not be applied retroactively if it will interfere with vested or substantive rights.\u201d <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 418, 754 A.2d 389. In <em>John Deere Constr. &amp; Forestry Co. v. Reliable Tractor, Inc., </em>406 Md. 139, 957 A.2d 595 (2008), the Court, drawing from the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Landgraf </em>defined retroactive application as \u201cone that \u2018would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\u2019 \u201d <em>John Deere, </em>406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Md. at 147, 957 A.2d 595 (quoting <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Notwithstanding legislative recognition of a \u201ccustom\u201d prior to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>[Ernest </em>] <em>Johnson, </em>the operative fact is that an enlarged class of persons is eligible to receive benefits not lawfully available to it prior to the 2007 amendments. We consider the decision by the Arkansas Court of Appeals in <em>Clevenger v. City of Jonesboro, </em>2011 Ark.App. 579, 2011 WL 4585587 (2011), to be instructive. Clevenger, a retired firefighter, appealed from a decision by the Arkansas Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ruling that the City of Jonesboro was entitled to an offset against his retirement disability benefits. At the time of Clevenger\u2019s injury, which ultimately resulted in his disability retirement, a provision of the Arkansas statute provided for a dollar-for-dollar reduction in an injured worker\u2019s benefits where the injured worker had previously received similar payments from other sources. <em>See </em>Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 ll-9-411(a)(2) (2008). The Arkansas legislature in 2009 amended the relevant provision to eliminate the setoff in certain instances and Clevenger asserted that the amended statute would have a retroactive effect and apply to his case to afford him relief from the setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">An administrative law judge ruled in Clevenger\u2019s favor, but the Commission reversed. The intermediate appellate court sided with the City on appeal and affirmed. The Court rejected Clevenger\u2019s complaint that the Commission erred by ruling that the statute was substantive and would not have retrospective application. The Court\u2019s rationale is relevant and merits extensive quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Clevenger concedes that section ll-9-411(a)(2) contains no language to suggest retroactivity; however, he relies on the holding of <em>Archer [v. Sisters of Mercy Health Sys., </em>375 Ark. 523, 294 S.W.3d 414 (2009) ] and attempts to draw a parallel that, like in <em>Archer, </em>and [sic] retroactive application is appropriate because the amendment alters only the City\u2019s available recovery remedies, not its vested rights. Indeed, in <em>Archer, </em>our supreme court concluded that the direct-action statute\u2014the subject of its review\u2014did not create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>new cause of action, because the negligence cause of action was firmly grounded in our state\u2019s common law and was regulated by statute. <em>Id. </em>at 529, 294 S.W.3d at 418. The court went on to note that <em>merely the remedy for recovery had changed, not the underlying fight to recover. Id. </em>at 529, 294 S.W.3d at 418. Thus, there is a notable distinction between the case presently at bar and the <em>Archer </em>precedent\u2014the underlying \u201ccause of action\u201d remained constant in <em>Archer, </em>the only thing that changed was the potential tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">Here, prior to 2009, the employer had a vested right to a setoff, yet after the amendment that right was obliterated. Our case law directs that any changes in statutes relating to vested rights are characterized as substantive and require application of the law as it existed at the time the claimant sustained a compensable injury. <em>Ark. State Police v. Welch, </em>28 Ark.App. 234, 772 S.W.2d 620 (1989). A vested right exists when the law declares that one has a claim, or that one may resist enforcement of a claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">The statutory amendment at issue in this case deals not with the procedure for enforcing a remedy provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but rather with the substance of the remedy itself, <em>i.e., </em>entitlement to retirement disability benefits. Before section (a)(2) was enacted, a claimant had no vested right to retirement disability benefits that had already been paid by other parties, and the employer had a vested right to a full setoff for those amounts. When section (a)(2) was enacted, it created a new vested right for injured workers and <em>altered that of employers. </em>Accordingly, because the statute is substantive and therefore cannot be applied retroactively to cover Cleven-ger\u2019s injury, the decision of the Commission is supported by substantial evidence, and we affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\"><em>Clevenger, </em>2011 Ark.App. 579 at \u00b6 4-5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Yaeger v. Delano Granite Works, </em>250 Minn. 303, 84 N.W.2d 363 (1957), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>is likewise instructive. An amendment to Minnesota\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute changed the source of additional compensation payments from a special compensation fund and imposed that obligation on employers and their carriers. The court held on constitutional grounds that the amendment would not apply, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">Where, as here, the liability of the employers and insurers has been fixed ... their vested right in such determined liability may not be destroyed by legislation which imposes a new obligation or an additional liability____In these cases the statute imposed a new obligation on the employer and insurer in that they were made liable for the payment of ... additional ... compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\"><em>Yaeger, </em>84 N.W.2d at 366 (citations omitted). In <em>Tedford v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., </em>738 N.W.2d 29 (N.D.2007), the WSI had been offsetting the claimant\u2019s federal social security retirement against his disability, pursuant to a statute that had been enacted subsequent to the date that he was determined to be totally disabled. The North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the statute did not apply. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">[A]n injured claimant receiving total disability benefits prior to enactment of a statutory retirement offset ... has a reliance interest in ... continued disability benefits.... Statutory amendments may not operate retrospectively to abrogate or change WSI\u2019s obligation to pay benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\"><em>Tedford, </em>738 N.W.2d at 34. <em>Cf.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>change in LE \u00a7 9-503(e) was intended by the General Assembly to address the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>and to clarify the law to provide for dual benefits to the surviving dependents of certain public employees who are presumed to have died because of their occupational disease. There is no clear directive from the General Assembly that the amendment should apply retrospectively. The amendment has an adverse impact on the size of the class of eligible claimants who would benefit, and this effects a substantive change in the \u201clegal landscape\u201d and enlarges the obligations of public employers. The amended law creates an \u201cobligation\u201d that the employer had not previously been required to meet. <em>See Layton v. Howard County Bd. of Appeals, </em>399 Md. 36, 48, 922 A.2d 576 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">\n<em>Postscript</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Claimant points out that, according to the legislative history, the financial impact on the State would be negligible. Yet, the impact from retroactive application of LE \u00a7 9~503(e) would not only be borne by the State, but by local governments.
