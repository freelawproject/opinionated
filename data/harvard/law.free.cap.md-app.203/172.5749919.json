The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted appellees\u2019 motion to transfer to the Circuit Court for Talbot County on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>where summary judgment was granted in favor of appellees. Appellants raise three issues on appeal, which we quote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in transferring this action under the doctrine of <em>Forum Non Conve-niens </em>from Baltimore City to Talbot County, when the trial court (1) failed to properly regard the appellants\u2019 choice of forum, and (2) the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice did not weigh strongly in favor of the appellees! ]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">II. Did the trial court err when it granted summary judgment for appelleesL ] when (1) there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the assistance or medical care provided by the appellees\u2019 employee, Chris Barbour, was provided without fee or compensation, (2) CJP \u00a7 5-603 (Good Samaritan [Act]) does not apply to a private, for-profit ambulance transportation company[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and (3) the trial court\u2019s decision was legally incorrect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>III. Did the trial court err when it granted summary judgment for appellees[] and determined that the appellees[ ] were a fire or rescue company within the meaning of CJP \u00a7 5-604?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We answer the first question in the negative and the second and third questions in the affirmative. As such, we affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s grant of the motion to transfer and reverse the Circuit Court for Talbot County\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On November 15, 2007, at approximately 6:15 p.m., Karen brought Bryson to the Memorial Hospital at Easton (\u201cEaston Memorial\u201d) Emergency Department in Talbot County with complaints of congestion and trouble breathing. An evaluation in the Emergency Department revealed that Bryson had tachycardia, bilateral rhonehi, and diffuse wheezing. Due to the degree of Bryson\u2019s respiratory distress, and as a precaution, at 7:35 p.m. Easton Memorial medical personnel electively intubated Bryson. After the intubation, a decision was made to transfer Bryson to University of Maryland Medical System\u2019s (\u201cUMMS\u201d) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit via helicopter, as Easton Memorial was unable to manage intubated children. UMMS contacted PHI Air Medical in order to effectuate the transfer. PHI Air Medical dispatched a helicopter and a pediatric transport team to Easton Memorial, consisting of several individuals, including a UMMS pediatric nurse and appellees\u2019 employee, Chris Barbour. Barbour was employed by appellees as a paramedic. In appellee\u2019s memorandum in support of the motion for summary judgment, they stated that: \u201cBarbour was a paramedic licensed by the State of Maryland to provide medical care at the time of the incident\u2014although he was still in paramedic orientation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>On November 16, 2007, at approximately 1:25 a.m., Bryson was placed on the helicopter for transport. Appellants allege that during transport, Bryson\u2019s airway became blocked by his endotracheal tube and he failed to receive sufficient oxygen. The transport team searched for a pediatric mask to deliver oxygen to Bryson, but were unable to locate the mask. As a result, the pilot landed at Bay Bridge Airport and located the mask for the transport team. Appellants contend that the oxygen mask was located too late and a lack of oxygen caused Bryson to suffer permanent brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In the memorandum in support of the Motion for Summary Judgment, appellees describe themselves as a \u201cground ambulance company.\u201d On November 9, 2009, Barbour testified in a deposition that appellee, TransCare Maryland, Inc. is \u201c[a] private ambulance company.\u201d At the time of Bryson\u2019s transfer, appellee, TransCare Maryland, Inc., held licenses to operate as an Advanced Life Support Commercial Ambulance Service, Basic Life Support Commercial Ambulance Service, and Neonatal Life Support Commercial Ambulance Service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is undisputed that appellees did not own or operate the helicopter that transferred Bryson and, with the exception of Barbour, did not employ any of the personnel who took part in Bryson\u2019s medical aircraft transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Appellees contract with UMMS to provide ground ambulance transport services. PHI Air Medical, a separate company, provides UMMS with air medical transport services. According to Theresa Drayer, the manager of Maryland Ex-pressCare, a part of UMMS, the contract between UMMS and each transportation provider is different. For ground ambulance transport services, UMMS has a contract with appellees under which UMMS pays appellees a monthly fee to provide ground equipment and personnel. For air medical transport services, UMMS has a contract with PHI Air Medical whereby PHI Air Medical provides air equipment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>personnel at its own expense and without any fee or other payment from UMMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On February 6, 2009, appellants filed a two-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging: (1) negligence/medical malpractice and (2) loss of parental relationship and extraordinary costs and expenses against appellees. In the negligence/medical malpractice count, appellants sued ap-pellees individually \u201cand/or through [their] actual and/or apparent agents, representatives, and/or employee, Mr. Barb[our.]\u201d Appellants alleged that appellees, individually and/or through Barbour, were negligent because, during Bry-son\u2019s transfer, Barbour failed to follow the requisite standard of care for paramedics. In the Complaint, appellants allege that Barbour failed to provide adequate care to Bryson by failing \u201cto remove the misplaced endotracheal tube and initiate masked ventilation or mouth-to-mouth breathing or intubation as appropriate,\u201d and by failing to promptly locate the oxygen mask. Appellants did not bring action against Barbour individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On March 27, 2009, appellees filed a Motion to Transfer to the Circuit Court for Talbot County on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>On April 8, 2009, appellants filed an Opposition to the Motion to Transfer. On April 15, 2009, appellees filed a Reply. On May 29, 2009, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City conducted a hearing on the Motion to Transfer. During the hearing, as to appellants\u2019 choice of forum, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">What\u2019s the connection to Baltimore City? I mean I understand that I am suppose[d] to give some deference to [appellants\u2019] choice of forum. But if [appellants] themselves or herself or whoever it is, resides in Talbot County, that kind of goes to the lower end of my analysis with regard to giving him that deference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted the Motion to Transfer to Talbot County, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>For the issues of Forum Non Convenient], it appears to this Court that the alleged occurrence occurred in Talbot County, that [appellants] live in Talbot County. Medical records, they could be in Baltimore City, they could be in Talbot County. But that\u2019s just pieces of paper tha[t] can be transferred by courier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">Key witnesses are located in Talbot County. Expert witnesses, experts choose to get into these cases. I\u2019m not too concerned with that. Further treatment and provision of care occurs in Talbot County, and there seems to be very minimal connection to Baltimore City. I don\u2019t even know if I saw Baltimore City mentioned in the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Now, I read some case law, 367 Maryland, that says, \u201cThe cause of action arises when the Plaintiff first experiences any injury from the alleged negligence of the Defendants.\u201d Soon after takeoff in Talbot County, onset of injuries occurred a few minutes after the aircraft[\u2019]s departure from Easton Memorial Hospital in Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">It appears that this incident is far removed from Baltimore City. There appears to be minimal connection to the community members of Baltimore City, that would not warrant an imposition on not only a congested docket, but a jury pool from Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">It appears that the local interest is most appropriately in the County of Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">Now, 1 have to balance that with you know, [appellants\u2019] choice of forum. However, [appellants] reside[] in Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Based on all the factors that I\u2019ve assessed, the Motion to Transfer for Forum Non Convenient], this case having full connections with Talbot County, minimal, minimal at best connection to Baltimore City, the motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">On the same day, the circuit court issued an Order consistent with the oral ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">On July 16, 2010, appellees filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in the Circuit Court for Talbot County. In the memorandum supporting the motion, appellees contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Bryson\u2019s negligence/medieal malpractice claim is precluded by the Good Samaritan Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Fire and Rescue Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellees contended that Karen\u2019s claim for loss of parental relationship is not recognized by Maryland law and sought to have the claim dismissed as a matter of law. On August 2, 2010, appellants filed an Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment arguing that the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Act are inapplicable to the circumstances of the case. In the Opposition, Karen withdrew the loss of parental relationship claim, but not the claim for extraordinary costs. On August 5, 2010, appellees filed a Reply to the Opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On August 9, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment. The circuit court denied the motion for summary judgment, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">Is it with the Court? All right, gentlemen, as I said I\u2019ve been through the files and this case ... presents the question of the interpretation of Sections 5-603, the Good Samaritan Statute, or as I like to call it, no good deed goes unpunished statute. And 5-604 the immunity that is granted to fire and rescue companies. And of course as you gentlemen know the question for the Court today is whether there are factual disputes, material factual disputes that will effect the outcome of the case. The Court does not read 5-603 exactly as counsel for [appellees] does. The Section A(2) states that a person is not civilly liable if the assistance of medical care is provided without fee or other compensation. [Appellees\u2019 counsel] points out very clearly that there was no fee charged to [appellant] in this matter, Bryson Murray, and therefore since no compensation flowed from the victim to Transcare then Transcare qualifies under the statute. It is argued by [appellants\u2019 counsel] and on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>of [appellants] that [appellees] could elect not to bill particularly where a procedure goes bad and there are significant and serious and devastating consequences such as here. There\u2019s no doubt about the injuries and the lifelong impairment that Bryson Murray will experience. The question is whether the statute was intended to require a showing that there was actual compensation paid. This Court does not read it that way. There is a factual dispute as to the compensation that was paid anyone. We know that the helicopter company was paid some forty some thousand dollars as I recall. But the helicopter company is not in this action. I am told that there was an accord reached with the helicopter company, Petroleum, whatever that name of it was, and the University of Maryland. That\u2019s, as I said earlier, those matters are not before me. There is a contract between the University of Maryland and Transcare and/or Express Care. And there are allegations that Trans-care and Express Care, and Maryland Express Care are one in the same. And there is not much doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that Chris Barb[our] was a part-time EMT that was assigned to this transfer from Easton to Baltimore of young Bryson Murray on the 15th day of November and some few minutes in the air because of the way he was intubated he was not getting the oxygen that he needed. There was difficulty in locating the bag valve mask, I believe is what that device is called, by Mr. Barb[our] and the pilot put the plane down, put the helicopter down at Bay Bridge Airport and they were able to locate the bag valve mask and proceeded on. But the precious moments without oxygen caused as I said significant permanent injury to young Bryson Murray. So there is indeed a dispute as to what compensation, if any, was paid. Clearly the helicopter company, which I suspect leases the helicopter to Express and Transcare of Maryland, or Express Care. And there is an exhibit in file showing a photograph of the particular helicopter with Express Care written on the side of it. Clearly those facts are in dispute. [Appellees\u2019 counsel] says Express Care and Transcare are not related, not joined at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the hip and that it is an error to suggest that it is. [Appellants\u2019 counsel] says, oh no, Transcare, Express Care is a subsidiary of Transcare and we all know that the EMT Mr. Barb[our] was employed at least at some point in time by Transcare. Whether he was paid for this, I don\u2019t know. And there is no way that this Court can know because he was paid a salary as I understand it as a part time EMT. I think he was working for the Waldorf Department of Utilities. This was a part time thing for him. On the issue of whether [appellees] qualify as a fire and rescue agency under Section 5-604, it seems certainly a dispute as to that. The case that we are pointed to are the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Sharon Chase, </em>which I\u2019ve quoted from which says that 5-604 ... was intended to grant immunity to fire and rescue companies be they municipal or volunteer. Well we know that Transcare Maryland Inc. is not a municipal or a volunteer fire company or a rescue company, but [appellees\u2019 counsel] points out that it would qualify as a rescue company because it\u2019s an ambulance company that was engaged in transferring this young man on the 16th of November 2007. The Court notes that 5-603 does specifically refer to ambulance companies whereas 5-604 only refers to fire companies and rescue companies as being immune. This Court cannot extend the interpretation of a fire and rescue company to mean at least I cannot, to mean that that includes an ambulance for a for profit company that is providing transfer services from Easton to Baltimore be it by land or air. There are significant disputes of fact, significant disputes of fact that are material to the outcome of this case. [Appellees\u2019 counsel] points out that [appellees are] entitled to summary judg[ ]ment as a matter of law. I cannot resolve those factual disputes. And I\u2019m afraid that either a jury or the Court of Appeals, Court of Special Appeals will have to do that for us by revisiting <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase </em>and deciding whether or not it extends to a private, for profit ambulance company. And I don\u2019t know the answer to that. And maybe we all won\u2019t know until the Court of Special Appeals decides it. But at this point I\u2019m going to deny the motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>I\u2019ll hear you [appellants\u2019 counsel] on [appellees\u2019 counsel]\u2019s suggestion that he would like to take an immediate appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judg[ ]ment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On August 19, 2010, appellees filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the denial of the Motion for Summary Judgment. On September 7, 2010, appellants filed an Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration. On September 16, 2010, appel-lees filed a Reply to appellants\u2019 Opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On September 23, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court granted the Motion for Reconsideration, ruling orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Very well. Gentlemen and lady this case presents rather interesting statutory interpretation questions to the Court. And as you know the thing that concerned me when we were here earlier on August the 9th was whether [appellees] could control its liability by simply electing not to bill for their services, which to me was a rather strained interpretation of the statute ... that provides for qualified immunity where a person who is licensed by the State of Maryland to provide medical care provides assistance without fe[e] or other compensation. And it was troublesome because the Court felt that to apply that statute in a way that [appellees] could control [their] liability [ ] gave the statute an illogical interpretation. It boils down essentially to whether in this case Transcare, there is no question in the Court\u2019s mind that Mr. Barb[our] was a person who was licensed by the State of Maryland to provide medical care. That has not been argued. The question under 5-603 is whether the assistance provided by Mr. Barb[our] and/or his employer, his principle was provided without fee or the compensation. The second question is under 5-604, and that is whether a private ambulance company, private for a fee ambulance company is covered under the statute with respect to fire and rescue companies. And I made the distinction because, earlier, because 5-603 specifically addresses ambulance companies, whereas 5\u2014603(b)(2) is a section that state where it\u2019s applicable it says a member of a state, county, municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>or volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad or law enforcement agency. And 5-604 does not use the word ambulance it only used fire and rescue companies as the, as the entities that are entitled to qualify for immunity. And certainly the General Assembly was aware of ambulance companies as being a component of 5-603 when they enacted 5-604, which I believe based on the reading of <em>Chase </em>was enacted as curative legislation because of a case that did not permit immunity for a paramedic with the Baltimore City I believe fire company. This Court is going to grant the motion to reconsider. And I\u2019m going to grant the motion for summary judg[ ]ment. This case needs to be considered by the Court. The Court has provided some instruction in <em>Chase. </em>And that instruction leads me to the conclusion that I have reached because of several things. 5-604 as interpreted by the Court in <em>Chase </em>says that it applies to both public, municipal and private fire and rescue companies. While I believe that the intent of the legislature was to cover volunteer fire companies which are often private and not connected with a municipality. <em>Chase </em>really doesn\u2019t say that. It doesn\u2019t distinguish. In a broad way it says the statute applies to all, public and private fire and rescue companies. The last sentence is clear 5-604 was intended to grant immunity to fire and rescue companies be they municipal or volunteer but earlier it says the statute clearly and unequivocally refers to the fire and rescue companies. There is no differentiation at all between public and private companies. And while the Court may have been talking about private companies in the sense of private volunteer fire companies, which all have ambulance services and rescue services, the case doesn\u2019t make that distinction. And this Court cannot parse the words of the Court to mean that the Court\u2019s reference to private companies is only with respect to volunteer fire companies. The language is clear in its meaning, public and private companies. Transcare is a private for profit company. The question of compensation is ever more ... of a matter that the Court needs to consider. The statute is clear, if the assistance is provided without fee or compensation qualified immunity attaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>provided by a person licensed by the State of Maryland to provide that care. In this case it\u2019s clear that Transcare did not receive compensation although it was employed by the University of Maryland Medical System on a monthly basis and it was paid on a monthly basis to be on stand-by. There is no evidence before this Court and it\u2019s not disputed that they did not [ ] charge a fee for Mr. Barb[our]\u2019s services that day as did the helicopter transport company, Petroleum Helicopter Services. And the cases say that the fee must be to the recipient, the victim in this case or the victim\u2019s parents. It\u2019s a question of law which this Court feels need not go to trial before it\u2019s determined by the Court of Special Appeals. And this Court is resolving ... this legal issue of immunity preliminarily so that the Court can determine whether I was right the first time or right this time or wrong both times, I don\u2019t know. But to require this case to go to trial without a determination by the Court of Special Appeals as to the immunity of Transcare under the statute to this member of the Court is unnecessary at this time. This Court feels that the interpretation of the statute cries for a judicial determination by minds that are far better than mine. And law clerks that are far better than mine because I don\u2019t have one. So, gentlemen, I\u2019m going to grant the motion and it\u2019s my sincere hope that you will get it to the Court of Special Appeals as soon as possible because the outcome is important not only because of young Bryson Murray but because of any other person who may have this issue to try later. It\u2019s a difficult one for this Court so I\u2019m going to grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Consistent with the oral ruling, on September 23, 2010, the circuit court issued an Order granting the Motion for Reconsideration and summary judgment in favor of appellees. On October 8, 2010, appellants noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Appellants contend that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City abused its discretion in transferring the action to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Circuit Court for Talbot County on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens </em>because: (1) the circuit court failed to give \u201cproper regard\u201d to appellants\u2019 choice of forum and (2) the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice weighed strongly in favor of denying the motion to transfer. Appellants maintain that the circuit court abused its discretion by giving only \u201csome deference\u201d to appellants\u2019 choice of forum, and that in doing so, the circuit court \u201cmisapplied\u201d case law that requires the court to give \u201cproper regard\u201d to appellants\u2019 choice of forum. Appellants acknowledge that a plaintiffs choice of forum has \u201cminimal value\u201d in a court\u2019s determination as to transfer of an action where the plaintiff is not a resident of the chosen forum, but contend that \u201cthis principle loses its force\u201d when the defendants, such as appellees, are also not residents of the chosen forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Appellants contend that the circuit court improperly weighed the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice factors. As to the convenience of the parties and witnesses, appellants argue that: (1) the circuit court improperly determined that the convenience of the parties weighed in favor of transferring the action, as there is no evidence that appellees reside, carry on regular business, are employed, or habitually engage in a vocation in Talbot County; (2) the circuit court failed \u201cto give any weight to the convenience of the expert witnesses;\u201d and (3) the circuit court improperly determined that the convenience of non-expert witnesses weighed in favor of granting the motion to transfer despite the fact that key witnesses are located in Baltimore City, such as the transport team, Bryson\u2019s treating physicians at UMMS, Johns Hopkins, and Kennedy Krieger, and Barbour, who works at UMMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As to the private interest factors, appellants maintain that this is a \u201ccomplex medical malpractice case\u201d and that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City is better equipped than the Circuit Court for Talbot County to handle a lengthy complex case with numerous expert and fact witnesses. As to the public interest factors, appellants contend that those factors weighed strongly in favor of denial of the motion to transfer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Appellants assert that Baltimore City has a \u201csignificant local interest\u201d in adjudication of the actions because: (1) providing safe medical transport is a significant interest to \u201cevery citizen in the state of Maryland, including Baltimore City;\u201d (2) Bryson was transported to UMMS in Baltimore City, pursuant to a contract between UMMS and the air transport company; (3) the transport team came from UMMS in Baltimore City; and (4) UMMS, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Kennedy Krieger Institute, all located in Baltimore City, provided the majority of Bryson\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Appellees respond that application of the legal standards for granting transfer on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens </em>to the facts of the case confirms that the circuit court properly granted the motion for transfer. Appellees argue that a plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum \u201cis not an absolute and uncontrolled privilege that is determinative under present <em>forum non con-veniens </em>law,\u201d and that the choice has minimal value, in a case such as this, where appellants are not residents of the forum in which they bring the action. Appellees contend that the \u201coverall convenience of the parties and witnesses to this action was best served through transfer of the action to the Circuit Court for Talbot County.\u201d Appellees argue that appellants are residents of Talbot County, and that healthcare providers and witnesses to Bryson\u2019s care and treatment at Easton Memorial, located in Talbot County, are also likely residents of Talbot County, thereby making it \u201cat least as convenient ... to travel to the courthouse as it [is] to travel to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Appellees maintain that the circuit court properly determined that private interest factors, such as ensuring ease of access to evidence, the availability of compulsory process, the cost of obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and \u201cother practical considerations\u201d weighed in favor of the transfer. As to public interest factors, appellees contend that because the action involves matters unrelated to the citizens of Baltimore City but of local interest to the community in Talbot County, the circuit court correctly determined that the public interest factors of court congestion and the burden of jury duty on the community weighed in favor of transferring the case to Talbot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>County. Specifically, appellees maintain that \u201c[t]he acts or omissions at issue in treating a resident of Talbot County, while still in Talbot County, neither affect the community members of Baltimore City nor warrant the imposition of jury duty on the residents of Baltimore City.\u201d Appellees argue that based on the circuit court\u2019s consideration of all of the factors and reasoned analysis, \u201cit cannot be said that no reasonable court would [have found] that transfer of venue was warranted.\u201d Simply put, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Maryland Rule 2-327(c) states that \u201c[o]n motion of any party, the court may transfer any action to any other circuit court where the action might have been brought if the transfer is for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and serves the interests of justice.\u201d In reviewing a grant of a motion to transfer under Md.

The record reflects that during the hearing on the Motion to Transfer, the circuit court stated: \u201cWhat\u2019s the connection to Baltimore City? I mean I understand that I am suppose[d] to give some deference to [appellants\u2019] choice of forum. But if [appellants] themselves ... reside! ] in Talbot County, that kind of goes to the lower end of my analysis with regard to giving [them] that deference.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>demonstrates that the circuit court weighed and considered appellants\u2019 choice. As we have previously noted, \u201cthe exercise of a judge\u2019s discretion is presumed to be correct ... [and] a trial judge\u2019s failure to state each and every consideration or factor ... does not, absent more, constitute an abuse of discretion, so long as the record supports a reasonable conclusion that appropriate factors were taken into account in the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Payton-Henderson, </em>180 Md.App. at 286, 949 A.2d 654 (internal quotations, citation, and emphasis omitted). We see no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s consideration of appellants\u2019 choice of forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Upon review of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the motion to transfer, we conclude that the circuit court properly evaluated the motion under the <em>forum non conveniens </em>factors\u2014convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice. When evaluating the convenience of the parties, the circuit court noted that appellants \u201clive in Talbot County.\u201d Appel-lees\u2019 principal place of business is not in either Baltimore City or Talbot County. As to expert witnesses, the circuit court stated that \u201cexperts choose to get into these cases. I\u2019m not too concerned with that.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s finding on the matter of expert witnesses was not an abuse of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>light of our previous holding that little weight is to be accorded to the convenience of expert witnesses. <em>Smith, </em>169 Md.App. at 302, 900 A.2d 301 (A plaintiffs \u201callegation about his possible expert is entitled to some weight, but not much.\u201d). As to non-expert witnesses, the circuit court stated that \u201c[k]ey witnesses are located in Talbot County.\u201d Although the non-expert witnesses were not specifically listed or identified by the circuit court in its oral ruling, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that residents of Talbot County would be called to testify at trial, including doctors and nurses from Easton Memorial who treated Bryson, and appellants themselves. As such, the record demonstrates the circuit court considered the convenience of the parties and witnesses and determined that this was a factor that weighed in favor of transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Insofar as the interests of justice are concerned, the circuit court properly weighed and considered the public and private interest factors and found them to weigh in favor of granting the Motion to Transfer to Talbot County. As to the private interest factors, the circuit court observed that ease of access to sources of proof was not an issue as medical records, whether located in Talbot County or Baltimore City, are easily transported. Although there were no premises to be viewed, the circuit court stated that \u201cthe alleged occurrence occurred in Talbot County\u201d and that \u201c[s]oon after takeoff in Talbot County, onset of injuries occurred a few minutes after the [aircraft[\u2019]s departure from Easton Memorial Hospital in Talbot County.\u201d Thus, the circuit court was persuaded that the private interests of justice inherent to the specific case weighed in favor of transfer to Talbot County. As we stated in <em>Stidham, </em>\u201c[fjhere is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\u201d 161 Md.App. at 571, 870 A.2d 1285 (quotations and citation omitted). We perceive no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s analysis of the private interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">As to the public interest factors, or those factors of general concern to the community, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Further treatment and provision of care occurs in Talbot County, and there seems to be very minimal connection to Baltimore City ... It appears that this incident is far removed from Baltimore City. There appears to be minimal connection to the community members of Baltimore City, that would not warrant an imposition on not only a congested docket, but a jury pool from Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">It appears that the local interest is most appropriately in the County of Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The circuit court\u2019s ruling demonstrates that the court considered most, if not all, of the public interests of justice factors outlined by this Court in <em>Stidham, </em>161 Md.App. at 569, 870 A.2d 1285, including \u201ccourt congestion, the burden of jury duty, and local interest in the matter\u201d at hand. In <em>Payton-Henderson, </em>180 Md.App. at 272-73, 294, 949 A.2d 654, we found no error in the determination by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that there was a high degree of local interest in the case in Baltimore County, which warranted transfer of the case on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">A possibly protracted trial involving numerous witnesses is a burden properly to be assumed by the Baltimore County court system and not one that should be foisted onto the strained court system of Baltimore City. There is no reason, moreover, why the cost and obligation of jury service should be cast upon the citizens of Baltimore City for the trial of a matter of more vital and immediate concern to the citizens of Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 294, 949 A.2d 654. A similar rationale is applicable in this case. Talbot County has a significant local interest in the case because Bryson, a Talbot County resident, was taken to a hospital in Talbot County and intubated there. As discussed above, the circuit court noted the injury \u201coccurred in Talbot County,\u201d starting in Easton Memorial and continuing into transport in the aircraft over Talbot County. Appellants brought this action as a result of injury occurring before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Bryson\u2019s arrival in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As such, the component of local interest in the matter as both a private and public interest factor weighed strongly in favor of transfer. The circuit court considered factors such as imposition on the court\u2019s docket and jury pool and determined that there was \u201cminimal connection to ... Baltimore City, that would [ ] warrant an imposition on not only a congested docket, but a jury pool from Baltimore City.\u201d In <em>Payton-Henderson, </em>180 Md.App. at 293, 949 A.2d 654, we determined that the circuit court, utilizing the same grounds, gave proper weight to the public interest consideration for transfer of the case to Baltimore County. For all of the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the circuit court properly weighed the factors applicable in a <em>forum, non conveniens </em>review, and properly exercised its discretion in granting the motion to transfer because the case \u201chad minimal at best connection to Baltimore City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees because the Good Samaritan Act, CJP \u00a7 5-603, does not apply to private commercial ambulance companies and, therefore, appellees are not immune under the Act. Appellants maintain that the legislative history of the Good Samaritan Act demonstrates that \u201cit has never been amended to include a private, for-profit ambulance company!]\u201d and that the General Assembly did not intend to provide immunity to \u201ca private, for-profit ambulance company! ]\u201d like appellees. Appellants argue that the Good Samaritan Act \u201cdoes not require the patient to be charged a fee\u201d for services rendered and \u201cdoes not indicate that \u2018fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and/or other compensation\u2019 is specifically limited to payment or compensation directly from the patient.\u201d Appellants contend that appellees \u201cdid in fact receive or had the legal right to receive a fee or compensation for the time that Mr. Barbour provided assistance or medical care to Bryson[,]\u201d and that appellees cannot evade liability by choosing not to bill a patient. Appellants argue that appellees do, \u201cin fact bill patients ... contractually through UMMS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Appellees respond that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment under the Good Samaritan Act in their favor. Appellees argue that the Act \u201capplies to any individual licensed by the State to provide medical care[,]\u201d and that the Act covers Barbour, who was a licensed paramedic member of an ambulance squad at the time of the incident. Appellees contend that because Barbour, their employee, is immune under the Act, they also are immune. Appellees maintain that the \u201c\u2018for-profit\u2019 status of a medical care provider or entity does not create a blanket prohibition on the application of the Good Samaritan statute.\u201d Appellees contend that they meet the three basic requirements of the Good Samaritan Act, in that: (1) there was no act or omission of gross negligence; (2) the act or assistance was provided without fee or other compensation; and (3) the assistance or medical care was provided in transit to a medical facility. Appellees argue they are, therefore, afforded immunity under the Act\u2019s application. As to the second requirement, of no fee or other compensation, appellees contend that they \u201cbilled in accordance with the usual practices of all entities involved!,]\u201d and that they (appel-lees) did not receive compensation through their contract with UMMS barring application of the Good Samaritan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md.

Our review is \u201ctwo-fold,\u201d in that we determine first, whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact, and second, whether the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a material fact is in dispute, a trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>must give great deference to the non-moving party as well as review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Lipscomb v.

We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">(Citing <em>Lockshin v.

The Good Samaritan Act, codified at CJP \u00a7 5-603 and titled \u201cEmergency medical care,\u201d provides immunity to a broad class of rescuers and medical providers for any act or omission in giving assistance or medical care provided without fee or other compensation, unless grossly negligent, (1) at the scene of an emergency, (2) in transit to a medical facility, or (3) through communications with personnel providing emergency assistance.

The Act does not provide a definition of \u201cperson,\u201d \u201cindividual,\u201d or \u201cmember.\u201d A review of the plain meaning of those terms, however, supports the conclusion a private commercial ambulance company, is not covered by those terms, and, therefore, is not immune by application of the Act. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1178 (8th ed. 1999), defines \u201cperson\u201d as: \u201cA human being.\u2014Also termed <em>natural person.\u201d See also </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 924 (11th ed. 2003) (\u201cPerson\u201d is defined as \u201chuman, individual.\u201d) \u201cIndividual\u201d is defined as: \u201c1.

In order for a company or corporate entity to enjoy the immunity provided under the Good Samaritan Act, that company or corporate entity must qualify under either (b)(3) or (b)(4). Subsection (b)(3) clearly applies to volunteer fire departments or ambulance and rescue squads whose members have immunity, and subsection (b)(4) applies only to a corporation when its fire department personnel are immune under (b)(2). Subsection (b)(3) is clearly inapplicable as it is undisputed that appellee, TransCare Maryland Inc., is a private commercial ambulance company, and not a volunteer ambulance squad. Subsection (b)(4) is inapplicable as well as appellees have not contended that they maintain, or are, a fire department, or that Barbour was employed as \u201cfire department personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In their brief, appellees expressly acknowledge that the Good Samaritan Act \u201capplies to any individual licensed by the State to provide medical care.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellees wrongly conclude, however, that because Barbour could be immune under the Act, they too are immune. That simply is not the case; when the General Assembly wishes to provide immunity to companies or corporations, it is capable of doing so and has done so. For example, the Fire and Rescue Act, codified at CJP \u00a7 5-604, clearly provides immunity to \u201ca fire company or rescue company, and the personnel of a fire company or rescue company.\u201d (Emphasis added). For all of the reasons stated above, we conclude that under a plain language analysis, CJP \u00a7 5-603 does not provide immunity to private commercial ambulance companies that are not \u201cpersons,\u201d \u201cindividuals,\u201d or \u201cmembers\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(2) Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In <em>Tatum v.

Chapter 616, Laws of Maryland 1969, added coverage for members and employees of fire departments or ambulance and rescue squads. Of interest to our analysis [in <em>Tatum, </em>] is the fact that the legislature dropped the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d that preceded \u201cambulance and rescue squads\u201d when it amended the law in 1969.[]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">In 1970 the General Assembly completely revised the \u201cPractitioners of Medicine\u201d subtitle in Article 43, which contained the Good Samaritan Law. That law was renumbered as \u00a7 132 of Article 43, but otherwise was left basically intact. Finally in 1976, the General Assembly repealed and reenacted the Good Samaritan Law, consolidating the various provisions that had been enacted over the years into four subsections found in the applicable statute at the time of this incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In 1982, in House Bill 523, Chapter 770, \u00a7 4, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 132 of Article 43, and recodified the Good Samaritan Act at CJP \u00a7 5-309. In 1982, CJP \u00a7 5-309 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">(A) Immunity for Special Personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">A person described in subsection (B) of this section is not civilly liable for any act or omission in giving any assistance or medical care, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">(1) The act or omission is not one of gross negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(2) The assistance or medical care is provided without fee or other compensation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">(3) The assistance or medical care is provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">(i) At the scene of an emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(ii) In transit to a medical facility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">(iii) Through communications with personnel providing emergency assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">(B) Special Personnel Included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Subsection (A) of this section applies to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">(1) An individual who is licensed by this State to provide medical care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">(2) A member of any State, county, municipal, or volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad, or law enforcement agency, or of the National Ski Patrol System, if the member:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">(i) Has completed an American Red Cross course in advanced first aid and has a current card showing that status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">(ii) Has completed an equivalent of an American Red Cross course in advanced first aid, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">(iii) Is certified by this State as an emergency medical technician or cardiac rescue technician; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">(3) A volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad whose members have immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">(C) Immunity For Other Individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">An individual who is not covered otherwise by this section is not civilly liable for any act or omission in providing assistance or medical aid to a victim at the scene of an emergency, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">(1) The assistance or aid is provided in a reasonably prudent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">(2) The assistance or aid is provided without fee or other compensation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-20\">(3) The individual relinquishes care of the victim when someone who is licensed or certified by this State to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>medical care or services becomes available to take responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The General Assembly stated the purpose of the amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Subsection (a) of this section establishes the standards for granting immunity from tort liability for persons providing emergency medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Subsection (b) of this section describes the persons who are not liable if the standards of subsection (a) are met. Subsection (c) of this section describes an individual who is not covered by subsection (b) of this section\u2014i.e., one who is not trained in providing medical care.

In fact, the legislative history specifically demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to extend immunity to certain persons and corporations, but not private commercial ambulance companies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As stated above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>in 1982, in House Bill 1872, Chapter 775, the General Assembly carved out two types of corporate entities for which immunity would be provided\u2014(1) \u201cA volunteer fire department, ambulance and rescue squad whose members have immunity\u201d and (2) \u201cA corporation when its fire department personnel are immune under paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d At no point did the General Assembly seek to include private commercial ambulance companies or corporations. A review of the legislative history clearly demonstrates that the Good Samaritan Act does not provide immunity to private commercial ambulance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">(3) Relevant Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Relevant case law supports the conclusion that private commercial ambulance companies are not protected from civil liability under the Good Samaritan Act. The few cases addressing applicability of the Good Samaritan Act demonstrate that the Act applies to persons, not corporate entities like appellees. In <em>Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 562, 565 A.2d 354, this Court held that a \u201csalaried emergency medical technician\u201d of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department was immune under the Good Samaritan Act. In <em>McCoy v. Hatmaker, </em>135 Md.App. 693, 705, 763 A.2d 1233 (2000), we affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of an ambulance paramedic employed by Baltimore City and a Baltimore City police officer on the basis of the Good Samaritan Act \u201cbecause Maryland law affords them immunity from civil damages in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\u201d We know of no reported Maryland appellate authority extending immunity to a private commercial ambulance company, or to any company or corporation, under the Good Samaritan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the Good Samaritan Act does not apply to private commercial ambulance companies. As such, we need not address the parties\u2019 other contentions as to the Act\u2019s applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in granting appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment as appellees are neither a fire nor a rescue company as described in the Fire and Rescue Act, CJP \u00a7 5-604. Appellants argue that CJP \u00a7 5-604 is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case given the plain and obvious meaning of the statutory language. Appellants contend that the legislative history of CJP \u00a7 5-604 demonstrates that the statute is inapplicable because the General Assembly intended CJP \u00a7 5-604 to protect fire departments, not private commercial ambulance companies, such as appellees, acting in a situation that did not involve a rescue or an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellees respond that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in their favor on the ground that they are immune from civil liability as a \u201crescue company\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-604. Appellees contend that all of the factors contained in CJP \u00a7 5-604 necessary to establish immunity are satisfied, as there was no willful or grossly negligent act, TransCare Maryland, Inc. is a rescue company, and the act or omission occurred in the course of TransCare Maryland, Inc. performing its duties. Specifically, as to the second factor of CJP \u00a7 5-604, appellees contend that an ambulance company satisfies the definition of a rescue company for purposes of CJP \u00a7 5-604, and that whether or not the ambulance company acts for profit is irrelevant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Upon review of the plain language of CJP \u00a7 5-604, its legislative history, and relevant statutes and case law, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(1) Plain Language</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The issue in this case is whether appellees are protected from civil liability under CJP \u00a7 5-604, titled \u201cFire and rescue companies,\u201d and, as a result, are entitled to summary judgment. CJP \u00a7 5-604 contains no definition of the term \u201crescue company\u201d and Maryland appellate courts have not addressed the issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">CJP \u00a7 5-604 provides immunity from civil liability to members of fire and rescue companies and to the companies themselves for any act or omission performed in the course of their duties, unless the act or omission is willful or grossly negligent. CJP \u00a7 5-604 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">(a) Immunity from civil liability.\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except for any willful or grossly negligent act, a fire company or rescue company, and the personnel of a fire company or rescue company, are immune from civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing their duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">A review of the plain meaning of the terms within CJP \u00a7 5-604 supports the conclusion that a private commercial ambulance company does not satisfy the definition of the term \u201crescue company.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1833 (8th ed. 1999), defines \u201crescue\u201d as: \u201cThe act or an instance of saving or freeing someone from danger or captivity.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1059 (11th ed. 2003), defines \u201crescue\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">[T]o free from confinement, danger, or evil: save, deliver: as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">a: to take (as a prisoner) forcibly from custody</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">b. to recover (as a prize) by force</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>c: to deliver (as a place under siege) by armed force</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\"><em>syn </em>Rescue, Deliver, Redeem, Ransom, Reclaim, Save</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Save may replace any of the foregoing terms; it may further imply a preserving or maintaining for usefulness or continued existence &lt;an operation that <em>saved </em>my life&gt;.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8D\">An ambulance is defined as \u201ca vehicle equipped for transporting the injured or sick.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 39 (11th ed. 2003). To conclude that an ambulance company by definition is a \u201crescue company\u201d would distort the plain meaning of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">To the extent appellees contend that under CJP \u00a7 5-604 no distinction is made between volunteer and for-profit or public and private rescue companies, they are correct. The statute, by its plain language, does not exempt private or commercial rescue companies from immunity. The requirement, however, is that the entity in question be a fire or rescue company. A private commercial ambulance company, or any company that is not a rescue or fire company is not afforded immunity under the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Although the question arises as to whether an ambulance company performing the duties of a rescue company is afforded immunity, we need not answer this question. The statute does not by its plain meaning provide immunity to any company or entity performing rescue duties. The statute requires both\u2014that the company be a fire or rescue company and that the alleged acts or omissions be in the course of the company or their personnel performing their official duties. Thus, it is not necessary that we determine whether appellees were performing the duties of a rescue company.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>conclude, for all of the reasons above, that under a plain language analysis, CJP \u00a7 5-604 does not provide immunity to a private commercial ambulance company that is neither a fire nor rescue company.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(2) Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In 1964, Subsection (a) of Health Article, 43 \u00a7 149A of the Maryland Annotated Code (1957/1965 Repl.Vol.) titled \u201cLiability for civil damages of physicians, nurses and members of volunteer ambulance and rescue squads,\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">(a) A physician licensed to practice medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Maryland, who, in good faith, renders medical aid, care, not in a hospital, and assistance for which the physician received no fee or compensation, at the scene of an accident, shall not be liable for any civil damages as the result of any professional acts or omissions by him, not amounting to gross negligence, in rendering such aid, care, and assistance. The physician shall have a defense against any action, not amounting to gross negligence, for negligence or malpractice brought against him because of any professional acts or omissions in the rendering of such care, aid and assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In 1964, in Senate Bill 43, Chapter 48, the Senate proposed amending Md.

The Court interpreted CJP \u00a7 5-604 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">[F]rom the standpoint of statutory construction, it is important that the statute started with a narrow focus-to exempt volunteer fire companies-and ended worded much more broadly-referring simply to \u201ca fire company or rescue company, and the personnel of a fire company or rescue compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ny.\u201d That most emphatically supports the argument that the petitioners make, that the Legislature, by enacting the statute, intended to immunize all fire and rescue companies and their personnel and that immunization is \u201cfrom civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing their duties.\u201d In point of fact, the statute in this regard is quite clear and unambiguous. Reading the statute reveals not a bit of ambiguity as to the scope of its reach and, giving the words of the statute their ordinary meaning, as we are required to do ... The statute is rendered even clearer when it is recalled that the Legislature knows how to differentiate between voluntary fire companies and municipal fire companies and has done so clearly whenever that is what it intended. . See Maryland Code (1973,1998 RepLVol., 1999 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 5-603 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">(Some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 132-33, 756 A.2d 987, the Court of Appeals addressed immunity for individuals under CJP \u00a7 5-604 and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">The breadth of \u00a7 5-604 can not be questioned; it specifically states that it applies to \u201cany act or omission [of a fire or rescue company, or their personnel] in the course of performing their duties.\u201d Nor is there any doubt as to who falls within its grant of immunity. The statute clearly and unequivocally refers to fire or rescue companies; there is no differentiation at all between public and private companies. Indeed, as we have seen, the statute started with that limitation, at its introduction it applied only to volunteer companies, but ended without it, indicating the Legislature\u2019s intention, arrived at during the passage of the legislation through the General Assembly, to broaden its coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Although the legislative history of CJP \u00a7 5-604 and the broad focus of its clear and unambiguous language supports the proposition that the statute is applicable to fire and rescue companies regardless of whether they are volunteer, municipal, or for profit, nothing in the legislative history demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>strates an intent to extend immunity to private commercial ambulance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">(3) Relevant Statutes and Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Relevant statutes and case law support the conclusion that a private commercial ambulance company is not protected from civil liability under CJP \u00a7 5-604. As noted above, CJP \u00a7 5-604 contains no definition of the term \u201crescue company,\u201d however, provisions of the Maryland Code and the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) provide distinct definitions for \u201ccommercial ambulance companies\u201d and \u201cfire and rescue companies\u201d in different contexts. We shall look to these statutes and regulations for guidance. COMAR 11.17.20.02(B)(6),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> defines \u201cfire and rescue organization\u201d as \u201ca Maryland fire department, rescue squad, emergency medical services unit, or volunteer fire company that is authorized to operate emergency vehicles for fire and rescue purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Md.Code Ann., Ed. Art. \u00a7 13-515,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> entitled \u201cAmbulance Service\u201d provides that the term: \u201c \u2018Ambulance services\u2019 does not include the transporting of individuals in an ambulance owned, operated, or under the jurisdiction of a unit of State government, a political subdivision of the State, of a volunteer fire company or volunteer rescue squad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">COMAR 30.09.01.02(B)(13)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">(a) \u201cCommercial ambulance service\u201d means an individual, firm, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>association, or organization engaged in the business of transporting, by ambulance, individuals who are sick, injured, wounded, or otherwise incapacitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">(b) \u201cCommercial ambulance service\u201d does not include transporting individuals in an ambulance owned by, operated by, or under jurisdiction of a unit of State government, a political subdivision of the State, a volunteer fire company, a volunteer ambulance company, or a volunteer rescue squad or other jurisdictional EMS operations program recognized by the EMS board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">These definitions demonstrate that a commercial ambulance company has not been defined in the Maryland Code or COMAR as a fire or rescue company, and lead us to conclude that a commercial ambulance company is not a fire or rescue company under C JP \u00a7 5-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Md.Code Ann., Pub. Safety \u00a7 8-102<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> provides that State money can be used for \u201cfire or rescue equipment, including ambulances[,]\u201d thereby indicating that an ambulance may be considered fire or rescue equipment for the allocation of State funds. <em>Id. </em>This statute does not address the issue of whether a private commercial ambulance company is a fire and rescue company under CJP \u00a7 5-604. The statute merely permits State money to be used for rescue or fire equipment, including ambulances. Sound logic dictates that because the General Assembly deemed it necessary to specify the provision of State money for ambulances, the General Assembly was aware that ambulances are not encompassed by the definition of fire and rescue equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We discern no support in relevant case law or statutes for the proposition that a private commercial ambulance company is a fire or rescue company. In <em>McCoy, </em>135 Md.App. at 705, 763 A.2d 1233, we affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, including an ambulance paramedic employed by Baltimore City, holding that \u201cMaryland law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>afford[ed] them immunity from civil damages in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\u201d We concluded that Maryland law\u2014through the Good Samaritan Act and the Fire and Rescue Company Act-provides immunity to \u201cfire, rescue, and law enforcement personnel from civil damages for errors and omissions made while acting in the scope of their duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>McCoy, </em>135 Md.App. at 701, 763 A.2d 1233, Hatmaker, a Baltimore City ambulance paramedic, responded to a call to provide emergency assistance to McCoy, whom he concluded was dead and not a viable candidate for resuscitation. McCoy\u2019s widow brought suit alleging that Hatmaker was grossly negligent and therefore not immune under CJP \u00a7 5-603 or CJP \u00a7 5-604. <em>McCoy, </em>135 Md.App. at 703-04, 763 A.2d 1233. In reviewing Hatmaker\u2019s immunity under the Fire and Rescue Company Act, we concluded that the Act \u201censures that members of fire and rescue companies, like Hatmaker, \u2018are immune from civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing their duties,\u2019 except for those acts that are willful or grossly negligent.\u201d <em>McCoy, </em>135 Md.App. at 705, 763 A.2d 1233 (quoting CJP \u00a7 5-604(a)). The issue before this Court was whether Hatmaker\u2019s conduct constituted gross negligence under CJP \u00a7 5-604. We specifically noted that McCoy\u2019s widow conceded that the immunity provisions of CJP \u00a7 5-603 and CJP \u00a7 5-604 applied, absent a willful or grossly negligent act. <em>McCoy, </em>135 Md.App. at 704-05, 763 A.2d 1233. As such, we did not address whether Hatmaker was employed by a fire or rescue company given his status as an employee of the city department responsible for responding to emergencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 123, 756 A.2d 987, the Court of Appeals held that CJP \u00a7 5-604 applied to municipal fire and rescue departments and their employees, as well as to volunteer fire and rescue companies and their employees. The Court of Appeals found that whether a fire or rescue company is public or private is irrelevant to CJP \u00a7 5-604\u2019s application, but did not define the term \u201crescue company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be sure, the Court stated there is no differentiation between public and private companies. Again, the threshold requirement is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the entity be a fire or rescue company. In <em>Chase, </em>the employer was the Baltimore City Fire Department. One of the petitioners was an emergency medical technician, a paramedic, employed by the Fire Department. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 756 A.2d 987. The Court of Appeals was not confronted with the question of whether or not the employer was a rescue company. As such, the Court was not required to explore the definition of the term \u201crescue company,\u201d and most certainly did not address the issue of whether a private commercial ambulance company is a rescue company. Under the circumstances of the cases, contrary to appellees\u2019 position, the proposition that private commercial ambulance companies are covered by CJP \u00a7 5-604 is not implicit in the <em>Hatmaker </em>and <em>Chase </em>opinions, nor do the opinions provide any guidance on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Appellee\u2019s argument that CJP \u00a7 5-604 is applicable because there was an emergency is without merit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Paramountly, the statute does not require the existence of an \u201cemergency\u201d as a prerequisite for its applicability. The clear language of the statute provides that for immunity, fire or rescue companies must not commit a willful or grossly negligent act and must be performing \u201ctheir duties,\u201d which could include a vast number of activities outside of a rescue, emergency, or fire. <em>See Kovatch Mobile Equip. Corp. v. Frederick County Maint. Dep\u2019t and Frederick County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>62 Va. Cir. 52, 54, 2003 WL 21382434 (Va.Cir.Ct.2003) (applying Maryland law) (The Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke, Virginia held that \u201c[m]odifications, alterations, maintenance, or otherwise, made on a fire truck\u2019s battery system, drive system, engine, or otherwise, are all clearly included within the potential duties of a fire department, particularly if a broad construction is applied [to CJP \u00a7 5-604].\u201d). Given that the existence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>emergency is not a requirement of CJP \u00a7 5-604, to hold that appellees are immune under CJP \u00a7 5-604 would afford, for example, private commercial ambulance companies engaged in routine patient transfers such as transferring a patient from a hospital to a nursing home, immunity from civil liability under the Act. This would not be a salutary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Most conspicuously, however, it is evident from the record and the circumstances surrounding Bryson\u2019s intubation that appellees were not responding to a medical emergency. Bry-son was electively intubated, by staff with knowledge that Easton Memorial was unable to care for Bryson once the procedure was completed and that Bryson would need to be transported to another facility. Bryson\u2019s condition prior to transport was not described in the record as one requiring emergency assistance. In the Complaint filed on February 6, 2009, appellants described the incident, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">An evaluation by the Emergency Department physician revealed that Bryson had tachycardia, bilateral rhonchi, and diffuse wheezing. Due to the degree of Bryson\u2019s respiratory distress, and as a precautionary measure, at 7:35 p.m. he was electively intubated. As Easton Memorial Hospital is not equipped to manage children that are intubated, Bryson had to be transferred to a hospital that could safely and effectively manage his care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">A call made to University of Maryland Express Care found that there was an available bed in the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation (\u201cUMMSC\u201d) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. UMMSC agreed to accept Bryson and to send a Pediatric Transport Team to bring Bryson to UMMSC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">The Team arrived at Easton Memorial Hospital at or about 11:30 p.m., received reports from Easton\u2019s Health Care Providers, and took over Bryson\u2019s care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUG\">According to appellant, a transport team arrived approximately four hours after Bryson was intubated, only after Easton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>contacted UMMS to determine if the hospital could take Bryson.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In this case, appellees and their employee, Barbour, were participating in a training opportunity as PHI Air Medical and employees from PHI Air Medical and UMMS transferred Bryson to UMMS. Barbour was a private commercial ambulance paramedic participating in Bryson\u2019s transfer for training purposes, unlike Hatmaker, who was a municipal employee of the city department dispatched to render emergency assistance. McCoy, 135 Md.App. at 701, 763 A.2d 1233. There was no genuine dispute of fact as to the nature of appellees\u2019 businesses\u2014appellee TransCare Maryland, Inc. acknowledged being a licensed commercial ambulance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we conclude, based on a plain language analysis, the legislative history, and relevant case law and statutes, that a private commercial ambulance company is not, by definition, a fire or rescue company entitled to immunity under CJP \u00a7 5-604. We hold that appellee, TransCare Maryland, Inc., a private commercial ambulance company, is not a rescue company under CJP \u00a7 5-604 and, as such, appellees are not entitled to immunity under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED AS TO THE TRANSFER.

Appellants argue that, in deciding the motion to transfer, the circuit court abused its discretion by incorrectly finding that appellants failed to mention Baltimore City in the Complaint. Appellants contend that this was an erroneous finding of fact as: (1) appellants\u2019 complaint stated \u201cvenue is proper in Baltimore City;\u201d (2) Biyson's medical records \"clearly show\u201d Easton Memorial contacted UMMS, which is located in Baltimore City, to arrange Bryson\u2019s transfer; (3) the helicopter transport team left from UMMS; (4) at the time of the incident, Bryson was being transferred to UMMS; and (5) after the incident, Bryson received medical care from UMMS, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the Kennedy Krieger Institute, all located in Baltimore City. This contention is without merit. The record reflects that the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">For the issues of Forum Non Conveniens, it appears to this Court that the alleged occurrence occurred in Talbot County, that the Plaintiffs live in Talbot County.
