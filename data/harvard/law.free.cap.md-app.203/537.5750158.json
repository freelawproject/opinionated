Did the circuit court err when it admitted a recorded interview between a social worker and the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">2. Did the circuit court err when it declined to give a \u201cmissing evidence\u201d instruction to the jury with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>to a recording of a police interview of the appellant that was missing the audio component?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">On August 20, 2010, appellant was indicted on one count of committing a sexual offense in the third degree. Trial commenced on January 11, 2011. During opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that appellant\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d began on July 18, 2010, \u201cwhen, for some reason unknown to [appellant], myself, unknown to anybody ... [J.M.] tells her mother\u201d that appellant molested her. Counsel told the jury that the jury\u2019s task was \u201cto prove that something didn\u2019t happen, to corroborate it with other evidence, to verify the word of a child, whose motives are unknown to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The victim\u2019s mother, Ms. M., testified that appellant met J.M.\u2019s family at a religious holiday celebration in 2008 or 2009. After they met, appellant spent a significant amount of time at the family home. Although appellant\u2019s presence made Ms. M. uncomfortable, he would visit the family home a few times a week, and, at one point, he visited \u201calmost every night.\u201d The children enjoyed spending time with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">J.M. testified that, one night in March 2010, she, her sister, and appellant were playing a game of hide-and-seek. After they finished playing, J.M. went upstairs to prepare for bed. She went back downstairs for a glass of water and appellant, who was alone in the living room, called her over and asked her to sit on his lap. She complied, facing away from him. Appellant then placed one of his hands under her shirt on her stomach and the other hand in her pants, underneath her underwear. J.M.\u2019s testimony about the incident continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">[THE STATE]: Okay. Did you ever know or feel if he put his finger or any part of his hand inside of you or whether it stayed on the outside of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>[J.M.]: It stayed\u2014put it inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">[THE STATE]: Okay. Do you remember if he put one finger or more than one finger inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">[J.M.]: I think it was one finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">[THE STATE]: Okay. [J.M.], how long would you say his hand was inside your, your pants for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">[J.M.]: About five seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">[THE STATE]: And after five seconds what happened? [J.M.]: He took it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">[THE STATE]: Okay. And did anything happen right before he took it out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">[J.M.]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">[THE STATE]: After he took it out, was his other hand still on your stomach or did he move that hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">[J.M.]: Moved that hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-14\">[THE STATE]: So, what happened after five seconds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM4\">[J.M.]: My mom, she called, she called me to go upstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Als\">[THE STATE]: And at that time, did you go upstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aiu-dedup-0\">[J.M.]: Yeah, I was trying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">[THE STATE]: What do you mean you were \u201ctrying\u201d? [J.M.]: I went upstairs and he called me again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-16\">[THE STATE]: And then what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-17\">[J.M.]: He did it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-18\">[THE STATE]: Okay. So, when you say \u201che did it again,\u201d did you ever get off of his lap or did you stay on his lap the whole time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-19\">[J.M.]: On his lap the whole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-20\">[THE STATE]: Okay. So, how long a time was there between when he put his\u2014took his hand out and put his hand back in? Do you remember? Was it like a minute or less?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-21\">[J.M.]: Maybe less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>[THE STATE]: ... The second time he put his hand down your pants, where was his other hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">[J.M.]: On ... my stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">[THE STATE]: And the second time, do you remember how long his hand was down your pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">[J.M.]: About the same ... five seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">[THE STATE]: Five seconds. And that time did his hand move or stay the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">[J.MJ: Move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">[THE STATE]: And did his finger stay on the outside or did it go inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">[J.M.]: Inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">[THE STATE]: Okay. And after five seconds what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">[J.M.]: My mom, she called me again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">[THE STATE]: And after she called you again, tell me what happened then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">[J.M.]: I went upstairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">During cross-examination of J.M., defense counsel questioned her extensively about whether she told anyone about whether appellant \u201cput his finger inside\u201d her. J.M. testified that she told her mother, the police, and a social worker, Ms. Daryl Leach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">Ms. M. testified that, in July 2010, J.M. told her what appellant had done in March, stating that appellant \u201cput his hands in my pants.\u201d Ms. M. and her husband called the police and filed a police report. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questioning, Ms. M. stated that she did not tell the police that J.M. said that appellant put his finger inside of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">Amy Krone, a member of the Montgomery County Police Department, conducted the initial investigation. Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Krone spoke with J.M., who told her that appellant asked her to sit on his lap and then \u201cplaced his hand inside of her underwear and rubbed her vaginal area with one hand and took his other hand and placed it on her stomach and rubbed her stomach area.\u201d J.M. became frightened and tried to get off appellant\u2019s lap. Appellant held her tighter, but he then released her after Ms. M. called for J.M. On cross-examination, defense counsel established that Officer Krone\u2019s report stated that J.M. \u201cdid not state that [appellant] penetrated her, only touched her private area.\u201d After her initial investigation, Officer Krone contacted detectives from the Family Crimes Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Detective Levi Renno, a member of the Montgomery County Police Department Family Crimes Division, Child Abuse Unit, conducted the investigation. He contacted a social worker, Daryl Leach, to interview J.M. He observed the interview, which was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On July 23, 2010, Detective Renno, along with Detective Chad Williams, arrested appellant and transported him to the Family Crimes Division. Appellant was able to speak English. After advising appellant of his Miranda rights, Detective Renno asked appellant what languages he spoke. Appellant responded that he spoke Tamil, Sinhalese, and English.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant signed an Advice of Rights form and agreed to speak with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Detective Renno began the interrogation by stating what J.M. had told them. Appellant initially acknowledged that he touched J.M.\u2019s vagina, but he stated that it was accidental. After further questioning, appellant acknowledged that his touching of J.M. was intentional, and that he had touched J.M. under her underwear. He considered his conduct a lapse in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>judgment, but he stated that his hand never went inside of her vagina. He apologized.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The detectives gave appellant the opportunity to write an apology letter to J.M., which he did. In the letter, appellant wrote: \u201cI am so sorry for all this. Because we all make mistakes in life time. You are like my own grand children. I am so sorry if I hurt you. May Allah bless you. Tell mommy <em>&amp; </em>daddy I am sorry. It\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Prior to their questioning of appellant, the detectives went to the audiovisual room to start the recording equipment. The recording equipment is activated by pushing a button and turning on the television monitor. Detective Williams could not remember who started the recording equipment, but Detective Renno testified that he was under the impression that his questioning of appellant was being recorded. After the end of the questioning, Detective Renno went to the audiovisual room and discovered that there was video, but no sound.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The prosecutor then moved to admit a DVD recording of the interview between J.M. and the social worker, Ms. Leach. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the tape constituted hearsay, had no probative value because it was irrelevant, and was prejudicial. The prosecutor argued that the DVD did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>contain inadmissible hearsay because the social worker made no statements during the interview and J.M.\u2019s statements were admissible pursuant to Rule 5-802.1, the hearsay exception for prior consistent statements. He argued that the tape was relevant because the defense strategy was to undermine J.M. The court reserved ruling until it had the opportunity to view the DVD of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The next day, prior to the court viewing the DVD, defense counsel re-asserted his initial objections. He also argued that the testimony was cumulative, and if admitted, would allow the jury to view statements, which counsel characterized as largely replicating J.M.\u2019s trial testimony, \u201cover and over again.\u201d Defense counsel also argued, without elaboration, that the statement should not come in as a response to a charge of fabrication because the interview occurred after the motive to fabricate arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The court then viewed the videotaped interview, in which J.M. stated, consistent with her trial testimony, that appellant told her to sit on his lap, and he then put his hand in her pants, under her underwear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">With respect to appellant\u2019s hand, the interview proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">Ms. Leach: Okay. Do you have any way to know if his hands were on the outside of your body but touching your skin, inside your body but touching your skin, or something else? Do you ... understand what I\u2019m asking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">[J.M.]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">Ms. Leach: Okay. Let\u2019s see how I\u2019m going to ask this so it makes sense. Okay. When [appellant] was rubbing here, on the no-name part, you\u2019ve described to me that it was on the outside, it was touching your skin but on the outside of your body. At any point, could you ... tell if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>his, any part of his hand went inside your body when the rubbing was happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">[J.M.]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Ms. Leach: No, okay. Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">[J.M.]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Ms. Leach: Okay. All right. On the rubbing part, the no-name part ... could you tell if his fingers were doing\u2014this is a really weird question, okay\u2014could you tell if his fingers were like doing the same thing or were some of his fingers doing different things when the rubbing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">[J.M.]: They were doing the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">Ms. Leach: Same thing, okay. How about up here on your tummy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">[J.M.]: The same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">Ms. Leach: Okay. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">After the tape ended, the court stated that \u201c[t]his testimony is inconsistent with what she testified to at trial in material respects.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the court should admit the DVD as a prior consistent statement because \u201cthe totality of the statement is consistent with what [J.M.] testified to in court.\u201d Alternatively, the prosecutor argued that the statement was justified as rehabilitation, in response to her impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">I believe that the, the tape is admissible for two separate reasons. First, I do believe it fulfills the requirements of 5-802.1 as that rule has been explicated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Holmes v. State, </em>350 Md. 412 [712 A.2d 554 (1998) ], and by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Hyman v. the State, </em>158 Md.App. [618, 857 A.2d 1166 (2004)], a decision by Judge Kenney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-17\">The statements\u2014the witness was, in my judgment, cross-examined, and it was clearly suggested to the jury that she\u2019s making up stories and has not been truthful in her recounting of the stories, either in front of the jury or on prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>occasions, and that, as a consequence, the evidence is admissible to rebut an implied or express charge of fabrication or motive. Here, frankly, it\u2019s not implied, it\u2019s express, and the declarant testified at trial and the declarant was subject to cross-examination about her statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">I also find under 5-104 that the statements predated any motive to lie or any improper influence and certainly predated this trial, which is when the charge of fabrication was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">As an independent alternative ground, which was the basis for the affirmance in <em>Holmes, </em>the statements are also admissible as a consistent statement to diminish the child\u2019s impeachment at trial under 5-616(c)(2). The witness was clearly impeached during her cross-examination, and as a consequence, the statements are usable by the State under that rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Now, here\u2019s the rub. If they are admissible as substantive evidence, they\u2019re just in. If they\u2019re admissible only for impeachment, upon request, I would give a limiting instruction. What I\u2019m inclined to do in this case is, when I instruct the jury, tell them they\u2019re usable only for the purposes of rehabilitation and not for the truth of the matter.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The court then addressed the relevancy of the evidence and balanced that against the potential prejudice in admitting the DVD into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">I do find that the evidence is relevant. I disagree with the contention that was made yesterday that the statements do not have probative value. I find that they are relevant to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">I also find under 5-403 that the, the probative value of the evidence, in the context of this case and how the evidence has come in, outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. And I believe, in addition, that my, when I instruct the jury that it\u2019s\u2014this is the shorthand version and not the longhand version\u2014that it\u2019s only to be used by them under 5\u2014616(e)(2), that, in addition, minimizes the prejudice, because I\u2019ll make it clear that the statements are not usable by them for the truth of the matter asserted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">So, although I\u2019m not required, necessarily, to state on the record that I\u2019ve done the balancing[,] the Court of Appeals has indicated in lots of cases, including <em>Streater v. State, </em>that they would prefer so they don\u2019t have to indulge in the <em>Chaney v. State </em>presumption, which sort of is the fallback of \u201cwhen, there\u2019s nothing else to do, we\u2019re going to assume the trial judge was not a complete idiot,\u201d which is not always a good assumption, so there it is. It may be right, it may be wrong, but there it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The State then played the DVD for the jury. The DVD was approximately eight minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The State then rested its case. Defense counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal, asserting a \u201clack of sufficiency of the evidence based on the contradictory statements of the victim in the case.\u201d The court denied the motion, and the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In its instructions to the jury, the court, consistent with its evidentiary ruling, instructed the jury that the DVD evidence was admissible only regarding the victim\u2019s credibility. It instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">This morning I allowed you to watch a videotape, a DVD of statements made by the child earlier in the matter. This testimony was permitted only to help you decide whether or not to believe the testimony that the child gave at trial. It is for you to decide whether or not to believe the trial testimony of the child in whole or in part, but you may not use her earlier statement\u2014that is to say, what you saw on the TV monitor\u2014for any purpose other than to assist you in making that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>During closing argument, defense counsel told the jury that J.M.\u2019s allegations were not credible. Specifically, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWS\">Usually, if someone is not telling the truth, fibbing, fabricating lying, whatever you want to call it, there\u2019s usually a reason. [Appellant] doesn\u2019t know the reason. I don\u2019t know the reason. Maybe there is no reason. Maybe it\u2019s just something children do____She walked in here, she was awfully cute, and you know, when a 9-year-old girl walks in, tells you something, you really want to believe her because she\u2019s cute. You don\u2019t know nothing about her, but she says something and that something was a little shady, and you want to believe her. And, apparently, some people did believe her, and now the prosecutor wants you to believe her. But why can\u2019t we believe her? And I\u2019ll tell you why.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4x\">Counsel then stated that J.M. \u201cdownright fabricated, fibbed, and told a falsehood\u201d when she testified that she told her mother, the police, and the social worker that appellant put his finger inside her.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">During deliberations, the jury submitted a note to the court, asking: \u201cDoes 3rd degree require penitration [sic].\u201d After discussing the note with counsel, the circuit court answered: \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the jury returned with a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On March 28, 2011, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Appellant\u2019s first contention involves the admission of a DVD containing J.M.\u2019s prior statements to the social worker. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>pellant asserts several grounds of error. Initially, he contends that the recording contained inadmissible hearsay statements by J.M. He further contends that the DVD contained hearsay statements by the social worker, asserting that her \u201cmode of questioning\u201d included statements that repeated and reinforced J.M.\u2019s previous answers and \u201cimplicitly asserted that [J.M.] was telling the truth.\u201d Finally, appellant contends that the decision to admit the recorded interview constituted reversible error \u201c[b]ecause its risk of prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its relevance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The State contends that the trial court properly admitted a portion of the recorded interview. It asserts that J.M.\u2019s recorded statements were properly admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Maryland Rules 5-616(c)(2) and 5-802.1. It argues that the social worker\u2019s questioning was not hearsay and \u201cdid not constitute an implied assertion or a statement of belief in [J.M.\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Finally, the State contends that the circuit court \u201cproperly exercised its discretion in balancing probative value and prejudice\u201d and properly admitted the taped statement with a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">A ruling on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Blair v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 571, 592, 747 A.2d 702 (2000). This Court generally reviews such rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (2011). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brass Metal Prods. v. E-J Enters., </em>189 Md.App. 310, 364, 984 A.2d 361 (2009) (quoting <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Although the decision whether to admit a prior consistent statement falls within the discretion of the trial court, there are certain limits to when such evidence is admissible. The Court of Appeals has made clear that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, prior out-of-court statements by a witness that are consistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony are not admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to bolster the credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 416-17, 712 A.2d 554. <em>Accord Thomas v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 386, 395, 32 A.3d 503 (2011) (general rule that prior consistent statements are not admissible merely as corroborative evidence). There are exceptions to this general rule, which are set forth in Md. Rule 5-802.1 and Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2), but there are specific requirements that must be met to fall within the ambit of these rules.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We turn to address these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1 provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">(b) A statement that is consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of fabrication, or improper influence or motive[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">In <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 417, 712 A.2d 554, the Court of Appeals addressed whether this Rule retained the common law \u201cpremotive\u201d rule, <em>i.e., </em>that if a witness is attacked by a charge of fabrication or improper influence or motive, the prior consistent statement is relevant only if it was made <em>before </em>the source of the fabrication or improper influence or motive originated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that the Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>did contain a \u201cpremotive\u201d requirement, and a prior inconsistent statement is admissible pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(b) only if it was made prior to the alleged fabrication or improper motive. Id. at 424, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Here, the trial court found that J.M.\u2019s prior statements to the social worker were admissible pursuant to Rule 5-802.1 because defense counsel suggested to the jury that J.M. was making up stories, and therefore, the evidence was \u201cadmissible to rebut an implied or express charge of fabrication.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s argument, however, was that, for reasons unknown, J.M. made up the entire incident, from the beginning when she told her mother. J.M.\u2019s subsequent statements to the social worker, therefore, were not made prior to the time the alleged, but unexplained, bias originated. Because her statements were not made \u201cpremotive,\u201d they were not admissible pursuant to Rule 5-802.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Maryland Rule 5-616(c)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The trial court ruled, in the alternative, that J.M.\u2019s statements on the DVD were admissible pursuant to Rule 5-616(c)(2). That Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">(c) Rehabilitation. A witness whose credibility has been attacked may be rehabilitated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">(2) Except as provided by statute, evidence of the witness\u2019s prior statements that are consistent with the witness\u2019s present testimony, when their having been made detracts from the impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Prior consistent statements admitted pursuant to Rule 5-616(c)(2) are not admissible as substantive evidence, but rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>er, they are admissible to rehabilitate a witness\u2019 credibility. <em>Thomas, </em>202 Md.App. at 395, 32 A.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">Prior consistent statements used for rehabilitation of a witness whose credibility is attacked are relevant not for their truth since they are repetitions of the witness\u2019s trial testimony. They are relevant because the circumstances under which they are made rebut an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility. Thus, such statements by definition are not offered as hearsay and logically do not have to meet the same requirements as hearsay statements falling within an exception to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>Blair, </em>130 Md.App. at 595, 747 A.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">A review of Rule 5\u2014616(c)(2) indicates that there are three prerequisites to admission of a prior statement as rehabilitation: (1) the witness\u2019 credibility must have been attacked; (2) the prior statement is consistent with the trial testimony; and (3) the prior statement detracts from the impeachment. We will address each of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The first prerequisite is that the witness\u2019 credibility be attacked. A witness may be impeached in various ways, including by a showing of a prior inconsistent statement or a claim of fabrication. <em>Cole v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 279, 298, 574 A.2d 326, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 68, 580 A.2d 1077 (1990). Impeachment can occur from the nature of questioning or from suggestions of counsel in argument. <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 290-91, 544 A.2d 784 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">There is no dispute here that J.M.\u2019s credibility was attacked. Defense counsel impeached J.M.\u2019s testimony at trial that appellant digitally penetrated her by extensively cross-examining her about whether she told anyone that detail, and then by eliciting testimony from Detective Krone and J.M.\u2019s mother that J.M.\u2019s initial statements did not include a claim that appellant penetrated her. And in opening statement, counsel stated that J.M. stated that appellant molested her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cfor reasons unknown.\u201d Thus, J.M.\u2019s credibility clearly was attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The second requirement for admissibility pursuant to Rule 5-616(c)(2) is that the prior statement sought to be introduced be consistent with the trial testimony. Focusing on the issue of penetration, appellant contends that J.M.\u2019s statements on the DVD were not consistent with her trial testimony. Although the State attempts to argue to the contrary, we agree with appellant on this point. At trial, J.M. testified that appellant put his finger inside of her and that she relayed that fact to the social worker. In J.M.\u2019s statement to the social worker, however, when asked if she could tell if any part of appellant\u2019s hand went inside her body, she stated: \u201cNo.\u201d J.M.\u2019s statement to the social worker, which was played for the jury on the DVD, was not consistent with her trial testimony on the issue of penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The State argues, however, that our focus should not be so narrow. It contends that we should look to J.M.\u2019s statements as a whole. It asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">The fact that the prior statement was consistent on the key points with her trial testimony meant that it detracted from the impeachment. That is, as she did at trial, in the prior statement she indicated that: it happened when [appellant] was on the couch in the living room; she sat on his lap; he put his hands \u201cin my pants\u201d; he \u201csticked his hand in\u201d; his right hand was in her pants; he rubbed her stomach with his other hand; and she was wearing pajamas and underwear and his hand went under her underwear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Since defense counsel focused so much on how the victim\u2019s statements changed over time, particularly at the time of trial, it was appropriate for the State to respond by pointing out how her statement closer to the time of the charged offense was consistent with her testimony at trial. [Defense counsel] argued that, since she allegedly was inconsistent about penetration, \u201cwhy should we believe her about whatever else she says?\u201d The narrowly focused prior statement, which was consistent with the victim\u2019s trial testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>mony, detracted from that impeachment and was properly admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">To be sure, much of the prior interview played for the jury contained statements consistent with J.M.\u2019s trial testimony. As the State notes, J.M. recounted that appellant asked her to sit on his lap, and he then placed his right hand in her pants, underneath her underwear, and he rubbed her stomach with his other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">To be admissible as rehabilitation, however, a prior consistent statement must be more than a repetition of the trial testimony; the statement must, under the circumstances in which it was given, \u201cdetract from the impeachment,\u201d Md. Rule 5\u2014616(c)(2), or \u201crebut logically\u201d the impeachment. <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 426 n. 3, 427, 712 A.2d 554 (quoting Reporter\u2019s Note, 125th Report of the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, July 1993, at 86.) As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has stated, a prior consistent statement \u201cmust meet at least the standard of showing \u2018some rebutting force beyond the mere fact that the witness had repeated on a prior occasion the statement consistent with his trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Simonelli, </em>237 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>781 F.2d 329, 331 (2d Cir.1986)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 821, 122 S.Ct. 54, 151 L.Ed.2d 23 (2001). <em>Accord United States v. Dennis, </em>625 F.2d 782, 797 (8th Cir.1980) (request to introduce extrajudicial statements properly denied where prior consistent statements would be mere repetition to bolster witness\u2019 trial testimony). <em>See also Coltrane v. United States, </em>418 F.2d 1131, 1140 (D.C.Cir.1969) (\u201cMere repetition does not imply veracity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Here, J.M.\u2019s statements to the social worker did not detract from the impeachment beyond the fact that, on a prior occasion, she had repeated many of the details consistent with her trial testimony. With respect to the issue of digital penetration, as indicated, none of her statements to the social worker were consistent with her trial testimony on this issue. Nor do the statements in any way explain, clarify, or put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>perspective the inconsistency between J.M.\u2019s trial testimony and her earlier statements, in which she made no assertion that appellant penetrated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Moreover, J.M.\u2019s statements to the social worker did not \u201cdetract from\u201d or \u201crebut logically\u201d counsel\u2019s claim that J.M. made up the whole incident. The only \u201crebuttal value\u201d the prior consistent statements had was the mere fact that she had repeated on an earlier occasion many of the statements she made at trial. The DVD, which included approximately eight minutes of the interview, was admitted to bolster the testimony of J.M. at trial. It did not otherwise detract from the impeachment pursuant to Rule 5-616(c)(2), and it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit this evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cMissing Evidence\u201d Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Although our disposition of the first issue renders it unnecessary for us to address the second issue presented, we will address it briefly for the benefit of the parties and the court in the event there is a retrial. Appellant\u2019s second issue addresses the fact that the audio portion of appellant\u2019s interrogation was not recorded due to an equipment malfunction or human error in activating the recording equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Defense counsel contends that \u201cthe court erred in declining to give a missing evidence instruction due to the absence of audio on the video recording.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At trial, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>objected to such an instruction, stating that the evidence was not missing because \u201cit\u2019s not that the audio at some point worked and, because of some fault of the police, it ceased to be.\u201d Instead, \u201c[i]t never was there in the first place.\u201d In declining to give the missing evidence instruction, the court stated that the lack of an audio recording \u201cwas accidental, albeit sloppy,\u201d but its absence was \u201cmore hurtful to the State than\u201d to appellant, and \u201can instruction regarding the spoilation or failure to preserve in this ... case would create a clear danger of the jury giving undue weight to my comments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gimble v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 610, 627,18 A.3d 955, <em>cert. denied, </em>421 Md. 193, 25 A.3d 1026 (2011). The Maryland appellate courts have discussed the exercise of this discretion in the context of missing evidence instructions on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 694, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999), the Court of Appeals held that a court generally is not required to instruct \u201con the presence or absence of most evidentiary inferences, including \u2018missing evidence\u2019 inferences.\u201d In that case, Patterson was convicted of possession of cocaine after the police found, in the trunk of his car, a jacket with crack cocaine in its pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 680-81, 741 A.2d 1119. The police did not collect the jacket as evidence, and the police did not know where it was at the time of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 681-82, 741 A.2d 1119. The Court of Appeals held that counsel was permitted to argue that the fact that the jacket was not collected by the State permitted an inference that the admission of the evidence would have been adverse to the State\u2019s case, but the trial court was not required to give such an instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 741 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>In <em>Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 369, 10 A.3d 184 (2010), the Court of Appeals reiterated that an appellate court generally reviews a trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a missing evidence instruction for an abuse of discretion. The Court found, however, that the facts in that case constituted an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that compelled a missing evidence instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 10 A.3d 184. The defendant in <em>Cost </em>was charged with crimes arising from the stabbing of a fellow prisoner in a prison cell. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 10 A.3d 184. The cell was cleaned by prison officials before it could be examined and none of the physical evidence was preserved. <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 10 A.3d 184. The Court held that the missing evidence, blood stained clothing and blood on the cell floor, was \u201chighly relevant evidence in [the State\u2019s] custody that it normally would have retained and submitted to forensic examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382., 10 A.3d 184 The missing evidence went \u201cto the heart of the case,\u201d and the Court held that, given the facts of the case, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to give a missing evidence instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 380-81, 10 A.3d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In <em>Gimble, </em>198 Md.App. at 630, 18 A.3d 955, this Court noted that, pursuant to <em>Cost, </em>\u201c[w]hen destroyed evidence was not central to the defense case, was \u2018not the type of evidence usually collected by the [S]tate, or [was] not already in the [S]tate\u2019s custody ... a trial court may well be within its discretion to refuse\u2019 to give a missing evidence instruction.\u201d (Quoting <em>Cost, </em>417 Md. at 382, 10 A.3d 184). In that case, Gimble was convicted of drug charges stemming from drugs found in a backpack that flew out of Gimble\u2019s vehicle after his car crashed during a high-speed chase. <em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 18 A.3d 955. The backpack and other items were destroyed during a glitch in the Sheriffs Office routine annual purging procedure for evidence collected. <em>Id. </em>at 616-19,18 A.3d 955. This Court held that, although the evidence was in police possession before it was destroyed, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving a missing evidence instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 632, 18 A.3d 955. We noted that, although the destroyed evidence was \u201cpotentially useful,\u201d it \u201cwas neither necessary nor central\u201d to the appellant\u2019s defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The above cases all deal with situations where the State had evidence in its possession but did not preserve it. Here, as the State notes, the record does not reflect that it ever had an audio recording of appellant\u2019s interview. A missing evidence instruction, advising the jury that it could infer that the missing evidence would be unfavorable to the State, is not warranted in a situation where evidence was not destroyed, but rather, it was never created. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>104 F.3d 1408, 1417 (1st Cir.1997) (missing evidence instruction properly denied where, rather than failing to provide available evidence, the government merely failed to collect fingerprint evidence). <em>See also Metcalf v. Commonwealth, </em>158 S.W.3d 740, 747 (Ky.2005) (court categorizes \u201cequipment malfunction as a failure to <em>create </em>evidence to corroborate a confession rather than a failure to preserve\u201d evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Indeed, counsel did not request a typical missing evidence instruction. As indicated, the requested instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">Where there is a failure to electronically record an interrogation, you have not been provided with a complete picture of all of the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s alleged statement and the precise details of that statement. By way of example, you cannot hear the tone or inflection of the defendant\u2019s or interrogator\u2019s voices, or hear first hand the inteiTogation, both questions and answers, in its entirety. Instead you have been presented with a summary based upon the recollections of law enforcement personnel .... [sic] The absence of an electronic recording permits but does not compel you to conclude that the State has failed to prove that a statement was in fact given and if so, was accurately reported by State\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Appellant cites no case that supports the proposition that such an instruction must be given. Under the facts presented here, we cannot conclude that it was an abuse of discretion to decline to give this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Whether the trial court erred by admitting, without a stated hearsay exception, a social worker\u2019s hearsay statements from a videotaped interview with the child victim, where her method of questioning amounted to statements of implied belief in the child\u2019s credibility and the social worker was not called to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">IV. Whether the trial court erred by admitting a videotaped interview between the child victim and a social worker, where its relevance was substantially outweighed by a risk of prejudice because it repeated the child's account without challenge, the social worker implied her belief in that account, and the visual setting of the interview enhanced the jury\u2019s sympathy for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">V.
