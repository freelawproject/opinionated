SALMON (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">After using mostly fake money to purchase marijuana, Donald Kohler immediately fled from the seller, Warren Jerome Yates. Upon discovering the deception, Yates ran after Kohler and fired a shot that killed Shirley Worcester, an innocent bystander. Based on the State\u2019s theory that Kohler aided and abetted Yates\u2019s felony distribution of marijuana, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted Kohler of second-degree felony murder and conspiracy to distribute marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was also convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Kohler was sentenced to thirty years for the felony murder, five consecutive years for the conspiracy, and a concurrent five years on the possession charge. In this appeal Kohler does not take issue with his conviction of possession with intent to distribute marijuana but claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for either second-degree felony murder or conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The question of whether the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for felony murder presents an issue of first impression. No reported Maryland appellate case addresses whether a buyer of a controlled dangerous substance (\u201cCDS\u201d) may be convicted of distribution based on the theory that he or she \u201cparticipated\u201d in the sale as a second degree principal, i.e., as an aider or abettor of the distribution. Consequently, there is no reported Maryland case that addresses the felony murder question now before us\u2014whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>drug buyer, whose actions toward the seller in the course of the transaction precipitated the seller\u2019s murder of an innocent victim, may be convicted of second degree felony murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the evidence presented by the State was insufficient to convict appellant of distributing marijuana, and therefore also insufficient to convict him of felony murder and conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Evidence considered by the jury that convicted Kohler, viewed in the light most favorable to the State (see Maryland Rule 4-324), is summarized below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">On the morning of January 7, 2009, Kohler met Christopher Jagd and Justin Wimbush at a house in Baltimore County where Johnny Moore lived. Kohler said to Jagd and Wim-bush that he would like to steal some marijuana. Kohler inquired of Jagd and Wimbush if they knew anyone who might have \u201csome pounds\u201d of marijuana. Wimbush said that he needed to \u201cmake some calls\u201d but believed \u201che could get it.\u201d Wimbush and Jagd then left. Later that day Wimbush, acting on Kohler\u2019s behalf, called Warren Yates and the two negotiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ed the sales price ($1,100.00 per pound) and the quantity of marijuana to be sold (four pounds). Wimbush and Yates then made arrangements concerning the time and place of the delivery. Ultimately it was agreed that the sale would occur at the townhouse on South Hawthorn Street where Johnny Moore lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On the evening of January 7, 2009, Yates, accompanied by Billy Griffin, arrived at the townhouse in Yates\u2019s car. Yates and Griffin entered the basement of Johnny Moore\u2019s house where they joined Jagd, Wimbush and others. Kohler stayed upstairs. He told Jagd that he wanted to see the marijuana before he bought it. Griffin gave Jagd a pound of marijuana, Jagd then gave the pound to Wimbush who went upstairs and showed it to Kohler. Kohler then asked to see all four pounds, but his request was denied by Yates. Finally, tired of waiting, Griffin and Yates announced they were leaving and went upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Just as Griffin and Yates were about to leave, Kohler said that he still wanted to buy the drugs. The marijuana was given to Jagd. Jagd handed the drugs to Wimbush, who gave the contraband to Kohler. Kohler, in turn, gave Wimbush a bag with money in it. The bag went to Jagd, who gave it to Yates.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Yates told everyone not to leave until he counted the money, but as soon as Jagd handed over the bag, Kohler grabbed the drugs and ran out the door. Yates immediately reported to Griffin that the money Kohler gave to him in exchange for the drugs was fake.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yates then chased after Kohler. During the chase Yates fired two shots, intending to hit Kohler. Kohler was not hit but one of the bullets went astray and killed Shirley Worcester, who happened to be standing nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">A. Second Degree Felony Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Challenging the State\u2019s theory that appellant abetted Yates in his distribution of marijuana, appellant argues that his second degree felony murder conviction must be reversed because the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the predicate felony of distribution. In support, appellant points out that, at trial, the State\u2019s theory was not that appellant distributed the marijuana to others, but that appellant was \u201ca participant\u201d in the sale of marijuana by Yates because appellant was \u201cthe buyer\u201d who \u201creceived it.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the State\u2019s \u201cparticipant\u201d argument \u201cdemonstrates its concession\u201d that appellant did not distribute marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The State maintains that \u201c[ujnder the unique facts of this case, ... the evidence was sufficient to convict [appellant] of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>distribution of marijuana and of the felony murder.\u201d On appeal the State renews its trial argument that appellant \u201cparticipated in the distribution ... as a second degree principal\u201d who aided and abetted the transaction by seeking \u201cout Yates, inquiring] as to whether he could purchase four pounds of marijuana, set[ting] up the details of the exchange, and, ultimately, fraudulently entic[ing] Yates to relinquish possession of the marijuana.\u201d Of significance, the State argues, is the fact that appellant\u2019s \u201cintent to defraud Yates and essentially trick him into transferring the drugs\u201d was what ultimately led to the shooting of Ms. Worcester. As the trial court pointed out at sentencing, \u201cbut for Mr. Kohler\u2019s actions in seeking to have these drugs sold to him and all of the machinations about which we heard during the trial and his decision to effectuate the purchase in the way that he did[,]\u201d \u201cthe victim in this case would not have been killedf.]\u201d In these limited circumstances, the State posits, a buyer like appellant, who \u201ctakes an active role in soliciting the distributor and arranging the transaction,\u201d which \u201cis occurring in the middle of the distribution chain, and not between the seller and user, ... could be guilty of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions, we must determine, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Yates v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 700, 712, 33 A.3d 1071 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In Maryland, second degree felony murder is a common law crime premised on \u201cthe principle that a person participating in a felony is responsible for the natural and probable consequences of his or her criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 231, 236, 867 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A.2d 1095 (2005). <em>See Yates, supra, </em>at 712-13, 33 A.3d 1071. \u201cThe modern felony-murder rule is \u2018intended to deter dangerous conduct by punishing as murder a homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in the perpetration of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 226-27, 867 A.2d 1095 (citation omitted). \u201cTo obtain a conviction for felony murder, the State is required to prove the underlying felony and that the death occurred during the perpetration of the felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 867 A.2d 1095. Moreover, \u201cthe underlying felony must be sufficiently dangerous to life to justify application of the doctrine,\u201d so that the jury must be able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe felonious conduct, under all the circumstances, made death a foreseeable consequence[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 867 A.2d 1095. It is not necessary, however, for the State to separately charge the defendant with the predicate felony. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 867 A.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Maryland does not have an \u201caiding and abetting\u201d statute. Nevertheless, under established case law, a person who did not actually commit the crime in question may nevertheless be guilty to the same degree as the person who did. <em>Handy v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 239, 250, 251-52, 326 A.2d 189 (1974). Whereas principals in the first degree \u201ccommit the deed as perpetrating actors, either by their own hand or by the hand of an innocent agent,\u201d principals in the second degree are \u201cpresent, actually or constructively, aiding and abetting the commission of the crime, but not themselves committing it[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 326 A.2d 189 (citations omitted). \u201cAn aider is one who assists, supports or supplements the efforts of another in the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn abettor is one who instigates, advises or encourages the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Here, the State charged appellant with conspiring with Yates and Griffin to distribute marijuana in violation of the statutory prohibition against distributing marijuana and with possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, which is a statutory felony. <em>See generally </em>Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 5-602(1) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrim.\u201d) (\u201ca person may not ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>distribute or dispense a controlled dangerous substance\u201d); Crim. \u00a7 5-602(2) (\u201ca person may not ... possess a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity reasonably to indicate under all circumstances an intent to distribute or dispense a controlled dangerous substance\u201d); Crim. \u00a7 5-607(a) (\u201ca person who violates a provision of \u00a7\u00a7 5-602 through 5-606 of this subtitle is guilty of a felony\u201d). <em>Cf. Rudder v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 426, 434, 956 A.2d 791 (2008) (conspiracy is a common law misdemeanor); Crim. \u00a7 1-102 (\u201cThe punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Although appellant was not charged with distribution in violation of Crim. \u00a7 5-602(1), the State argued throughout trial that the second degree felony murder charges against both appellant and Yates were predicated on distribution, and that appellant was guilty of distribution as a second degree principal, based on his role in arranging the sale and receiving the marijuana from Yates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued to the trial court, in support of his unsuccessful motions for acquittal, and to the jury in closing, that appellant could not be guilty of distribution or felony murder because a buyer cannot be convicted of distributing marijuana to himself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The trial court instructed the jury that \u201cthe State must prove that the Defendant[,] or another participating in the crime with the Defendant^] committed or attempted to commit the crime of distribution of marijuana, which is a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court did not define \u201cdistribution\u201d or further explain who might qualify as \u201canother participating in the crime with the Defendant^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In this Court, appellant points out that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an analogous \u201cdrug buyer as facilitator\u201d theory in <em>Abuelhawa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 816, 129 S.Ct. 2102, 2105, 173 L.Ed.2d 982 (2009), and that courts in other states have similarly rejected the notion that a buyer can be convicted of CDS distribution as a second degree principal. We agree that these cases are instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In <em>Abuelhawa, </em>the issue was whether a <em>buyer\u2019s </em>use of his cell phone to arrange drug purchases \u201cfacilitated\u201d the seller\u2019s felony drug distribution, in violation of a federal statute criminalizing the use of communication devices in \u201cfacilitating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>commission of ... a felony[.]\u201d <em>See Abuelhawa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2104; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). A unanimous Supreme Court held that the buyer, whose two separate purchases of one gram were misdemeanors, could not be convicted of the \u201cfacilitation\u201d felony under that theory. <em>Abuelhawa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2104.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The <em>Abuelhawa </em>Court rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding that the buyer\u2019s use of his cell phone to purchase cocaine qualified as facilitation \u201cbecause it \u2018undoubtedly made [the seller\u2019s] cocaine distribution easier; in fact, \u2018it made the sale possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Abuelhawa, </em>523 F.3d 415, 421 (4th Cir.2008)). Although \u201con the literal plane, the phone calls could be described as \u2018facilitating\u2019 drug distribution[,]\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cstopping there would ignore the rule that, because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, \u2018[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2105 (citations omitted). In Abuelhawa\u2019s case, the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnA\">the Government\u2019s literal sweep of \u201cfacilitate\u201d sits uncomfortably with common usage. Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the conduct of the other. A buyer does not just make a sale easier; he makes the sale possible. No buyer, no sale; the buyer\u2019s part is already implied by the term \u201csale,\u201d and the word \u201cfacilitate\u201d adds nothing. We would not say that the borrower facilitates the bank loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Court also pointed out that \u201c[t]he common usage that limits \u2018facilitate\u2019 to the efforts of someone other than a primary or necessary actor in the commission of a substantive crime has its parallel in\u201d case law recognizing that \u201cwhere a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the calibration of punishment set by the legislature[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2106. Explaining that Congress intended the meaning of the term \u201cfacilitate\u201d to be \u201cequivalent\u201d to judicially interpreted \u201cterms like \u2018aid,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u2018abet,\u2019 and \u2018assist[J \u201d <em>id. </em>at 2106, the Court reasoned that the Government\u2019s \u201cbroader reading of \u2018facilitate\u2019 would for practical purposes skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties[,]\u201d by ignoring that \u201cCongress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than the felony of distributing drugs, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a drug felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>Hyche v. Indiana, </em>934 N.E.2d 1176, 1177 (Ind.Ct.App.2010), a buyer (Hyche) made telephone arrangements to purchase ecstasy, then sent two accomplices to complete the transaction. During the exchange, one of the sellers was shot and killed. Although Hyche was not present during the transaction or shooting, he was convicted of dealing and felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The Indiana Court of Appeals held that, \u201c[b]ecause the record is devoid of any evidence that Hyche was acting in any capacity other than that of a purchaser, it is insufficient to support a dealing conviction and therefore a felony murder conviction based thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180. Interpreting a statute that defines \u201cdealing\u201d as a \u201c \u2018transfer from one (1) person to another of a controlled dangerous substance,\u2019 \u201d the court reasoned that Hyche</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">acted as the transferee, not the transferor. The fact that he called another person to request drugs no more makes him a dealer in ecstasy than it would make a customer who calls the florist a dealer in flowers. The State\u2019s cited cases are factually distinguishable because each involved a defendant involved on the distribution side of the transaction. The record is devoid of any evidence that Hyche was acting on the distribution side. Thus, he cannot be said to have organized the delivery of ecstasy under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1179 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In <em>Rhode Island v. Oliveira and Hill, </em>882 A.2d 1097 (R.I.2005), the Supreme Court of Rhode Island interpreted a statutory felony murder scheme in which the \u201csale, delivery, or other distribution\u201d of controlled dangerous substances qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ifies as a predicate for first degree felony murder, whereas the possession of CDS with the intent to manufacture or deliver constitutes a predicate for second degree felony murder. In that case, the prosecution presented evidence that after Oli-veira and Hill arranged to buy $43,000 worth of cocaine from a seller who traveled from Texas to make the delivery, the seller was shot and killed. The two buyers were charged with first degree felony murder based on the State\u2019s theory that \u201cthe killing occurred during the course of the \u2018attempted receipt and redistribution of the drugs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1107. At trial, Oliveira and Hill argued that \u201cno reasonable reading of the statute encompasse[d] their actions because all the evidence ... demonstrated that they were unsuccessfully attempting to purchase or possess a controlled substance, not to manufacture, sell, deliver, or distribute it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108. The trial court agreed with the State, however, that the two buyers could be found \u201cguilty of an attempt to distribute cocaine, based on the fact that they attempted to purchase over $43,000 worth of cocaine for further distribution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island reversed, holding that the distribution statute did \u201cnot encompass one who attempts to purchase or receive a controlled dangerous substance from a seller, distributor, or deliverer, absent proof that the purchaser or receiver has taken a substantial step toward reselling, redelivering, or redistributing the controlled substances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117-18. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe terms \u2018sell,\u2019 \u2018deliver,\u2019 and \u2018distribute\u2019 all refer to the actions of one who transfer <em>to another, </em>and are the opposite of one who purchases or receives <em>from another.\u201d Id. </em>at 1112. Moreover, it was not \u201cabsurd for the Legislature to distinguish between \u2018delivery\u2019 or \u2018attempted delivery\u2019 from \u2018possession with intent to deliver\u2019 for purposes of exposing a defendant to the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment\u201d imposed under the first degree felony murder statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1117. Although</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adk\">the evidence tying [Hill] and Oliveira to the attempt to possess a substantial quantity of cocaine was overwhelming and the intent to deliver element can be inferentially established from the quantity of cocaine they sought to acquire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the record is devoid of any evidence that establishes, either directly or inferentially, that [Hill] or Oliveira took any action in an effort to further distribute or deliver the cocaine. Consequently, we are constrained to conclude that their motions for judgment of acquittal on the first-degree felony-murder count, should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1118.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Like the subject case, <em>Graves v. Kentucky, </em>17 S.W.3d 858 (Ky.2000), concerned a \u201cdrug deal gone wrong.\u201d In <em>Graves, </em>the three defendants attempted to buy a kilogram of cocaine in order to resell it. After they delivered the $27,000 purchase price to the sellers in a parking lot, the sellers drove away without delivering the cocaine. In two vehicles, the buyers chased the sellers at high speeds through Louisville streets, until one of the buyers\u2019 vehicles struck and killed two innocent occupants of a vehicle that crossed its path. All three buyers were convicted of trafficking and \u201cwanton murder,\u201d which is Kentucky\u2019s codified version of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the murder convictions against all three buyers based on the predicate felony of drug trafficking, which is a statutory felony encompassing both the attempted sale or transfer of CDS and the attempted possession of CDS with intent to sell or transfer. <em>Id. </em>at 862-63. Although the court did not specifically identify the buyers\u2019 attempted possession of the cocaine as the factual basis for the trafficking charges against them, the evidence supported only that theory since the buyers never obtained the cocaine and there was no evidence they attempted to sell it in advance of possessing it. The evidence of attempted possession with intent to distribute was therefore sufficient to support the wanton murder convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 862-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Applying the lessons of <em>Abuelhawa, Hyche, Oliveira &amp; Hill </em>and <em>Graves, </em>we conclude that treating drug buyers as second-degree principals in the drug sellers\u2019 distribution stretches the concept of \u201cparticipation\u201d and \u201caiding and abetting\u201d too far. The phrase \u201cor dispense\u201d 1) \u201cmeans to deliver to the ultimate user or the human research subject by or in accordance with the lawful order of an authorized provider,\u201d 2) \u201cdispense\u201d indicates to prescribe, administer, package, label, or compound a substance for delivery. Crim. \u00a7 5-101(k). To \u201cdistribute\u201d means, \u201cwith respect to a controlled dangerous substance, to deliver other than by dispensing.\u201d Crim. \u00a7 5-101(1). In turn, \u201cdeliver\u201d means \u201cto make an actual constructive, or attempted transfer or exchange from one person to another whether or not remuneration is paid[.]\u201d Crim. \u00a7 5-101(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Because CDS \u201cdistribution\u201d requires a delivery <em>to another person, </em>it is clear that the General Assembly intended the prohibition against distribution to encompass only those who deliver CDS, not those to whom CDS is delivered. The State\u2019s characterization of appellant as a participant in Yates\u2019s distribution would require us to ignore the \u201ccommon usage\u201d principles cogently articulated in <em>Abuelhawa </em>and <em>Hyche. </em>We therefore agree with appellant that he may not be convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>distribution based solely on his role as buyer and receiver of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The State\u2019s attempt to limit the scope of its \u201cbuyer as distributor\u201d theory to certain types of buyers is not persuasive. In its brief, the State posits that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alr\">liability as an aider and abettor to distribution is limited to those circumstances where, as here, the defendant\u2019s role in the transaction is more than simply an end-of-the-line, arm\u2019s length buyer purchasing for personal use. Where the buyer takes an active role in soliciting the distributor and arranging the transaction, and where it is clear that the transaction is occurring in the middle of the distribution chain, and not between the seller and user, the buyer could be guilty of distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The \u201cactive role\u201d component of the standard suggested by the State is untenably vague and overbroad. Allowing a jury to convict a drug buyer of distribution on an aiding and abetting theory that is circumscribed only by whether the buyer took an \u201cactive role in soliciting the distributor\u201d could effectively eviscerate any distinction between possession and distribution, because any buyer who initiates a drug purchase arguably takes \u201can active role in soliciting the distributor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Nor do we agree that a buyer who is in a \u201cdistribution chain\u201d may be convicted as an aider and abettor of the seller\u2019s distribution. It is neither necessary nor consistent with the legislative scheme to treat a drug buyer who purchases with intent to distribute as a second-degree principal in the drug seller\u2019s distribution. There simply is no need to contort the language and meaning of Crim. \u00a7 5-602(1) to cover this scenario, because when a buyer purchases CDS with the intent to distribute it to others, that buyer may be convicted, as a first-degree principal, of possession with intent to distribute, which is a separate felony under Crim. \u00a7 5-602(2). And, if that same buyer actually takes steps toward distributing the CDS he has in his possession to another person, he may then be convicted, as a first-degree principal, of attempted distribution of marijuana, which, as the State concedes, is only a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>law misdemeanor in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., Lane v. State, </em>348 Md. 272, 283-84, 703 A.2d 180 (1997) (\u201cBy Maryland common law, the attempt to commit a crime is, itself, a separate crime\u2014a misdemeanor\u201d unless the attempt is made a felony by statute). Finally, if the buyer actually makes a delivery, then he or she is guilty of distribution, again as a first-degree principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">For these reasons, although the State is correct that appellant\u2019s intent to distribute the marijuana differentiates his purchase from cases in which the buyer purchased CDS solely for personal use, we do not agree that this fact supports a conviction for distribution as a second degree principal. As noted in <em>Oliveira and Hill, </em>the appropriate charge in these circumstances\u2014when the buyer solicits the sale and receives the CDS with the intent to later distribute it to others, but there is no evidence of any attempt at distribution\u2014is possession with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>note 10, <em>supra. </em>A contrary conclusion would put the proverbial cart before the horse, by allowing the State to convict a CDS buyer like appellant, who purchases for re-distribution but has not yet acted upon his intent to distribute, of actually distributing the CDS.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this case, the jury did convict appellant of felony possession with intent to distribute, in violation of Crim. \u00a7 5-602(2), and appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that conviction. Even though appellant might have been convicted of felony murder based on the alternative predicate felony of possession with intent to distribute, the prosecution did not argue that alternative, and the jury was not instructed about it. <em>Cf. Graves, </em>17 S.W.3d at 862 (\u201cIn this case, the jury was instructed that it could find each defendant guilty [of felony murder] as either a principal or accomplice under alternative theories of criminal liability, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>trafficking by sale or transfer, or trafficking by possession with intent to sell or transfer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">To the extent that the State\u2019s position in this appeal may be understood as an assertion that there is no material difference between these two crimes, so that we may treat them as fungible felonies for purposes of affirming appellant\u2019s second degree felony murder conviction, we disagree. We acknowledge that possession with intent to distribute and distribution might fairly be viewed as two sides of the same coin because both crimes fall under Crim. \u00a7 5-602, and both crimes are punished as felonies under Crim. \u00a7 5-607(a). As this case demonstrates, however, there is a substantive difference between the two crimes when the State attempts to use them as the predicate for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Here, the jury was permitted to convict appellant of felony murder based on the theory that he aided and abetted Yates in distributing the marijuana. Consequently, the jury, when determining whether the manner in which the marijuana was distributed created a substantial risk of death or bodily injury so as to warrant a felony murder conviction, naturally focused on the conduct of Yates, who came armed with a gun and later used it to shoot and kill an innocent bystander. In contrast, if the jury had been asked to convict appellant of felony murder based on the theory that he obtained possession of the marijuana with an intent to distribute it, its primary focus would not have been on the conduct of Yates, but on the conduct of appellant, who was unarmed during the purchase and obtained the marijuana through fraud and flight, rather than force. To be sure, it is also possible that the jury might have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the manner in which appellant committed that possession felony created a foreseeable risk of death, sufficient to convict him of second-degree felony murder. For purposes of this appeal, however, the material fact is that, depending on which of the two underlying felonies the jury was considering, it might have considered different evidence and/or weighed the evidence differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Because the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of distribution as an aider and abettor, and the arguments and instructions pertaining to the felony murder charge allowed the jury to decide guilt based on the predicate felony of distribution, we are constrained to reverse appellant\u2019s second-degree felony murder conviction. Having foregone the opportunity to present to the jury possession with intent to distribute as an alternate predicate for convicting appellant of felony murder, the State is precluded by double jeopardy principles from re-trying appellant for that crime. <em>See, e.g., Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d); <em>In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 313, 539 A.2d 664 (1988) (\u201c[Insufficiency of the evidence is ... a singularly inappropriate basis for ordering a new trial, because if the evidence was insufficient to go to the jury in the first place, double jeopardy principles preclude a new trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Conspiracy to Distribute</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error \u201cpiggybacks\u201d his first.

[Furthermore], the crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, and no overt act in furtherance of the agreement need be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">It is well settled that, in order validly to charge conspiracy, a charging document must allege both the fact of the conspiracy and its object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Campbell v.

In accordance with the State\u2019s \u201cbuyer as distributor\u201d theory, the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict appellant if he and Yates \u201centered into an agreement with at least one other person to commit the crime of distribution of marijuana.\u201d But, on the facts of this case, there appears to be no meeting of the minds to engage in a sale of drugs because Kohler was acting in bad faith from the outset. His pretended offer of the purchase price was nothing but a charade to facilitate his theft of the marijuana. Kohler cannot have conspired to purchase marijuana when he obviously never intended to purchase it. Moreover, even if the State proved that appellant conspired with his cohorts to <em>buy </em>marijuana from appellees, the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of conspiring with Yates and Griffin to <em>distribute </em>marijuana.

The court went on to explain in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">We note that although we hold that \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d is not a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder, it may support a conviction for second-degree felony murder. <em>See State v.

Second-degree felony murder is not a lesser-included offense to first-degree felony murder because it requires proof of an additional fact\u2014a determination that the crime was committed in an inherently dangerous manner. <em>See State v. Briggs, </em>787 A.2d 479, 487 (R.I.2001) (\"A lesser included offense is 'one that does not require proof of any additional element beyond those required by the greater offense.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v.

Conversely, first-degree felony murder requires no such determination.
