On April 28, 2010, the jury found in favor of appellant and awarded $82,000.88 for past medical expenses, $35,191.80 for past lost wages, $409,787.00 for loss of future wages, $224,010.16 for pain and suffering, and $224,010.16 for loss of consortium. Appellee filed a motion for remittitur or new trial, which the court granted. At the conclusion of a second trial, on August 18, 2010, the jury found that appellee was negligent but that appellant was contributorily negligent and so awarded no damages. The court denied appellant\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>trial on January 11, 2011, and appellant filed this timely appeal on February 4, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellant presents the following questions, which we have edited to comport with our discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">I. Did the circuit court err when it ordered a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">II. Did the circuit court err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike appellee\u2019s expert testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">For the reasons that follow, we answer yes to question one, we do not address question two as our opinion renders it moot, and we remand the case to circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">On the night of March 15, 2006, appellant was on call as a maintenance worker for the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission and traveling southbound on New Hampshire Avenue when he collided with appellee, who was turning left from the northbound lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Appellant sustained a transverse fracture of the left patella with displacement, requiring open reduction and internal fixation surgery on March 23, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s recovery required physical therapy, during which he developed stress injuries to multiple bones in his left foot. At the conclusion of appellant\u2019s rehabilitation program, his therapist completed a functional capacity evaluation. The evaluation determined that appellant was restricted to occasional lifting of up to sixty-seven pounds and carrying up to forty-five pounds for one hundred feet, frequent lifting of up to forty-five pounds and carrying forty pounds for one hundred feet, continuous walking for no more than fifteen minutes, \u201climited\u201d stair climbing, no ladder climbing, and no kneeling or crawling without knee pads.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Appellant had to use a walker, crutches, and a cane for several months before returning to \u201clight duty\u201d at work on February 19, 2007. But in March, the Housing Commission discharged appellant because there was no permanent light duty work and because appellant could no longer perform the tasks required by his normal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The Housing Commission\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurance carrier retained the services of Stuart Porter, an employment counselor with the GENEX company. He assessed appellant\u2019s vocational abilities and refined his resume to include his skills and experience\u2014basic plumbing, carpentry, hardware, use of hand tools, restaurant management, cooking, and customer service. Appellant applied for work with several employers but secured no interviews or offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Appellant\u2019s suit came to trial on April 26, 2010. Appellant and his wife testified that, after the accident, appellant suffered from boredom and the frustration of knowing that he could no longer work outside or inside the home, no longer enjoy his daily walks with his wife, and no longer entertain their friends, as was their habit. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that they now argue more frequently and have considered separation and divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellant called Dr. Jeffrey Phillips, an orthopedic specialist, who opined as to appellant\u2019s disability. On cross-examination, Dr. Phillips testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">Q. Okay, you mentioned on direct examination, I think near the end, that you thought that given Mr. Yiallouros\u2019 injury, he couldn\u2019t go back to his old work as a maintenance mechanic, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">Q. All right, but you also said that Mr. Yiallouros is capable of working, just not in that job, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">A. Without a doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">Q. Okay, something that\u2019s a little less physically taxing, a little less bending, stooping, carrying, things of that nature, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">Q. So, it\u2019s not a situation where from a medical perspective, Mr. Yiallouros is totally unemployable, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">A. From an orthopaedic point of view\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">A. \u2014without a doubt, I agree with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">On redirect, Dr. Phillips explained that his opinion was limited to appellant\u2019s physical capabilities: \u201c... I don\u2019t know what his training allows him to do. Education, that\u2019s beyond my ability. Pm just talking about work based on his ortho-paedic examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">To complement Dr. Phillips\u2019 testimony, appellant offered the opinion of Lianne Friedman. Appellee chose not to conduct <em>voire dire </em>or to demand a hearing to determine her qualifications, and the court designated her as \u201can expert in the field of vocational rehabilitation counseling and employment.\u201d Friedman testified that she interviewed appellant and reviewed his medical history and capability assessments, and determined whether appellant could find employment in light of \u201cwhat the labor market is and what the labor market requires and what employers are looking for.\u201d She then rendered her opinion, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">A. It\u2019s my opinion because of a combination of factors, but mostly because of this injury, because of his knee and foot injury, he is not placeable or employable at this time. He sustained a total loss of earning capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">Q. Please explain to the jury what specifically is your basis for coming up with that opinion, that he is totally incapable of working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">A. Mr. Yiallouros only has a high school diploma from Cyprus. He doesn\u2019t have any college or additional training or education. The only jobs that he has ever had either in restaurant work or as a maintenance mechanic are very heavy jobs. They\u2019re not sedentary. They\u2019re not just sitting at a desk or getting up and moving around a little bit. You have to carry, lift, walk, do stairs, kneel, bend, stoop, work with tools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>And at his job at Housing Opportunities Commission, he did not have an assistant. He was, he did the work alone. So he\u2019s not able to perform any of those tasks anymore and what is required by the employer. Maybe he can still do some of those things, but he can\u2019t do all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">And in addition to that, if that weren\u2019t bad enough at this point, the\u2014he\u2019s 61 now and the market, the labor market right now is so bad that no one is going to hire him, nobody. He doesn\u2019t have the skills or the physical capability to do the types of jobs that he knows how to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">... And the jobs that he\u2019s had, restaurant work and as a maintenance mechanic are very physically stressful jobs and that\u2019s the only work he\u2019s ever done. And he doesn\u2019t have the kinds of transferrable skills like computer work or management or administrative work that could help him go back to work in a sedentary job, in a less physically stressful job. So he\u2019s not going to be able to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">Q. He did some restaurant management, but that\u2019s, you don\u2019t think that\u2019s transferable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">A. Well, but it\u2019s, even as a restaurant manager, managers don\u2019t just sit there. They are right in there doing all the work beside their employees. So it\u2019s not the type of management work where you\u2019re just sitting in an office all day. He\u2019s out there working as well, along with his employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">On cross-examination, appellee confronted Friedman with a document in which appellant\u2019s employment counselor asked appellant\u2019s treating physician to \u201cindicate approval\u201d of certain jobs. Appellant\u2019s physician had checked \u2018Yes\u201d next to all six listed positions: \u201cSchool Bus Driver,\u201d \u201cCashier,\u201d \u201cRental Car Delivery Driver,\u201d \u201cShuttle Driver,\u201d \u201cSecurity Console Monitor,\u201d and \u201cService Dispatcher.\u201d Friedman explained why, in her opinion, appellant was not qualified for those positions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amh-dedup-0\">A. School bus driver. There are steps that\u2014most buses you have to get up the steps throughout the day and he has problems with steps. You have to do some maintenance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>your vehicle and sometimes that might include bending and kneeling and crawling. So that\u2019s going to be a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">And I know that he did apply for that position and was never even called for an interview. You also have to have a certain license which he does not have to drive a school bus. But physically I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an appropriate job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">A. Well, because of the things that I just mentioned, going up and down steps and having to do some checks and maintenance on your vehicle as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">Q. The school bus driver would have to deal with the children involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">A. That too. In case of an emergency, he\u2019d have to be able to react and help in an emergency and with a bad leg that would not be a good idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">Q. Okay. Next, cashier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">A. Cashier, most cashiers that I know that I\u2019ve worked with stand all day long. Very, very few get a place to sit. They\u2019re on their feet all day long. He can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">Rental car delivery driver, you\u2019re sitting most <em>of </em>the day and that\u2019s difficult for someone with his limitations as well. The same thing, the shuttle driver has the same types of problems that the school bus driver has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">Security console monitor, those jobs are not out there. They are very, very few and far between and you have to have computer skills and he doesn\u2019t have any computer skills. And the same with service dispatcher, those are, those you need computer skills for and he doesn\u2019t have computer skills. And someone is not going to hire a 61-year-old and give him computer skill training when they can get someone who already has plenty of able-bodied people out there with lots of computer skills and experience in those positions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">He has no experience in those positions. So, for a variety of reasons, I understand why Mr. Porter may have targeted those, but I\u2019m sure that if they got down to an interview, which I don\u2019t know if he had them or not, and he had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>a detailed job description, he would not have been able to perform them either physically or because he doesn\u2019t have the education and experience or skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On re-cross examination, Friedman further explained that while appellant could potentially learn new skills, \u201cat this age it\u2019s not worth the time or the expense because at his age he is not going to be hired for the types of jobs that he can physically do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Appellant\u2019s other expert, Thomas Borzilleri, a Ph.D. economist, opined that the present value of appellant\u2019s future lost earnings was between $330,607.00 and $404,787.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">On April 28, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for appellant and awarded $32,000.88 for past medical expenses, $35,191.80 for past lost wages, $409,787.00 for loss of future wages, $224,010.16 for pain and suffering, and $224,010.16 for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Appellee filed a motion for remittitur or new trial on the issue of damages. Appellee argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">[T]he award for future lost wages [shocks] the conscience given the unreliability of the expert testimony on this issue, including the extent to which the opinion of total disability from employment offered by Ms. Friedman is entirely contradicted by the Plaintiffs own medical experts. Indeed, the issue of one\u2019s physical incapacity to be employed is a medical one, customarily within the sole province of a medical expert, and courts traditionally require contradictory medical evidence to rebut such opinions. In the instant matter, however, the Plaintiff merely presented the unsupported factual opinion testimony of a non-medical expert to rebut the uncontradicted medical opinions of Plaintiffs own medical experts, all within his own case-in-chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Ms. Friedman\u2019s opinions are unreliable and lack an adequate basis. She performed almost no analysis of plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>vocational abilities or opportunities. There was no diagnostic testing and no determination of the specifics of alternative employment that might be available to plaintiff. Her opinions as to Mr. Yiallouros\u2019 inability to work in any occupation were directly contradicted by his treating physician, Dr. James Gilbert, as well as plaintiffs medical expert witness, Dr. Phillips.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Appellee further argued that the amount of non-economic damages awarded were \u201cexcessive and disproportionate to the injuries sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At the conclusion of a hearing on June 16, 2010, the court ruled from the bench that Friedman\u2019s testimony had been admitted in error and required a new trial on liability and damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">The Court erred and the jury was improperly influenced by expert testimony of the vocational rehabilitation witness which the Court never should have admitted into evidence. She totally lacked any factual basis, much less an adequate factual basis for opinion under Maryland Rule 5-702 and 5-703. She gave basically a \u201cbecause I said so opinion.\u201d It was interesting. I shouldn\u2019t have let it in, I did. The error is mine, I apologize. But it is nonetheless an error, which, in my judgment, so fundamentally affected the decision in this case as to warrant a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">While it is certainly true that the plaintiff suffered an injury and suffered a serious injury, by all accounts of the competent medical evidence, he has recovered from his injury. And while it very well may be he may not return to his former line of work, he is a highly skilled individual. He ran a restaurant. He\u2019s done all manner of gainful employment since immigrating to this country for which he is to be commended. The notion that he is simply incapable or unemployable is, to be blunt, nonsensical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The court also found that the jury\u2019s award of non-economic damages so grossly excessive that they shocked the conscience of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>I\u2019ve already said the jury\u2019s finding of future lost wages of $409,787 is without factual basis, was predicated on improper, quote unquote, expert testimony and does shock the conscience of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">The non-economic losses, exclusive of loss of consortium, were determined by this jury to be $224,010.16. It\u2019s an interesting number, but the Court finds it is irrational based on the evidence. It is against the evidence. It is against the weight of the evidence. It is excessive, as was the jury\u2019s conclusion that the marital unit should be awarded, interestingly enough, an identical amount for loss of consortium, $224,010.16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">Before joining the bench, this member of the Court was for over a decade national litigation counsel for one of the largest entities on the planet. In that capacity, I either personally tried or supervised the trial of hundreds, it\u2019s probably bigger than that, but I don\u2019t want to overstate it, hundreds of tort cases in jurisdictions, including Maryland, all over the United States of America. In addition, I represented plaintiffs, not defendants, plaintiffs in complex cases in the State of New York, the State of Florida, the State of Maryland, and other states whose names escape me at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Some of the venues were plaintiff friendly, others were more kind to the defense side of the equation, but each case and each trial was different. I have as both a trial lawyer and a trial judge seen low verdicts, high verdicts, and outlier verdicts. The verdict in this case, particularly on damages, was more than just a surprise. In legal parlance, the Court was, quote unquote, shocked, and for that reason the motion for a new trial is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The court convened a second trial, and appellee demanded a hearing to determine Friedman\u2019s qualifications as an expert under Rule 5-702. Friedman testified\u2014as she had during the first trial\u2014that she holds a master\u2019s degree in rehabilitation counseling of the hearing impaired from Gallaudet University <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and has over twenty years of experience in that field. In her work, she would assess her subject\u2019s capabilities and determine whether the subject needed and could complete vocational training, then she would attempt to find a suitable job. She testified that \u201c95%\u201d of her present work is related to litigation, but that it still requires these steps in each case. As to her assessment of <em>prospective </em>job opportunities, Friedman testified: \u201cWe also have to research the labor market to see if the jobs that we think are appropriate even exist in the labor market in sufficient numbers in order to place them. We work with employers and recruiters in order to find out what\u2019s available in the labor market.\u201d The court concluded the hearing by ruling that although there were \u201cweaknesses in her predicate for rendering her opinion,\u201d it could not find that Friedman\u2019s opinion was without any factual basis, and that \u201cthose weaknesses can be fully fleshed out in cross-examination and otherwise but that the jury should not be deprived of her opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">During the second trial, appellee called Anthony Cornetto, an accident reconstruction expert, to testify. The court had ruled <em>in limine </em>that Cornetto could present his measurement of ground distances and his estimations of speed, stopping time, and stopping distance\u2014including his assumptions of average reaction times\u2014but that Cornetto <em>could not </em>give an opinion of what appellant otherwise could have done to avoid the accident. At trial, Cornetto gave several estimations of the distance and time it would have taken for appellant to stop at a given speed (and vice-versa) and with the assumption of normal reaction times. On cross-examination, counsel asked whether appellant could have taken longer than average to perceive appellee\u2019s truck, to which Cornetto replied: \u201cNo, because in this accident, if that was the case, it still would have been avoided.\u201d The court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike this testimony on the grounds that it did not violate the court\u2019s ruling <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">At the conclusion of the second trial, the jury found that appellee was negligent but that appellant was contributorily negligent and awarded no damages. The court denied appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>lant\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial, and appellant filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Appellant argues that the court erred when it granted appellee\u2019s motion for new trial. Nominally, the standard of review governing such a ruling is \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d but as applied to new trial decisions, the phrase takes on a meaning different from its ordinary use in describing appellate review. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom </em>Rugs, 328 Md. 51, 58-59, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">[T]he breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed and immutable; rather, it will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered, and the extent to which the exercise of that discretion depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial and to rely on his own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQAj\">The <em>Buck </em>Court went on to explain that the degree of deference that is to be extended reflects the general scheme of appellate review, <em>viz., </em>it depends on the extent to which the decision rests on the trial court\u2019s particular knowledge and expertise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">In the case before us, the range of discretion of the trial judge was necessarily at its broadest. The motion for a new trial did not deal with the admissibility or quality of newly discovered evidence, nor with technical matters. Instead, it asked the trial judge to draw upon his own view of the weight of the evidence; the effect of an accumulation of alleged errors or improprieties by defense counsel, no one of which may have been serious enough to provoke a request for, or justify the granting of, a mistrial; and the allegedly inadequate verdict, in determining whether justice would be served by granting a new trial. Under circumstances such as this, the power to grant a new trial is an equitable one in its nature. Because the exercise of discretion under these circumstances depends so heavily upon the unique opportunity the trial judge has to closely observe the entire trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>complete with nuances, inflections, and impressions never to be gained from a cold record, it is a discretion that will rarely, if ever, be disturbed on appeal. It is that concept which led this Court in the past to state, albeit too broadly in the context of all motions for new trial, that such a decision is effectively unreviewable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 59, 612 A.2d 1294 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The trial court in this case held that it had erroneously admitted testimony from appellant\u2019s vocational expert, who lacked an adequate factual basis for her opinions. Appellee argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial was \u201cwholly dependent upon [its] evaluation of the character of the testimony, [its] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, and [its] assignment of weight to the evidence presented at trial,\u201d and concludes that the court\u2019s ruling is therefore \u201centitled to the broadest range of discretion.\u201d We disagree. It is not clear what formed the precise basis of the court\u2019s ruling, but the record presents three possibilities that demonstrate the distinction between evidentiary \u201cweight\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d matters, of which none are availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">An ordinary fact witness merely states his or her recollection of past events, whereas an expert opinion draws from given facts to reach a conclusion that cannot be tested directly. In this case, for example, there was no way to determine at present what the future holds for appellant, and yet the law of damages entitles him to the benefit of his future earnings. <em>See Adams v. Benson, </em>208 Md. 261, 271, 117 A.2d 881 (1955) (citing <em>McMahon v. Northern C. R. Co., </em>39 Md. 438 (1874); <em>Bannon v. Baltimore &amp; O.R.R. Co., </em>24 Md. 108, 123 (1866)). Believing that question to be \u201cbeyond the ken of the average layman,\u201d <em>Schultz v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>413 Md. 15, 28-29, 990 A.2d 1078 (2010), appellant called on an expert to predict appellant\u2019s future lost earning capacity based on her knowledge of appellant\u2019s abilities and market demand. Under Rule 5-702, her opinion required a \u201csufficient factual basis,\u201d which is the crux of the matter before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Stripped to its essence, Friedman\u2019s opinion was a proposition, drawing a conclusion from a set of facts using logical inference. As such, it was subject to three primary criticisms, each falling along the spectrum of discretion: first, that the expert misrepresented her <em>knowledge </em>of the given facts; second, that the given facts are <em>objectively </em>untrue; and third, that the conclusion does not follow logically from the given facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The first of these generic attacks on expert testimony is essentially a question of truthfulness that will ordinarily \u201cdepend upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial and to rely on his own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice,\u201d thereby vesting the court with wide discretion. But in this case there was no indication or argument that Friedman was actively misrepresenting such fundamental matters as her <em>curriculum vitae </em>or the fact that she had studied and dealt with the relevant labor markets. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship of Tatianna B., </em>417 Md. 259, 268, 9 A.3d 502 (2010) (depth of the expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>experience with the subject goes to the weight of her testimony, not the admissibility of her testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">At the other end of the discretionary spectrum lies the third category of attack on expert opinion, \u201cvalidity,\u201d which\u2014 to borrow a phrase from Buck\u2014is a \u201ctechnical\u201d matter unobscured even after the record \u201ccools\u201d on appeal. Here, again, the court had no reason to pass judgment on such issues, for no one argued that it was impossible or impermissible to infer future market demand from knowledge of present conditions and trends, or that appellant\u2019s physical capabilities also could not be forecasted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Rather than attack Friedman\u2019s representations of her substantive knowledge, or the logical validity of her conclusions, appellee grounded his argument\u2014and the court its ruling\u2014on the substantive falsity of her \u201cfactual basis,\u201d taking as proof that her testimony contradicted several medical assessments of appellant\u2019s \u201ccapabilities.\u201d To that end, appellee correctly states that appellant \u201cindicated that he believed he was physically capable of performing alternative employment,\u201d that Dr. Gilbert advised \u201cthat [appellant] was medically capable of performing\u201d alternative employment, and that in Dr. Phillips\u2019 opinion appellant could work in a position that was \u201cless physically taxing.\u201d But as appellant rightly argues, these are phantom contradictions. Ms. Friedman plainly opined that while appellant was <em>physically </em>capable of performing <em>many </em>jobs, he was <em>otherwise incapable </em>because he lacked the skill, training, and experience that those positions demanded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although appellant had considerable work experience, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>his expert testified that from her experience and knowledge of the labor market as well as various professional assessments of his physical limitations, appellant could no longer be employed in physically demanding jobs and he was not equipped with the requisite skills for sedentary employment. There simply was no contradiction between this opinion and the medical opinions given at trial, which were that appellant could\u2014hypothetically\u2014work in a sedentary position.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Two additional and related considerations bolster our opinion. The <em>Buck </em>Court held that \u201cthe failure of the moving party to object to an alleged error or impropriety at trial is a significant factor to be considered by the trial judge when that error is later argued in support of a motion for new trial. A motion for new trial should not be an opportunity to \u2018sandbag\u2019 an opponent, nor ordinarily to correct oversights that might have been remedied at trial if seasonably noted.\u201d 328 Md. at 62, 612 A.2d 1294. Appellee argues that the grounds for his new trial motion could not have been raised prior to the verdict because the weight of the evidence does not arise during the course of trial. But as we have seen, appellee\u2019s arguments did not indict the jury\u2019s <em>subjective weighing </em>of the evidence, but rather the <em>basis </em>for Friedman\u2019s opinion testimony, a matter that could have (and should have) been raised during trial. This was precisely the issue that the second trial court determined when appellee, having learned from experience, requested a Frye/Reed<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> hearing on Friedman\u2019s qualifications as an expert. After hearing at length from both parties, the court held that appellee\u2019s various attacks on her opinion\u2014 including the argument of interest that she contradicted other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>medical experts\u2014were problematic but should nevertheless be developed at trial and submitted to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">We\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time, I\u2019m not saying it was not justified, regarding whether or not Ms. Friedman would be permitted to testify basically as she stated in her report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">And the court finds it to be a very close call. There are clear, in the Court\u2019s view, weaknesses in her predicate for rendering her opinion but the Court cannot find that it is without any factual basis and accordingly, she may testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">And the Court finds that those weaknesses can be fully fleshed out in cross-examination and otherwise but that the jury should not be deprived of her opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">When the court granted appellee\u2019s new trial motion, it interjected itself and confused the weight of the evidence with its admissibility. As the second trial court determined, Friedman\u2019s many years of experience, her knowledge of the labor market, and her skill in performing employment assessments qualified her at least to <em>testify </em>before the jury so that it could weigh the evidence and reach a verdict. Whether the first trial court\u2019s operative error was an abuse of discretion in granting a new trial, or was the clearly erroneous finding that the expert testimony was contradicted and thus could not form a sufficient factual basis for any opinion, we must reverse.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The question of wow-economic damages, however, was an independent factual matter, and we have no reason to reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling thereupon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The presiding judge drew from his many years of experience as a lawyer and a jurist, as well as his immediate observations of the relevant evidence, to conclude that the non-economic damages awarded were grossly excessive. The court\u2019s finding\u2014and our holding\u2014finds further support in the jury\u2019s unusual awards of damages for pain and suffering and for loss of consortium. Specifically, the jury awarded <em>precisely </em>$224,010.16 for each, an amount which, when added to appellant\u2019s economic damages, brings the total award to the round figure of $925,000.00. Neither the trial court nor we can escape the conclusion that the jury determined its award for economic damages and then awarded non-economic damages as an exercise in arithmetic \u201cguesswork,\u201d failing to consider what amounts would actually compensate a reasonable person for the pain and suffering of his physical injuries, as a matter separate and distinct from any alleged loss of consortium.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Quality Discount Tires, Inc. v.
