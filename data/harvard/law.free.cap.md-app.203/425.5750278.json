On August 31, 2010, the court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on appellants\u2019 counts requesting writs of <em>mandamus. </em>The court allowed appellants\u2019 request for declaratory judgments to proceed and, after a three day trial, entered judgment in favor of appellees on September 29, 2010. The court subsequently denied appellants\u2019 motion to alter or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>amend judgment, and appellants noted this timely appeal on November 9, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Appellants present the following questions, which we have edited to comport with our discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 claims for <em>mandamus </em>relief in Counts I, II, and III?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred in entering judgment for Appellees on Appellants\u2019 claim for declaratory relief in Count IV?[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">For the reasons that follow, we answer no to both questions and we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Oregon leases from The Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks (\u201cParks Department\u201d) a 2.63 acre parcel of land located on the grounds of the Oregon Ridge Park.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>lease provides that Oregon\u2019s use must comply with all federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, and reserves for the Parks Department the \u201cright and duty at all times, to exercise full governmental control and regulations with respect to all matters connected with the Lease[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In 1994, the County submitted three petitions to the Baltimore County Zoning Commissioner. First, the County requested a special hearing, pursuant to Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\u201cBCZR\u201d or the \u201cRegulations\u201d) \u00a7 500.7, to determine whether the property and Oregon\u2019s proposed improvements were exempt from the Regulations. Second, the County requested a special exception to allow a restaurant on the property. Third, the County requested a special variance from BCZR \u00a7 409.8, which required a paved parking lot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On June 28, 1994, the Deputy Zoning Commissioner determined that, because the property was being leased to a private party, its use would be subject to the BCZR. The Deputy Commissioner simultaneously granted the County\u2019s petition for a special exception to operate a restaurant, on the condition that its outdoor area must be used only for seated dining\u2014not for catering or special events\u2014and must not employ \u201ctents, canopies, or other similar overhead covering,\u201d except for \u201ctable umbrellas.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the Deputy Commissioner granted a variance to allow a parking lot of \u201ccrushed stone or other permeable surface in lieu of the required paving,\u201d so as not to \u201cdisturb the natural state\u201d of the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Various individuals and community associations appealed the zoning commissioner\u2019s decision. While the appeal was pending, Oregon entered into a restrictive covenant with The Valleys Planning Council, Inc., whose terms refined certain terms of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order. The County and Oregon incorporated these terms in a supplemental lease agreement of November, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On February 8, 1995, the County Board of Appeals issued an order that upheld the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order granting the County a special exception. The Board\u2019s order incorporated certain of the covenanted terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">3. The alternate outdoor dining area/patio locations ... shall only be utilized for dining or pre-dinner cocktails, so long as patrons are subsequently served dinner, and shall be limited in quantity to 125 persons. There will be no outdoor bars, live music, tents, or similar overhead coverings on or serving the outdoor dining area. Music shall not be audible from any neighboring residences that exist as of the date of this Board\u2019s Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">9. The parking area shall consist of a non-paved surface such as stone or a similar permeable surface unless otherwise required by law. All parking will be contained within the leased area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Board\u2019s Order also granted the County a variance to allow \u201c94 parking spaces in lieu of the required 145.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In April, 2002, Oregon was negotiating the lease of an adjacent parcel from the County in order to expand its property and filed three zoning petitions, all seeking to amend the Board\u2019s 1995 order. First, Oregon requested a special hearing to remove restrictions on the outdoor seating area, including restriction three (above). Second, Oregon sought to expand the area subject to the special exception in order to provide additional parking on property yet to be leased. Third, Oregon sought a variance to permit the expanded portion of the parking lot to be \u201cstone ... in lieu of a durable and dustless surface\u201d required by BCZR \u00a7 409.8, so that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>use would be consistent with restriction number nine of the 1995 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The Board denied Oregon\u2019s petitions in an order dated July <em>2, </em>2004. The accompanying memorandum explained that because the adjacent property was not yet leased from the County, Oregon was not an \u201cinterested person\u201d under Maryland Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(U), and the Board lacked authority to grant Oregon\u2019s petitions. Notwithstanding that determination, the Board went on to address several substantive issues raised in Oregon\u2019s petitions and in the protestants\u2019 oppositions thereto. The Board explained that Oregon\u2019s arguments against the outdoor seating restrictions could have been raised during the proceedings in 1995, but because they were not, the Board would not disturb the 1995 restrictions. The Board noted that while Oregon \u201cis certainly entitled to file [its] requested changes to the original 1995 Board\u2019s Order, in the form of a special hearing, special exception, or variance request, it is the responsibility of this Board not to disturb the original Board\u2019s Order simply to accommodate the desires of the Petitioner in response to the increased popularity and prestige of his establishment.\u201d Similarly, Oregon\u2019s opponents charged it with operating in violation of its special exception and requested that the Board \u201crevisit the entire special exception because it[ was] a change of the prior use.\u201d But the Board explained that it would not do so because, \u201cif the restaurant was operating illegally, it more appropriately was the subject of a \u2018Code Enforcement\u2019 action\u2014subject to investigation and determination by the Department of Permits and Development Management.\u201d The Board did, however, note its concern as to whether Oregon \u201cis in compliance with the original Board\u2019s Order relative to the parking lot surface\u201d because an engineering expert testified that the then-existing parking lot was \u201ctar and chip\u201d with a stone base and macadam covering, \u201cwhich is considered impervious by Baltimore County for purposes of stormwater management.\u201d The Board therefore denied Oregon\u2019s petitions for a special exception and variance because\u2014among other reasons\u2014the \u201cexisting and proposed parking lots considerably exceed the 10% permeabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ity limit set forth in BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s opinion concluded by denying all three of Oregon\u2019s petitions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In early 2006, the Parks Department Director decided to investigate citizen complaints about the condition of Oregon\u2019s parking lot. On March first of that year, the County Department of Permits and Development Management (\u201cPermits and Development\u201d) received a memorandum from the Parks Department Director, who wrote as the \u201clandlord and property owner\u201d to request a property inspection so that the County could \u201cformalize a plan and design that [would] allow the department to conform to ADA as well as safety requirements as they relate to the parking lot conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A Permits and Development Department staff member inspected the parking lot and wrote to his director that \u201c[t]he parking lot is not ADA compliant due to the fact that the access route has numerous potholes\u201d and because \u201c[p]arking space striping is non existant\u201d [sic]. The staff member further advised that \u201c[s]triping, repaving &amp; proper sign height is needed at the site ASAP to avoid any future issues with ADA requirements and to [reduce<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] chances of personal injury.\u201d On March 28, 2006, the Permits and Development Director forwarded these findings to the Parks Department Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">On June 8, 2006, the Parks Department Director notified Oregon in writing that because \u201cthe parking lot violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Americans with Disabilities Act,\u201d Oregon was \u201cin default under the terms of the Lease.\u201d The letter therefore \u201cdemanded\u201d that Oregon, at its own expense, \u201cpave the parking lot to bring it into compliance with the ADA and to remedy its unsafe condition.\u201d The letter further notified Oregon that if it failed to take that action within fifteen days, the Department would \u201center upon the premises and make the necessary repairs to the parking lot,\u201d with Oregon still to bear the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Sometime in November of 2006, a contractor paved the property\u2019s parking lot. The Parks Department inspected the property and, on November 30, notified Oregon that \u201cthe parking lot is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act\u201d (emphasis in original), and that should Oregon fail to pay the contractor\u2019s invoice of $85,700.00, the Parks Department would \u201chave the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the Lease, take possession of the premises and pursue any and all legal remedies it may have under the Lease and Maryland Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In a letter dated December 19, 2006, counsel for Oregon wrote a letter to the Parks Department and explained that he thought it \u201cnecessary to summarize the sequence of events leading up to this demand for payment letter.\u201d Counsel then wrote that after giving Oregon notice of default, \u201cBaltimore County exercised its right to enter upon the premises and repair the condition of the parking lot, and retained the services of George Cowman, Jr., Inc. to pave the parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">At some point prior to this action, Oregon installed several large squares of fabric over the outdoor seating area, each approximately ten feet on a side, hanging from structures resembling streetlights that line the area\u2019s perimeter and are bolted into the ground. Beneath each square hangs an electric ceiling fan with lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In 2007, appellants contacted the Permits and Development Director, the Parks Department Director, the County Office of Law, and the Director of Environmental Protection and Resource Management, and requested that each take action to change Oregon\u2019s present condition. In the summer of 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the County Office of Law informed appellants that the County would not act on the appellants\u2019 requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In August, 2008, appellants brought suit against Oregon and the County in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In the first three counts of their complaint, appellants requested that the court issue writs of <em>mandamus </em>ordering Baltimore County to \u201ccomply with the County Code and County Charter\u201d and enforce the terms of the Board\u2019s orders, its supplemental lease agreement with Oregon, and BCZR \u00a7 1A08.4.B.3 (the impervious surface limitation). In count four, appellants also requested that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">A. enter a declaration that Oregon has violated and shall refrain from further violating (i) the terms of the February 1995 and July 2004 orders of the Board of Appeals, (ii) the terms of the Lease Agreement and Supplemental Lease Agreement; and (iii) the impervious surface limitation in 1A03.4.B.3 of the Zoning Regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">B. enter a declaration that the County has failed to comply with its duties under the County Code and the County Charter by (i) failing to enforce the terms of the February 1995 and July 2004 orders entered by the Board of Appeals; (ii) failing to enforce the terms of the Supplement Lease Agreement; (iii) failing to enforce the impervious surface limitation in section 1A03.4.B.3 of the Zoning Regulations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">C. enter a declaration that the terms of the February 1995 and July 2004 orders of the Board of Appeals are fully enforceable and shall be enforced by the County, including the terms of those orders providing that: (i) catering and the hosting of weddings or outdoor events at the Oregon Grille is prohibited; (ii) the parking lot at the Oregon Grille shall remain a non-paved surface such as stone or similar permeable surface; and (iii) all parking at the Oregon Grille shall be contained within the area leased from the County;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>D. enter a declaration that the terms of the Lease Agreement and Supplemental Lease Agreement are fully enforceable and shall be enforced by the County, including the terms providing that: (i) the outdoor dining area at the Oregon Grille shall be used only for dining or pre-dinner cocktails so long as patrons are subsequently served dinner; (ii) catering and the hosting of weddings or outdoor events at the Oregon Grille is prohibited; (iii) the parking lot at the Oregon Grille shall remain a non-paved surface such as stone or similar permeable surface; and (iv) the Property shall \u201cfully comply with all federal and state laws, county ordinances, and regulations of public authority\u201d, including but not limited to the impervious surface limitation in section 1A03.4.B.3 of the County\u2019s Zoning Regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">E. enter a declaration that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not require that the entire parking lot at the Property be paved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">F. enter an order that Oregon shall remove all paving from that portion of the parking lot at the Property that is not required to be paved under the Americans with Disabilities Act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">G. grant such other and further relief that the nature of this cause requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">On June 1, 2010, appellants moved for partial summary judgment. Oregon opposed appellants\u2019 motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Appellants argued that it was undisputed that appellees had violated the Board\u2019s orders and breached the lease agreement, and that the court should issue a writ of <em>mandamus </em>\u201cdirecting the County to enforce the prohibitions against: (1) paving the parking lot; (2) having more than 94 parking spaces in the parking lot; and (3) installing permanent canopies in the outside dining area[,]\u201d and enter \u201ca declaration that the ADA does not and did not require the paving of the parking lot,\u201d as well as \u201ca declaration that the County and Oregon, at their expense, shall remove the paving from the parking lot and return that area of the Property to a permeable condition^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>On August 31, 2010, the court entered summary judgment against appellants on the issue of <em>mandamus. </em>In the same order, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on its declaratory counts, leaving those requests for trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">At trial, Parks Department Director Robert Barrett testified that he advised Oregon that it could bypass the County\u2019s competitive bidding process by selecting a paving contractor, and he asserted that the County had no involvement in the process beyond its written notices, detailed above. Oregon\u2019s witness and owner, Theodore Bauer, denied selecting or meeting the contractor and testified that the County had retained the contractor (as Oregon\u2019s counsel stated in the aforementioned letter of December 19, 2006). The court also heard testimony from David Carroll, Director of the County Office of Sustainability. Carroll testified that the parking lot surface was impermeable at the time of the Board\u2019s 1995 order and remained impermeable after the paving in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">At the conclusion of trial, the court found that the fabric coverings in the outdoor seating area were \u201cvery large umbrellas\u201d that complied with the Board\u2019s orders, and that neither the ADA nor BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3 required that the lot be paved. However, the court found that the parking lot\u2019s impermeable surface and number of parking spaces violated the Board\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court then held that although appellants \u201cmay have been required to institute some zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>action\u201d to enforce the Board\u2019s orders and BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3, this did not preclude declaratory relief because the zoning action was a \u201cconcurrent remedy\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> under \u00a7 3-409(c) of the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, and because the court was \u201cnot entirely persuaded that there is ... an adequate remedy available to the Plaintiffs under the zoning law[.]\u201d However, the court held that declaratory relief would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy, that it would not be \u201cproper,\u201d under section 3-412 of the Declaratory Judgment Act, to order Oregon to remove the paved surface at its own expense, that appellants had not requested that the court order the County to remove the paved surface itself, and that \u00a7 3-409 of the Declaratory Judgment Act did not authorize injunctive relief. Therefore, the court denied appellants\u2019 request for relief and entered judgment in favor of appellees. The court subsequently denied appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend judgment, and appellants noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">It is easy to conceive of government as the Heraclean offspring of our mortal electorate and our immortal ideals, acting with heroic purpose and singleness of mind. But in reality, government more often resembles the many-necked Hydra, flickering its tongues and periodically replacing its departed heads. And while we wish to call upon our government as a hero, we face the tragic reality that it is fundamentally an amalgamation of elected and appointed <em>people, </em>each doing his or her best to serve the public but unable to maintain perfect consistency in all circumstances. Thus we find Oregon, directed in contradiction by the County\u2019s various heads. Appellants, meanwhile, take the County to be an animal at their command that must mindlessly enforce the law in its various forms. But the County is no beast, and there is a process to resolve these conflicts and direct the County\u2019s actions. Because appellants have not availed themselves of that process, we shall affirm the judgments in favor of appel-lees, albeit on grounds different than the trial court\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">I. Duty, Discretion, and <em>Mandamus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Appellants first contend that the trial court erred when it held that the requested relief was within the County\u2019s discretion and therefore refused to issue writs of <em>mandamus. </em>Appellants argue that <em>mandamus </em>should have issued because \u201cthe County had a clear, non-discretionary duty to enforce the Orders of the Board of Appeals, the Zoning Regulations, and the Supplemental Lease Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>A writ of <em>mandamus </em>issues \u201cto compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right.\u201d <em>Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145, 680 A.2d 1040 (1996) (quoting <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55 (1975); <em>George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>59 Md. 255, 259 (1883)). Importantly, <em>mandamus </em>\u201cdoes not lie where the action to be reviewed is discretionary or depends on personal judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County v. Sec\u2019y of Pers., </em>317 Md. 34, 46, 562 A.2d 700 (1989); <em>In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 305-06, 539 A.2d 664 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Appellants argue that the County Code and Charter bind certain of its agencies to enforce the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, Board orders,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the terms of the lease between the County and Oregon.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, Code \u00a7 3-2-1103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>provides that the Department of Permits and Development Management \u201cshall administer and enforce ... [a]ll laws, maps, and regulations related to zoning[.]\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellants argue that this mandate attaches not only to the impervious surface limitation of BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3, but also to Board orders, which appellants consider to be \u201claws related to zoning.\u201d Second, Code \u00a7 3-2-604 states that the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management \u201cshall ... [a]dminister and enforce environmental laws, regulations, programs, and activities,\u201d which, according to appellants, includes BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3. Third, section 522.1(a)(5) of the Baltimore County Charter states that the Office of Planning and Zoning \u201cshall have the responsibility and duty of planning for Baltimore County, including ... [a]dministering the zoning code,\u201d and in particular BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3. Fourth, Charter Sections 523 and 533 charge the Department and the Board of Recreation and Parks with the \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201cduty\u201d to manage park lands and to \u201cperform such other functions and duties as may be provided from time to time by the legislative act of the county council,\u201d including the requirement in Code \u00a7 3-9-110 that any lease of parklands \u201c[ejxpressly reserv[e] for the county administration the right and duty at all times to exercise full governmental control and regulation in respect to all matters connected with the lease not inconsistent with the terms of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We first note that none of the above provisions <em>require </em>the enforcement of any terms in Oregon\u2019s original or supplemental lease agreements, and we therefore agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>trial court\u2019s holding that the enforcement of its rights as lessor is generally within the County\u2019s discretion. While the Parks Department must <em>reserve </em>the \u201cright and duty\u201d to exercise governmental control and regulation, the Code nowhere requires that the Parks Department <em>enforce </em>those reserved rights and duties. Although Charter Sections 523 and 533 charge the Parks Board and Department with management of park lands, those sections do not contain specific edicts <em>requiring </em>enforcement of any particular laws or regulations. And while they are obligated to perform \u201cother functions and duties as may be provided from time to time by the legislative act of the county council,\u201d there is no indication that the council has imposed legal or regulatory enforcement as one such function or duty. Thus, <em>if </em>the County is <em>obligated </em>to pursue its \u201crights and duties,\u201d that obligation must be found in the Code or Charter rather than the Park Department\u2019s contractual obligations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Hall v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>171 Md. 449, 453, 189 A. 206 (1937) (\u201cmandamus will not lie for an alleged breach of contract\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Clark v.

Section \u00a7 3-6-20 provides that \u201c[i]n addition to any other remedy authorized by law,\u201d county officials <em>\u201cmay </em>en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>force and seek correction of a violation as provided in this title\u201d (emphasis added). The County argues that this section makes any and all enforcement permissive, citing our opinion in <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Potomac River Ass\u2019n, </em>113 Md.App. 580, 688 A.2d 515 (1997). In that case, we held that enforcement under Section 5.05 of Maryland Code, Article 66B is discretionary because it contains the following permissive language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">The county or municipal corporation <em>may </em>enjoin the transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of equity jurisdiction <em>or may </em>recover the penalty by civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 599-603, 688 A.2d 515 (emphasis added). But unlike Article 66B of the Maryland Code, the word \u201cmay\u201d in Baltimore County Code \u00a7 3-6-201 <em>follows </em>the phrase \u201cany other remedy authorized by law.\u201d This syntax limits application of the word \u201cmay\u201d to the enforcement provisions contained in the Code Enforcement Title, leaving open the possible existence of mandatory enforcement provisions elsewhere. And mandatory enforcement provisions are precisely what we find in the various Code and Charter provisions recited above.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, while enforcement <em>under the Code Enforcement Title </em>may be permissive, the County is incorrect when it asserts that enforcement is permissive <em>in general.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The Charter and Code allow the County to choose among various methods of enforcement, but that is the limit of the County\u2019s discretion and does not appear sufficient to overcome appellants\u2019 rights to <em>mandamus. </em>Relief by <em>mandamus </em>is appropriate where a tribunal refuses to exercise the judgment and discretion imposed upon them by statute. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 276-77, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005) (\u201cWhen an agency, in the face of a formal invocation of its discretion by an affected person coming within the class of persons contemplated by the statute, fails to act on a matter committed to its discretion by that statute, there is as much aggrievement and potential for abuse or prejudice as when an agency affirmatively announces an adverse decision.\u201d), and cases cited therein. <em>See also Mahoney v. Board of Supervisors, </em>205 Md. 325, 335, 108 A.2d 143 (1954) (\u201c[T]he courts, possessing inherent power to prevent violations of public trust, may grant <em>mandamus </em>requiring public officers to perform their duties without committing unlawful acts or abuses of discretion.\u201d); <em>Miles v. Stevenson, </em>80 Md. 358, 30 A. 646 (1894); 52 Am.Jur.2d Mandamus \u00a7 49 (\u201cMandamus can compel the respondent to exercise his or her discretion.\u201d). Thus, while the trial court may have lacked authority to decree a <em>specific </em>course of enforcement, it could have compelled <em>some </em>enforcement action, to be chosen by the County in its discretion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Likewise, <em>mandamus </em>can direct adherence to compulsory rules of administrative procedure. <em>Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 457, 800 A.2d 768 (2002) (\u201c[W]e have recognized that, under some circumstances, mandamus or other traditional actions may lie to enforce administrative compliance with procedural requirements or duties.\u201d). The most convenient course would be simply to order the County to resolve the conflicts in this case by administrative proceedings and issuance of an amended order, variance, or special exception. But appellants did not demand that the court compel administrative proceedings, which is understandable because the County\u2019s informal acts\u2014and present adversarial position\u2014indicate that an administrative action likely will not resolve in their favor. But as we explain, below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>this did not relieve appellants of their obligation to undertake formal administrative proceedings prior to judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">II. Administrative Exhaustion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Court of Appeals addressed administrative exhaustion at length in <em>Board of Education for Dorchester County v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 786-87, 506 A.2d 625 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[W]here the General Assembly has provided an administrative remedy and there also exists an independent judicial remedy, and no statute coordinates the two or specifies which is primary, we have ordinarily construed the pertinent enactments to require that the administrative remedy be first invoked and followed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">Where ... the administrative remedy is deemed to be primary, this Court has generally held that it must be pursued and exhausted before a court exercises jurisdiction to decide the controversy. As explained in <em>[Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 645, 409 A.2d 713 (1979) ],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cwhen the Legislature enacts a comprehensive remedial scheme in which a claim is to be determined by an administrative agency and reviewed in an administrative appeal before judicial review is available, it establishes, as public policy, that such a procedure produces the most efficient and effective results. In order to effectuate this public policy, trial courts generally should not act until there has been compliance with the statutory comprehensive remedial scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">While the failure to invoke and exhaust an administrative remedy does not ordinarily result in a trial court\u2019s being deprived of fundamental jurisdiction, nevertheless, because of the public policy involved, the matter is for some purposes treated like a jurisdictional question. Consequently, issues of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies will be addressed by this Court <em>sua sponte </em>even though not raised by any party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>(Internal citations omitted.) <em>Accord, Laurel Racing Ass\u2019n v. Video Lottery Facility Location Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Md. 445, 458, 975 A.2d 894 (2009) (quoting the above).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Administrative exhaustion is a prerequisite both to <em>mandamus </em>relief and to declaratory judgment. <em>Md. Reclamation Assocs. v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 362, 855 A.2d 351 (2004) (\u201c[W]hen administrative remedies exist in zoning cases, they must be exhausted before other actions, including requests for declaratory judgments, mandamus, and injunctive relief, may be brought.\u201d (citing <em>Josephson v. City of Annapolis, </em>353 Md. 667, 674-78, 728 A.2d 690 (1998))); <em>see also </em>CJ \u00a7 3-409(b) (\u201cIf a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d); <em>Soley v. State Com. on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 525-26, 356 A.2d 254 (1976) (CJ \u00a7 3-409(b) bars declaratory relief where administrative relief is available).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The County argues that appellants can pursue their claims under BCZR \u00a7 \u00a7 500.6 and 500.7. Baltimore County Zoning Regulation \u00a7 500.6 provides that \u201cthe Zoning Commissioner shall have the power, upon notice to the parties in interest, to conduct hearings involving any violation or alleged violation or noncompliance with any zoning regulations, or the proper interpretation thereof, and to pass his order thereon, subject to the right of appeal to the County Board of Appeals as hereinafter provided.\u201d County Zoning Regulation \u00a7 500.7 further provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">The said Zoning Commissioner shall have the power to conduct such other hearings and pass such orders thereon as shall, in his discretion, be necessary for the proper enforcement of all zoning regulations, subject to the right of appeal to the County Board of Appeals as hereinafter provided. The power given hereunder shall include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>right of any interested person to petition the Zoning Commissioner for a public hearing after advertisement and notice to determine the existence of any purported nonconforming use on any premises or to determine any rights whatsoever of such person in any property in Baltimore County insofar as they are affected by these regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Appellants argue that they have no recourse under these sections for three reasons. First, appellants claim that the plain text of BCZR \u00a7 500.7 excludes them as complainants. Specifically, they refer to the second sentence of BCZR \u00a7 500.7, which states that \u201c[t]he power given hereunder shall include the right of <em>any interested person </em>to petition the Zoning Commissioner for a public hearing after advertisement and notice to determine the existence of any purported nonconforming use on any premises or to determine any rights whatsoever <em>of such person </em>in any property in Baltimore County insofar as they are affected by these regulations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellants claim that this affords them no relief because they \u201cdid not seek a determination that Oregon has undertaken a nonconforming use or a determination of <em>their </em>rights in the subject property.\u201d But the word \u201cinclude\u201d in this sentence of \u00a7 500.7 indicates that it is illustrative and not exhaustive. The true scope of the Commissioner\u2019s power under \u00a7 500.7 is \u201cto conduct such other hearings and pass such orders thereon as shall, in his discretion, be <em>necessary for the proper enforcement of all zoning regulations, </em>subject to the right of appeal to the County Board of Appeals as hereinafter provided.\u201d The County represented to the trial court\u2014 and introduced expert testimony to prove\u2014that the Commissioner can and would exercise discretion under \u00a7 500.7 to entertain exactly the complaints that appellants have brought in this suit for <em>mandamus </em>and declaratory relief, and the regulations\u2019 plain text gives us no reason to reject that argument.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Second, appellants argue that \u00a7\u00a7 500.6 and 500.7 do not offer them redress because \u201cAppellants did not claim that Appellees violated the zoning regulations or seek an interpretation of the regulations,\u201d and that instead they \u201csought to enforce the terms\u201d of the Board\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We disagree with both appellants\u2019 premise and conclusion. As to the question of the parking lot surface, appellants plainly have claimed\u2014and maintain on appeal\u2014that Oregon violated a zoning regulation, <em>viz., </em>BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3. Moreover, the other relief that appellants seek <em>does </em>require the Zoning Commissioner to interpret the language and intent of the County Zoning Regulations and the Board\u2019s orders in order to determine whether the property stands in violation thereof, and in that case which\u2014if any\u2014conflicting regulations must yield. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32-3-301; BCZR \u00a7 307.1.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Third, appellants claim that the County\u2019s enforcement powers do not encompass Board orders. Appellants call attention to the fact that Code \u00a7 32-3-602(a) distinguishes between \u201c(1) The Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, policies, rules, or regulations interpreting the zoning regulations\u201d and \u201c(2) Orders of the Zoning Commissioner or Board of Appeals.\u201d Appellants contrast this with subsection (b) of \u00a7 32-3-602, which states that the Permits and Development Department \u201c[s]hall enforce the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, policies, rules, or regulations interpreting the zoning regulations,\u201d making no mention of orders. However, the very next section of Code, \u00a7 32-3-603, provides that when issuing a citation pursuant to its enforcement powers, Permits and Development must state \u201c[t]he section number of the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>regulation, policy, rule, or regulations interpreting the zoning regulations or <em>reference to the Zoning Commissioner\u2019s order that has been violated </em>[.]\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In light of these conflicting provisions and the Department\u2019s consistently broad enforcement authority, the omission of \u201corders\u201d from \u00a7 32-3-602(a) is no more than a drafting oversight. Thus, the Permits and Development Department has authority to enforce the Board\u2019s orders, if necessary by maintaining an action for injunctive relief under Code \u00a7 32-3-607, which introduces yet another variation on the theme by granting the power to enjoin \u201cthe erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings, structures, and land <em>in violation of this title or the zoning regulations and restrictions adopted under this title.\u201d </em>But the Board\u2019s orders enact restrictions that are adopted under the Code\u2019s Zoning Title, and therefore the Department can enforce them by injunction, if it so chooses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We are thus persuaded that administrative proceedings under Code \u00a7\u00a7 500.6 and 500.7 can address and resolve appellants\u2019 complaints as to the disputed Zoning Regulations and Board orders. Furthermore, there is nothing to rebut the presumption that these administrative remedies are primary and that they must be exhausted before appellants pursue their requested relief by <em>mandamus </em>or declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>III. Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that administrative remedies were (or are) unavailable to appellants, appellants\u2019 requests for declaratory relief are plagued by various deficiencies, which we shall briefly catalogue before concluding our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">First, the trial court was correct in holding that appellants\u2019 request for a declaratory interpretation of the ADA would not \u201cterminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding\u201d as required by CJ \u00a7 3-409(a). As noted, above, appellees never disputed that issue, and the only question this case presents is what must be done to remedy the current situation with respect to the Board\u2019s orders and County zoning regulations. Moreover, our foregoing discussion should make it clear that \u201cenforcement\u201d is a complex idea, which renders appellants\u2019 requests that the court declare various laws and regulations \u201cenforceable\u201d so vague that such declarations would be of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Second, appellants present no argument as to the trial court\u2019s ruling that to order Oregon to remove the paving it installed at the County\u2019s request would be \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d under CJ \u00a7 3-412(a).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Third, and relatedly, we are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 argument that their request for \u201cfurther relief\u2019 in the pleadings can be construed as requesting an injunction ordering the County to remove the paving. Appellants argue that by the explicit terms of CJ \u00a7 3-402, the Declaratory Judgment Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to be liberally construed, but construction of <em>pleadings </em>are governed by the Maryland Rules. And while Rule 2-303(e) provides that \u201cpleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d the intended justice adheres to both sides of a dispute, not only to the pleader. Appellants argue that because they alleged and proved that the county was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the paving, that imbues their pleadings with the necessary substance to warrant an injunction against the county. We disagree. Pleading plays four distinct roles in our system of jurisprudence: it (1) provides notice to the parties as to the nature of the claim or defense; (2) states the facts upon which the claim or defense allegedly exists; (3) defines the boundaries of litigation; and (4) provides for the speedy resolution of frivolous claims and defenses. <em>Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 690 A.2d 1000 (1997). Of these four, notice is paramount. <em>Id. </em>To order the County to remove the paving goes beyond mere \u201cenforcement\u201d and raises a host of legal and factual issues independent of appellants\u2019 other claims and requests for relief. Appellants\u2019 pleadings give no notice of this issue, nor does the record\u2014at trial and on appeal\u2014indicate by what authority the County could take such an action. Appellants simply cannot receive that which they did not fairly request.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Fourth, appellants present no specific argument that there was fault in the court\u2019s factual finding that the outdoor seating area coverings were \u201clarge umbrellas,\u201d that the court misinterpreted BCZR \u00a7 1A03.4.B.3, or that appellants were not in privity with the lease and so lacked standing to obtain any declarations regarding it. <em>See </em>C J \u00a7 3-406.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Whatever rights appellants had to press the County into action with writs of <em>mandamus </em>are preempted by the availability of administrative remedies, as are their rights to declaratory relief, if there be any that survive in spite of the defenses listed in the third part of our discussion. For these reasons, we shall not disturb the judgments of the trial court in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

Whether the Circuit Court erred in entering judgment for Appel-lees on Count IV on the ground that coercive or injunctive relief is not available under the Maryland Declaratory Judgment Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">This presentation would unnecessarily limit the grounds upon which we may affirm the court\u2019s judgment, and so we have edited them to remove that specificity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">.

We need not address this argument, however, because no one disputes the trial court's finding\u2014in appellants\u2019 favor\u2014that the ADA does <em>not </em>require Oregon's entire parking lot to be paved. Appellants\u2019 present complaint has not to do with the Parks Department's misunderstanding of the ADA, but whether the County must now enforce <em>other </em>laws and regulations to remedy the results of that mistake. As such, the trial court rightly held that any relief premised on the County\u2019s misinterpretation is nugatory and thus improper. <em>See </em>C.T \u00a7 3-409(a) (a court may grant declaratory relief only if, <em>inter alia, </em>it will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding). <em>See also Parish v.

Klemm v. Baskin, </em>111 Fla. 667, 668-669, 150 So. 517 (1933) (citing <em>Galena v. Amy, </em>72 U.S. 705, 5 Wall. 705, 18 L.Ed. 560 (1867)); <em>see also Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 96, 862 A.2d 941 (2004) (where there is no administrative recourse, case law does not restrict a contract plaintiff to <em>mandamus </em>or injunction). Here, appellants have no privity to the contract, nor is there a statute directing the County to enforce its contractual rights for their benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. Additionally, \u00a7 32-3-602 of the Enforcement Subtitle in the Code\u2019s Planning, Zoning, and Subdivision Control Article sets civil penalties and states that representatives of the Department of Permits and Development Management <em>\"shall </em>enforce the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, policies, rules, or regulations interpreting the zoning regulations\u201d (emphasis added). The Article sets forth additional permissive enforcement options, including the option to pursue injunctive relief in court, <em>see </em>\u00a7 32-3-607, but what matters for our purposes is that there is <em>at least one </em>mandatory enforcement method.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">. The trial court held that the Comity had discretion to determine whelher zoning violations exist, but also found as fact that the parking lot is impermeable and contains more than ninety-four parking spaces, both of which are plain violations of the Board\u2019s orders. However, we need not reconcile those rulings because we hold that judicial relief is barred entirely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. It appears that the trial court mistook the County\u2019s proffered administrative remedies to be \"concurrent common-law, equitable, or extraordinary legal\u201d remedies that are not a bar to recovery, <em>per </em>CJ \u00a7 3-409(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. It is not clear how we should consider the County\u2019s representations, as they do not appear to be official interpretations of law but rather the advice and opinion of counsel during adversarial litigation. We further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>note that the County\u2019s position in this case appears to contradict the grounds upon which the Board denied Oregon\u2019s petitions in 2004. Nevertheless, we consider their representations both factually and legally persuasive in this case, given that the County could be held to them by threat of contempt or, possibly, estoppel. <em>See County Comm\u2019rs v. Forty West Builders, Inc., </em>178 Md.App. 328, 395, 941 A.2d 1181 (2008) (trial court properly found county in contempt); <em>Berwyn Heights v. Rogers, </em>228 Md. 271, 279, 179 A.2d 712 (1962) (\"[T]he majority rule is to the effect that the doctrine of estoppel in pais is applied to municipal, as well as to private, coiporations and individuals, at least where the acts of its officers are within the scope of their authority and justice and right require that the public be estopped.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">.

We note that appellants <em>themselves </em>argue that Code \u00a7 3-2-1103 compels Permits and Development to administer and enforce \"[a]ll laws, maps, and regulations related to zoning,\u201d and that a Board order should be considered \u201ca law related to zoning.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. According to appellants, the trial court correctly held that the County Zoning Regulations did not afford adequate relief, arguing that they seek an injunction rather than monetary or other penalties.

Moreover, appellants have no absolute right to injunctive relief\u2014only the right to have the County choose some enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We further note that appellants' argument addresses only the Department of Permits and Development Management and thus overlooks additional administrative enforcement mechanisms, such as civil enforcement by the County Attorney under Code \u00a7 32-3-604(c), as well as criminal misdemeanor enforcement under \u00a7 32-3-606.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\">.
