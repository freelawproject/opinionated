We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for his trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury regarding unanimity?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel without holding an evidentiary hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">\u00b65 The State of Montana (State) charged Hanson by information with one count of felony sexual assault and one count of felony deviate sexual conduct. After a four-day trial in March of 1995, the jury found Hanson guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">\u00b66 Hanson subsequently moved for a new trial based on the court\u2019s alleged error in admitting, and his attorney\u2019s failure to object to, the testimony of the victim, the victim\u2019s therapist and Detective Lamb. The court denied the motion, Hanson appealed and we affirmed. <em>See State v. Hanson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 316, 940 P.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">\u00b67 On June 30, 1998, Hanson petitioned the District Court for postconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Hanson later amended his petition to assert that, in light of <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713, his jury trial was fundamentally unfair because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it had to reach a unanimous verdict as to at least one specific underlying act of sexual assault or deviate sexual conduct for each count charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">\u00b68 The District Court denied Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and Hanson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b69 We review the denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 235, 239, 948 P.2d 215, 218 (citation omitted). Discretionary rulings in postconviction relief proceedings, including rulings relating to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Sullivan, 285 Mont. at 239, 948 P.2d at 218 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b610 1. Did the District Court err in denying Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for his trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury regarding unanimity?</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b611 Prior to deliberations at the end of Hanson\u2019s trial, the district court instructed the jury, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he law requires the jury verdict in this case to be unanimous. Thus, all twelve of you must agree in order to reach a verdict whether the verdict be guilty or not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b6 12 After his direct appeal, Hanson petitioned for postconviction relief arguing that, under <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713, his fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial was violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that a unanimous verdict was necessary regarding at least one specific underlying act of sexual assault and deviate sexual conduct to support a conviction on each charge. The District Court concluded that Hanson was procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, from raising this issue in his petition for postconviction relief because the issue could have been raised on appeal as it was \u2014 under the plain error doctrine \u2014 in <em>Weaver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b613 Hanson does not directly challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion and could not do so successfully. The cases on which the successful appellant relied in <em>Weaver </em>had been decided prior to Hanson\u2019s direct appeal in 1996. <em>See Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-35, 37 (citing <em>United States v. Holley </em>(5th Cir. 1991), 942 F.2d 916; <em>United States v. Echeverry </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 719 F.2d <em>974; People v. Gordon </em>(1985), 165 Cal. App. 3d 839, 212 Cal. Rptr. <em>174; State v. Weldy </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 68, 902 P.2d 1). In addition, the common law plain error doctrine, pursuant to which we may review claimed errors implicating a defendant\u2019s fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>constitutional rights even absent a contemporaneous objection, clearly has been available since <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208, and, indeed, Hanson relied on <em>Finley </em>in attempting to raise issues for the first time in his direct appeal. <em>See Hanson, </em>283 Mont. at 321-22, 940 P.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b6 14 We consistently apply the statutory bar \u201cin order to prevent the abuse of postconviction relief by criminal defendants who would substitute those proceedings for direct appeal and in order to preserve the integrity of the trial and direct appeal.\u201d <em>In re Petition of Manula </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 166, 169, 866 P.2d 1127, 1129. Because Hanson reasonably could have raised this instructional issue on direct appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, he is barred from raising it via petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b615 Despite the statutory procedural bar, Hanson urges he is entitled to the retroactive application of <em>Weaver </em>in this proceeding to collaterally attack his conviction. We decline to address his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AEC\">\u00b616  As was the case in <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 11, [294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 11], 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 11, Hanson waived his right to raise the instructional error on appeal by failing to preserve it at trial. Unlike <em>Harris, </em>he did not attempt to raise it on direct appeal via the common law plain error doctrine. <em>See Harris, </em>\u00b6 11. As a result, and as we concluded above, Hanson is statutorily barred from raising the issue in his petition for postconviction relief and we must continue to apply the statutory bar consistently in order to prevent the abuse of postconviction proceedings by criminal defendants. <em>See Petition of Manula, </em>263 Mont. at 169, 866 P.2d at 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b617 We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Hanson\u2019s Weaoer-based claim for postconviction relief was procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. On that basis, we further hold that the District Court did not err in denying Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for his trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury regarding unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b618 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel without holding an evidentiary hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">f 19 Hanson\u2019s second claim for postconviction relief was ineffective assistance of counsel. He alleged that his trial counsel failed to call character witnesses who were present and waiting to testify at his trial, to play taped conversations in their entirety at trial, and to adequately prepare him for \u2014 and advocate for him at \u2014 the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>hearing. The District Court denied this portion of Hanson\u2019s petition on several bases, including Hanson\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, which requires a postconviction petition to \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b620 Hanson contends the District Court erred. He asserts that because his petition was verified as required by \u00a7 46-21-103, MCA, it was not necessary that he attach evidence establishing the existence of the facts identified in his petition as supporting his entitlement to relief. Hanson\u2019s argument ignores the separate and distinct requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-103 and 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b621 Section 46-21-103, MCA, addresses the commencement of a postconviction proceeding and requires that a petition for postconviction relief be verified. A \u201cpetition\u201d is \u201ca recital of facts which give rise to a cause of action.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1146 (6th ed. 1990). When a statute requires a verified petition, the petitioner must \u201cconfirm or substantiate [it] by oath or affidavit.\u201d <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1561 (6th ed. 1990). The purpose of verification is to assure good faith in a party\u2019s averments or statements. <em>See United States ex rel. Echevarria v. Silberglitt </em>(2d Cir. 1971), 441 F.2d 225, 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b622 Section 46-21-104, MCA, on the other hand, sets forth what the postconviction petition must contain. Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, expressly requires that evidence \u2014 such as affidavits or records \u2014 establishing the existence of the facts on which the petition is based be attached to the petition. Allegations in a petition, even verified allegations as required for all petitions, are not evidence. Moreover, unsupported allegations are not sufficient to entitle a postconviction petitioner to an evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA. <em>See Sullivan, </em>285 Mont. at 240, 948 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b623 Here, Hanson\u2019s verified petition satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-103, MCA, for commencing a proceeding for postconviction relief. However, the petition does not satisfy the separate requirement contained in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, that evidence establishing the facts alleged to provide a basis for relief be attached to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"Adq\">\u00b624  We conclude that Hanson\u2019s unsupported petition did not comply with \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, and as a result, the petition was not sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
