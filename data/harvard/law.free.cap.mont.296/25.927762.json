Cusenbary brought this action against Glen Mortensen doing business as the Town Tavern for serving Wells alcohol immediately prior to the incident. On March 30,1998, a jury returned a verdict against Mortensen in the amount of $750,000 and this appeal followed. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u00b62 The issues presented on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Mortensen\u2019s proposed jury instruction regarding his defense of intervening, superseding cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it excluded evidence of crimir nal proceedings against James Wells which arose from this incident? I</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it allowed evidence and testimony regarding James Wells\u2019 blood alcohol content and evidence regarding the amount of alcohol James Wells consumed prior to arriving at the Town Tavern?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court properly dismiss Mortensen\u2019s third party complaint and refuse to permit the jury to apportion the alleged negligence of James Wells, Pamela Wells, and Georgina Wells?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u00b67 James Wells suffered a broken neck in an automobile accident in 1991. Although initially paralyzed, Wells recovered to the point of being able to walk without a limp. When Wells consumes alcohol, however, he loses control of his legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">\u00b68 On the evening of July 28, 1993, Wells was driven to the Town Tavern in Great Falls, Montana by his niece. Glen Mortensen owns the Town Tavern. Several members of Wells\u2019 family including Katherine Wells, Pamela Wells, and Georgina Wells assisted Wells from the vehicle into the Tavern. Witnesses also saw Wells\u2019 family members helping him to move from a chair at a table in the Tavern to his wheelchair, and assisting him to the restroom. After approximately two hours in the Tavern, Wells\u2019 family members pushed him out of the Tavern and placed him in the passenger side of a vehicle. Wells estimated that he had consumed \u201cabout eight\u201d beers while in the Tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">\u00b69 Tavern patron Korey McGaffey observed Wells\u2019 behavior while Wells was in the Tavern. To McGaffey, Wells was \u201cobviously drunk, in a bad mood.\u201d McGaffey observed Wells shout and yell and saw him \u201ctip over and hold his head in his hand and swerve and weave up and yell.\u201d He saw Wells \u201cpound a drink and slam it down,\u201d and noticed that Wells\u2019 speech was \u201cvery slurred.\u201d He also noticed that Wells would get \u201creal quiet and groggy down and explosively snap up and Ltart barking at people.\u201d To McGaffey, Wells was \u201cvery obviously\u201d intoxicated. McGaffey recalls being relieved when Wells finally left because other patrons were \u201ctrying to avoid\u201d Wells and because Wells had created a \u201cbad situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">\u00b610 Another patron, Jarrod Hall noticed Wells immediately after entering the bar because Wells was \u201cloud, obnoxious, and acting in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>toxicated.\u201d Hall recalls that Wells was arguing and talking loudly and was \u201cobviously intoxicated.\u201d He also noticed that Wells\u2019 speech was \u201cvery slurred\u201d and hard to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b611 While sitting in the car, Wells apparently moved into the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle, started the vehicle, and drove it through the south wall of the Tavern injuring Jonathan Cusenbary, another patron of the Tavern. Wells was arrested, charged, and pled guilty to several felonies. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Wells testified that he has no recollection of driving through the Tavern wall and believes he was \u201ctoo intoxicated to exercise good judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b612 Toxicologist Dr. Brian Finkle estimated that Wells\u2019 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of the accident was between .28 percent and .30 percent. Dr. Finkle identified slurred speech, staggered walk, talkativeness, and \u201cfighting\u201d behavior as subjective signs of intoxication that can be readily observed and which most people recognize as drunkenness. Dr. Finkle stated that as a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration increases, the subjective signs of intoxication such as slurred speech also increase. Dr. Finkle also stated that an estimated blood alcohol concentration of .28 percent to .30 percent is \u201cvery high\u201d such that it would \u201cmost certainly\u201d render a person visibly \u201cgrossly intoxicated.\u201d He testified that such persons have \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d with speech; their personality is distorted, and they may be on the verge of falling asleep or \u201cfighting and antagonistic.\u201d Dr. Finkle testified that \u201cwithout question\u201d Wells would have been showing obvious signs of intoxication at least one hour prior to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">\u00b613 Jonathan Cusenbary commenced the present action by filing a complaint against Glen Mortensen, d/b/a/ Town Tavern, for the injuries he received as a result of Wells\u2019 conduct. Cusenbary claims that Mortensen\u2019s employees \u201cnegligently served intoxicating liquors and alcoholic beverages to James Wells\u201d when Wells was already visibly intoxicated. Cusenbary alleges that Mortensen violated \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, the dram shop act, when he furnished alcoholic beverages to a person who is \u201cvisibly intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b614 Mortensen asserted as an affirmative defense that Wells\u2019 conduct of driving the vehicle through the Tavern wall was an intervening, superseding cause which was not reasonably foreseeable to Mortensen and thus severed the chain of causation. The District Court excluded all evidence that Wells\u2019 actions were intentional, that he had been convicted of several felonies for his actions, and that he was sentenced to serve 20 years in the Montana State Prison. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>District Court dismissed Mortensen\u2019s affirmative defense and ruled Wells\u2019 conduct did not constitute an intervening, superseding cause and was foreseeable as a matter of law. The District Court also denied all of Mortensen\u2019s instructions that related to this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b6 15 By third party complaint, Mortensen sued James Wells, Pamela Wells, and Georgina Wells. Cusenbary released these third party defendants and the District Court dismissed Mortensen\u2019s complaint against them. The District Court limited Mortensen\u2019s defense to the sole issue of whether Wells was visibly intoxicated and refused to allow the jury to apportion any percentage of negligence to the third party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">ISSUE I</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Mortensen\u2019s proposed jury instruction regarding his defense of intervening, superseding cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b617 On appeal Mortensen claims that Cusenbary\u2019s damages proximately resulted from an intervening, superseding, new and independent cause which was not reasonably foreseeable to Mortensen and thus severed the chain of causation from his original negligent acts. He maintains that the District Court erred when it dismissed his jury instruction regarding this affirmative defense and concluded that Wells\u2019 conduct was foreseeable. He maintains that the District Court should have left the issue of foreseeability for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"ALx\">\u00b618  A district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Busta v. Columbus Hosp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 359, 916 P.2d 122, 131; <em>Lacock v. 4-B\u2019s Restaurants </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 17, 20, 919 P.2d 373, 375. When reviewing an instruction to determine whether it was properly refused, the appellate court considers the instructions in their entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and the evidence at trial. <em>See Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 359, 916 P.2d at 131<em>; Lacock, </em>277 Mont. at 20-21, 919 P.2d at 375. Itis not reversible error to refuse an offered instruction unless the refusal affects the substantial rights of the party proposing the instruction. <em>See Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 360, 916 P.2d at <em>132; Lacock, </em>277 Mont. at 21, 919 P.2d at 375. A party is not prejudiced by a refusal of his or her proposed instructions when the subject matter of the instruction is not supported by the evidence introduced at trial. <em>See Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 360, 916 P.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00b619  The issue of causation requires a determination, ordinarily by the fact finder, that a defendant\u2019s conduct helped produce the injury and that the injury would not have occurred without it. As we explained in <em>Estate of Strever v. Cline </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 165, 175, 924 P.2d 666, 672, however, in cases involving alleged intervening causes, foreseeability is properly considered with respect to causation. According to the facts presented here, we conclude as we did in <em>Strever, </em>that failure of proof of causation can be determined as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">\u00b620 Accordingly, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to see whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04); <em>see also Kreger v. Francis </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 444, 447, 898 P.2d 672, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b621  In order for Cusenbary to prevail against Mortensen on a claim for negligence, he must establish the following: (1) the existence of a legal duty from Mortensen to Cusenbary; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages to Cusenbary. <em>See White v. Murdock </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 386, 389, 877 P.2d 474, 476. If a plaintiff is unable to establish any one element, the <em>negligence </em>claim fails. <em>See White, </em>265 Mont. at 389-90, 877 P.2d at 476; <em>Dvorak v. Matador Serv., Inc. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 98, 107, 727 P.2d 1306, 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b622  The dram shop act codified at \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, provides that a tavern owner is liable for foreseeable injury-producing accidents of a patron if the tavern owner provided alcohol to a \u201cvisibly intoxicated\u201d patron. Section 27-1-710 (3)(b), MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">(3) Furnishing a person with an alcoholic beverage is not a cause of, or grounds for finding the furnishing person or entity liable for, injury or damage wholly or partly arising from an event involving the person who consumed the beverage unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">(b) the consumer was visibly intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Mortensen has maintained that it was not foreseeable to him or his employees at the Town Tavern that a wheelchair-bound patron, apparently disabled in such a manner and to such an extent that he was to all appearances incapable of operating his wheelchair himself, and assisted by family members, would somehow get into the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle and drive the vehicle through the wall of the Tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00b623 The District Court concluded that the conduct of Wells did not constitute an intervening, superseding cause and was foreseeable to Mortensen as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b624 Cusenbary maintains that the District Court did not err because when an intervening cause is reasonably foreseeable it does not absolve the defendant of liability. <em>See USF&amp;G v. Camp </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 64, 70, 831 P.2d 586, 589. Cusenbary notes the following facts to establish that the intervening cause \u2014 Wells driving a vehicle through the wall of the Tavern \u2014 was foreseeable: Wells was already intoxicated when he arrived at the Town Tavern; other patrons saw numerous signs of Wells\u2019 drunken behavior and observed that his intoxication was obvious; and the Town Tavern continued to serve alcohol to Wells for a period of approximately two hours by which time Wells was \u201cgrossly intoxicated.\u201d Cusenbary supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that if one furnishes alcoholic beverages to such a person, it is reasonably foreseeable that the person will thereafter engage in drunken behavior that may endanger others.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b625 In order for Mortensen\u2019s conduct of serving alcohol to Wells to be considered a cause of Cusenbary\u2019s injuries, it must be a cause in fact, or actual cause of the injury. In this case, actual causation is not at issue. Rather, this case involves the allegation that the chain of causation was severed by an independent intervening act. However, not all intervening acts are independent. Those that are foreseeable do not break the chain of causation. In other words, if one of the reasons that makes a defendant\u2019s act negligent is a greater risk of a particular harmful result occurring, and that harmful result does occur, the defendant is generally liable. The test is based on foreseeability. <em>See </em>Camp, 253 Mont. at 69-70, 831 P.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b626  Mortensen claims, that unlike a direct cause case in which the facts present an uninterrupted chain of events from the time of the negligent act to the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, this case is one involving an independent, intervening cause. An intervening cause case is one in which the facts indicate that a force came into motion after the time of the defendant\u2019s negligent act and combined with the negligent act to cause the injury to the plaintiff. Whether an intervening force will cut off a defendant\u2019s liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injury is, once again, determined by foreseeability. <em>See Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 175-76, 924 P.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b627 Mortensen\u2019s theory is that in this case there was an intervening force that produced an unforeseeable result that supersedes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>serves to break the causal connection between Mortensen\u2019s initial act of serving Wells alcohol, and Cusenbary\u2019s injury. He maintains that the intervening force was Wells\u2019 act of getting into the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle and driving it through the Tavern wall. Mortensen maintains that this act itself becomes a direct, immediate cause of Cusenbary\u2019s injury and, thus, relieves Mortensen of liability for the consequences of his negligent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b628 In <em>Busta </em>we held that in direct cause cases \u2014 those in which no independent intervening forces are present, proof of causation is satisfied by proof that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the cause in fact or actual cause of the damage alleged, and no consideration of the concept of foreseeability is required on the issue of causation. <em>See Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 373, 916 P.2d at 140. Otherwise, in all cases involving independent, intervening forces, we consider the question of foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b629 We have previously examined situations in which an alleged independent, intervening act potentially supersedes the original negligent act to relieve the defendant of liability, and we find this case to be dissimilar. In <em>Strever, </em>several youths including Strever and Cline, stole a gun from an unlocked vehicle. Some time thereafter, while Cline was attempting to remove the ammunition clip from the gun, the gun discharged, killing Strever. We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the vehicle owner on the basis that the vehicle owner\u2019s negligence was superseded by the independent, intervening criminal and grossly negligent acts of Cline and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b630  In this case, unlike the act of leaving a vehicle unlocked, the act of Mortensen in serving alcohol to Wells is the very act which caused the conduct that resulted in the injury to Cusenbary. The consequences of serving alcohol to a person who is visibly intoxicated are reasonably foreseeable precisely because of the causal relationship between serving alcohol and drunken conduct. Wells\u2019 drunken conduct was not freakish, bizarre, or unpredictable as Mortensen asserts. Rather, drunken conduct is the expected, predictable, and therefore reasonably foreseeable outcome of serving alcohol to a person who is already intoxicated. As Justice Andrews explained in his dissent in the oft-cited decision of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad </em>(1928), 162 N.E. 99, 104 (Andrews, J. dissenting):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The court must ask itself whether there was a natural and continuous sequence between cause and effect. Was the one a substantial factor in producing the other? Was there a direct connection between them, without too many intervening causes? Is the effect of cause on result not too attenuated? Is the cause likely, in the usual judgment of mankind, to produce the result? Or, by the exercise of prudent foresight, could the result be foreseen?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Cited in <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 361, 916 P.2d at 133. The situation presented in this case meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b631 The facts of the present case and the facts in <em>Strever </em>both involve intervening causes. However, the intervening cause in <em>Strever </em>(criminal and grossly negligent acts by several juveniles) was not the foreseeable result of the original negligence complained of (leaving a vehicle unlocked). On the other hand, the intervening cause in the present case (Wells\u2019 drunken driving) is the reasonably foreseeable result of the original negligence complained of (Mortensen\u2019s serving of alcohol to Wells who was already intoxicated). In <em>Strever, </em>the affirmative defense of intervening, superseding cause applied. In this case it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b632 Other cases involving intervening causes such as <em>Camp </em>and <em>King v. State of Montana </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 393, 856 P.2d 954, are distinguishable from this case on the same basis as <em>Strever. </em>In <em>Camp, </em>a prison escapee accidentally started a fire when he fell asleep and dropped a lit cigarette on a couch. USF&amp;G sued the Phillips County Sheriff alleging negligence in allowing the escape. Similarly, in <em>King, </em>a mental patient murdered the plaintiff\u2019s son after escaping from the Montana State Hospital. Plaintiff sued the State alleging negligence in allowing the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b633 These cases are distinguishable because in <em>Camp, </em>the conduct which resulted in the injury (dropping a lit cigarette) was not the forseeable result of the negligent conduct complained of (negligence that allowed escape). Similarly, in <em>King, </em>the offending conduct (murder), was not the forseeable result of the negligence complained of (release of a mental patient). In contrast, as we held in <em>Nerhing v. LaCounte </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 462, 712 P.2d 1329, it is foreseeable that serving alcohol to one who is already intoxicated causes drunken conduct that may endanger others.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b634 Because this case involves foreseeability with respect to a tavern owner and the application of the dram shop act, mention must be made of the application of foreseeability as it is specifically applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>liquor liability cases. Montana\u2019s earliest liquor liability case explained that dram shop liability evolved because it became widely known that an intoxicated patron may attempt to drive home from a bar or tavern and become involved in an accident. <em>See Deeds v. U.S. </em>(D. Mont. 1969), 306 F.Supp. 348. In <em>Deeds </em>the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">The increasing frequency of serious accidents caused by drivers who are intoxicated is a fact which must be well known to those who sell and dispense liquor. This lends support to those cases which have found the automobile accident to be \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable\u201d result of furnishing liquor to the intoxicated driver, at least where the person furnishing the liquor knew that the intoxicated person would be driving on a public highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Deeds, </em>306 F.Supp at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b635 In <em>Jevning v. Skyline Bar </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 422, 726 P.2d 326, we described what type of conduct is foreseeable to bar owners serving alcohol:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201c[Consumption of the alcoholic beverages served, subsequent driving, and <em>the likelihood of an injury-producing accident are foreseeable intervening acts which do not relieve the tavern owner of liability for negligence.\u201dNehring, </em>219 Mont. At 456, 712 P.2d at 1335, 43 St.Rep. at 99. <em>In Bissett v. DMI, Inc., </em>we held that a tavern owner who serves an intoxicated minor could be held liable for injuries sustained by that minor in a motor vehicle accident, and that the minor\u2019s acts in drinking alcoholic beverages served to her <em>and then becoming involved in an injury-producing accident were reasonably foreseeable events that would no longer protect a defendant from liability for negligence. Bissett v. DMI, Inc., </em>(1986) 220 Mont. 153, 156-57, 717 P.2d 545, 547-48, 43 St.Rep. at 255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\"><em>Jevning, </em>223 Mont. at 424, 726 P.2d at 327 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b636 In <em>Nehring, </em>we also discussed foreseeability as it relates to tavern owners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">Both <em>Deeds, </em>306 F.Supp. 348, and <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(D.Mont.1980), 496 F.Supp. 597, considered Montana law on negligence and held the seller of alcoholic beverages liable to third parties injured by an intoxicated patron. After establishing the seller\u2019s duty to the injured party, <em>Deeds </em>discussed the element of causation and held that the operators who served alcoholic beverages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">... could reasonably foresee or anticipate some accident or injury as a reasonable and natural consequence of their illegal and negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>gent acts, particularly in view of the ever increasing incidence of serious automobile accidents resulting from drunken driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">\n<em>We adopt this approach in the case at bar and hold that consumption of the alcoholic beverages served, subsequent driving, and the likelihood of an injury-producing accident are foreseeable intervening acts which do not relieve the tavern operator of liability for negligence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Nehring, </em>219 Mont. at 469-70, 712 P.2d at 1334-35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">\u00b637  When one consumes alcohol in Montana, subsequent driving resulting in an injury-producing accident is an intervening act, but it is an intervening act we have determined to be reasonably foreseeable as a matter of law. We recognize that in this case the driver of the vehicle appeared to the tavern owner to be physically incapable to drive a vehicle and, thus, regardless of the amount of alcohol served, unable to cause an injury-producing accident. In fact, as Mortensen claims, Wells appeared to have been wheelchair-bound and under the complete care and supervision of his family. It is because of this that Mortensen argues that Wells\u2019 conduct functions to sever the otherwise foreseeable causal chain of events in a typical liquor liability case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b638  Pursuant to the dram shop act, \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, a tavern owner is prohibited from furnishing alcoholic beverages to a person who is \u201cvisibly intoxicated.\u201d Nowhere in the statute exists a requirement that the tavern owner assess the medical condition of the patron in conjunction with the patron\u2019s level of intoxication. The tavern owner is simply responsible for assessing visible intoxication regardless of the physical ability and condition of the patron. Medical conditions vary from person to person and exhibit themselves in ways that individuals without medical training may not recognize or correctly interpret. This is obviously one such case. The bartenders at the Town Tavern were convinced that Wells was a quadriplegic when, in fact, his medical condition was far from that. Wells was able-bodied enough to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and drive. It is because of situations such as this that the only subjective symptoms that \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, requires a tavern owner to interpret are those which indicate visible intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b639  As we stated <em>in Kiger v. State </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 457, 462, 802 P.2d 1248, 1251, when reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion, the question of foreseeability may be determined as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>law. Accordingly, we conclude that as a matter of law Wells\u2019 conduct of driving a vehicle while intoxicated, through the wall of the Town Tavern, was a foreseeable intervening cause that did not serve to supersede or break the causal chain between Mortensen\u2019s original negligence and the injury to Cusenbary. The District Court correctly interpreted the law and did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mortensen\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b640 Did the District Court err when it excluded evidence of criminal proceedings against James Wells which arose from this incident?</p>\n<p id=\"A1f\">\u00b641 Wells pled guilty to several felony charges as a result of this incident and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mortensen requested that the District Court take judicial notice of Wells\u2019judgment of conviction and sentencing order. Mortensen also requested a limiting instruction that the conviction be admissible \u201conly for the purpose of instructing the jury of the crimes of which Wells was sentenced and the necessary elements of each crime.\u201d The District Court denied Mortensen\u2019s requests and disallowed evidence of Wells\u2019 criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b642 On appeal, Mortensen claims that Wells\u2019judgment of conviction was relevant to his principal defense that it was not foreseeable to Town Tavern personnel that a wheelchair-bound patron would somehow drive a vehicle through the wall of the building. Mortensen claims that Wells\u2019 act was intentional and, therefore, criminal. He argues that in <em>Strever </em>we held that one normally has less reason to anticipate acts on the part of others which are \u201cmalicious and intentionally damaging\u201d and especially when \u201csuch acts are criminal.\u201d <em>Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 176-77, 924 P.2d at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b643 However, we noted in <em>Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 176, 924 P.2d at 673, that this rule applies \u201cin the absence of any reason to expect the contrary.\u201d As discussed earlier, in <em>Strever </em>we concluded that the owner of an unlocked truck had no reason to anticipate the criminal and grossly negligent conduct of the youths who stole a gun from the truck. Here, Mortensen is the very person who served the alcohol that resulted in Wells\u2019 drunken conduct. Thus, Mortensen had every reason to \u201cexpect the contrary\u201d that Wells would engage in drunken conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b644 Mortensen concedes that the dram shop act and Montana case law have established that it is foreseeable as a matter of law that an intoxicated tavern patron may drive a vehicle while intoxicated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>that an injury-producing accident may result. However, he maintains that when this conduct is criminal and intentional, it supersedes the tavern owner\u2019s original liability. The question, however, is not whether Wells\u2019 conduct was criminal and intentional, but whether it was forseeable. As we discussed in <em>Strever, </em>some criminal conduct may be reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b645 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion because evidence of Wells\u2019 criminal convictions in relation to this matter are inadmissible for the same reasons that Mortensen\u2019s affirmative defense of intervening, superseding cause is inadmissible. It was reasonably foreseeable as a matter of law that Wells would engage in this type of drunken conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b646 Did the District Court err when it allowed evidence and testimony regarding James Wells\u2019 blood alcohol content and evidence regarding the amount of alcohol James Wells consumed prior to arriving at the Town Tavern?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b647 We have held that a district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is admissible, and its evidentiary rulings should not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bueling v. </em>Swift, 1998 MT 112, \u00b6 24, [288 Mont. 472, \u00b6 24], 958 P.2d 694, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">\u00b648 At trial, Mortensen contended that the test results of Wells\u2019 blood alcohol content taken by the hospital shortly after the incident were not admissible because the standard for civil liability pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, is \u201cvisible intoxication,\u201d rather than \u201clegal intoxication.\u201d The District Court granted Mortensen\u2019s motion in limine and refused evidence of the BAC test results. The District Court later held, however, that if Cusenbary\u2019s expert on the issue of blood alcohol content, toxicologist Dr. Brian Finkle, could be qualified to give an opinion of blood alcohol content from a hypothetical situation, rather than from the hospital\u2019s BAC test results, then the court would allow the opinion. Based upon the District Court\u2019s ruling, Cusenbary did not introduce any evidence of the BAC test results from the hospital. Instead, Cusenbary\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Finkle a hypothetical based upon the testimony of Wells in which he had to estimate Wells\u2019 BAC content on the evening in question based upon Wells\u2019 own testimony of the number of drinks he consumed that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b649 Mortensen asserts that Dr. Finkle\u2019s estimate of blood alcohol content should be excluded \u201cbecause eye witness testimony is the only kind of evidence that is relevant to the issue of how Wells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>appeared.\u201d However, Dr. Finkle expressly testified that there is a direct correlation between the level of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood and observable signs of intoxication. Dr. Finkle explained that the subjective, observable signs of intoxication include slurred speech, staggered walk, talkativeness, and fighting behavior. He explained that the more a person drinks the more severe and obvious the symptoms of intoxication become because there is a proportional relationship to the rising blood alcohol concentration and the severity of the symptoms of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"ANK\">\u00b650 It is apparent that the District Court agreed with Mortensen\u2019s contention that the BAC test results were not probative of the issue of visible intoxication at the time that Wells was served alcohol. However, based upon a hypothetical set of facts taken directly from the testimony of Wells and relating to the amount of alcohol consumed, the rate of consumption, and other variables, Dr. Finkle was able to estimate a range of Wells\u2019 probable blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident. Thus, Dr. Finkle\u2019s testimony is not based upon BAC test results taken after the accident. Rather, he provided expert opinion testimony concerning his estimate of Wells\u2019 blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident. As explained by Dr. Finkle, blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident is directly related to the visible signs of intoxication that a person may exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao4\">\u00b651 Accordingly, based upon Dr. Finkle\u2019s estimate of blood alcohol concentration, it was probable that Wells was displaying observable signs of intoxication while served alcohol by Mortensen. Therefore, we conclude that Dr. Finkle\u2019s opinion was relevant pursuant to Rule 401, M.R.Evid., and the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b652 Did the District Court properly dismiss Mortensen\u2019s third party complaint and refuse to permit the jury to apportion the alleged negligence of James Wells, Pamela Wells, and Georgina Wells?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b653 Approximately nine months after Cusenbary filed his complaint, Mortensen filed a third party complaint against James Wells, Georgina Wells, Pamela Wells, Virginia Wells, Jane Does I-IV, and John Does I-IV. Having no insurance or other resources with which to defend the allegations in Mortensen\u2019s third party complaint, James, Georgina, and Pamela failed to appear. Virginia Wells could not be located in order to be served with the complaint. Mortensen took the default and now contends that by reason of their default James, Georgina, and Pamela admitted that Wells negligently caused inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ries to Cusenbary, and that they provided alcoholic beverages to Wells. Having determined that James, Georgina, and Pamela were judgment-proof, Cusenbary released each of them from liability for the nominal consideration of $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b654  With regard to Mortensen\u2019s claim that by default the third party defendants admitted Wells\u2019 negligence, it is well settled that an admission predicated upon a default is effective only against the particular party who makes the default, and does not bind any other party to the litigation. <em>See </em>46 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Judgments </em>\u00a7 321. The admissions obtained by default against James, Georgina, and Pamela were admissible only on the issue of their negligence and not that of Mortensen.</p>\n<p id=\"AAV\">\u00b655 Mortensen maintains that the release Cusenbary gave to the third party defendants was not in good faith pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Deere &amp; Co. v. District Court </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 384, 730 P.2d 396, because Pamela and Georgina were not indigent as Cusenbary claims they were. Our review of the deposition and testimony of the third party defendants, however, reveals otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b656 James Wells has no income or property and is serving time in prison. Georgina Wells has a monthly income of $700 but no property, no bank account, and no cash or other assets. Pamela Wells has a stereo, television, a monthly income of $1219, and a 1980 pickup truck, but has no real property, no bank account, no home, and no cash. Based on this information we conclude that although these third party defendants have some nominal assets, they can be reasonably considered to be indigent and, therefore, the money paid and the release given in this case was in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b657 Mortensen further maintains that the jury was entitled to apportion fault to the settling third party joint tortfeasors even though those third parties were judgment-proof and released from liability by Cusenbary. This, however, is contrary to the law in Montana regarding apportionment of negligence among tortfeasors that controlled this case. In <em>Newville v. State Department of Family Services </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 237, 247-49, 883 P.2d 793, 799-800, we noted that the 1987 amendments to \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1981), were designed to apportion responsibility for a person\u2019s damages among all those who might have contributed as a cause of those damages in order that those defendants named by a plaintiff could avoid paying a judgment disproportionate to their respective degree of fault. We ultimately struck down the critical language in the 1987 amendments on due process grounds, concluding that the legislation lacked sufficient pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cedural safeguards to insure a fair apportionment of negligence to plaintiffs and unrepresented nonparties. <em>See Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 252, 883 P.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b658 In response to <em>Newville, </em>the 1995 Legislature again amended \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, reviving the nonparty defense which had been found unconstitutional, and inserting procedural requirements which had not been present in the 1987 version of the statute. In <em>Plumb v. Fourth Judicial District </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 363, 927 P.2d 1011, we addressed the 1995 amendments and noted that the legislation still lacked a mechanism for unnamed third parties to appear and defend themselves. We observed that pursuant to the statute it would be entirely possible that the negligence apportioned to an unrepresented party who had not appeared to defend himself or herself, would not bean accurate reflection of the true degree of that person\u2019s fault. <em>See Plumb, </em>279 Mont. at 377-78, 927 P.2d at 1019-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b659 Mortensen contends that <em>Plumb </em>does not control the facts of this case. Mortensen argues that he filed a third party action against the Wells who were thus put on notice with an opportunity to defend themselves and hire counsel. Even though the defendants did not appear and their default was taken, Mortensen argues that this is an entirely different situation than <em>Plumb </em>in which the party was unnamed either as a defendant or third party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b660 An examination of Mortensen\u2019s third party complaint discloses that he was seeking contribution and indemnity from the Wells defendants. Once Cusenbary settled with these defendants, Mortensen\u2019s third party claim for contribution was extinguished. <em>See Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 396-97, 730 P.2d at 404-05. At that point in time the same due process concerns we noted in <em>Newville </em>and <em>Plumb </em>appeared. There is no mechanism provided in \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1995), by which the negligence of nonparties, including third party defendants released from liability, can be fairly apportioned by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b661 Mortensen points out that in <em>Whiting v. State </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 207, 810 P.2d 1177, the state was allowed to apportion negligence against a defendant who had previously settled with the plaintiff. Our review of <em>Whiting, </em>however, discloses that the issue of apportionment was never raised by the plaintiff, at least on appeal. In <em>Whiting, </em>the state argued that it should not be responsible for all the damages when the jury found that it was only 58 percent negligent. In that case we held that \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1987), still retained joint and several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>liability as to defendants found more than 50 percent responsible for the plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b662  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly refused to permit the jury to apportion negligence to third party defendants who were released from liability by Cusenbary and who were impecunious and judgment-proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b663 We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b66-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"ANm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b664 I concur with the resolution of issue four and dissent from issues one, two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\u00b665 In issue one, the Court concludes that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mortensen\u2019s proposed jury instruction on intervening, superseding cause. In reaching that conclusion, the Court reasons that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">The consequences of serving alcohol to a person who is visibly intoxicated are reasonably foreseeable precisely because of the causal relationship between serving alcohol and drunken conduct. Wells\u2019 drunken conduct was not freakish, bizarre, or unpredictable as Mortensen asserts. Rather, drunken conduct is the expected, predictable, and therefore reasonably foreseeable outcome of serving alcohol to a person who is already intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">\u00b666 In concluding that all \u201cdrunken conduct\u201d is the reasonably foreseeable result of serving alcohol, the Court casts with too broad a net. Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, absolutely anything that Wells did after Mortensen served him would constitute \u201cdrunken conduct\u201d and thus be foreseeable. If he had traveled in his wheelchair down the street and robbed the local convenience store in order to obtain more alcohol, that too would be drunken conduct, but could Mortensen have reasonably foreseen this conduct? I doubt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">\u00b667 At best it can be argued that if one serves alcohol to an already intoxicated person, it is foreseeable that you will further impair that person\u2019s senses and coordination, thus increasing the likelihood that he/she will engage in negligent conduct that results in an accident. When, however, the intoxicated person engages in intentional, criminal conduct, the foreseeability is greatly attenuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">\u00b668 It may be that a jury would determine that Wells\u2019 intentional act of driving through the wall of the tavern was foreseeable. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ever, given that Wells was brought into the tavern in a wheelchair and that, later, two of his companions had to lift him back into the wheelchair to wheel him out of the tavern where he was then placed in the car by his niece, reasonable minds could certainly disagree as to whether it would be foreseeable that he would then drive a car through the tavern wall. In <em>Estate of Strever, </em>we \u201cemphasize[d] that a cause of action involving superseding intervening acts, whether criminal or non-criminal, normally involves questions of fact which are more properly left to the finder of fact for resolution.\u201d <em>Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 178, 924 P.2d at 673-74. Rather than establish a precedent that all drunken conduct is foreseeable as a matter of law, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s refusal of the jury instruction on intervening, superseding cause and submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b669 I also dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of issue two. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the criminal proceedings against James Wells. As a result of the incident at the Town Tavern, Wells was arrested and charged with four felony counts, including two counts of criminal endangerment, \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, which requires a showing that he knowingly engaged in specific conduct, and felony criminal mischief, \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA, which requires knowing and purposeful conduct. Wells pled guilty to all four counts thereby admitting that he had acted intentionally and purposefully when he drove through the tavern wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b670 Mortensen argues that Wells\u2019 convictions should have been admissible to prove that Wells\u2019 conduct was intentional, criminal and therefore not foreseeable since one normally has less reason to anticipate acts that are \u201c \u2018malicious and intentionally damaging,\u2019 \u201d especially when \u201c \u2018such acts are criminal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 176, 924 P.2d at 672 (citation omitted). The Court skirts this rule by noting that in <em>Estate of Strever </em>we stated that the rule applies \u201c \u2018in the absence of any reason to expect the contrary....\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 176-77, 924 P.2d at 673 (citation omitted). The Court reasons that Mortensen, as the server of the alcohol, had every reason to \u201cexpect the contrary,\u201d that Wells would engage in <em>drunken </em>conduct; that under the dram shop act, it is foreseeable as a matter of law that an intoxicated tavern patron may drive a vehicle while intoxicated and that an injury-producing accident may result. The Court states: \u201cThe question, however, is not whether Wells\u2019 conduct was criminal and intentional, but whether it was foreseeable.\u201d That begs the question. The intentional and criminal nature of Wells\u2019 conduct goes to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>question of whether Wells\u2019 conduct could reasonably be foreseen. As it did in resolving the first issue, the Court reasons that all drunken conduct of tavern patrons is reasonably foreseeable. Again, I disagree with that broad proposition. Furthermore, I do not see any basis for concluding that the dram shop act stands for that proposition. As the majority points out, under the dram shop act, a tavern owner must reasonably foresee that an intoxicated patron may drive a vehicle and that an injury producing \u201caccident\u201d may result. Whether Wells acted intentionally is relevant to the question of whether the incident was an accident. Mortensen should not have been precluded from introducing evidence that this was no \u201caccident\u201d and that it was the result of Wells\u2019 intentional, criminal conduct which Wells admitted to when he pled guilty to the felony criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b671 I would reverse the District Court and allow the introduction of the criminal convictions for the jury to consider in determining whether or not Wells\u2019 conduct was an intervening, superseding cause.</p>\n<p id=\"AkXc\">\u00b672 Finally, as to issue three, Mortensen contended that the test results of Wells\u2019 blood alcohol content taken by the hospital shortly after the incident were not admissible because the standard for civil liability pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-710, MCA, is \u201cvisible intoxication,\u201d rather than \u201clegal intoxication.\u201d The District Court agreed and granted his motion <em>in limine </em>excluding evidence of the BAC results. Having concluded that actual blood alcohol content was not admissible, the District Court resorted to legerdemain and allowed Cusenbary\u2019s expert to testify as to a <em>hypothetical </em>blood alcohol content and what that signified in terms of visible signs of intoxication. This ruling truly befuddles me. Either blood alcohol content is relevant or it is not. If it is, then actual, not hypothetical, blood alcohol content is more probative. I agree that blood alcohol content in any form was not relevant to the question of whether Wells was visibly intoxicated. That question should have been resolved with testimony from those who saw Wells in the tavern. The expert testimony as to Wells\u2019 hypothetical blood alcohol content should have been excluded. I would reverse the District Court on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b673 In conclusion, under issue four I concur that the District Court properly dismissed Mortensen\u2019s third party complaint. However, I would reverse and remand for a new trial on the remaining issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-6\">JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
