Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional and it is the duty of the Court to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation if possible. <em>State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99 (citations omitted). A party challenging the constitutionality of a statute \u201cbears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional. Any doubt is to be resolved in favor of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 148, 902 P.2d 14, 17 (citations omitted). A statute will be \u201cupheld on review except when proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Davis v. Union Pacific R. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 233, 239, 937 P.2d 27, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">\u00b612 In February, 1997 Montrust filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of fourteen statutes that concern Montana\u2019s school trust lands and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In May, 1997 Montrust filed an amended complaint. Following a hearing in May, 1997 the District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the State from issuing deeds for historic rights of way on school trust lands under House Bill 607 (codified as \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA) and from leasing or disposing of school trust lands under \u00a7 20-6-621, MCA. A hearing was held in October, 1997, and the District Court issued its Decision, Order and Permanent Injunction in April, 1998. Concluding that ten of the statutes challenged by Montrust violated Montana\u2019s Enabling Act and Constitution and that another statute was invalid as applied, the District Court permanently enjoined eleven statutes. In June, 1998 the District Court awarded Montrust costs of $312 but denied Montrust attorney fees. The State appeals the District Court\u2019s permanent injunction of three statutes. Montrust cross-appeals the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>District Court\u2019s ruling on three other statutes and the District Court\u2019s denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b613 Under the Act of February 22, 1889 (hereafter, the Enabling Act), ch. 180, 25 Stat. 676 (1889), the federal government granted Montana the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections of each township in Montana \u201cfor the support of common schools.\u201d Section 10 of the Enabling Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The federal government\u2019s grant of those lands to Montana constitutes a trust (hereafter, the trust). <em>See Rider v. Cooney </em>(1933), 94 Mont. 295, 306-07, 23 P.2d 261, 263 (citations omitted). The terms of the trust are set forth in Montana\u2019s Constitution and the Enabling Act. <em>See </em>Art. XVII, Sec. 1, Mont. Const. (1889) (providing federal grant of lands \u201cshall be held in trust for the people, to be disposed of as hereafter provided, <em>for the respective purposes for which they have been or may be granted\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Department of State Lands v. Pettibone </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 361, 366, 702 P.2d 948, 951 (concluding Montana\u2019s 1889 Constitution accepted the lands and \u201cprovided they would be held in trust consonant with the terms of the Enabling Act .... The 1972 Montana Constitution continued those terms\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b614 The State of Montana is a trustee of those lands (hereafter, the school trust lands). <em>See, e.g., Toomey v. State Board of Land Com\u2019rs </em>(1938), 106 Mont. 547, 559, 81 P.2d 407, 414; <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1913), 48 Mont. 347, 349, 137 P. 854, 855. Further, \u201cThe state board of land commissioners, as the instrumentality created to administer that trust, is bound, upon principles that are elementary, to so administer it as to secure the largest measure of legitimate advantage to the beneficiary of it.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>48 Mont. at 349-50, 137 P. at 855. The State Board of Land Commissioners (hereafter, the Board) \u201cowe[s] a higher duty to the public than does an ordinary businessman.\u201d <em>State v. Babcock </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 46, 54, 409 P.2d 808, 812. Finally, Montana\u2019s Constitutional provisions are \u201climitations on the power of disposal by the <em>legislature.\u201dRider, </em>94 Mont. at 307, 23 P.2d at 263. One limitation on the legislature\u2019s power of disposal is the trust\u2019s requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>full market value be obtained for trust lands. <em>See </em>Section 11 of the Enabling Act(as amendedbythe Act of May 7,1932, ch. 172, 47 Stat. 150 (1932)) (providing that \u201cnone of such lands ... shall ever be disposed of ... unless the full market value of the estate or interest disposed of, to be ascertained in such manner as may be provided by law, has been paid or safely secured to the State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b6 15 With the foregoing as background, we note the pertinent provisions of the Enabling Act and Montana\u2019s Constitution. The Enabling Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">That all lands granted by this Act shall be disposed of only at public sale after advertising \u2014 tillable lands capable of producing agricultural crops for not less than $10 per acre and lands principally valuable for grazing purposes for not less than $5 per acre....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">The said lands may be leased under such regulations as the legislature may prescribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">The State may also, upon such terms as it may prescribe, grant such easements or rights in any of the lands granted by this Act, as may be acquired in privately owned lands through proceedings in eminent domain: <em>Provided, however, </em>That none of such lands, nor any estate or interest therein, shall ever be disposed of except in pursuance of general laws providing for such disposition, nor unless the full market value of the estate or interest disposed of, to be ascertained in such manner as may be provided by law, has been paid or safely secured to the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Section 11 of the Enabling Act (as amendedbythe acts of May 7, 1932, ch. 172, 47 Stat. 150 (1932) and October 16, 1970, Pub. L. No. 463, 84 Stat. 987 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b616 Article X, Section 4 of Montana\u2019s Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amv\">Board of land commissioners. The governor, superintendent of public instruction, auditor, secretary of state, and attorney general constitute the board of land commissioners. It has the authority to direct, control, lease, exchange, and sell school lands and lands which have been or may be granted for the support and benefit of the various state educational institutions, under such regulations and restrictions as may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Art. X, Sec. 4, Mont. Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">\u00b617 Article X, Section 11 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">Public land trust, disposition. (1) All lands of the state that have been or may be granted by congress, or acquired by gift or grant or devise from any person or corporation, shall be public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>lands of the state. They shall be held in trust for the people, to be disposed of as hereafter provided, for the respective purposes for which they have been or may be granted, donated or devised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-3\">(2) No such land or any estate or interest therein shall ever be disposed of except in pursuance of general laws providing for such disposition, or until the full market value of the estate or interest disposed of, to be ascertained in such manner as may be provided by law, has been paid or safely secured to the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">(3) No land which the state holds by grant from the United States which prescribes the manner of disposal and minimum price shall be disposed of except in the manner and for at least the price prescribed without the consent of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Art. X, Sec. 11, Mont. Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b618 As a preliminary matter, we note that the parties disagree over the standard of review in the present case. The State urges that this Court should determine whether the legislation in question \u201cirrevocably\u201d conflicts with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties as a trustee \u201cin any conceivable instance\u201d and whether the Board may constitutionally apply the legislation. Montrust argues rather that there are two essential inquiries: whether the legislation comports with the Montana Constitution, and whether the legislation is preempted by the Enabling Act. Montrust also argues that this Court should employ an equal protection analysis. We conclude that neither party offers persuasive authority for its proposed standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b619 We therefore decline to adopt either party\u2019s proposed standard of review. As previously discussed, the school lands are held in trust. Moreover, \u201c[t]he essence of a finding that property is held in trust, school, public, or otherwise, is that anyone who acquires interests in such property do so \u2018subject to the trust.\u2019 <em>\u201dPettibone, </em>216 Mont. at 375, 702 P.2d at 956-57 (citations omitted). We follow our previously discussed standard of review in determining whether the statutes are consistent with the constitutional mandates of the trust and the State\u2019s fiduciary duties as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b620 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">\u00b621 Section 77-1-130, MCA, authorizes individuals and counties to apply to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (hereafter, the Department) for historic right-of-way deeds to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>access to private property or to continue county roads. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">At the time of issuing the historic right-of-way deed, the department shall collect from the applicant the full market value of the acreage of the historic right-of-way based on the following classifications of land:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">(i) $37.50 per acre for state land classified as grazing land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">(ii) $275 per acre for state land classified as timber land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">(iii) $100 per acre for state land classified as crop land; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(iv) $100 per acre for other land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Section 77-l-130(4)(a), MCA. The District Court found and the State does not dispute that \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA\u2019s figures \u201care based on the median values for the classifications of land in 1972.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\u00b622 The State argues that the District Court erred in striking \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA, because it is facially valid and Montrust has not shown that it has constitutional infirmities beyond a reasonable doubt. The State relies on an Attorney General opinion, 40 A.G. 24 (1983), in arguing that the figures in \u00a777-1-130, MCA, are merely a minimum above which the Department may charge full market value. The State contends that the Board has discretion not to implement the values set forth in \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA, and that this Court should assume that the Board will uphold its constitutional duty to charge full market value for historic right-of-way deeds. Montrust responds that by fixing fair market values at 1972 levels, \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA, is unconstitutional because it expressly violates the trust\u2019s requirement that full market value be obtained for school trust lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">\u00b623  We conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 77-1-130, MCA, requires that full market valuations of right-of-way acreage be based on 1972 levels. Section 77-1-130, MCA, provides in part that \u201cthe department <em>shall </em>collect from the applicant the full market value of the acreage of the historic right-of-way <em>based </em>on the following classifications of land ...\u201d Section 77-l~130(4)(a), MCA (emphasis added). The statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d admits of no discretion and requires the department to use 1972 values. We hold that this statute clearly violates the State\u2019s constitutional obligation to obtain full market value for school trust lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">\u00b624 2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Department\u2019s rental policy for cabin site licenses and leases under \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00b625 Section 77-1-208, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-3\">Cabin site licenses and leases \u2014 method of establishing value. (1) The board shall set the annual fee based on full market value for each cabin site and for each licensee or lessee who at any time wishes to continue or assign the license or lease. The fee must attain full market value based on appraisal of the cabin site value as determined by the department of revenue. The licensee or lessee has the option to pay the entire fee on March 1 or to divide the fee into two equal payments due March 1 and September 1. The value may be increased or decreased as a result of the statewide periodic revaluation of property pursuant to 15-7-111 without any adjustments as a result of phasing in values. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">(2) The board shall set the fee of each initial cabin site license or lease or each current cabin site license or lease of a person who does not choose to retain the license or lease. The initial fee must be based upon a system of competitive bidding. The fee for a person who wishes to retain that license or lease must be determined under the method provided for in subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Section 77-1-208, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b626 The District Court ruled that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, did not violate the trust because it requires that full market value be obtained. However, the District Court found that the Department had a policy of charging a rental rate of 3.5% of appraised value (hereafter, the rental policy) and that Montrust had introduced an economic analysis of cabin site rentals showing that the rental policy\u2019s 3.5% rate was \u201csignificantly below a fair market rental rate.\u201d The District Court concluded that the rental policy violated the trust\u2019s constitutional requirement that full market value be obtained for school trust lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b627 The State argues that Montrust challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA\u2019s ban on competitive bidding for renewals of cabin site leases but did not challenge the constitutionality of the rental policy. The State argues that it therefore did not have notice of Montrust\u2019s objection to the rental policy and that it did not consent impliedly to trying that issue. The State argues that the District Court should not have addressed the rental policy after it affirmed the constitutionality of \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b628 Montrust responds that its pleadings gave notice of the issue whether the Department\u2019s rental policy achieved full market rates. Montrust argues further that substantial evidence supported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>conclusion that the rental policy did not obtain full market value for cabin site leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b629  We have previously addressed whether pleadings give sufficient notice of an issue. <em>In Miller v. Titeca </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 357, 628 P.2d 670, this Court concluded that the district court\u2019s resolution of damages \u201cdid not conform precisely with the buyer\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Titeca, </em>192 Mont. at 364, 628 P.2d at 675. However, the Court in <em>Titeca </em>noted that under Rule 8, M.R.Civ.P., \u201call pleadings shall be construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The courts should \u201clook to the claim as a whole, to the subject with which it deals, to the reason and spirit of the allegations in ascertaining its real purpose. If such purpose can reasonably be said to be within the scope of the language used, that purpose should be honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><em>Titeca, </em>192 Mont. at 364, 628 P.2d at 675 (citation omitted). Thus, in assessing whether Montrust\u2019s pleadings gave notice of the issue whether the rental policy was constitutional, we look at Montrust\u2019s claim as a whole and to \u201cthe reason and spirit of the allegations in ascertaining its real purpose.\u201d <em>Titeca, </em>192 Mont. at 364, 628 P.2d at 675 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b630 In Montrust\u2019s complaint and amended complaint, Montrust asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u00a7 77-1-208, MCA[,] provides for competitive bidding for the first issuance of cabin site leases, but prohibits it for renewals. By tying lease rental rates to the taxation valuation procedure, the legislature has intentionally discounted the value of those leases below full market rates. Doing so violates the duties of prudence, loyalty, fidelity, productivity, accountability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b631  We conclude that this pleading gave notice of the issue whether cabin sites were leased at full market rental rates. Although Montrust\u2019s complaint focussed on the actions of the legislature instead of the Department, the complaint clearly signaled its concern with the intentional discounting of leases below full market rates. We hold that the State had adequate notice of Montrust\u2019s objection to the rental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u00b632  Moreover, we conclude that the rental policy violates the trust. We have previously concluded that the Board and the Department have discretion in administering the trust; however, their discretion is not unbounded. In <em>State v. Babcock </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 46, 409 P.2d 808, we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>There is no doubt that the State Board of Land Commissioners has considerable discretionary power when dealing with the disposition of an interest in land they hold in trust for the people of this state....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-3\">The discretionary power of the Board is, however, limited.... Article XVII, \u00a7 1 of the Montana Constitution provides [one limitation], A portion of such section reads: \u201c* * * and none of such land, nor any estate or interest therein, shall ever be disposed of except in pursuance of general laws providing for such disposition, <em>nor unless the full market value of the estate or interest disposed of, </em>to be ascertained in such manner as may be provided by law, be paid or safely secured to the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><em>Babcock, </em>147 Mont. at 51-52, 409 P.2d at 811 (emphasis added). In the present case, the trust mandates that the State obtain full market value for cabin site rentals. Furthermore, the State does not dispute the District Court\u2019s determination that the rental policy results in below market rate rentals. We hold that the rental policy violates the trust\u2019s requirement that full market value be obtained for school trust lands and interests therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">f33 3. Whether the District Court correctly determined that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, does not violate the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b634 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, on its face does not violate the trust because it requires that full market value be obtained for cabin site lease renewals. As previously noted, \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, provides that the Board \u201cshall set the fee of each initial cabin site license or lease or each current cabin site license or lease of a person who does not choose to retain the license or lease ... based upon a system of competitive bidding.\u201d Section 77-1-208(2), MCA. However, for renewals of cabin site leases or licenses, \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he fee must attain full market value based on the appraisal of the cabin site value as determined by the department of revenue.\u201d Section 77-1-208(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b635 On cross-appeal, Montrust argues that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, is facially unconstitutional because its eschewal of competitive bidding is \u201ccalculated\u201d to keep cabin site rental rates below their full market value. Montrust\u2019s argument assumes that without competitive bidding, the Department cannot obtain fair market value for its renewals of cabin site leases. Montrust also argues that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, breaches the State\u2019s fiduciary duty of undivided loyalty because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>preference rights that cabin site lessees have to renew and assign their leases under \u00a7\u00a7 77-6-205 and -208(1), MCA. The State responds that because \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, mandates that fair market value be obtained, it is consistent with the Enabling Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b636  We conclude that \u00a7 77-1-208, MCA, on its face does not violate the trust.

Thus, \u00a7 77-5-211, MCA, on its face violates both the trust\u2019s mandate that full market value be received for school trust lands and the State\u2019s trust duty of undivided loyalty.

The former lessee may, however, remove the movable improvements on the land and dispose of them to parties other than the lessee. If he fails to remove the improvements from the land within 60 days from the date of the expiration of his lease, all of the improvements become the property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>state unless the department for good cause grants additional time for their removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b645 On cross-appeal, Montrust contends that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA\u2019s sixty-day provision violates the trust by providing direct unreimbursed benefits to nontrust entities. Montrust argues that there is no evidence that the Department has charged former lessees for exercising their sixty-day right under \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA. The State responds that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, does not violate any fiduciary duty, that it merely gives the Department time to inventory improvements on school trust lands, and that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, has no quantifiable impact on the trust fund. The State further argues that bids on school trust lands take into account the sixty-day provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b646 The District Court found that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, did not prevent the Department from charging former lessees for the storage of improvements after the termination of their leases. The District Court also found that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, does not prevent a new lessee from moving onto trust land before the former lessee has removed his improvements. The District Court further found that \u201cit was reasonably necessary for the Department to allow the former lessee some extra time to remove improvements, especially in the winter months when most agricultural leases terminate.\u201d The District Court acknowledged that the Department\u2019s policy is to postpone new leases pending removals of improvements by former lessees. Conceding that this policy could reduce potential profits to the trust, the District Court concluded nonetheless that the policy did not breach the State\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities and that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, is constitutional as applied to school trust lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b647 We note that leases in school trust lands are subject to the trust. <em>In Rider v. Cooney </em>(1933), 94 Mont. 295, 23 P.2d 261, the Court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">When a lease is granted upon the public lands of the state, an interest or estate in the lands has been alienated, and therefore the leasing of the lands of the state for a term of years is the disposal of an interest or estate in the lands within the provisions of our Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Rider, 94 Mont. at 308, 23 P.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b648 In construing statutes, we have previously concluded that \u201c[t]he intent of the Legislature is to be pursued and we determine that intent by interpreting the plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature. The statutory language must be reasonably and logically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>interpreted and words given their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Matter of R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\u00b649  Applying these canons of construction to \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, we conclude that it plainly authorizes the Department to allow former lessees to remain free of charge on trust lands for up to sixty days while they remove movable improvements. The right to remove movable improvements that is provided under \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, necessarily implies a right of occupancy in order to remove movable improvements. Further, as previously noted, the Department\u2019s practice is to postpone the issuance of new leases until movable improvements are removed. The Department\u2019s practice recognizes that to allow former lessees to remove improvements, including for example houses, cabins, and fences, after new leases have issued would interfere with new lessees\u2019 quiet enjoyment and possession of leased lands. We agree with this premise. As the District Court suggested, the Department could allow a new lessee to move onto trust lands before improvements are removed. The former lessee\u2019s occupancy during the period when he exercises his removal rights would however conflict with the new lessee\u2019s occupancy. Section 77-6-304, MCA, clearly contemplates that and authorizes the Department to avoid this conflict by postponing new leases without trust compensation while former lessees exercise their removal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b650 In <em>Lassen v. Arizona Highway Dept. </em>(1967), 385 U.S. 458, 87 S.Ct. 584, 17 L.Ed.2d 515, Arizona\u2019s Highway Department sought to prohibit Arizona\u2019s State Land Commissioner from applying rules regarding the acquisition of rights of way in lands held in trust by Arizona. The Commissioner\u2019s rules provided in part that \u201cRights of Way and Material Sites may be granted ... for an indefinite period ... <em>after full payment </em>of the appraised value has been made ...\u201d <em>Lassen, </em>385 U.S. at 459-60, 87 S.Ct. at 585, 17 L.Ed.2d at 517 (emphasis added). The Highway Department argued that no compensation \u201cneed ever be actually paid since it may be conclusively presumed that all highways enhance the value of the remaining trust lands in amounts at least equal to the value of the lands which were taken.\u201d <em>Lassen, </em>385 U.S. at 465, 87 S.Ct. at 588, 17 L.Ed.2d at 521. The <em>Lassen </em>Court rejected this argument and concluded that \u201cthe purposes of Congress require that the Act\u2019s designated beneficiaries \u2018derive the full benefit\u2019 of the grant.\u201d <em>Lassen, </em>385 U.S. at 468, 87 S.Ct. at 589, 17 L.Ed.2d at 522. The <em>Lassen </em>Court held that Arizona must compensate the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>with money for the \u201cfull appraised value of any material sites or rights of way which it obtains on or over trust lands.\u201d <em>Lassen, </em>385 U.S. at 469, 87 S.Ct. at 590, 17 L.Ed.2d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b651  In the present case, we conclude that allowing former leaseholders up to sixty days to remove movable improvements without charge similarly denies the trust\u2019s beneficiaries \u201cthe full benefit\u201d of the trust lands. <em>Lassen, </em>385 U.S. at 468, 87 S.Ct. at 589, 17 L.Ed.2d at 522.

The reasonable value may not be less than the full market value of the improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b654 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 77-6-305, MCA, does not violate the trust \u201ceven though it may result in less revenue due to delayed leases.\u201d The District Court further concluded that the Department must have latitude to administer school trust lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">\u00b655 On cross-appeal, Montrust argues that under \u00a7 77-6-305, MCA, a former lessee can delay indefinitely the issuance of a new lease on trust lands. Montrust notes that the parties stipulated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">In denying the issuance of a lease to a new lessee, the school trust may receive revenue from the land where it issues a land use license to farm or graze the land.

The State concedes that this statute is an occasional source of delay in the transfer of leases on trust lands. However, the State argues that allowing a new lessee to assume immediately a lease and to use the improvements installed by the former lessee can create \u201cneedless complications in determining the value of improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b657 The State correctly observes that both the Board and the Department have discretion in the management of trust lands. In <em>Stewart, </em>48 Mont. at 350, 137 P. at 855, the Court observed that \u201cof necessity, the board must have a large discretionary power over the subject of the trust...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b658  However, this discretion is not unlimited but must conform to the requirements of the trust. <em>See, e.g., Toomey, </em>106 Mont. at 559, 81 P.2d at 414 (concluding that \u201cthe state is a trustee in this instance, and that a trustee must strictly conform to the directions of the trust <em>agreement....\u201d); Babcock, </em>147 Mont. at 51, 409 P.2d at 811 (recognizing discretionary powers of Board but concluding that \u201cthere can be no such implied powers inconsistent with any part of the constitution\u201d) (citation omitted). In allowing trust lands to idle indefinitely while former and new lessees determine the value of improvements, \u00a7 77-6-305, MCA, is inconsistent with the trust\u2019s mandate that full market value be obtained for school trust lands. We hold that the specific requirement in \u00a7 77-6-305, MCA, that a new lease will not issue until the new lessee shows that the old lessee has been paid the value of his improvements is unconstitutional on its face. We note that our holding does not reach the requirement, in \u00a7 77-6-305, MCA, that former lessees be reimbursed for their improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b659 7.

However, Montrust argues that Montana has recognized equitable exceptions to the rule. Montrust argues in part that it is entitled to reasonable attorney fees under the doctrine of private attorney general. Because this issue is dispositive, we do not address the other grounds for attorney fees that Montrust has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b663 The State responds that the American rule bars attorney fees in the present case. The State asserts that no contractual or statutory provision allows attorney fees. Further, the State -argues that \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, does not help Montrust because the State has not acted frivolously or in bad faith. The State also argues that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the doctrine of private attorney general is available in the present case, Montrust is not entitled to attorney fees. Further, the State directs this Court\u2019s attention to <em>Helena Elementary School Dist. v. State </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 684, <em>opinion amended by Helena Elementary School Dist. v. State </em>(1990), 236 Mont. 44, 784 P.2d 412, where the Court denied a request for attorney fees under the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines. However, <em>Helena Elementary School Dist. </em>is readily distinguished from the present case as we do not consider the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines. We note that the State also appears to argue that under a private attorney general theory, Montrust would be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>quired to show that the trust\u2019s beneficiaries have received a tangible monetary benefit from Montrust\u2019s litigation. The State offers no authority for this interpretation, and we decline to adopt such a narrow reading of \u201cbenefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">\u00b664 We have previously recognized equitable exceptions to the American rule. <em>See, e.g., Foy v. Anderson </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 507, 511, 580 P.2d 114, 117 (affirming award of attorney fees on equitable grounds despite absence of specific contractual or statutory grant); <em>Holmstrom Land Co. v. Hunter </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 43, 48-49, 595 P.2d 360, 363 (again affirming award of attorney fees on equitable grounds in absence of statutory or contractual grant); <em>Goodover v.

In <em>Means v.

In <em>Matter of Dearborn Drainage Area, </em>this Court recognized but declined to apply the private attorney general doctrine, commenting that \u201c[tjhe Doctrine is normally utilized when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens.\u201d <em>Matter of Dearborn Drainage Area, </em>240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b665 A number of jurisdictions have adopted the private attorney general doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Miotke v. City of Spokane </em>(Wash. 1984), 678 P.2d 803 (adopting private attorney general theory for attorney fees); <em>Arnold v. Arizona Dept. of Health Services </em>(Ariz. 1989), 775 P.2d 521 (also adopting private attorney general theory); <em>Serrano v. Priest </em>(Cal. 1977), 569 P.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b666 In <em>Serrano, </em>the court affirmed the district court\u2019s award of reasonable attorney fees to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys under a private attorney general theory. The <em>Serrano </em>court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">there are three basic factors to be considered in awarding fees on this theory. These are in general: (1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>burden on the plaintiff, (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Serrano, 569 P.2d at 1314. The <em>Serrano </em>court recognized that under the first factor, courts could be \u201cthrust into the role of making assessments of the relative strength or weakness of public policies furthered by their decisions and of determining at the same time which public policy should be encouraged by an award of fees, and which not \u2014 a role closely approaching that of the legislative function.\u201d <em>Serrano, </em>569 P.2d at 1314. However, the <em>Serrano </em>court concluded that the public policy furthered by the litigation in that case was \u201cgrounded in the State Constitution.\u201d <em>Serrano, </em>569 P.2d at 1315. The <em>Serrano </em>court also noted that the uncontested findings of the district court established that the \u201cbenefits flowing from this adjudication are to be widely enjoyed among the citizens of this state,\u201d and concluded that under those circumstances, the award of attorney fees to the plaintiffs \u201cwas proper under the theory posited by the trial court.\u201d <em>Serrano, </em>569 P.2d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b667  We adopt the private attorney general theory and the three part inquiry set forth in <em>Serrano. </em>Further, we conclude that Montrust is deserving of attorney fees under the private attorney general theory. First, Montrust has litigated important public policies that are grounded in Montana\u2019s Constitution. Second, the State argues that it had a duty to defend the statutes in the present case; thus, the State does not dispute the necessity of private enforcement of Montana\u2019s Constitution. Nor does the State dispute the magnitude of Montrust\u2019s consequent burden. Third, Montrust\u2019s litigation has clearly benefited a large class: all Montana citizens interested in Montana\u2019s public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b668 The award of attorney fees \u201cto make the injured party whole\u201d is within the discretion of a district court. <em>Russell Realty Co. v.

If he fails to remove the improvements from the land within 60 days from the date of the expiration of his lease, all of the improvements become the property of the state unless the department for good cause grants additional time for their removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The Court determines that this statute authorizes the Department to allow former lessees to remain free of charge on trust lands for up to sixty days while they remove improvements and, as a result, that the statute is facially inconsistent with the trust\u2019s requirement that full market value be obtained for interests in school trust lands. I would agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion if \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, on its face, actually allowed for the continued occupancy of the leased premises by a former lessee for sixty days. The statute does not do so, however. Indeed, nothing in the statutory language permits continued occupancy by the former lessee for sixty days or precludes the issuance of a lease to, and occupancy thereunder by, a new lessee. Nor are the Department\u2019s policies relating to \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, relevant to the facial constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b673 In short, it is my view that Montrust has failed to establish that \u00a7 77-6-304, MCA, is facially unconstitutional beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>doubt as required by <em>Martel. </em>Therefore, I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding on issue 5.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-4\">JUSTICE REGNIER joins in JUSTICE GRAY\u2019S foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b448-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in JUSTICE GRAY\u2019S concurring and dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
