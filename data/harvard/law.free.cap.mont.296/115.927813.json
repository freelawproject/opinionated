On May 1,1998, Title Insurance Company moved for summary judgment, and thereafter, the Millers moved for partial summary judgment with respect to their breach of contract claim. On September 9,1988, the District Court granted Title Insurance Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Millers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. On September 16,1998, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Title Insurance Company. The Millers appeal from that judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b62 The issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted Title Insurance Company of Minnesota\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Millers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">\u00b63 In November 1988, Scott and Carolyn Miller purchased a home in Helena, Montana. At the time they purchased the home, they purchased a title insurance policy from Minnesota Title, now known as Title Insurance Company, through its agent Helena Abstract &amp; Title Company. This policy defined the term \u201cpublic records\u201d as: \u201cthose records which by law impart constructive notice of matters relating to said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">\u00b64 Prior to the issuance of the insurance policy, the Millers received two title commitments from Title Insurance Company, which did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>specifically define the term \u201cpublic records.\u201d However, under the Conditions and Stipulations section, the commitment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">3. Liability of the Company under this Commitment shall be only to the named proposed Insured and such parties included under the definition of Insured in the form of policy or policies committed ... and such liability is subject to the insuring provisions and the Conditions and Stipulations and the Exclusions from Coverage of the form of policy ... which are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Commitment except expressly modified herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b65 In August 1996 the Millers began excavation to construct a garage on their property. During that excavation and construction, the Millers learned that a neighbor\u2019s water and sewer lines ran across their property. Specifically, the lines ran beneath the location of the new garage. At the time the water and sewer lines were installed, both the dominant and servient estates were under common ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b66 The Millers determined that the easement established for the neighbor\u2019s water and sewer lines, as identified by records located in the city engineer\u2019s office, rendered their title unmarketable. Consequently, they submitted a claim to Title Insurance Company. The Millers requested that Title Insurance Company cure the title defect by securing the relocation of their neighbor\u2019s water and sewer lines, and by reimbursing them for legal expenses they had and would incur in curing the title defect. Title Insurance Company denied the claim based on a coverage exclusion in the policy, which limited coverage to easements of public record. Nothing in the Millers\u2019 chain of title, recorded in the Lewis and Clark County Clerk and Recorder\u2019s office, revealed the existence of the water and sewer lines. However, the lines were shown in the records of the Helena City Engineer and Water Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b67 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Motarie v. Northern Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156 (citing <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785). When we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we apply the same evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we set forth our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it granted Title Insurance Company of Minnesota\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Millers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b69 The District Court concluded that since the insurance policy unambiguously defined the term \u201cpublic records,\u201d it could not offer an alternative interpretation. The District Court pointed out that the insurance policy unambiguously limited coverage to encumbrances of which Title Insurance Company had constructive notice and that the Millers could not point to any statute declaring that records in a city engineer\u2019s office provide constructive notice. As a result, the District Court concluded that the reasonable expectations doctrine did not apply and entered summary judgment in favor of Title Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b6 10 Millers contend that the term \u201cpublic records\u201d as defined in the insurance policy is ambiguous, uncertain, and unclear and the limiting effect of that definition violates their reasonable expectations. Title Insurance Company responded by stating that the records located in the city engineer\u2019s office are not public records as defined by the policy, and therefore, the existence of the underground lines was not an insured matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b611 Millers assumed a broad definition of \u201cpublic records.\u201d They argue that pursuant to \u00a7 2-6-101, MCA, the \u201cpublic writings\u201d statute, it was reasonable for them to expect prior to receiving the policy and after reading the title commitment, that the term \u201cpublic records\u201d included all public records relative to their property and specifically, in this case, those records relating to sewer and water lines encumbering their property as maintained by the City of Helena Engineer\u2019s Office and Water Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u00b612 The purpose of Title 2, Chapter 6, Part 2 of the Montana Code Annotated is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[T]o create an effective records management program for executive branch agencies of the state of Montana and political subdivisions by establishing guidelines and procedures for the efficient and economical control of the creation, utilization, maintenance, and preservation of state and local records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Section 2-6-201, MCA. Section 2-6-202(1), MCA, defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cPublic records\u201d includes any paper, correspondence, form, book, photograph, microfilm, magnetic tape, computer storage <em>media, </em>map, drawing, or other document, including all copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, that has been made or received by a state agency in connection with the transaction of official business and preserved for informational value or as evidence of a transaction and all other records or documents required by law to be filed with or kept by any agency of the state of Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Local government public records are similarly defined except that the definition is limited to those records made, received, or kept by a local government. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-6-401(2), MCA. However, the title insurance policy at issue in this case specifically defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as \u201cthose records which <em>by law </em>impart <em>constructive notice </em>of matters relating to said land.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b613 Pursuant to the Montana recording statutes, \u201cconstructive notice,\u201d as found in the definition of \u201cpublic records,\u201d is described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(1) Every conveyance of real property acknowledged or proved and certified and recorded as prescribed by law, <em>from the time it is filed with the county clerk for record, is constructive notice </em>of the contents thereof to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">(2) A certified copy of any such recorded conveyance may be recorded in any other county, and when so recorded the record thereof shall have the same force and effect as though it was of the original conveyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Section 70-21-302, MCA, (emphasis added). Section 70-21-209, MCA, defines what instruments are to be considered recorded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">An instrument is deemed to be recorded when, being duly acknowledged or proved and certified, <em>it is deposited in the county clerk\u2019s office </em>with the proper officer for record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">\u00b614 The Millers contend that they relied on the ambiguous term \u201cpublic records\u201d in the title commitment, which was not defined, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>they purchased their home. They assert that they interpreted \u201cpublic records\u201d to mean \u201cthose records which relate to their property and that are open to the public to review and inspect.\u201d The Millers explain that, upon reviewing the title commitment, they expected and understood that any adverse interest, easement, claim, encumbrance, or lien that was not shown by the public records, would not be insurable based upon the exceptions stated in the title commitment. The Millers maintain that the phrase \u201cby law\u201d within the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d in the policy does not adequately inform an insured that an examination of the Montana recording statutes codified at \u00a7\u00a7 70-21-101, et seq., MCA, is required in order to determine what is meant by the term \u201cpublic records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b6 15 We have held that the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>See Leibrand v. National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 1, 6, 898 P.2d 1220, 1223 (citation omitted). \u201cAmbiguity exists only when the contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u201d <em>Canal Ins. Co. v. Bunday </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 100, 105, 813 P.2d 974, 977 (citation omitted). A clause in an insurance policy is ambiguous \u201cwhen different persons looking at the clause <em>in light of its purpose </em>cannot agree upon its meaning.\u201d <em>Leibrand, </em>272 Mont. at 6, 898 P.2d at 1223 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b6 16 Under Montana law, \u201c[t]he language of a contract is to govern its interpretation if the language is clear and explicit and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d Section 28-3-401, MCA. In <em>Canal, </em>we determined that \u201c[i]f the language of a contract is unambiguous and subject to only one meaning, there is no basis for the interpretation of the policy coverage under the guise of ambiguity.\u201d <em>Canal, </em>249 Mont. at 105, 813 P.2d at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b6 17 In this case, the term \u201cpublic records\u201d defined in the title policy is not reasonably subject to two different interpretations. The title policy issued to the Millers specifically defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as \u201cthose records which by law impart constructive notice of matters relating to said land.\u201d This is entirely consistent with existing Montana statutory law and Montana recording procedures, which require that documents affecting title to real property be recorded with the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the real property is located. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 70-21-201, et seq., MCA. By law, upon filing and recordation with the proper officer in the county clerk\u2019s office, subsequent purchasers and mortgagees are deemed to have <em>constructive notice </em>of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>conveyance of real property and its contents. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-21- 302(1), MCA. In addition, judgments docketed in the clerk of the district court\u2019s office become liens on the real estate owned by the judgment debtor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-9-302, MCA. These are the records that impart constructive notice of matters relating to real property and, for the purposes of this case, are the \u201cpublic records\u201d defined in the title policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u00b618  The applicable Montana statutes, therefore, do not impose a duty upon title insurers to search city engineer or water department records. Pursuant to Montana law and the title policy at issue, a title insurer is only under a contractual duty to investigate the documents properly recorded or docketed and which themselves, or through their contents, impart constructive notice of liens and encumbrances, including easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\u00b619. According to Title Insurance Company, the contract definition of \u201cpublic records,\u201d in conjunction with the Montana statutes relating to recorded instruments (\u00a7 70-21-209, MCA) and constructive notice (\u00a7 70-21-302, MCA), make it clear that title insurers and abstractors search only record title in the offices of the clerk and recorder and the clerk of court in the county in which the real property is located. Pursuant to Montana\u2019s statutory scheme, documents recorded or filed in the office of the clerk and recorder or clerk of court impart constructive notice. Nowhere in the insurance policy or Montana statutes related to recording is there a suggestion that the records of the city engineer and water department impart constructive notice to purchasers of real property. While documents located in a city engineer\u2019s office or water department may be subject to public inspection as public records under \u00a7 2-6-202( 1), MCA, such documents do not by law impart constructive notice. Accordingly, we agree with Title Insurance Company and conclude that the term \u201cpublic records\u201d in the Millers\u2019 policy is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b620 Alternatively, the Millers contend that even if no ambiguity is found in the contractual definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d it is within their reasonable expectations that such encumbrances on their real property, regardless of where they were recorded, would be covered by their title insurance. Title Insurance Company contends that the Millers\u2019 expectation is not reasonable because no title underwriter could maintain copies of such a broad assortment of records, nor could any local title company research those records every time a request for title insurance was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u00b621 \u201cThe reasonable expectations doctrine provides that the objectively reasonable expectations of insurance purchasers regarding the terms of their policies should be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations.\u201d <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 32, 292 Mont. 244, \u00b6 32, 970 P.2d 1054, \u00b6 32. Nevertheless, we have determined that \u201cthe reasonable expectations doctrine is inapplicable where the terms of the policy at issue clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude <em>coverage.\u201d American Family, </em>\u00b6 33. The reason for this determination is that an insured\u2019s \u201cexpectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019.\u201d <em>American Family, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b622  The policy at issue in this case clearly states that it does not insure against loss or damage by reason of \u201ceasements, or claims of easements, not shown by the public records.\u201d As indicated previously, the policy defines the term \u201cpublic records\u201d as \u201cthose records which by law impart constructive notice of matters relating to said land.\u201d This language clearly demonstrates an intent to exclude coverage for easements, or claims of easements, not shown by the public records. As such, the District Court correctly determined that the reasonable expectations doctrine does not apply. Thus, the Millers\u2019 expectations which were contrary to the clear exclusion of coverage were not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
