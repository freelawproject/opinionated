Blythe, </em>1998 MT 90, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 356, \u00b6 17, 957 P.2d 1134, \u00b6 17. Our review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary; we determine whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Liberty v. State Fund, </em>1998 MT 169, \u00b6 7, 289 Mont. 475, \u00b6 7, 962 P.2d 1167, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">\u00b66 Matthews was a long-haul truck driver for SEA trucking. On April 7, 1996 Matthews stopped in Ohio to fix the roof lights on his truck, fell, and struck his head on the ground. He apparently lost consciousness briefly. After his fall, Matthews had a headache, rested and then continued driving. The following morning, Matthews phoned his fleet manager, reported his fall, and stated that he would be late with his delivery. While on the phone with his supervisor, Matthews passed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">\u00b67 Matthews was taken by ambulance to Memorial Hospital in Geneva, Ohio. Matthews was later transported by helicopter to a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. He was diagnosed with a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or stroke. However, his medical tests failed to provide objective evidence of a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b68 Matthews later received treatment from a Veterans Administration medical center in Hot Springs, South Dakota. In July, 1996 Steven Hata (Dr. Hata), a neurologist associated with the Hot Springs medical center, evaluated Matthews and determined that he suffered from \"post cerebrovascular accident, etiology undetermined.\u201d Dr. Hata ordered an MRI; its result was normal. In September, 1996 Dr. Hata commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">This patient shows no objective evidence of having had a left middle cerebral stroke nor a subcortical thalamic stroke in the left hemisphere which would account for his right hemiparesis and aphasia. ... With the negative MRI scan as well as no evidence of stroke risk and acute stroke during his acute hospitalization in Cleveland, this raises the possibility that some of these symptoms are nonphysiologic and that the patient\u2019s symptoms are perpetuated, if not caused by, a conversion type of symptomatology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Dr. Hata determined that \u201c[n]o further workup is indicated.\u201d He concluded that Matthews might be depressed and that \u201ca [pjsychiatric/psychological evaluation might uncover conversion tendencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b69 At the time of Matthews\u2019 fall, SEA trucking was insured by the State Compensation Insurance Fund (hereafter, State Fund). In May, 1996 Matthews filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The State Fund obtained a medical peer panel review of Matthews\u2019 claim in August, 1996. The panel, which was comprised of three physicians, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">From review of the medical records, it would appear that the cerebral vascular accident resulted from a thrombotic or embolic phenomenon. Most likely, the etiology of the stroke relates to the patient\u2019s hypertension. There is no evidence that the stroke was caused from a traumatic event. There is no evidence on the CT scan of a skull fracture, or an epidural or subdural hematoma. The localized right hemiparesis indicates that a branch of a cerebral artery was occluded, and the resultant hemiparesis occurred. This type of occlusion develops from a thrombotic or embolic phenomenon, and is not related to soft tissue trauma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b610 In his January, 1999 trial Matthews presented no medical testimony but asked that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court make its determination based on his medical records. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that \u201c[i]n light of the uncontradicted medical panel opinion of August 16,1996, [Matthews] has failed to persuade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the Court that his hemiparesis and aphasia were caused by his April 7, 1996 fall.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court further concluded that Matthews had failed to meet his burden of proof that he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and dismissed his case with prejudice. From that judgment Matthews appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b611 Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that Matthews failed to meet his burden of proof that his stroke-like symptoms were caused by a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b612 Matthews argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in relying on the opinion of the medical peer panel. Matthews asserts that the medical peer panel opinion was based on incomplete information and that it was called into question by tests performed after Matthews left Memorial Hospital in Ohio. However, Matthews does not identify those tests or their results. Matthews also argues that the medical peer panel\u2019s opinion was called into question by Dr. Hata\u2019s assessment of Matthews. Matthews contends that Dr. Hata\u2019s report raised the possibility that \u201chis symptoms were caused by a conversion type of symptomology.\u201d Relying on <em>Plainbull v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 120, 870 P.2d 76, Matthews argues further that causation may be established by indirect evidence when medical science cannot provide proof and that he provided such evidence through Dr. Hata\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b613 The State responds that there is no objective medical evidence that Matthews suffered a conversion reaction. Further, the State argues that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Matthews had a conversion reaction, there is no evidence that it was caused by his fall from the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b614 We begin by addressing the pertinent statutory provisions. We have previously recognized that \u201c[i]t is well established that the workers\u2019 compensation law in effect at the time of an injury governs the claim.\u201dMurer <em>v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 210, 219, 942 P.2d 69, 74. Matthews\u2019 alleged injury occurred in April, 1996 and the 1995 Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes therefore apply in the present case. Section 39-71-407, MCA (1995), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">Liability of insurers \u2014 limitations. (1) Each insurer is liable for the payment of compensation, in the manner and to the extent provided in this section, to an employee of an employer that it insures who receives an injury arising out of and in the course of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ment or, in the case of death from the injury, to the employee\u2019s beneficiaries, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">(2) (a) An insurer is liable for an injury, as defined in 39-71-119, if the injury is established by objective medical findings and if the claimant establishes that it is more probable than not that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">(i) a claimed injury has occurred ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Section 39-71-407, MCA (1995). Section 39-71-119, MCA (1995), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">(1) \u201cInjury\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">(a)internal or external physical harm to the body that is established by objective medical findings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">(2) An injury is caused by an accident. An accident is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">(a) an unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">(b) identifiable by time and place of occurrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">(c) identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">(d) caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">(5) (a) A cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, or other disease, cerebrovascular accident, or myocardial infarction suffered by a worker is an injury only if the accident is the primary cause of the physical condition ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Section 39-71-119, MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">\u00b615  We have previously determined that a claimant for workers\u2019 compensation benefits must initially \u201cprove by a preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a compensable injury.\u201d <em>Chaney v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 513, 518, 917 P.2d 912, 915 (citation omitted). Further, a claimant must show that \u201ca causal condition existed between his injury and his current condition.\u201d <em>Chaney, </em>276 Mont. at 518, 917 P.2d at 915 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">\u00b616 We conclude that Matthews\u2019 reliance on <em>Plainbull </em>is mistaken. <em>Plainbull </em>addressed \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA (1989), which provided in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n insurer is liable for an injury as defined in 39-71-119 if the claimant establishes it is more probable than not that: (i) a claimed injury has occurred ...\u201d Section 39-71-407(2)(a)(i), MCA (1989). However, in 1995 the legislature amended \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA, to provide in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n insurer is liable for an injury, as defined in 39-71-119, <em>if the injury is established by objective </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>medical findings </em>and if the claimant establishes that it is more probable than not ....\u201d Section 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA (1995) (emphasis added). In addition, the legislature inserted the requirement that \u201c[a]n employee is not eligible for benefits payable under this chapter unless the entitlement to benefits is established by objective medical findings that contain sufficient factual and historical information concerning the relationship of the workers\u2019 condition to the original injury.\u201d Section 39-71-407(6), MCA (1995). Thus, unlike the claimant in <em>Plainbull, </em>Matthews had to establish with objective medical findings that an injury occurred. <em>Compare Plainbull, </em>264 Mont. at 125, 870 P.2d at 79 (concluding \u201cnothing in [\u00a7 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA (1989),] requires a medical opinion as to whether the injury actually occurred or not\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b6 17  In the present case, Matthews has identified nothing in the record that shows a causal relationship between his accident and his stroke-like symptoms. Further, Matthews\u2019 reliance on Dr. Hata\u2019s assessment is misplaced. Dr. Hata did not state that Matthews\u2019 symptoms were possibly caused by a conversion reaction but recognized instead the possibility that \u201csome of these symptoms are nonphysiologic and that the patient\u2019s symptoms are perpetuated, if not caused by, a conversion type of symptomatology.\u201d Thus, contrary to Matthews\u2019 argument, Dr. Hata did not conclude that a conversion reaction was the only likely cause of his stroke-like symptoms. More importantly, Dr. Hata did not suggest that Matthews\u2019 fall was responsible for his stroke-like symptoms. Nor did Dr. Hata dispute Matthews\u2019 previous diagnosis of CVA. We conclude that Dr. Hata\u2019s assessment of Matthews was not inconsistent with the conclusions of the medical peer panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b618 We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in concluding that Matthews failed to meet his burden of proof that his stroke-like symptoms were caused by a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
