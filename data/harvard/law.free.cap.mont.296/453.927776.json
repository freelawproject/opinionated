Appellant was sentenced to two consecutive twenty-year terms, the execution of which was suspended subject to the condition that she pay $128,610.15 in restitution to her former employer, Parsons Tractor &amp; Implement Co., (Employer) and serve six months in the Flathead County Detention Center. We affirm in part, reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">\u00b62 We restate the issues Appellant presents on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>I. Was the trial court\u2019s calculation of Appellant\u2019s restitution within statutory mandates?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">II. Did the trial court exceed statutory parameters by imposing interest upon Appellant\u2019s restitution obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">III. Did the trial court follow the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, in determining Appellant\u2019s ability to pay restitution and in ordering her to make payments according to a schedule developed by her probation officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">IV. Did the trial court err in refusing to rule upon Appellant\u2019s post-conviction motions in light of her notice of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b63 While working as Employer\u2019s bookkeeper, Appellant created unauthorized checks on Employer\u2019s account. Without permission, she then signed the checks in the name of the shop foreman, an authorized signer on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b64 On February 5,1998, Appellant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of two counts of felony forgery pursuant to a plea agreement with the State of Montana (the State). While the State charged Appellant with only two counts of forgery, one in the amount of $2,413.45, and another for $2,000.00, the record reflects that Appellant may have forged checks on Employer\u2019s account in an amount as high as $96,403.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b65 On March 23,1998, the District Court sentenced Appellant to two consecutive twenty-year terms for the forgery convictions. The court suspended execution of the sentences subject to the condition that Appellant serve six months in the Flathead County Detention Center and pay restitution to Employer. Crediting Appellant for payments already made, the District Court calculated her restitution obligation at $128,610.15, and imposed interest at a rate of 10%. The court based the total amount of Appellant\u2019s restitution on the following: 1) $96,403.46, the total of forged checks; 2) $16,240.94 for invoices and pay to Appellant; 3) $2,015.00 paid to accounting firms; 4) $7,932.00 paid to employees; 5) $5,396.70 paid to labor contractors; 6) $225.00 paid to Shiloh Software; 7) $397.05 paid to Anytime Lock.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b66 Appellant filed her notice of appeal on May 27,1998, challenging the District Court\u2019s calculation of her restitution and the court\u2019s imposition of interest on the unpaid balance while she was incarcerated in the county detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b6 7 This Court has recently clarified the proper standard of review of criminal sentences. \u201cThis Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute).\u201d <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b615, [295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15], 983 P.2d 937, \u00b615. We overruled any other decisions from this Court which suggest that we also review criminal sentences for an abuse of discretion. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b615.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">I. Was the trial court\u2019s calculation of Appellant\u2019s restitution within statutory mandates?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b68 This Court may review Appellant\u2019s sentence only if Appellant preserved the issue for appeal by objecting to the sentence in district court, or if, on appeal, Appellant alleges her sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates. We adopted the standard in <em>State v. Lenihan;</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">[i]t appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\"><em>State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000, See <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b69 While she did not raise the issue in District Court, Appellant alleges in her appeal that her sentence violates the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, by including in her restitution figure, costs which are not \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as defined by statute. Because Appellant alleges her sentence exceeds statutory mandates, this Court may review her sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b610 Appellant argues that \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as defined by \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, covers only an amount equal to the figure by which she enriched herself at the expense of her victim. She contends that expenses paid by her victim as a result of her cfirn\u00e9 do not fall within the statutory definition and therefore may not be included in her restitution. As a result, Appellant therefore claims the proper amount of her restitution should be $96,403.46 and not the $128,610.15 as calculated by the District Court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">\u00b611 Section 46-18-241, MCA, directs a district court to impose restitution for a victim\u2019s pecuniary or economic loss;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">[a] sentencing court shall require an offender to make full restitution to any victim of the offense who has sustained pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>loss as a result of the offense, including a person suffering an economic loss as a result of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Section 46-18-241, MCA (1997). Section 46-18-243 further defines pecuniary loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities, including without limitation the money equivalent of loss resulting from property taken, destroyed, broken, or otherwise harmed and out-of-pocket losses, such as medical expenses, loss of income, expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services that the victim would have performed if not injured, expenses reasonably incurred in attending court proceedings related to the commission of the offense, and reasonable expenses related to the funeral and burial or crematory services; and (b) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Section 46-18-243(1), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b612  Contrary to Appellant\u2019s argument, \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, allows the sentencing court to include in restitution costs paid by the victim as a result the defendant\u2019s criminal act, so long as such costs are a \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as defined by \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA. Such loss includes economic loss as a result of the crime, out-of-pocket losses such as medical expenses or, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense. Section 46-18-241, 243, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u00b613 Montana cases have not discussed in depth what costs are properly included as \u201cpecuniary losses\u201d. This Court first concluded that restitution may be allowed by payment of the money equivalent of loss as well as out-of-pocket losses in <em>State v. Morgan </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 391, 646 P.2d 1177. Morgan was convicted of negligent homicide when he was involved in an automobile accident with another vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Two occupants in the other vehicle were killed and three seriously injured as a result of the accident. The issue relevant to the case at bar was whether the district court could properly order Morgan to make restitution to the survivors of the accident in the amount of their out-of-pocket losses (for medical expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u00b6 14 At the time, our statutes did not give significant guidance to district courts for the application or limitations of restitution. <em>See Morgan, </em>198 Mont. at 402, 646 P.2d at 1183. In order to develop an appropriate restitution standard in <em>Morgan, </em>we looked to \u00a7 3-601 of The Uniform Law Commissioners Model Sentencing and Corrections Act, (1979), for guidance. <em>Morgan, </em>198 Mont. at 402, 646 P.2d at 1183. In <em>Morgan, </em>the district court had not indicated the out-of-pocket expenses or losses for which restitution was being made. We therefore concluded that it was not possible for this Court to determine if the order of restitution was proper. We held that the district court could provide for payments to those suffering out-of-pocket losses for medical expenses not in excess of the actual money equivalent and remanded to the district court for resentencing on that point. <em>Morgan, </em>198 Mont. at 402-03, 646 P.2d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b6 15 After our decision in Morgan, the Legislature codified the Model Act at \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, which exists in a similar form today. Since the enactment of the restitution statute, this Court has held that a sentencing court\u2019s restitution order was based on pecuniary loss where it arose out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities. <em>See State v. Korang </em>(1989), 237 Mont 390, 396, 773 P.2d 326, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b6 16 Korang, an employee at the Lewis and Clark County Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office, collected fees for recording documents and other services. Korang had bookkeeping responsibilities associated with this position, including depositing collected fees with the County Treasurer\u2019s Office. When the Clerk and Recorder became convinced Korang was taking money and falsifying book entries, a certified public accountant was hired to perform an audit of the books. Based upon this audit, Korang was charged and convicted of felony theft and felony tampering with public records or information. <em>Korang, </em>237 Mont at 392, 773 P.2d at 327. We stated that \u201cthe evidence...gave a figure for the total loss suffered by the County \u2018arising out of the facts or events\u2019 constituting Korang\u2019s common scheme \u2014 her \u2018criminal activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Korang, </em>237 Mont at 396, 773 P.2d at 329. Although we focused on the statutory requirement included in \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, that the restitution figure \u201carise out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities,\u201d we did not explain specifically what costs were included in the total restitution amount in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b617 As in <em>Korang, </em>Employer\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses included in the District Court\u2019s restitution order are a figure for the \u201ctotal loss\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>suffered by Employer arising out of the facts or events of Appellant\u2019s criminal activities. <em>See Korang, </em>237 Mont. at 396, 773 P.2d at 329, \u00a7 46-18-243(1)(a), MCA (1997). The restitution order included Employer\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses for payments to his employees, labor contractors, a software company, accounting firms, and a locksmith, the costs of which arose out of Appellant\u2019s criminal activities. In contrast to the facts in <em>Morgan, </em>where this Court concluded that we could not determine whether the restitution amount was proper due to insufficient facts in the district court\u2019s order, the court\u2019s restitution calculation in the instant case described with particularity the out-of-pocket expenses for which restitution was being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b618 Appellant does not contend that the more than $96,000 she embezzled is not a pecuniary loss under \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA. Rather, her argument is \u201cthe fact that Montana\u2019s statute excludes general damages appears to militate against the inclusion in her restitution obligation of amounts above and beyond the total\u201d she stole from Employer (emphasis original). Appellant improperly characterizes Employer\u2019s out-of-pocket loss, which occurred as a result of her criminal activities, as general damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b619 Employer paid his employees, labor contractors, Shiloh Software, Anytime Lock, and an accounting firm in excess of $ 15,000 in an attempt to repair the damage Appellant caused through her theft. Such expenses directly resulting from Appellant\u2019s criminal activities are not general damages such as pain and suffering, and disfigurement, which are disallowed under the statute, but are special damages contemplated by the statute as pecuniary loss. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA (1997), Model Act, Comment to (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b620 In addition to the actual amount of money Appellant stole from Employer, these damages are recoverable by Employer in a civil action against Appellant as damages arising out of the facts or events constituting Appellant\u2019s criminal activities. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, allows for restitution for such losses \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d As a result, Appellant may assert any defense she would be entitled to assert in a civil action brought by the victim for compensation. See \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA, and Model Act, Comment to (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b621 Contrary to Appellant\u2019s argument, Montana\u2019s restitution statute does not confine district courts\u2019 restitution calculations to a figure by which a defendant enriches herself at her victim\u2019s expense but rather empowers them to impose restitution for a victim\u2019s pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>loss which, as defined by statute, includes out-of-pocket losses. The statute also provides for restitution to \u201cvictims of the offense who have suffered an <em>economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d </em>Section 46-18-241, MCA (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b622 Appellant claims \u201ccases from other jurisdictions appear to stand for the proposition that compensable losses incurred by crime victims must be confined to the damages actually and directly inflicted by the offender.\u201d Appellant cites numerous cases from other jurisdictions in an attempt to show that damages incurred as a result of the criminal act are not awarded in restitution cases. By way of contrast, the State cites still other jurisdictions holding that costs arising from the crime, such as those incurred by a victim for reconstructing his books due to the conduct of the defendant, are properly included in restitution as pecuniary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b623  We determine that it is unnecessary for this Court to rely on case law from other jurisdictions because Montana case law is sufficient to decide this issue. Employer paid accounting firms, employees, labor contractors, a software company, and a locksmith in an attempt to reconstruct his books and repair damage resulting from Appellant\u2019s criminal act. Those expenses are out-of-pocket losses within the intent of \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, and are therefore properly includable in the District Court\u2019s restitution calculation. We conclude the District Court did not exceed its statutory authority in requiring Appellant to pay restitution based upon out-of-pocket losses substantiated by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b624 As Appellant argues and the State concedes, wages paid to Appellant over the course of her employment by Employer do not constitute pecuniary loss to Employer, and are not recoverable in a civil action against Appellant. As a result, we hold that wages Employer paid to Appellant are not recoverable as restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">II. Did the trial court exceed statutory parameters by imposing interest upon Appellant\u2019s restitution obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b625 Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering her to pay 10% interest on her restitution obligation during the term of her six months confinement. She contends that if interest is allowed to accrue at all, it should be allowed only after she is released from confinement. Appellant also claims that interest on her restitution is <em>per se </em>an abuse of discretion insofar as it exceeds Employer\u2019s pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00b626 As we have stated above, the proper standard of review of a criminal sentence is for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). We have expressly overruled other decisions from this Court suggesting that we also review criminal sentences for an abuse of discretion. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b615.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b627 We note that the issue of whether interest may be properly applied to restitution under \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, is one of first impression for this Court. Interest is not expressly provided for by the restitution statute. However, the statute provides for restitution to a victim who has sustained pecuniary loss, \u201cincluding economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d Section 46-18-241, MCA (1997). Section 46-18-243, MCA, also includes in its definition of pecuniary loss, restitution for \u201call special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d Section 46-18-243, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b628 Employer could recover interest on Appellant\u2019s restitution in several ways. Because Employer lost the use of the $96,403.46 stolen by Appellant, as well as the more than $15,000 he paid to try to repair damage done to his financial records, Employer could recover interest as an \u201ceconomic loss as a result of a crime.\u201d Section 46-18-241, MCA. He could also recover interest on any amount awarded him in a civil action against Appellant arising out of Appellant\u2019s theft under \u00a7 27-1-210, MCA, which authorizes interest on torts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">(l)...in an action for recovery on an injury as defined in 27-1-106, a prevailing claimant is entitled to interest at a rate of 10% on any claim for damages awarded that are capable of being made certain by calculation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Section 27-1-210(1), MCA (1997). Because interest is a special damage, available to Employer in a civil action against Appellant, interest is properly applied to Appellant\u2019s restitution under \u00a7 -46-18-241, MCA. The interest is not allowed on damages such as pain and suffering, mental anguish or suffering, or punitive damages. Section 27-1-210(2), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b629 We take this opportunity to note that the Model Act used both as a directive in providing a standard for restitution in <em>Morgan </em>and by the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 46-18- 241, MCA, provides for \u201cinterest on the amount of pecuniary loss from the time of loss until payment is made.\u201d Model Act, (e)(3). This provision is intended to be included in restitution statutes in those states authorizing prejudgment interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>in civil cases. As the Comment to the model provision explains, \u201c[t]he rule regarding interest should be the same both in tort and for the purposes of restitution.\u201d See Model Act, Comment to (e)(3). However, while \u00a7 27-1-210, MCA, provides for interest on prevailing claims in civil cases, no corresponding provision for interest on restitution exists in \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b630 We invite the Legislature to rectify the current incongruity between \u00a7 27-1-210, MCA, which provides for prejudgment interest on civil tort claims and \u00a7 46-8-241, MCA, which does not expressly provide for interest on restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b631 Finally, we agree with the District Court that \u201c[Employer] is not in the lending business, and even if he were in the lending business, he would not make any such loans without attaching to it interest.\u201d As a result of Appellant\u2019s criminal activities, Employer lost the use of the amount of money stolen from him and will continue to do so until the money is repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b632  We now hold that interest is properly includable on restitution awards under \u00a7 46-18-421, MCA. The District Court\u2019s imposition of 10% interest on Appellant\u2019s restitution was within statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">III. Did the trial court follow the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, in determining Appellant\u2019s restitution amount?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b633 Appellant argues that the District Court did not consider her present ability to repay when it imposed interest on her restitution. The language of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, clearly instructs the sentencing court to contemplate only a defendant\u2019s <em>future ability </em>to pay restitution. See \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA (1997). Appellant also argues that in calculating the amount of her restitution obligation, the District Court did not properly consider her financial resources and future ability to repay such restitution. She further claims the District Court did not specify the amount, method, and time of each payment as required by \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA. That statute requires the sentencing court to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">(1).. .specify the amount, method, and time of each payment to the victim and may permit payment in installments. (2) In determining the amount, method, and time of each payment, the court shall consider the financial resources and future ability of the offender to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Section 46-18-244(1),(2), MCA. The court is also required under \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA, to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(1)...order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence investigation and report: ... documentation of the offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution.... [T]he court may receive evidence of the offender\u2019s ability to pay and the victim\u2019s loss at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b634 Appellant testified at her sentencing hearing that she had obtained two jobs at which she was working about 55 hours per week and was taking home about $1,200 per month after taxes. She explained that her husband\u2019s wages covered the couple\u2019s household expenses. As a result, Appellant testified that she intended to put all her wages toward restitution at the rate of at least $1000 per month. At the time of sentencing, Appellant had paid Employer nearly $6000. After considering the information in the presentence investigation and report, and the testimony presented at Appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Appellant to repay the above referenced amount of restitution, with a schedule of repayment to be arrived at between Appellant and her probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b635  We conclude that based on Appellant\u2019s own testimony at her sentencing hearing regarding her earning capacity, the payments she had already made to Employer, and her intent and ability to continue to make such payments, the District Court properly considered Appellant\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution for Employer\u2019s pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b636 Appellant also raises the claim that the District Court did not properly specify the amount, method, and time of each of her restitution payments to Employer. Appellant failed to first raise this argument in District Court and does not argue on appeal that the District Court\u2019s sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates on such grounds. Appellant\u2019s claim is therefore not properly before this Court, and we will not consider it on appeal. Sections 46-20-104(2), 701(2), MCA. <em>See State v. Goulet </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 308, 311-12, 921 P.2d 1245, 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">IV. Did the trial court err in refusing to rule upon Appellant\u2019s post-conviction motions in light of Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b637 This Court\u2019s order of August 12,1998, granting in part and denying in part Appellant\u2019s motion for supervisory control has rendered this portion of Appellant\u2019s claim moot. Therefore, we need not address this issue. <em>Turner v. Mountain Engineering and Const. Inc. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 55, 915 P.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u00b638  We conclude that the District Court erred in including as a part of Appellant\u2019s restitution, wages paid to her by Employer during the term of her employment, and reverse on that issue. We affirm the District Court on all other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b639 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-6\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
