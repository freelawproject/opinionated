Gillispie (Gillispie) was charged and convicted under Montana\u2019s order of protection violation statute, \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), in Missoula Municipal Court. Gillispie appealed the municipal court judgment and his conviction was affirmed by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. Gillispie appeals from the District Court\u2019s Order and Memorandum. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b62 Gillispie raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b63 (1) Did the Municipal Court have jurisdiction over Gillispie\u2019s order of protection violation based on third party contact?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u00b64 (2) Did Gillispie commit an order of protection violation pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), when he attempted to contact his former wife through a third person?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\u00b65 On October 20, 1993, the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, issued a permanent injunction, based on stalking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA (1993), which prohibited Gillispie from contacting his former wife, Bobette Gillispie (Bobette). The court\u2019s order of injunction stated that Bobette \u201cneeds permanent protection or may otherwise suffer permanent injury or harm and therefore the injunction should be effective permanently.\u201d Thus, the court ordered Gillispie to \u201cnot contact or attempt to contact Bobette Eilene Gillispie in person, in writing, or by a third person, except by telephone or correspondence through her attorney of record.\u201d Gillispie was served, on October 26, 1993, with the permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">\u00b66 On November 19, 1997, Gillispie called Mary Jane Stolp, Bobette\u2019s mother, in Missoula. Gillispie asked Mary Jane Stolp to give Bobette an offer from him; Gillispie wanted to know whether Bobette would accept payment of $10,000 in full satisfaction of a $50,000 judgment that Bobette had obtained against Gillispie for unpaid child support. Bobette\u2019s mother reported the third party contact to the Missoula Police Department. When Missoula authorities invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>gated the incident, Gillispie admitted that he had called Bobette\u2019s mother. Based on the admitted third party contact, Gillispie was charged with an order of protection violation pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), in Missoula Municipal Court on November 21, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"A_JS\">\u00b67 Gillispie appeared in Missoula Municipal Court on December 22, 1997, entered a plea of not guilty to the charge, and asked that the matter be set for a jury trial. On January 30,1998, Gillispie filed a motion to dismiss the charge, arguing that the district court injunction was no longer in effect on the date of the alleged third party contact. Gillispie\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied, on February 19,1998, by the Municipal Court. On April 9,1998, Gillispie waived his right to a jury trial and was tried before a municipal court judge, who convicted Gillispie of an order of protection violation under \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b68 On April 13,1998, Gillispie filed a notice of appeal from the municipal court judgment. On appeal, Gillispie argued that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because the permanent injunction was no longer in effect, and that the Municipal Court did not have jurisdiction over the alleged offense. On August 18, 1998, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s conviction and remanded the matter for imposition of sentence. Gillispie appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b69 (1) Did the Municipal Court have jurisdiction over Gillispie\u2019s order of protection violation based on third party contact?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b610 Gillispie\u2019s challenge to the Municipal Court\u2019s jurisdiction involves a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, \u00b6 74,293 Mont. 403, \u00b6 74, 977 P.2d 298, \u00b6 74 (citing <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00b611 A municipal court has geographic jurisdiction \u201ccoordinate and coextensive\u201d with the jurisdiction of justice courts located in the same county. Section 3-6-103(1), MCA (1997). The criminal jurisdiction of a justice court, and thus a municipal court, extends to misdemeanors \u201ccommitted within\u201d the county in which the court sits. Section 3-10-303, MCA (1997). An order of protection violation, first offense, is a misdemeanor within the subject matter jurisdiction of a municipal court. Sections 3-6-103(1), 3-10-303(1), and 45-5-626(3), MCAQ997).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u00b612 The offense at issue occurred in several counties, including Missoula County. Gillispie contends that since neither he nor Bobette were present in Missoula County at the time of the prohibited phone call, he could not have contacted Bobette either directly or indirectly in Missoula County. Therefore, Gillispie argues that the third party contact offense, having not been \u201ccommitted within\u201d Missoula County, rendered the Municipal Court without jurisdiction to adjudicate the order of protection violation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b6 13 Under the terms of the permanent injunction, Gillispie was prohibited from contacting or attempting to contact Bobette \u201cby a third person, except by telephone or correspondence through her attorney of record.\u201d The act constituting the offense in this case was Gillispie\u2019s attempt to contact Bobette through her mother, a third person. Importantly, Gillispie\u2019s phone call was <em>received </em>by Bobette\u2019s mother in Missoula. Thus, we agree with the State of Montana (the State) that the Municipal Court was vested with jurisdiction over Gillispie\u2019s order of protection violation when the necessary \u201cresult\u201d of Gillispie\u2019s actions, third party contact by telephone, was \u201ccommitted within\u201d Missoula County.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b614  In other words, the crime was <em>completed, </em>and thus \u201ccommitted within\u201d Missoula County. Section 3-10-303, MCA (1997). We hold that the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the order of protection violation by virtue of the fact that the criminal offense of third party contact was consummated when the phone call was received within Missoula County.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b6 15 (2) Did Gillispie commit an order of protection violation pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), when he attempted to contact his former wife through a third person?</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b616 In 1993, the Fourth Judicial District Court issued an order and permanent injunction, pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), based on Gillispie\u2019s stalking of his former wife, Bobette. Under subsection (7) of \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), a victim who qualified could petition the court for \u201cpermanent protection\u201d from the offender, and the court was authorized under appropriate circumstances to \u201corder that the injunction be effective permanently.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(7), MCA (1993). One ground for issuance of a permanent injunction, found in subsection (8) of the statute, was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of stalking by the offender and the victim\u2019s need for permanent protection. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(8), MCA (1993). The 1993 version of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, provided that a person commits the offense of violation of a protective order when that person, \u201cwith knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>order, purposely or knowingly violates a provision of <em>any order provided for in 40-4-121.\u201d </em>Section 45-5-626(1), MCA (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"Azo\">\u00b617 In 1997, Gillispie violated the permanent injunction\u2019s \u201cno contact\u201d through a third party provision when he called Bobette\u2019s mother, and was convicted of violation of a permanent order of protection under \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997). The 1997 version of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of violation of an order of protection if the person, with knowledge of the order, purposely or knowingly violates a provision of <em>any order provided for in 40-4-121 or an order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15. </em>It may be inferred that the defendant had knowledge of an order at the time of an offense if the defendant had been served with the order before the time of the offense. Service of the order is not required upon a showing that the defendant had knowledge of the order and its content. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Section 45-5-626(1), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b6 18 Gillispie openly concedes that he knowingly violated the terms of the 1993 permanent injunction. However, he takes the position that the District Court must be reversed and the charge against him dismissed because \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), does not make criminal a violation of the permanent injunction imposed upon him in 1993. Gillispie\u2019s challenge to the statutory scheme involves a question of law, particularly, the legislative intent underlying the recent amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-121 and 45-5-626, MCA. We review a question of law to determine whether the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b619 In 1995, the Montana Legislature generally revised the laws relating to domestic violence, changed the name of the offense from domestic abuse to partner or family member assault, and provided enhanced criminal penalties against offenders so as to provide broader protections to the victims of such offenses. <em>See generally </em>Act of Apr. 10, 1995, ch. 350,1995 Mont. Laws 1108. In part, the legislature amended \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), and deleted subsections (7) and (8) from the statute. In its place, the legislature enacted Title 40, Chapter 15, which provides generally for the safety and protection of all victims of partner and family member assault, sexual assault, and stalking. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-15-101 to 40-15-303, MCA. Title 40, Chapter 15 now provides authority for a court to order, under appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>stances, that an order of protection \u201cremain in effect permanently.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-15- 204(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b620 Since Title 40, Chapter 15 was not enacted until 1995, Gillispie asserts that the 1993 permanent injunction against him could not be \u201can order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15.\u201d Section 45-5-626(1), MCA (1997). Thus, according to Gillispie, the question becomes whether the 1993 order imposing the permanent injunction was an \u201corder provided for in 40-4-121\" in 1997 when the order of protection violation was alleged to have occurred. Section 45-5-626(1), MCA (1997). The answer, as Gillispie urges, is that the 1997 version of \u00a7 40-4- 121, MCA, provides only for temporary protective orders expiring in one year or less. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(4)-(7), MCA (1997). Therefore, Gillispie contends that because the Montana Legislature did not amend the plain language of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), to make criminal violations of permanent protective orders <em>formerly </em>provided for in \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), he cannot be convicted of an order of protection violation pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b621 The State responds that Gillispie\u2019s arguments constitute, in essence, a retroactivity claim. As the State argues, the 1995 amendments to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), did not retroactively repeal the 1993 permanent injunction because the Montana Legislature did not expressly declare in the 1995 amendments that it was repealing remedies available to domestic abuse victims in 1993. However, Gillispie vigorously disputes the State\u2019s position that he is effectively making a retroactivity claim, asserting instead that he is simply making a plain language argument. While Gillispie\u2019s claim can be analyzed under the guise of retroactivity, we determine that there is no need to do so. Thus, this Court will not address the State\u2019s retroactivity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"ACNV\">\u00b622 Rather, we choose to reject Gillispie\u2019s hyper-technical argument on its merits. As mentioned earlier, the District Court had the authority to issue the permanent injunction against Gillispie in 1993. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(7), (8), MCA (1993). Today, a court would be empowered pursuant to Title 40, Chapter 15 to issue a permanent order of protection. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-15-204(1), MCA. Thus, the question is whether the permanent injunction issued in 1993 pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), remained legally in effect until the date of Gillispie\u2019s \u201cno contact\u201d violation in 1997. We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the 1993 permanent order of protection continued to be effective on the date of the prohibited third party contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u00b623 First, the plain language of \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1997), refutes Gillispie\u2019s all-or-nothing approach to this issue. The amended version of the statue authorized a district court to grant the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqm\">(2) As a part of a motion for temporary maintenance, temporary support of a child, or a temporary family support order or by independent motion accompanied by affidavit, <em>either party may request the court to issue a temporary injunction for any of the following relief:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">(h) <em>providing additional relief available under Title 40, chapter 15. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Section 40-4-12 l(2)(h), MCA (1997); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(4), MCA (1997). By cross- referencing Title 40, Chapter 15, the Montana Legislature clearly intended to permit a court to make a temporary injunction issued under \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1997), a permanent protective order according to the requirements of Title 40, Chapter 15. Thus, while \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1997), primarily governs the issuance of temporary protective orders expiring in one year or less, the statute expressly incorporates by reference the authority of Title 40, Chapter 15 to issue permanent orders of protection. In short, \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1997), and Title 40, Chapter 15 are not mutually exclusive of one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b624 Second and more importantly, in 1997, the Montana Legislature again had occasion to further revise Montana\u2019s domestic violence laws. <em>See generally </em>Act of May 1,1997, ch. 484, 1997 Mont. Laws 2576. In particular, as the District Court correctly recognized, the legislature sought to clarify, retroactively, that an order or injunction issued under \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), prior to the 1995 amendments was to remain legally in effect according to the terms and conditions of the order or injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Section 2. Temporary order or temporary injunction \u2014 continuing effect. A temporary order or temporary injunction issued under 40-4-121 before October 1, 1995, <em>continues in full force and effect as provided in the order or injunction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">Section 12. Retroactive applicability. [Section 2] applies retroactively to October 1,1995. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Act of May 1, 1997, ch. 484, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 12, 1997 Mont. Laws 2576, 2578, 2583. October 1, 1995, was the effective date for the 1995 amendments to Montana\u2019s domestic violence laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00b625 This Court, in determining legislative intent, will construe criminal statutes \u201cwith a view to effect their object and to promote justice.\u201d <em>State v. Sunday </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 292, 299, 609 P.2d 1188, 1193 (citing <em>State v. Shannon </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 25, 28, 554 P.2d 743, 744). The object of the Montana Legislature\u2019s 1995 amendments to Montana\u2019s domestic violence laws, which included amending \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), and concomitantly enacting Title 40, Chapter 15, was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">move[] orders, currently called Temporary Restraining Orders, from a subsection currently located in a marriage and divorce statute [\u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993)] to their own section [Title 40, Chapter 15].... [V]ictim\u2019s protections shouldn\u2019t be in divorce statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApZ\"><em>Hearing on SB 278 Before the Senate Judiciary Comm., </em>54th Legis., 1st Reg. Sess. (Mont. 1995) (statement of Judy Wang, Assistant City Attorney, Chair Missoula Family Violence Council). It is clear that the legislature principally intended, in 1995, to grant broader protection to victims of partner and family member assault without regard to their relationship to the offender. To further that object, Title 40, Chapter 15 was enacted \u201cto promote the safety and protection of all victims of partner and family member assault, victims of sexual assault, and victims of stalking.\u201d Section 40-15-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b626 The goal of affording broader protection to victims of partner and family member assault must guide our resolution of Gillispie\u2019s claim. By broadening protections available to such victims in 1995, the Montana Legislature clearly did not intend to do away with any existing orders of protection already in place. Indeed, to emphasize that point, the 1997 amendments expressly declare that an order of protection issued prior to the effective date of the 1995 amendments is to remain legally in effect pursuant to the terms and conditions of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b627 While it might be claimed that the legislature intended \u201cSection 2\" of the 1997 amendments to apply only to a \u2019\u2019temporary\" but not to a permanent order of protection issued pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), we note that the 1993 version of the statute was captioned \u201c[t]emporary order or temporary injunction\u201d and yet provided authority to issue a permanent order of protection. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(7), (8), MCA (1993). This Court would achieve a patently absurd result were we to hold that a temporary order of protection issued pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), remains legally in effect under the 1997 retroactive amendments, but that a permanent order of protection does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>not. We refuse to reach such a formalistic construction. \u201cThe law respects form less than substance.\u201d Section 1-3-219, MCA. Victims of partner or family member assault, whether shielded from further harm by a temporary or a permanent order of protection, are entitled to the same degree of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b628  In light of the clear object of the 1995 amendments to strengthen protections for victims of partner and family member assault and the clarification in the 1997 amendments that an order of protection issued pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA (1993), prior to the effective date of the 1995 amendments is to remain legally in effect, we hold that the 1993 permanent order of protection against Gillispie remained legally in effect at the time of the third party contact incident in 1997 and, therefore, was enforceable against Gillispie according to its terms and conditions. When Gillispie committed third party contact in 1997, he clearly violated the \u201cno contact\u201d provision of the earlier injunctive order, which, according to its own terms, was to \u201cbe effective permanently\u201d so as to provide \u201cpermanent protection\u201d to Bobette. Therefore, Gillispie was properly charged and convicted of an order of protection violation pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA (1997), when he admittedly violated the terms of the 1993 permanent order of protection. The remainder of Gillispie\u2019s contentions are without merit, and we will not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
