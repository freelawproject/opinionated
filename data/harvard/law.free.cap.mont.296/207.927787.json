Plaintiffs alleged, among other claims, that to the extent \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995) allows discharges of water from watering well or monitoring well tests, which degrade high quality waters without review pursuant to Montana\u2019s nondegradation policy found at \u00a7 75-5-303(3), MCA (1995), that statute is void for a violation of Article IX, Section 1(1) and (3) of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs sought an injunction suspending the exploration license that had been issued by DEQ to SPJV for pump tests to be performed at the site of its proposed gold mine. Both parties moved for summary judgment and following the submission of affidavits and oral testimony, the District Court held that absent a finding of actual injury, \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995) was not unconstitutional as applied and entered judgment for the DEQ. The Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the District Court. We reverse and remand for further review consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the Plaintiffs have demonstrated standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), and, if so, whether the statute implicates either Article II, Section 3 or Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b63 The following facts are taken from those allegations in the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and amended complaint which are uncontroverted by DEQ\u2019s answer and from testimony and exhibits offered in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b64 MEIC is a nonprofit organization, whose members live primarily in Montana and are actively involved in issues related to the protection and enhancement of water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. The Clark Fork-Pend Oreille Coalition is a nonprofit corporation whose members reside primarily in the Clark Fork drainage of Montana and Idaho and who, for the past ten years, have worked to improve water quality in the Clark Fork drainage. Women\u2019s Voice for the Earth is also a nonprofit organization based in Missoula, Montana and is dedicated to protecting biological diversity in the northern Rockies. Members of all three organizations, float, fish, hunt, and view wildlife on the Blackfoot River and on public and private lands adjoining the Blackfoot River. Furthermore, the Blackfoot River is a major tributary to the Clark Fork River.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b65 The Defendant, Montana Department of Environmental Quality is the State agency in charge of protecting water quality and issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>permits to hard rock mines. In doing so, it is obligated to comply with the Montana Environmental Policy Act, \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-101, et seq., MCA, the Montana Water Quality Act, \u00a7\u00a7 75-5-301, et seq., MCA, and the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\u00b66 Seven-Up Pete Joint Venture has submitted an application for a massive open-pit gold mine in the upper Blackfoot River valley, near the confluence of the Landers Fork and Blackfoot Rivers. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that in the summer of 1995, DEQ illegally amended SPJV\u2019s mineral exploration license to allow for the discharge of groundwater containing high levels of arsenic and zinc into the shallow aquifers of the Blackfoot and Landers Fork Rivers, without requiring nondegradation review pursuant to \u00a7 75-5-303(3), MCA (1995), and to the extent that it was authorized to do so, pursuant to \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), the latter statute violates the right to a clean and healthy environment guaranteed by Article II, Section 3 of Montana\u2019s Constitution, and the clear nondegradation policy established by Article IX, Section 1 of Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b67 The Blackfoot River provides habitat for many different species of fish and wildlife, including important habitat for the imperiled Bull Trout, a species which qualifies for listing as an endangered species pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531, et seq. The Landers Fork River is an important tributary of the Blackfoot in terms of both water flow and fish habitat. In particular, it provides critical spawning and rearing habitat for Bull Trout.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b68 In 1992 SPJV applied for an exploration license pursuant to the Metal Mine Reclamation Act, \u00a7\u00a7 82-4-301, et seq., MCA, and was issued exploration license No. 00497, which authorized it to collect geophysical information and generally explore the mineral formations associated with the proposed mine. However, on June 2, 1995, SPJV submitted a new work plan which included extended pumping of underground water at the proposed mine site and sought approval for the pumping pursuant to its exploration license. The pumping is apparently intended to provide data necessary to determine the long-term response to dewatering at the McDonald Gold Mine Project. Pursuant to the proposal, groundwater was to be pumped from the bedrock aquifer and discharged into two infiltration galleries-one located in the Blackfoot River alluvium and one located in the Landers Fork River alluvium.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b69 Although SPJV\u2019s application to amend its exploration license was initially approved, DEQ later realized that the water to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>pumped from the bedrock and discharged into the Blackfoot and Landers Fork alluvia, contained concentrations of some constituents including arsenic at greater concentrations than existed in the receiving water. Therefore, the initial approval was rescinded until SPJV proposed and DEQ agreed that areas in the Blackfoot and Landers Fork alluvia could serve as mixing zones for the discharged water in order to bring the discharges into compliance with State law. A groundwater mixing zone is a portion of the aquifer receiving a discharge where water quality standards may be exceeded in order to allow mixing with the receiving water to occur. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-5-103(18), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b610 Formal authorization for the proposed discharges into the Blackfoot and Landers Fork alluvia was issued by DEQ on August 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b6 11 Officials at DEQ determined that the mixing zone in the Blackfoot alluvial aquifer could extend 5000 feet down gradient from the Blackfoot infiltration gallery and the mixing zone in the Landers Fork alluvial aquifer could extend 4000 feet down gradient from the Landers Fork infiltration gallery. They estimated that arsenic would be diluted to meet water quality standards by the time the discharge had gone 2000 feet from the Blackfoot infiltration gallery and 1500 feet from the Landers Fork infiltration gallery.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b612 DEQ determined that water from the Blackfoot mixing zone would not enter the surface water of the Blackfoot River but that water from the Landers Fork mixing zone would discharge to the surface waters of that river. However, DEQ concluded that all chemical constituents in the groundwater would be diluted below applicable water quality standards prior to discharge to the Landers Fork surface waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b613 The background level of arsenic in the groundwater of the Blackfoot and Landers Fork alluvium in the vicinity of the well test discharges is no more than .003 milligrams per liter (mg/1). The expected level of arsenic in the water at the wellhead from the three water wells tested in 1995, was expected to be .018 mg/1 for well No. 4, .055 mg/1 for well No. 5, and .036 mg/1 for well No. 6. Water wells Nos. 4 and 5 discharged to the Blackfoot infiltration gallery and water well No. 6 to the Landers Fork infiltration gallery.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b614 The actual levels of arsenic at the wellhead for wells tested in 1995 ranged from .016 to .025 mg/1 for well No. 4; .035 to .056 mg/1 for well No. 5; and .024 to .039 mg/1 for well No. 6. The actual level of ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>senic reaching the Blackfoot infiltration gallery during the 1995 test ranged from .015 to .020 mg/1 and the actual level of arsenic reaching the Landers Fork gallery ranged from .018 to .020 mg/1 due to chemical changes caused by the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b615 The 1995 well tests involved the pumping and discharge of 740 gallons of underground water per minute to the Blackfoot alluvium and 240 gallons of underground water per minute to the Landers Fork alluvium. The duration of the tests was four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b616 However, samples taken during and after the 1995 well tests from monitoring wells located at a point approximately 4000 feet down gradient from the infiltration galleries, showed no change in the Blackfoot, and no significant change in the Landers Fork alluvia, from the background level of arsenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b617 Plaintiffs brought this action on October 6, 1995, and alleged that they have been damaged by the discharge of polluted water to the Blackfoot and Landers Fork Rivers. They sought a writ of mandamus compelling DEQ to comply with various statutory procedures prior to amendment of the exploration license. In particular, Plaintiffs sought an order requiring SPJV to comply with the nondegradation requirements found at \u00a7 75-5-303(3), MCA, and to the extent that they were not required to do so, based on the waiver found at \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA, (1995), Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the latter statute was unconstitutional and an injunction ordering DEQ to suspend amended exploration license No. 00497.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b618 In support of their complaint, Plaintiffs offered testimony from Dan L. Fraser, a registered professional engineer, and environmental consultant who worked for the Water Quality Bureau of the Montana State Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (DHES) from 1976 to 1993 and who was the bureau chief from 1990 to 1993. DHES was the state agency which administered Montana\u2019s Water Quality Act before that responsibility was given to DEQ. Fraser testified that the Montana numeric water quality standard for protection of health from arsenic is .018 milligrams per liter (mg/1) but that based on his review of data submitted by SPJV to DEQ in support of its application for permission to conduct pumping tests, water with higher levels of arsenic would be discharged to the Blackfoot and Landers Fork alluvia during pumping. He testified that arsenic is a carcinogen which causes skin cancer to humans and that the EPA has found evidence of an association between internal cancer and arsenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u00b619 Fraser acknowledged that in 1995 the Water Quality Act (\u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA) was amended to deem certain activities including water well and monitoring well tests \u201cnonsignificant\u201d and allow them to proceed without the form of review which would otherwise be required for degradation of the State\u2019s waters. However, it was his opinion that the discharges proposed by SPJV were not \u201cnonsignificant\u201d in reality and that the permit issued by DEQ did not take into account public health risks associated with the discharge of arsenic. It was his opinion that any increase of arsenic content in drinking water is likely to cause an increase in the risk of cancer to those who consume it.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b620 James Volberding is the senior project geologist for SPJV and has a degree in geological engineering. He is responsible for supervising the hydrologic studies connected to the proposed McDonald Gold Mine Project. Those studies include the well pump tests at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b621 Volberding explained that construction of the mine will require the groundwater levels in the vicinity of the mine to be temporarily lowered by a system of wells which will provide water for the mining operations and prevent flooding of the mine workings. The three wells involved in the current tests were constructed in 1993 to provide the necessary data by a series of pump tests regarding the chemistry and volume of water in the groundwater systems. Pumping from the three wells commenced on July 26,27, and 28,1995, and by October 11, monitoring data was available regarding the water being pumped and the effect that it had on the surface of the two rivers. He explained that the arsenic load of the discharged water was less than had been expected and while acknowledging that it exceeded the level of the receiving water at the point of discharge, testified that it will be close to nondetectable below the mixing zone of the Landers Fork alluvium and will contain .005 mg/1 of arsenic immediately below the mixing zone for the Blackfoot River alluvium compared to .003 mg/1 of arsenic for the receiving water. He testified that arsenic concentrations in other Montana waters used for drinking by individuals are higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b622 Joe Gurrieri is a hydrologist with the Reclamation Division of the Hard Rock Bureau of the DEQ. It is his responsibility, in that capacity, to review mining plans as they relate to hydrology. In that capacity he was familiar with the facts that pertained to SPJV\u2019s pump tests. Based on the data provided by SPJV he concluded that there was no beneficial use of water which would be interfered with by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>proposed mixing zones and that neither the biological resources of the Blackfoot River nor recreational use of the river would be affected. He determined that by the end ofthe mixing zones, all constituents ofthe pumped water, including arsenic, would be below human health standards and would not present a problem in terms of toxicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b623 Gurrieri calculated that the concentration of arsenic at a point 3000 feet down gradient from the Landers Fork infiltration gallery would be .008 mg/1 and that the arsenic concentration 5000 feet down gradient from the Blackfoot infiltration gallery would be .009 mg/1. These concentrations are lower than the standards for groundwater or surface water but greater than the concentrations in the receiving water.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b624 Geoffrey Beale, a hydrologist employed by SPJV also agreed that the water pumped from underground had higher concentrations of arsenic than the water into which it would be received, but testified that at some point downstream from the point of discharge the arsenic level will be diluted sufficiently, that it will not affect the arsenic level of the background water.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b625 In support of their motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs contended that pursuant Article II, Section 3 and Article IX, Section 1 ofthe Montana Constitution and \u00a7 75-5-303(3), MCA (1995), the State may not allow degradation of high quality waters without making the necessary showings required by the degradation review process set forth in the statute; that \u201cdegradation\u201d includes increasing the concentration of arsenic in high quality waters; (both parties agree the waters in question are \u201chigh quality\u201d waters) and that to the extent that water well tests are arbitrarily excluded from review, pursuant to \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), that statute offends Montana\u2019s constitution and the government must demonstrate both a compelling state interest for doing so, that the waiver provided for is closely tailored to effectuate only that interest and that it is the least onerous path available.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b626 In opposition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in support of DEQ\u2019s motion, DEQ and SPJV pointed out that at a short distance from the points of discharge there were no changes from background levels of arsenic, that therefore, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated violation of their right to a clean and healthful environment, and for that reason, strict scrutiny of the blanket waivers provided for by \u00a7 75-5-317, MCA (1995) is not required. Furthermore, they alleged that for Plaintiffs to have standing to challenge \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>75-5-317, MCA, they must demonstrate injury in fact and they have not done so because they have failed to demonstrate that either their health or the environmental health has been harmed by the discharges in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b627 In reply, Plaintiffs pointed out that Rule 16.20.712(l)(b), ARM (now Rule 17.30.715(l)(b), ARM), classifies any discharge of carcinogens in excess of those levels present in the background water as significant and that therefore, they have demonstrated all the harm necessary to establish standing and to require strict scrutiny of the statute which provides blanket exemption for that type of discharge from nondegradation review. In essence, Plaintiffs argued that \u00a7 75-5-317, MCA, which does not permit consideration of how a discharge might degrade water quality, cannot be said to meet the constitutional requirement for maintaining our current quality of environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b628 The District Court held that Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution does provide a fundamental right to a clean and healthy environment, and that parties such as the Plaintiffs are entitled to bring a direct action in court to enforce that right. The District Court interpreted the Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to \u00a7 75-5-317, MCA (1995) as an \u201capplied\u201d challenge based on the fact that Plaintiffs do not contend the statute is unconstitutional in all conceivable applications. However, the District Court held that before strict scrutiny applies, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that a right guaranteed by the constitution has been abridged and that in this case they did not do so because:</p>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">\u00b629 1. There is no proof that discharges from the mixing zones (as opposed to discharges from the ground) exceeded water quality standards;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b630 2. Plaintiffs have demonstrated no significant changes to the quality of water on either the surfaces of the Landers Fork or Blackfoot Rivers;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b631 3. Before a constitutional violation can be shown, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the waters of the Blackfoot and Landers Fork are so affected that public health is threatened or applicable water quality standards are violated to the extent that there is a significant impact on either river. Absent a finding of actual injury, as defined, \u00a7 75-5-317, MCA, is not unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\u00b632 In an order denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an order temporarily restraining further pumping tests, the District Court noted the following factual findings which formed the basis for its conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00b633 1. The existing level of arsenic in the Landers Fork River is .0015 mg/1. The State expected the arsenic in the well water which was to be discharged into the infiltration gallery to be at a level of. 014 mg/1 and be reduced to .006 mg/1 by the end of the mixing zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b634 2. SPJV, however, concluded that the level of arsenic discharged into the infiltration galleries is .009 mg/1, far below the standard for aquatic life and the human health standard and that there will be no detectable change in the ambient level of arsenic in water 50 feet downstream from the point of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b635 3. Based on these figures, there is no evidence of threat to public health, no violation of water quality standards, and no significant impact on the Landers Fork River or the Blackfoot River.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b636 The District Court originally held, however, that based upon the affidavit of Dan Fraser there was an issue of fact which could not be resolved by summary judgment. The Plaintiffs later asked the Court to either reconsider its order based on the amount of arsenic at the point of discharge or enter a final order based on the facts which the court currently assumed to be true. The District Court did so; it denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, granted the DEQ\u2019s motion and dismissed the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b637 On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that when the legislature amended the Water Quality Act, by enacting \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), to exclude certain activities from review pursuant to the act\u2019s nondegradation policy, the blanket exclusion is unconstitutional when the facts show, as they did here, that degradation will occur. Plaintiffs contend that because Montanans have a fundamental right to a clean and healthful environment pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution, the provisions of the amendment must be strictly scrutinized for not only a compelling state interest, but also to assure that the amendment is closely tailored to effectuate the government\u2019s interest by the least onerous path available and that the District Court erred by refusing to apply strict scrutiny absent a demonstration of risk to human or environmental health because Montana\u2019s Constitution, in particular, Article IX, Section 1, is intended to prevent pollution before it occurs. Plaintiffs contend that all they needed to demonstrate was that the concentration of arsenic, a known carcinogen, as it came out of the well, was greater than the carcinogen in the receiving water because the State has already determined pursuant to Rule 17.30.715(l)(b), ARM that discharges of that nature are significant enough to require nondegradation review pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>suant to \u00a7 75-5-303, MCA. Plaintiffs request that this Court remand to the District Court for a determination of whether exemption from nondegradation review is constitutional. However, they do not suggest that nondegradation review satisfies the constitutional requirement of a clean and healthful environment under all circumstances. They simply contend that it is the minimum that is required as applied to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b638 The DEQ and SPJV respond that because the District Court correctly found that arsenic levels returned to ambient standards within 50 feet from the point of discharge of the well water, Plaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proving they are threatened with injury by the enactment of \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA, and therefore, have no standing to challenge the statute. They also contend that the constitutional provisions in question were not intended to prohibit all discharges of water which include arsenic but only those which render the receiving water unclean or unhealthy and that neither condition was proven in this case. Finally, the Respondents contend that \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA, did not waive nondegradation review for discharges deemed significant by Rule 17.30.715, ARM, but that it simply codified those categories already deemed nonsignificant by Rule 17.30.716, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\n<em>ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b639 The issue on appeal is whether the Plaintiffs have demonstrated standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), and, if so, whether the statute implicates either Article II, Section 3 or Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b640 The District Court held that based on the facts presented to it, Plaintiffs had not established that \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), violates Montana\u2019s Constitution. We review a district court\u2019s constitutional conclusions as we do other issues of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Wadsworth v.

Those rights would normally be subject to a middle-tier of scrutiny because lodged elsewhere in our state constitution. However, we conclude that the right to a clean and healthful environment guaranteed by Article II, Section 3, and those rights provided for in Article IX, Section 1 were intended by the constitution\u2019s framers to be interrelated and interdependent and that state or private action which implicates either, must be scrutinized consistently. Therefore, we will apply strict scrutiny to state or private action which implicates either constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b665 A thorough review of the discussion and debate among the delegates to our 1972 Constitutional Convention leads us to the further conclusion that the nature of the environmental rights provided by Articles II and IX cannot be interpreted separately, but that it was the delegates\u2019 intention that the two provisions compliment each other and be applied in tandem. Therefore, we look to the records of the convention discussion and debate to determine the showing that must be made before the rights are implicated and strict scrutiny applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00b666 Article IX, Section 1 was reported to the floor of the constitutional convention by the Natural Resources and Agricultural Committee on March 1,1972. <em>Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. IV at 1198-99.

Delegate Eck concurred that including the additional language in Article II, Section 3, was consistent with the intention of the Natural Resources Committee when it reported Article IX, Section 1. <em>Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. V at 1638, March 7,1972. The right to a clean and healthy environment was, therefore, included as a fundamental right by a vote of 79 to 7. <em>Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. V at 1640, March 7, 1972. We have previously cited with approval the following language from 16 C.J.S. <em>Constitutional Laws </em>\u00a7 16 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">The prime effort or fundamental purpose, in construing a constitutional provision, is to ascertain and to give effect to the intent of the framers and of the people who adopted it. The court, therefore, should constantly keep in mind the object sought to be accomplished ... and proper regard should be given to the evils, if any, sought to be prevented or remedied ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>General Agric. Corp. v. Moore </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 510, 518, 534 P.2d 859, 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b677 We conclude, based on the eloquent record of the Montana Constitutional Convention that to give effect to the rights guaranteed by Article II, Section 3 and Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution they must be read together and consideration given to all of the provisions of Article IX, Section 1 as well as the preamble to the Montana Constitution. In doing so, we conclude that the delegates\u2019 intention was to provide language and protections which are both anticipatory and preventative. The delegates did not intend to merely prohibit that degree of environmental degradation which can be conclusively linked to ill health or physical endangerment. Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state\u2019s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked. The delegates repeatedly emphasized that the rights provided for in subparagraph (1) of Article IX, Section 1 was linked to the legislature\u2019s obligation in subparagraph (3) to provide adequate remedies for degradation of the environmental life support system and to prevent unreasonable degradation of natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b678  We conclude, therefore, that the District Court erred when it held that Montana\u2019s constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment was not implicated, absent a demonstration that public health is threatened or that current water quality standards are af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fected to such an extent that a significant impact has been had on either the Landers Fork or Blackfoot River.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">\u00b679 We conclude that the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment and to be free from unreasonable degradation of that environment is implicated based on the Plaintiffs\u2019 demonstration that the pumping tests proposed by SPJV would have added a known carcinogen such as arsenic to the environment in concentrations greater than the concentrations present in the receiving water and that the DEQ or its predecessor after studying the issue and conducting hearings has concluded that discharges containing carcinogenic parameters greater than the concentrations of those parameters in the receiving water has a significant impact which requires review pursuant to Montana\u2019s policy of nondegradation set forth at \u00a7 75-5-303, MCA. The fact that DEQ has a rule consistent with \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), is of no consequence. As we have previously held in <em>Wadsworth, </em>the constitution applies to agency rules as well as to statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b680  We conclude that for purposes of the facts presented in this case, \u00a7 75-5-303, MCA is a reasonable legislative implementation of the mandate provided for in Article IX, Section 1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that to the extent \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995) arbitrarily excludes certain \u201cactivities\u201d from nondegradation review without regard to the nature or volume of the substances being discharged, it violates those environmental rights guaranteed by Article II, Section 3 and Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution. Our holding is limited to \u00a7 75-5-317(2)0), MCA (1995), as applied to the facts in this case. We have not been asked to and do not hold that this section facially implicates constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b681 Based on these holdings, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand to the District Court for strict scrutiny of the statutory provision in question, and in particular for a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of whether there is a compelling state interest for the enactment of that statute based on the criteria we articulated in <em>Wadsworth v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b682 The judgment of the District Court is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"A3h\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. In fact, the delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention were very much aware of legislation passed during the previous year, such as requirements for nondegradation review and indicated that they felt that legislation was consistent with their own efforts to engraft environmental protection to Montana\u2019s Constitution. <em>See </em>Delegate Loendorf cmts. <em>(Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. IV at 1207, March 1, 1972); Delegate Swanberg cmts. <em>(Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. V at 1238-39, March 7, 1972); and Delegate Campbell cmts. <em>(Montana Constitutional Convention, </em>Vol. V at 1246, March 7, 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b256-5\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b683 I concur in the result reached by the Court and specifically with the conclusion that the right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Declaration of Rights found at Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution. Having so concluded, the Court goes on to declare that \u201cstate or private action which implicates either [Article II, Section 3 or Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution], must be scrutinized consistently. Therefore, we will apply strict scrutiny to state or private action which implicates either constitutional provision.\u201d I agree that state action implicating the rights guaranteed by Article II, Section 3 or Article IX, Section 1, must be subject to strict scrutiny. Although Article IX, Section 1, clearly imposes an obligation on private entities, as well as the state, to maintain and improve a clean and healthy environment, I would not, in the context of this appeal, address the question of private action. In resolving this appeal, we are not addressing private action. Rather, we are addressing state action; that is, the constitutionality of a state statute. The conclusion that we will apply strict scrutiny analysis to private action is dicta which, I submit, may well prove unworkable in the future. As we state in this opinion, strict scrutiny analysis requires that the state demonstrate a compelling state interest and that its action is both closely tailored to effectuate that interest and the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve the State\u2019s objective. I am not clear as to how, or whether, private action lends itself to a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d analysis. That is a question that I think would be better left to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b684 Finally, the Court concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">to the extent \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), arbitrarily excludes certain \u201cactivities\u201d from nondegradation review without regard to the nature or volume of the substances being discharged, it violates those environmental rights guaranteed by Article II, Section 3 and Article IX, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution. Our holding is limited to \u00a7 75-5-317(2)Cj), MCA (1995), as applied to the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>this case. We have not been asked to and do not hold that this section facially implicates constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">\u00b685 I do not see how the Court can logically avoid declaring that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. The constitutional infirmity of \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), is not limited to the facts in the present case but inheres in the statute\u2019s creation of a blanket exception. It creates a blanket exception to the requirements of nondegradation review for discharges from water well or monitoring well tests without regard to the harm caused by those tests or the degrading effect that the discharges have on the surrounding or recipient environment. The fact that there may be water discharges from well tests, say for agricultural purposes, that do not in fact create harm to the environment, does not alter the fact that such discharges are exempted from nondegradation review and that such review is the tool by which the State implements and enforces the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment. The facial unconstitutionality of \u00a7 75-5-317(2)(j), MCA (1995), lies in its exemption of particular water discharges from nondegradation review without consideration of the nature and volume of substances in the water that is discharged. The possibility that some water discharges will not harm the environment does not justify their exemption from careful review by the State to protect Montana\u2019s fundamental rights to a clean and healthy environment and to be free from unreasonable degradation of that environment. The whole purpose of the nondegradation review is to determine, in advance, whether a water discharge will be harmful and, if so, is the harm justified and can it be minimized. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-5-303, MCA. In excluding water discharges from well tests from review, the statute makes it impossible for the State to \u201cprevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural resources\u201d as required by Article IX, Section 1(3), of the Montana Constitution.
