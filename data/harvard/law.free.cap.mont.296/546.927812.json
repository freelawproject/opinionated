By Amended Information on March 13,1998, Berg was also charged with sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Berg pled not guilty to both offenses. Subsequently, a jury found Berg guilty of the offense of attempted sexual assault without consent. Berg appeals from the District Court\u2019s exclusion of his witnesses pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, for failure to disclose them and from the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant him a new trial based upon ineffective assistance of his counsel. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">\u00b63 1. Does \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, as applied in this case, violate Berg\u2019s right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when, as a sanction for failure to previously disclose witnesses, it precluded Berg from calling those witnesses at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it found that Berg was not prej - udiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, was not entitled to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">\u00b66 On September 2,1997, Dennis Berg was charged by Information with the felony offense of attempted sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103 and 45- 5-503, MCA. On September 9, 1997, Berg pled not guilty to the offense. The State\u2019s Information included a list of its potential witnesses known at that time. The District Court held an Omnibus Hearing on October 14,1997, at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>time, the District Court granted Berg an additional 60 days to disclose his witness list.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b67 On March 13, 1998, three months after the date the District Court ordered Berg to provide his witness list, Berg filed his witness list with the District Court. Berg\u2019s witness list included the names of eight possible witnesses and included the language that \u201call witnesses named herein, including those previously endorsed on the Information ... shall testify as fact witnesses and as character witnesses ....\u201d On March 13,1998, the State filed a motion to exclude Berg\u2019s witnesses based on the untimely disclosure of his witness list. The State also amended the Information to incl\u00fcde the offense of sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b68 On March 18,1998, the District Court held a hearing to consider the State\u2019s motion to exclude Berg\u2019s witnesses. At the hearing, Berg\u2019s counsel assured the court that he only intended to call Mr. and Mrs. Kucera and Ms. Dirkson as impeachment witnesses. The District Court denied the State\u2019s motion based on Defendant\u2019s representations that he would only be calling the three impeachment witnesses. The court reserved the right to rule on any objections to Berg\u2019s other listed witnesses at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u00b69 A jury trial was held on March 25 and 26,1998. After the State presented its evidence, Berg began his defense. Mark Kucera and Gina Dirkson were called as impeachment witnesses and testified for the defense. Counsel for Berg then attempted to call Jim Johnson as a defense witness. The State immediately objected to Jim Johnson as a witness, based on the untimely disclosure of Berg\u2019s witness list and Thompson\u2019s representations at the hearing on the State\u2019s motion to exclude Berg\u2019s witnesses. The District Court sustained the State\u2019s objection to Jim Johnson\u2019s testimony, based upon the fact that the witness had not been disclosed within 60 days pursuant to the Court\u2019s Omnibus Order and the witness was not mentioned by Thompson as a witness he intended to call at trial, during the hearing held on March 18, 1998. The District Court additionally held that the other three witnesses that Berg intended to call, Ronald Charlton, Connie Berg, and Ricky Charbonneau would not be allowed to testify for the same reasons. As a result, Berg presented no additional evidence. The jury found Berg guilty of attempted sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u00b610 On April 27,1998, Berg filed a pro se motion requesting that his counsel be excused, and for a new trial on the basis that he received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel and that the court improperly prohibited his witnesses from testifying. In May 1998, Berg retained new counsel. On June 16,1998, the District Court held a hearing on Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial. Berg\u2019s prior counsel testified at the hearing and explained to the court the reasons for his discovery noncompliance and informed the court what the witnesses he had wanted to call would have said. The District Court concluded that Thompson\u2019s failure to file a timely witness list, as required by Montana\u2019s discovery statutes, was ineffective. However, the District Court found that Berg failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance and denied Berg a new trial on that basis. The District Court also rejected Berg\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a new trial because the court improperly excluded his witnesses. Berg appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying him a new trial and from the District Court\u2019s exclusion order.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u00b6 11 We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Haskins </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 202, 207, 887 P.2d 1189, 1192. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. <em>Bone v. State </em>(1997) 284 Mont. 293, 303, 944 P.2d 734, 740. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Swan </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 483, 487, 928 P.2d 933, 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\u00b612 Does \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, as applied in this case, violate Berg\u2019s right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\u00b613 Berg contends that \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, violates both the United States and Montana Constitutions because it denies a defendant his right to defend and call witnesses on his behalf. Section 46-15-329, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">If at any time during the course of the proceeding it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with any of the provisions of this part or any order issued pursuant to this part, the court may impose any sanction that it finds just under the circumstances, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">(1) ordering disclosure of the information not previously disclosed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>(2) granting a continuance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">(3) holding a witness, party, or counsel in contempt for an intentional violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">(4) <em>precluding a party from calling a witness, </em>offering evidence, or raising a defense not disclosed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">(5) declaring a mistrial when necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u00b614 The State points out that Berg failed to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, in the District Court. Accordingly, the State concludes that Berg has waived this argument on appeal. In response, Berg cites <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713, as authority for this Court to consider his argument based on plain error. In <em>Weaver </em>we held that this Court may discretionarily review claimed errors which implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even when no contemporaneous objection is made, if failing to review the claimed error may: (1) result in a manifest miscarriage of justice; (2) leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings; or (3) compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Weaver, </em>f 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">\u00b615 It is our policy that we will use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly on a case-by-case basis. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 25. We conclude that Berg\u2019s constitutional claim regarding \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA, does not satisfy any of the criteria set forth in <em>Weaver </em>Consequently, we decline to invoke the common law doctrine of plain error and conclude that Berg has waived the right to have this Court consider his claim regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when, as a sanction for failure to previously disclose witnesses, it precluded Berg from calling those witnesses at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">\u00b617 Berg asserts that because the purpose for Montana\u2019s pretrial discovery statutes is to ensure that neither side is taken by unfair surprise, and the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Berg\u2019s witnesses did not further that purpose, it was an abuse of discretion. Berg contends that there would have been no surprise to the State if he had called a witness that the State had endorsed as its own witness. Berg points out that in the State\u2019s Information dated September 2,1997 and the State\u2019s Amended Information dated March 13,1998, the State named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the same witnesses that Berg intended to call. Thus, the State had knowledge of the identity of the witnesses Berg intended to call at least six months\u2019 prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b618 The State contends that Berg violated \u00a7 46-15-323, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">(6) Within 30 days after the arraignment or at a later time as the court may for good cause permit, the defendant shall make available to the prosecutor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">(a) the names, addresses, and statements of all persons, other than the defendant, whom the defendant may call as witnesses in the defense case in chief....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The State argues that because of Berg\u2019s violation of \u00a7 46-15-323(6)(a), MCA, the District Court was warranted in sanctioning Berg pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\u00b619 The purpose of Montana\u2019s discovery scheme is to enhance the search for truth. <em>State v. Waters </em>(1987) 228 Mont. 490, 495, 743 P.2d 617, 620. In addition, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">Consistent with th[at] goal, Section 46-15-329, MCA, provides a means of enforcing discovery orders. It endows the district courts with the flexibility to impose sanctions commensurate with the failure to comply with discovery orders. The statute does not mandate automatic exclusion for noncompliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">By its terms, Section 46-15-329 provides that \u201cthe court may impose any sanction that it finds just under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">Such discretion allows the court to consider the reason why disclosure was not made, whether the noncompliance was willful, the amount of prejudice to the opposing party, and any other relevant circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\"><em>Waters, </em>228 Mont. at 495, 743 P.2d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">\u00b620 In this case, the District Court ruled on the exclusion of Berg\u2019s proffered witnesses during the trial and thus made no explicit findings as to the reasons for the severity of the sanction imposed against Berg. However, in its order denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial the District Court responded to Berg\u2019s assertion that the District Court erred when it excluded his fact witnesses as a sanction for his failure to previously disclose them. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">It is alleged by previous counsel for the defendant that no witness list needed to be provided, as such witnesses were listed on the Information filed. The Court finds that the individuals contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the Information do not constitute a witness list provided by the defendant within the meaning of Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 46-15-323(6).... The purpose of requiring the defendant to provide a witness list is to prevent surprise at trial. To allow the defendant to never present a witness list to the State and then call witnesses at trial just because such are named in the Information would be contrary to this purpose and in contravention of the statute cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQA\">\u00b621  We agree with the District Court that Berg\u2019s witness list was untimely. Nevertheless, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s imposition of the harshest sanction available in this case, the exclusion of Berg\u2019s witnesses, was an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion. Our review of the record indicates that Berg\u2019s failure to timely disclose witnesses was not willful and that the State would not have been unduly prejudiced or surprised by Berg\u2019s noncompliance, since the proffered witnesses were known to the State. We agree with the District Court that a sanction was appropriate, however we conclude that under these circumstances, a less severe sanction should have been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b622 Berg asserts that because the District Court erred by excluding his witnesses, this Court should remand this cause for a new trial. However, \u00a7 46-20-701( 1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>See State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">\u00b623 An extensive review of both the trial transcript and the transcript of the hearing on Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial reveals that the exclusion of Berg\u2019s witnesses was not prejudicial. At the hearing on Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial, Berg\u2019s previous counsel testified that he believed Jim Johnson and Ronald Charlton to be the key witnesses in Berg\u2019s defense. He further testified that the substance of both Jim Johnson and Ronald Charlton\u2019s testimony would have been that they were both present at the house where the alleged incident took place, and that they did not see or hear anything suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u00b624 At trial, Officer David Sanders, the investigating officer, testified on cross- examination regarding statements he had elicited from Jim Johnson and Ronald Charlton. It had been established through previous witness testimony that Jim Johnson was present in the house where the alleged act took place, and that he was sleeping in the basement at the time the alleged act took place. Officer Sanders testified that Jim Johnson told him that: \u201cI don\u2019t think he had much to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>offer as far as any information. He hadn\u2019t seen anything, didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Officer Sanders also testified regarding the substance of the statement given to him by Ronald Charlton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">Q. Okay. How about Mr. Charlton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">A. Yes, I interviewed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">Q. Okay. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">A. He didn\u2019t believe it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">Q. Okay. Well, what did he tell you about his whereabouts and his perspective on which to view the scene of the allegation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">A. He was in the living room, and he was like in charge of the baby at this time, because A.[S.] [the alleged victim] and \u2014 and Dennis [Berg] were having a cigarette, or he didn\u2019t know where they were. The baby started to stir, started to make some sounds, so he went to look for A.[S.] and couldn\u2019t find her anywhere in the house. He went to the garage, opened the door, and saw A.[S.] and Dennis [Berg] in the garage he said smoking a cigarette, and I said, \u201cWell, then, did you tell \u2014 did you tell A.[S.] that the baby was crying?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I just went back to the couch,\u201d and I told him, \u201cWell you went to look for her but you \u2014 once you found her then you did-n\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t tell her the baby was crying?\u201d He said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I just \u2014 I said, \u201cI find that unusual that you would do that, that you would go to the trouble of looking for her and then when you found her not say anything.\u201d I said, \u201cIs it possible that you opened that door and saw her being assaulted?\u201d and he said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d and that was basically the end of our discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">A.... \u2014 and one other thing he did say is that when I asked \u201cDid you \u2014 you know, why didn\u2019t you tell her the baby was crying?\u201d he said, \u201cWell, it was cold outside. I figured she would be in sooner or later. I mean soon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">\u00b625 The record reflects that the substance of both Jim Johnson\u2019s and Ronald Charlton\u2019s testimony was introduced by Thompson through the cross-examination of Officer Sanders. Thus, in spite of the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Berg\u2019s two critical witnesses, the jury was essentially provided with the substance of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">\u00b626  Berg contends that Ricky Charbonneau would have testified that the event for which Berg was charged would have to have occurred, if at all, in January 1997, rather than during December 1996, as alleged, and that this would have established that the alleged vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tim was 16 years old at the time, rather than 15. However, her age was only relevant to the issue of consent and Berg did not raise consent as a defense. For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s error was not so prejudicial that Berg was deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, we hold that the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Berg\u2019s witnesses at trial was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err when it found that Berg was not prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, was not entitled to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u00b628 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d <em>674. Bone, </em>284 Mont. at 303, 944 P.2d at 740. The first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test is to determine whether counsel acted within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires a defendant to show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deny the defendant a fair trial. <em>Bone, </em>284 Mont. 293, 303, 944 P.2d 734, 740. In order to show prejudice, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, because of the error, the defendant was denied a fair trial. <em>Bone, </em>284 Mont. at 303-04, 944 P.2d at 740. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u00b629  The District Court found that: \u201cthe first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test may be met in this case: [cjounsel for the defendant missed the Court\u2019s deadline to submit his list of witnesses to the state.\u201d The issue on appeal is whether counsel\u2019s performance denied Berg a fair trial. Because we have previously held that the exclusion of Berg\u2019s witnesses at trial did not deny him a fair trial, the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test cannot be satisfied. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">\u00b630 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-10\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b578-11\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ApJN\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">\u00b631 I concur in our opinion and in all that is said with the exception that I do not agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>abused its discretion by precluding Berg from calling witnesses as a sanction for the Defendant\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 46-15-323(6)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">\u00b632 Admittedly, precluding a party from calling witnesses is a severe sanction that should be judiciously imposed. Notwithstanding, in the case at bar, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Berg\u2019s failure to timely file his witness list was not wilful, he nevertheless failed to demonstrate any good cause or compelling justification for his failure to comply with the discovery requirements of \u00a7 46-15-323, MCA, and the trial court\u2019s Omnibus Hearing order which extended substantially his statutory discovery obligations. To make matters worse, at the March 18,1999 hearing to exclude witnesses, Berg\u2019s counsel misled the State and the District Judge by affirmatively representing that he intended only to call two impeachment witnesses \u2014 which the court allowed him to call \u2014 and that other witnesses on his list would not be called. Indeed, Berg did not make any pretrial objection to the court\u2019s March 20, 1999 order excluding the witnesses he now contends were crucial to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u00b633 Under these facts, I cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding Berg from calling other witnesses in his defense. The trial judge ought not to be held in error because of the Defendant\u2019s choice to ignore the discovery rules; to ignore the court\u2019s discovery orders; to be less than candid; and to play fast and loose with the court. In any event, since I am otherwise in accord with our analysis and the result reached, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
