The District Court awarded summary judgment to the Defendants. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the District Court. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to Defendants based on its conclusion that the covenant not to compete was not enforceable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-703 and -704, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b64 Prior to May 1994, Plaintiff Michael Roessman was employed by Snow Country Construction, Inc., a closely held family corporation owned by Michael and Debra Laabs. Snow Country Construction, Inc., is a small construction company, whose business is primarily building expensive custom homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b65 In 1994, Michael Laabs informed Michael Roessman that he was interested in leaving the construction industry and subsequently offered to sell Snow Country Construction, Inc. to Michael Roessman. The Laabs and the Roessmans negotiated at length concerning the purchase of the company, and specifically over the terms of a covenant not to compete. Because Michael Laabs had close relationships with many of the company\u2019s clientele, the Roessmans felt it was imperative, for Snow Country Construction\u2019s continued success, that the Laabs enter into a covenant not to compete with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b66 On May 31,1994, the Laabs and the Roessmans executed a Stock Purchase Agreement for Snow Country Construction, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, Roessmans purchased 100 percent of Snow Country Construction Inc.\u2019s stock. The sale constituted a complete transfer and conveyance of all of the Laabs\u2019 right, title and interest in and to Snow Country Construction, Inc. Additionally, the agreement contained a covenant not to compete, which restricted the Laabs from serving as general contractors for residential construction in Flathead and Lake Counties for a period of seven years, and from performing any construction for any prior, existing or referred clients of Snow Country Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b67 On May 8,1998, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that the Defendants have repeatedly breached the covenant not to compete by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>continuing in the construction trade in Flathead and Lake Counties and by performing construction projects for prior, or existing clients of Snow Country Construction, Inc. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 12,1998. On July 8,1998, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on the Defendants\u2019 affirmative defense that the covenant not to compete is void because it violates public policy. The District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on January 15, 1999 based on the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the covenant not to compete was unenforceable. Plaintiffs appeal the District Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b68 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment orders is de novo. <em>See Motarie v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ. P., which provides that summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment to Defendants based on its conclusion that the covenant not to compete was not enforceable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-703 and -704, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b610 The Plaintiffs contend that the covenant not to compete is enforceable pursuant to Montana\u2019s statutory provision which expressly allows a covenant not to compete when the good will of a business has been sold. Sections 28-2-703 and -704, MCA, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">Any contract by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind, otherwise than is provided for by 28-2-704 or 28-2-705, is to that extent void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Section 28-2-703, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">(1) One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business within the areas provided in subsection (2) so long as the buyer or any person deriving title to the goodwill from him carries on a like business therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASr\">Section 28-2-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u00b611 The Laabs argue that because the sale of Snow Country Construction, Inc., was the sale of stock as opposed to the sale of assets, the exception found at \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA, does not apply. The Laabs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>assert that shareholders do not own the good will of a business, which belongs to the corporation, and that therefore, when shares of stock are bought and sold by individuals, the good will itself is not transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"As_\">\u00b612 Section 28-2-704, MCA, was modeled after \u00a7 1674 (now \u00a7 16601) of the California Civil Code. We have previously determined that our interpretation of this section will be guided by the construction given it by the Supreme Court of California. <em>Treasure Chem., Inc. v. Team Laboratory Chem. Corp. </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 200, 204, 609 P.2d. 285, 287. In 1899, the Supreme Court of California addressed the issue of whether the good will exclusion contained in section 1674 of the California Civil Code is applicable to a stock sale. <em>Merchants\u2019 Ad-Sign Co. v. Sterling </em>(1899), 124 Cal. 429, 57 P. 468. The court held that the \u00a7 1674 exclusion did not apply to a stock sale, stating that: \u201c[djefendant, as a stockholder, did not and could not transfer the good will of the corporation .... The element of good will, therefore, is not present in the transaction.\u201d <em>Merchants\u2019 Ad-Sign Co., </em>124 Cal. at 433, 57 P. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"AOq\">\u00b613 Section 1674 was subsequently amended in 1945, and now includes language which extends the good will exception to a shareholder selling all of his shares of stock. In <em>Boseley Medical Group v. Abramson, M.D. </em>(1984), 161 Cal. App. 3d 284, 207 Cal. Rptr. 477, the California court explained the subsequent amendment of \u00a7 1674, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">The purpose of the 1945 amendment to section 16601 [previously \u00a7 1674] is contained in a letter from sponsoring Senator Quinn and a memorandum prepared for the committee. ... The memorandum points out that the court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Merchants\u2019 Ad-Sign Co. v. Sterling, </em>supra, 124 Cal. 429, 57 P. 468, was very technical, and was based on the fact that when the predecessor sections to Business and Professions Code sections 16600, 16601 and 16602 were enacted, \u201cthe small trading corporation was practically unknown and partnership was the vogue ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>Boseley Med. Group, </em>161 Cal. App. 3d at 289, 207 Cal. Rptr. at 480. Thus, the California Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1674 in <em>Merchants\u2019 Ad-Sign Company, </em>does not reflect modern business reality. Therefore, we decline to follow California\u2019s statutory interpretation of \u00a7 1674 as set forth in <em>Merchants\u2019 Ad-Sign Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b614 Several other jurisdictions have addressed this same issue and have concluded that there is no substantive difference between the sale of all of a company\u2019s stock and the sale of a company\u2019s good will in some other form. <em>See Ward v. Midcom, Inc. </em>(1998 S.D.), 575 N.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>233; <em>Key v. Perkins </em>(1935 Okla.), 46 P.2d 530. In a recent case, the Supreme Court of North Dakota construed a similar good will exclusion statute stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">Where one sells his stock he necessarily disposes of his interest in the good will of the business conducted by the corporation to the same extent as he parts with his interest in any other property of the corporation. And where, as in the instant case, he disposes of all his stock and severs his connection with a business that had been in a measure dependent for its success upon his skill or ability and contracts at the same time not to re-engage in the same business within an area permitted by the statute, he has, in fact, sold the good will within the exception, and the contract is valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APG\"><em>Earthworks, Inc. v. Sehn </em>(1996 N.D.), 553 N.W.2d 490, 494 (citing <em>Bessel v. Bethke </em>(1927 N.D.), 215 N.W. 868, 869-870).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b615 Moreover, in the instant case, the Stock Purchase Agreement specifically contemplates the transfer of good will in the stock sale. Paragraph 9 of the Stock Purchase Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">The parties acknowledge and agree that, while no specific allocation of the purchase price is made for good will, that there is, nonetheless, a substantial value to the name and reputation of Seller and the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Thus, the Laabs\u2019 argument that the good will exclusion of \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA, does not apply because there was no transfer of good will in the stock sale is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b616  Section 1-3-219, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he law respects form less than substance.\u201d To hold that the good will exclusion of \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA, applies to an asset sale but not to a stock sale would effectively exalt form over substance. Because we conclude that in this context there is no substantive difference between a sale of all of a company\u2019s stock and the sale of a company\u2019s assets, we must further conclude that the good will exception of \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA, applies to a stock sale as well as an asset sale. For these reasons, we conclude that the Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
