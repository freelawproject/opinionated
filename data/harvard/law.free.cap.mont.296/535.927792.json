The District Court terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the parental rights of Lee and Nicki and awarded permanent custody of E.A.T., with the right to consent to his adoption, to DPHHS. Nicki appeals from the judgment of the District Court terminating her parental rights. Both Lee and Nicki appeal from the judgment of the District Court awarding custody of E.A.T. to DPHHS. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating the parental rights of Nicki?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating parental rights without considering other options, such as a guardianship?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by permanently placing E.A.T. with the DPHHS and not with E.A.T.\u2019s grandmother Eva, following termination of Lee\u2019s and Nicki\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">\u00b66 Appellants Nicki and Lee are the parents of two sons, E.A.T., born June 8, 1994, and T.A.T., born February 28, 1997. E.A.T. is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">f 7 On September 21,1995, DPHHS received a referral regarding a September 20, 1995 emergency room visit during which the emergency room doctor discovered fresh tears and bruising around 15-month-old E.A.T\u2019s rectal area. On September 29,1995, after conducting interviews with E.A.T.\u2019s parents Nicki and Lee, DPHHS removed E.A.T. from their home and placed him in protective custody with a foster parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">\u00b68 On October 2,1995, DPHHS filed a petition for temporary investigative authority based on allegations that E.A.T. had been sexually abused. At the October 12, 1995 hearing to consider DPHHS\u2019s petition for temporary investigative authority, the Appellants consented to a six-month temporary investigative authority for DPHHS. Additionally, the court ordered the parties to draft a treatment plan. The parties filed the court ordered treatment plan on October 24, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"AFG\">\u00b69 On April 12,1996, after E.A.T. had spent more than six months in foster care, DPHHS filed a petition for temporary custody of E.A.T., alleging that the Appellants had not complied with their court ordered treatment plans. On May 20,1996, the court held a hearing to consider the petition for temporary custody and after which it ordered that E.A.T. be returned to Nicki, and ordered that Lee be excluded from the home. Lee was only permitted supervised visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>with E.A.T. Nicki was required to continue with her treatment plan and Lee was ordered to complete a sex offender evaluation, following which the court intended to reconsider the case. Additionally, the court granted DPHHS the authority to enter Nicki\u2019s home to monitor E.A.T. and to place E.A.T. in protective custody should an emergency arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b610 On June 7,1996, after E.A.T. had been in Nicki\u2019s care for approximately two weeks, DPHHS social workers discovered Lee\u2019s car in a parking lot in the vicinity of Nicki\u2019s home. Accompanied by a Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy, the DPHHS social workers went to Nicki\u2019s home. The Deputy asked Nicki if Lee was in the home and she denied his presence. However, upon searching Nicki\u2019s home, Lee was discovered hiding in the bedroom closet. Nicki later testified that she knew of Lee\u2019s presence in her home and that she had asked him to stay with her that night, in direct violation of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b611 Because of Nicki\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order to exclude Lee from their home and not allow any unsupervised contact with E.A.T., DPHHS removed E.A.T. from the home that night and returned him to the protective custody of the foster parents. The next morning, on June 8, 1996, DPHHS brought E.A.T. to a pediatrician, Dr. Mclnnis, for examination. It was Dr. Mclnnis\u2019 opinion that there had possibly been recent sexual abuse. E.A.T. was referred to Dr. Johnson, a pediatrician with special training in the area of child sexual abuse. Dr. Johnson examined E.A.T. on June 12,1996. Dr Johnson\u2019s opinion was that E.A.T.\u2019s physical condition was consistent with recent sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b612 On August 21,1996, DPHHS filed a petition to terminate Lee\u2019s and Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T. On August 30,1996, Eva, E.A.T.\u2019s maternal grandmother, petitioned and was granted leave to be added as a party to this matter. A hearing was held to consider DPHHS\u2019s petition to terminate parental rights on September 18 through 20,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"AF1\">\u00b613 On June 27, 1997, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order terminating both Lee\u2019s and Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T. Specifically, the court found that: (1) E.A.T. had been sexually abused by Lee; (2) E.A.T. would not be safe in Nicki\u2019s care because she is unable or unwilling to protect E.A.T. from Lee; (3) the conduct and condition of both Lee and Nicki, renders them unfit to be parents and is unlikely to change within a reasonable time; and (4) Nicki\u2019s questionable adherence to her treatment plan suggests that she is not serious about parenting E.A.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00b614 On August 21,1997, the District Court entered its Supplementary Order granting DPHHS permanent legal custody of E.A.T., with the right to consent to his adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b6 15 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a parental rights termination case is whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re the Matter of J.M.W.E.H., </em>1998 MT 18, \u00b6 27, 287 Mont. 239, \u00b6 27, 954 P.2d 26, \u00b6 27. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the District Court made a mistake. <em>In re J.M.W.E.H, </em>\u00b6 27. We review conclusions of law in a termination proceeding to determine if those conclusions are correct. <em>In re E. </em>W., C. <em>W. and A. W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6 11, 289 Mont. 190, \u00b6 11, 959 P.2d 951, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"Aau\">\u00b616  This court has recognized that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re E.W., C.W. and A. W., </em>\u00b6 12. Moreover, the party seeking termination must present clear and convincing evidence to the district court that the prerequisite statutory criteria for termination have been met. <em>In re E.W., C.W. and A.W., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b617  In the context of parental rights termination cases, we have defined clear and convincing evidence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">[SJimply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of the proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\"><em>In re E.W., C.W. and A.W., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">\u00b618 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T.?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">\u00b619 Nicki makes several arguments to support her contention that the District Court abused its discretion by terminating her parental rights to E.A.T. She argues that there was no clear and convincing evidence that sexual abuse occurred. Based solely upon her contention that the District Court erred in finding that sexual abuse had occurred, Nicki also makes the following arguments: (1) the court erred when it found that she could not protect E.A.T.; (2) the court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>when it found that the condition that caused her to be unfit was unlikely to change; and (3) the court erred when it found that she failed to comply with her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b620 First, Nicki argues that the District Court abused its discretion by terminating her rights absent clear and convincing evidence that sexual abuse of E.A.T. occurred. Nicki contends that the court misapprehended the effect of the testimony of Dr. Johnson. She argues that \u201cDr. Johnson simply was highly suspicious of sexual abuse. If the court concluded that sexual abuse occurred, it has done so erroneously.\u201d Nicki\u2019s theory is that E.A.T. received the two reported injuries to his rectal area, not as a result of sexual abuse, but because he was constipated. She testified that ever since E.A.T. was little, he has suffered from constipation. However, she offered no medical proof or evidence to support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b621 Dr. Johnson, a pediatrician specially trained in child sexual abuse, testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">[T]he extent of the fissures that we saw ... are almost always caused by some force extending from the outside. And so we think of sodomy. ... These fissures, although they were in the positions that constipated stools can cause, were well beyond those that we see with constipation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">Q. And how probable is it that actual constipation could cause fissures of that type?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">A. Well, it\u2019s not probable. It\u2019s not impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">\u00b622 In its conclusions of law, the District Court stated that \u201c[t]he court accepts the testimony of Dr. Johnson as to the extent of the sexual injury to E.[A.]T.\u201d, and \u201c[tjhe court finds that E.[A.]T. has been sexually abused by Lee T.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">\u00b623 Nicki additionally argues that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the other evidence regarding sexual abuse. She testified that she was not convinced that Lee sexually abused E.A.T. and Lee testified that he did not sexually abuse E.A.T. She asserts that \u201c[tjhe strength of the case that sexual abuse occurred is the following: E.A.T. had tears on his anus on two occasions after being near Lee. The foster parents saw no evidence of constipation or bleeding while they had E.A.T. in their care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">\u00b624 However, as DPHHS points out, in addition to these facts, the record reflects that the District Court found Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony, that she was highly suspicious of sexual abuse, compelling. Additionally, Dr. Johnson found the ease with which E.A.T. submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>an examination of his rectal area most unusual. She testified that it indicated that he had been placed in such a position many times.</p>\n<p id=\"Afn\">\u00b625 In the context of parental rights termination cases, we have defined the term \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d as that quality of proof \u201cmore than a preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d/n <em>re J.M.W.E.H, </em>\u00b6 33. We have held that clear and convincing evidence \u201cdoes not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence.\u201d <em>In re J.M.W.E.H, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b626  Applying these rules to the instant case, the fact that Dr. Johnson testified that she was \u201chighly suspicious,\u201d and not definite, does not preclude the court from relying on her testimony. That \u201csuspicion\u201d in combination with other testimony given by Dr. Johnson regarding the physical evidence was sufficient to satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof. It is not the role of this Court to substitute our evaluation of the evidence for that of the trial court, or pass upon the credibility of witnesses. <em>In re J.M.W.E.H., </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b627  Having extensively reviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the sexual abuse of E.A.T. by Lee are supported by clear and convincing evidence and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u00b628 Because we conclude that there was clear and convincing evidence that Lee sexually abused E.A.T., Nicki\u2019s remaining three arguments regarding the termination of her parental rights which are predicated on her primary argument also fail. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by terminating Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\u00b629 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T. without considering other options, such as a guardianship?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\u00b630 Nicki contends that the District Court abused its discretion by terminating her parental rights without considering other options. Nicki asserts that a guardianship should have been considered prior to the court\u2019s termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\u00b631 While it is true that the State of Montana\u2019s policy regarding child abuse and neglect is to preserve and protect family unity, it is also this state\u2019s policy to provide for the protection of children whose health and welfare are or may be adversely affected and further threatened by the conduct of those responsible for their care and protection. Section 41-3-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u00b632 This Court has recognized that family integrity is a constitutionally protected interest. <em>Matter of M.R.L., </em>(1980) 186 Mont. 468, 472, 608 P.2d 134, 137. We have also noted, however, that family unity need not be preserved at the expense of the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Matter of M.R.L., </em>186 Mont. at 472, 608 P.2d at 137. Further, we have declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">[T]he right to maintain the family unit is not absolute and although the children\u2019s best interests and welfare generally are served by maintaining the family unit with custody retained by the natural parents, <em>the children\u2019s best interest and welfare, not that of the natural parent, is the paramount consideration.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Matter of C.G. </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 117, 120, 747 P.2d 1369, 1371 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b633  Additionally, the specific criteria for which a court may order termination of the parent-child legal relationship are enumerated in \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA. No limitation is placed upon a court which requires consideration of other options, such as a guardianship, prior to terminating parental rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA. The role of courts in applying a statute has always been \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Statutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>See Lovell v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b634  In its Supplementary Order, dated August 21, 1997, the District Court granted DPHHS permanent legal custody of E.A.T., with the right to consent to his adoption. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by doing so. We further conclude that the court was not required to consider a guardianship prior to terminating Nicki\u2019s and Lee\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u00b635 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by permanently placing E.A.T. with DPHHS, and not E.A.T.\u2019s maternal grandmother Eva, following termination of Lee\u2019s and Nicki\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\u00b636 Nicki and Lee argue that the court should have given preference to E.A.T.\u2019s extended family, specifically, E.A.T.\u2019s maternal grandmother Eva, when ordering the permanent placement of E.A.T. after terminating Nicki\u2019s and Lee\u2019s parental rights. Both Appellants cite \u00a7 41-3-101(4), MCA, as authority for their contention that the court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>required to give preference to extended family for out-of-home placement of children. Section 41-3-101(4), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">In implementing the policy of this section, whenever it is necessary to remove a child from the child\u2019s home, <em>the department shall, when it is in the best interests of the child and when the home is approved by the department, </em>place the child with the child\u2019s extended family, including adult siblings, grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, and uncles, prior to placing the child in an alternative protective or residential facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">(Emphasis added.) This statutory language is clearly directed at the department (DPHHS), and not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u00b637 Section 41-3-607, MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">If termination of a parent-child legal relationship is ordered, the court may transfer permanent legal custody of the child, with the right to consent to the child\u2019s adoption, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">(a) the department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">(b) a licensed child-placing agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">(c) another individual who has been approved by the department and has received consent for the transfer of custody from the department or agency that has custody of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\u00b638  This Court has often held that a district court has discretionary authority to transfer legal custody to any qualified individual, including a nonrelative, in order to protect the welfare of the youth. <em>Matter of J.J.G. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 274, 286, 880 P.2d 808, 815; <em>Matter of S.P. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 190, 201, 786 P.2d 642, 648. Moreover, we have held that a grandmother does not, by virtue of her status as a grandparent, have any superior right of adoption or custody to that of a nonrelative. <em>Matter of S.P. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. at 201, 786 P.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">\u00b639 The District Court\u2019s record reflects its consideration of Eva as a possible guardian or permanent caretaker in this matter. The court allowed Eva to become a party to this matter and present her case at the hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights. The court stated as follows in its findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">[Eva] believes she can adequately care for E.[A.]T., and protect him. She said she would provide supervised visitation for Nicki and that she would not allow Nicki to remove E.[A.]T. from her home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">\u00b640 Additionally, the court made the following finding of fact in regards to the testimony of E.A.T.\u2019s guardian ad litem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Mrs. Nybo [E.A.T.\u2019s guardian ad litem] also recommended against E.[A.]T. being placed with Mrs. T. She bases this recommendation on her discussions with Nicki about Nicki\u2019s childhood neglect, and prior DPHHS involvement with Mrs. T.\u2019s parenting of Nicki. She states that Mrs. T. lied to her about there being any prior DPHHS involvement, and also lied to her about the number of visitations she had with E.[A.]T. She was concerned that E.[A.]T. had received bite marks while Mrs. T. was babysitting him and another grandchild. However, she did not interview Mrs. T. concerning this event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abi\">\u00b641 The District Court\u2019s findings reflect its consideration of E.A.T.\u2019s maternal grandmother as a possible custodian in this matter. However, the District Court entered its order directing that the permanent custody of E.A.T. be placed with DPHHS and granting DPHHS the right to consent to E.A.T.\u2019s adoption. We conclude that there was sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s judgment not to grant Eva permanent custody of E.A.T. We further conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded permanent custody of E.A.T., with right to consent to his adoption, to DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b642 While conceding that she has no standing to assert a constitutional violation on Eva\u2019s behalf (Eva did not appeal the District Court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to DPHHS), Nicki additionally contends the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant Eva permanent custody of E.A.T. was <em>\u201ca </em>violation of her liberty interests in E. A. T.\u2019s society\u201d and a violation of E.A.T.\u2019s \u201cdue process, statutory, and substantive due process rights to his mother\u2019s society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b643  Because we have upheld the District Court\u2019s termination of Nicki\u2019s parental rights, \u00a7 41-3-611, MCA, governs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">(1) An order for the termination of the parent-child legal relationship divests the child and the parents of all legal rights, powers, immunities, duties, and obligations with respect to each other as provided in Title 40, chapter 6, part 2, and Title 41, chapter 3, part 2, except the right of the child to inherit from the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">(3) After the termination of a parent-child legal relationship, the former parent is neither entitled to any notice of proceedings for the adoption of the child nor has any right to object to the adoption or to participate in any other placement proceedings held pursuant to 41-3-610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Based upon this statutory language, we conclude that Nicki does not have standing to object to the court\u2019s placement of E.A.T. with DPHHS, nor any subsequent adoptive placement of E.A.T. Additionally, based upon this same statutory language, as well as \u00a7 41-3-303(2), MCA, which describes the role of the guardian ad litem as: \u201ccharged with the representation of the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d we conclude that Nicki does not have standing to assert a violation of E.A.T.\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b644 Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate Nicki\u2019s parental rights to E.A.T., and the District Court\u2019s decision to award DPHHS permanent legal custody of E.A.T. with the right to consent to his adoption, are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
