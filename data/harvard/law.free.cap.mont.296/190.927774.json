Nelson (Nelson) appeals from the judgment and order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Carbon County.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b63 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting the City of Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>for whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Bramble v. State of Montana, </em>1999 MT 132, \u00b6 16, [294 Mont. 501, \u00b6 16], 982 P.2d 464, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">\u00b66 Early in the morning of August 29,1997 Nelson had a disagreement with his partner, Donna Nelson, and struck her several times in the face, breaking her jaw. Nelson was charged with partner assault, a misdemeanor, under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, and convicted of partner assault in the City Court of Red Lodge in April, 1998. In May, 1998 Nelson appealed his conviction to district court and requested a <em>de novo </em>trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">\u00b67 At an omnibus hearing in July, 1998 Nelson gave notice of his intent to rely on the defense of self defense. In his trial brief, Nelson declared his intent to introduce evidence at trial of Donna Nelson\u2019s \u201cprior convictions for assault for the purpose of showing her intent to assault him.\u201d In September, 1998 the City of Red Lodge (hereafter, Red Lodge) filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit Nelson from introducing into evidence any criminal convictions of Donna Nelson. Nelson filed a response to Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>arguing that Donna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Nelson\u2019s prior convictions were admissible to show her intent to assault him and to show that he used reasonable force against her. The District Court granted Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Following a trial by jury, Nelson was convicted of partner assault and sentenced to one year in jail, to be served concurrent with the sentence he was serving at Montana State Prison, and with credit for time already served. From that judgment and order Nelson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b68 Nelson argues that the prior convictions of Donna Nelson were admissible under Rules 404(a)(2) and 405(b), M.R.Evid., and that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Nelson argues further that he relied on the defense of justifiable force at trial, that he made timely assertions that he knew of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions when he struck her, and that evidence of those convictions was necessary for him to establish that his use of force was reasonable in light of Donna Nelson\u2019s character for violence. Nelson also contends that the District Court\u2019s grant of Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>prejudiced his substantive rights and was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b69 Red Lodge responds that Nelson did not rely on the defense of justifiable force but rather claimed that his contacts with Donna Nelson were accidental. Further, Red Lodge contends that Nelson never asserted that he knew of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions when he struck her. Thus, the evidence of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions was not relevant to the defense of accident on which Nelson relied.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\u00b610 We begin by examining Montana\u2019s justifiable use of force statute and Rules 404 and 405, M.R.Evid. Montana\u2019s justifiable use of force statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">Use of force in defense of person. A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or another against such other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Section 45-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b611  Rule 404 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(2) Character of victim. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime offered by an accused ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Rule 404(a)(2), M.R.Evid. We have previously concluded that \u201c[w]here character evidence is admissible pursuant to Rule 404, M.R.Evid., character or a character trait can be proven through reputation evidence or specific instances of conduct evidence as expressly authorized in Rule 405, M.R.Evid.\u201d <em>State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 44, 288 Mont. 79, \u00b6 44, 956 P.2d 54, \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b6 12 Rule 405(b) has two alternative prongs for the admission of specific instances of conduct and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">Specific instances of conduct. In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, <em>or </em>where the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of force used by the accused in self defense, proof may also be made of specific instances of that person\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid. (emphasis added). Nelson relies on the second prong of Rule 405(b), which recognizes specific instances of conduct \u201cwhere the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of the force used by the accused.\u201d Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b613  The parties disagree over the threshold question whether Nelson relied at trial on the defense of justifiable force. Nelson argues that the notice he gave at the omnibus hearing of his intent to rely on the defense of self defense (hereafter, notice of intent), his trial brief in which he stated he would introduce evidence of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior assault convictions, and his response to Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>amply establish that he relied on the defense of self defense. However, Nelson\u2019s mention of the defense of self defense in his notice of intent, trial brief, and response to Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>did not place the matter of self defense at issue in his trial. <em>Compare State v. Logan </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 48, 65, 473 P.2d 833, 842 (concluding \u201c[t]he notice of intention to rely on self-defense served by defendant on the state prior to trial is immaterial and does not place this matter in issue at trial. Defendant is not bound to rely on this defense at the trial notwithstanding service of this notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\u00b614 Nelson argues further that he relied on the defense of self defense at trial. However, the portions of the trial transcript to which Nelson has directed this Court do not support his contention but show rather that he relied on the defense that he accidentally struck Donna Nelson. Nelson testified that on the night he struck Donna Nelson, he and Donna Nelson had been to a bar, in violation of his pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>bation, and that he had spoken with another woman. He and Donna Nelson quarreled over his conversation with that woman. Nelson testified further that when he and Donna Nelson returned home, Donna Nelson threw a vase that struck his throat and shattered when it hit the floor. Nelson testified that he hit the ground after the vase struck him but that he \u201cwas pretty mellow.\u201d He asked Donna Nelson to leave and he walked into a TV room. Nelson turned on a large TV that had a VCR attachment and sat down in a chair as Donna Nelson came behind him. Nelson further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">And I been through some of her rages before, and she takes and she goes to grabbing that TV and turning towards me, and I\u2019m perceiving the incident that just happened with the vase, that I\u2019m about to get hurt here, and I took and I jumped up and \u2014 meaning to hit the TV with this part of my arm (indicating), I took and threw out my arm and very assertively, and hit the TV. And this part of my hand here hit Donna on the jaw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b615 On cross-examination, Red Lodge asked Nelson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">Q. So to keep her from picking up the TV and the [VCR] attachment and hitting you over the head with it, you did something with your arm, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">Q. And as I understand your testimony, you went to hit at the TV?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">A. I did hit the TV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">Q. Correct; with part of your arm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">A. The side of my arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">Q. And the \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">A. (Indicating.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">Q. \u2014then the rest of your hand accidentally hit her jaw with enough force to break it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">A. The rest of my hand hit her jaw, yes. It wasn\u2019t intentional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">\u00b616 Thus, Nelson testified repeatedly that he intended to hit the TV but accidentally struck Donna Nelson\u2019s jaw. Nelson relied on the defense of accident, and he makes no claim that Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions were necessary for him to establish that defense. Accordingly, for purposes of his defense of accident, Nelson\u2019s reliance on <em>Sattler </em>for the admission of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions is misplaced. In <em>Sattler, </em>defendant Sattler, an inmate, testified that he did not intend to kill another inmate but that he struck him in self-defense; however, Sattler did not contend that he <em>accidentally </em>hit the victim. <em>See Sattler, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b6 17 We note, however, that our review of the record discloses that at the conclusion of Nelson\u2019s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">Q. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s all. The night of August 29,1997, did you have in your own mind a belief that you were in danger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_c\">A. You bet I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Q. Were you the initial aggressor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">A. No, I was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Q. Do you believe that the force you used was force necessary to defend yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b618 Arguably, in testifying that he used the force that he thought necessary to defend himself, Nelson meant that he intended to strike Donna Nelson and that his contact with her was deliberate. Thus, there is a tenuous basis in the record from which to conclude that Nelson relied on the defense of self defense. However, the foregoing testimony is also consistent with Nelson\u2019s previously asserted defense of accident and the implicit claim that although he used the force he thought necessary, he did not intend to strike Donna Nelson. As previously discussed, moreover, during his cross-examination Nelson emphatically reaffirmed his contention that he accidentally struck Donna Nelson. We conclude that the record offers scant support for Nelson\u2019s contention that he relied on the defense of self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b619  However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Nelson relied on the defense of self defense, the record clearly establishes that evidence of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions for assault lacked relevance because Nelson never asserted that he knew of those convictions when he struck her. Contrary to Nelson\u2019s contention, he did not assert in either his trial brief or his response to Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>that he knew of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions for assault when he struck her. Thus, Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions for assault lacked relevance under the second prong of Rule 405(b), which again recognizes specific instances of conduct \u201cwhere the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of force used.\u201d Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid. We note that Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions also lacked relevance under the first prong of Rule 405(b), because a victim\u2019s character for violence is not an \u201cessential element\u201d of the defense of justifiable force. <em>Compare </em>Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid. (providing \u201c[i]n cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is <em>an essential element of a charge, </em>claim, or defense, ... proof may also be made of specific in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>stances of that person\u2019s conduct\u201d) (emphasis added). Nor do we find persuasive Nelson\u2019s claim that he was unable to establish his knowledge of her prior convictions at trial because of Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Nothing prevented Nelson from alleging that he had timely relevant knowledge of Donna Nelson\u2019s prior convictions in his trial brief or his response to Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Red Lodge\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Because this holding is dispositive, we do not address Nelson\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s abuse of discretion was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b220-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AAD\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b621 I concur with the result of the majority opinion. However, I conclude that any discussion past paragraph 16 is unnecessary and therefore, specially concur in only that part of the opinion which includes paragraphs 1 through 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b622 The Defendant, William R Nelson, clearly testified that he struck Donna Nelson by accident. His contention that he did not intend to strike her is inconsistent with a defense that he struck her in self-defense. Therefore, in spite of what he did or didn\u2019t know about her prior conduct at the time of the event which formed the basis for the charges against him, Donna Nelson\u2019s prior conduct was irrelevant. For this reason alone, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
