Waters (Waters) appeals from the Sentencing Order of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">Issues Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">\u00b62 There are two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b63 (1.) Does the new judicial rule that oral pronouncement of sentence is the legally effective judgment apply retroactively to Waters\u2019 appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b64 (2.) Do the extra conditions imposed in the written Sentencing Order conflict with the oral pronouncement of sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b65 Waters and his common law wife, April King, moved from Texas to Forsyth, Montana, in 1997. The State of Montana (the State) charged Waters by Information, on August 11,1997, with the offense of Issuing a Bad Check as Part of a Common Scheme, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-316, MCA. The Information alleged that, during July of 1997, Waters had knowingly written eight bad checks to various businesses in Rosebud County for a total of $ 1,848.02. The State similarly charged co-defendant, April King, with the felony offense of issuing bad checks as part of a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b66 Waters pleaded not guilty to the charge at his initial appearance and arraignment on August 18, 1997. Thereafter, on September 21, 1997, Waters and the State entered into a written Acknowledgment and Waiver of Rights and Plea Agreement (Plea Agreement). Pursuant to the Plea Agreement, Waters agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the State agreeing to recommend a five-year suspended sentence. Waters understood that the District Court was not bound by the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b67 The District Court accepted Waters\u2019 change of plea at a hearing on September 22, 1997. After the District Court accepted Waters\u2019 guilty plea as voluntary, it ordered the preparation of a pre-sentence investigation (PSI). The PSI was completed and filed with the court on October 8,1997. The PSI recommended that Waters be sentenced to the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC), but did not make a specific recommendation for any length of incarceration. On October 20, 1997, an Addendum to the PSI was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">\u00b68 On October 22, 1997, a sentencing hearing was held. The pre-sentence investigator testified that the Addendum to the PSI had been filed because he had subsequently learned that Waters had two outstanding misdemeanor warrants and one outstanding felony warrant for his arrest in Texas. Based on these outstanding warrants, which included similar charges to those at issue here, the investigator recommended that Waters be sentenced to the Montana State Prison for five years with two years suspended. At the close of the hearing, the District Court informed Waters that it was not going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>follow the State\u2019s recommendation in the Plea Agreement, and asked Waters if he wished to withdraw his guilty plea or continue with sentencing. Waters agreed to continue with his plea of guilty and let the court sentence him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b69 Thus, the District Court orally sentenced Waters to the DOC for five years with two years suspended. The court orally imposed the following conditions on Waters\u2019 sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">Well, what the Court is going to do, I\u2019m going to commit [Waters] to the [DOC] for a period of five years with two suspended under the conditions in the Plea Agreement and the [PSI], including the restitution, and including joint and several liability for the other checks that [April King] wrote.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Apparently, the District Court believed that a DOC commitment would possibly enable Waters to get transferred to Texas authorities and clear up his outstanding warrants. The court referred to \u201cconditions\u201d contained in the Plea Agreement and PSI, but did not elaborate on those conditions. The court did not orally impose any other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b6 10 The District Court signed its written Sentencing Order on November 3,1997, which accurately reflected the five-year commitment with two years suspended, as orally pronounced by the court. The Sentencing Order set forth ten conditions and eight sub-conditions applicable to Waters\u2019 sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">1. The Defendant shall be placed under the supervision of the Montana Department of Corrections and Human Services, Adult Parole and Probation Division, and be subject to their standard rules and regulations as listed below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">a.

Travel: The Defendant shall not leave his assigned district without first obtaining written permission from his Probation/Parole Officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">c. Employment: The Defendant shall maintain employment or a program approved by his Probation/Parole Officer, and must obtain permission from his Probation/Parole Officer prior to any change of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">d.

Search: Upon reasonable cause, the Defendant shall, while on parole or probation, submit to a search of his person, vehicle or residence by his Probation/Parole Officer, at any time, without a warrant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">h. Laws &amp; Conduct: The Defendant shall comply with all city, county, state, and federal laws and ordinances and conduct himself as a good citizen. The Defendant shall report any arrests or contacts with law enforcement to his Probation/Parole Officer within 72 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">2. The Defendant shall not use or possess alcoholic beverages nor enter any establishment where alcohol is the chief item of sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">3. The Defendant shall not use or possess illegal drugs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">4.

The Defendant shall be subject to supervision fees in the amount of $10.00 per month, to be paid at the rate of $30.00 per quarter, or $120.00 per year, under the direction of his supervising officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">7. The Defendant shall pay a surcharge in the amount of $20.00 to the Clerk of the District Court for the felony conviction, pursuant to Section 46-18-236 M.C.A.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">8. The Defendant shall reimburse Rosebud County for the costs of his Court-appointed counsel, in the amount of $250.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">9. The Defendant shall reimburse the victims of his offense in the amount of $1,848.02, payable through the office of Adult Probation and Parole, and that said restitution be paid in full within six (6) months of the date of discharge of this sentence. Additionally, the Defendant will be jointly and severally responsible for the $4,645.05 in restitution established in Rosebud County Cause No. DC 97-39, with co-defendant, April Jean King, a/k/a/ April Jean Waters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>10. The Defendant shall present himself to the proper authorities in the State of Texas, to answer to the outstanding arrest warrants issued in that jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b611 All of the foregoing conditions, with the exception of two, were contained in either the PSI, the Plea Agreement, or both documents. The two conditions in the written judgment that were not contained in either one or both of the incorporated documents were: (1) payment of supervision fees (condition 6); and (2) submission to Texas authorities (condition 10). Waters did not file a contemporaneous objection to the variations between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b612 On December 9,1997, Waters filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal. Subsequently, this Court appointed the Montana Appellate Defender Office to represent Waters on appeal. On May 1,1998, Assistant Appellate Defender, Chad Wright, submitted a motion and brief to this Court requesting that he be allowed to withdraw from Waters\u2019 appeal because there were no meritorious issues to be raised. On August 13, 1998, this Court denied the motion to withdraw, and ordered appellate counsel to submit a brief oh appeal addressing, at a minimum, the question of the validity of the District Court\u2019s written Sentencing Order in light of our recent decision in <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b613 In <em>Lane, </em>we sought to resolve a conflict between this Court\u2019s past approach to the finality of a sentence, which viewed the written judgment as the legally effective sentence, and contrary authority suggesting that the oral pronouncement of sentence controls for purposes of finality. After reviewing Montana statutes requiring the defendant\u2019s presence at the oral pronouncement of sentence, the constitutional protections affording a criminal defendant the right to be present and the opportunity to respond to a trial court sentence, and federal case law indicating that the oral pronouncement of sentence is the legal sentence, this Court announced the rule \u201cthat the sentence orally pronounced from the bench in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40-41, <em>overruling State v. Graveley </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 519, 915 P.2d 184; <em>State v. Mason </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 419, 833 P.2d 1058; <em>State v. Wirtala </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 264, 752 P.2d 177; <em>State v. Enfinger </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 438, 722 P.2d 1170; and any other Montana case law inconsistent with the new rule. \u201cAccordingly, the written judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>commitment will serve as evidence of the sentence orally pronounced.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b614 Waters\u2019 challenge to the District Court\u2019s Sentencing Order involves a question of law. We review questions of law <em>de novo. State v. Romero </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 58, 68, 926 P.2d 717, 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b615 (1.) Does the new judicial rule that oral pronouncement of sentence is the legally effective judgment apply retroactively to Waters\u2019 appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b616 In <em>Lane, </em>after announcing the new judicial rule that oral pronouncement of sentence controls, this Court applied that rule to the case and held, without discussing whether the new rule was retroactive in application, that the defendant\u2019s oral sentence was the legal and valid sentence. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-49. The parties in this case agree, and we concur, that the new rule announced in <em>Lane </em>has retroactive application under recent pronouncements by this Court. However, there are some inconsistencies in our case law which we shall seek to clear up in this case. We limit our discussion to retroactivity for purposes of direct review in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b617 In <em>State v. Redding </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 24, 675 P.2d 974, this Court imposed a new rule of law, but applied that rule retrospectively. In so doing, we noted that \u201c[t]he major factor in limiting retroactive application of new principles of law is whether such application would further or retard the purpose and effect of the rule.\u201d <em>Redding, </em>208 Mont. at 30, 675 P.2d at 977 (citing, in part, <em>Linkletter v. Walker </em>(1965), 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (setting forth a three-pronged test for determining retroactive application of new constitutional rules of criminal procedure), <em>overruled by Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b618 A few years later, in <em>State, City of Bozeman v. Peterson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 418, 739 P.2d 958, we stated the general rule that \u201cjudicial decisions will apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>227 Mont. at 420, 739 P.2d at 960. However, we cited a civil decision for a number of factors to be considered by courts in determining whether a new judicial rule should be applied retroactively or prospectively. <em>See Peterson, </em>227 Mont. at 420, 739 P.2d at 960 (citing <em>LaRoque v. State </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 315, 319, 583 P.2d 1059, 1061). In short, the <em>Peterson </em>Court did not distinguish between retroactivity in civil and criminal cases and enumerated a variety of factors to be considered in analyzing retroactivity in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00b619 In 1995, this Court had occasion to rethink retroactivity analysis for criminal cases in <em>State v. Egelhoff </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 37, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361. In <em>Egelhoff, </em>we reformed Montana\u2019s retroactivity analysis in criminal cases to comport with the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649. The U.S. Supreme Court, in <em>Griffith, </em>sought to clarify the standards for determining retroactivity for new constitutional rules of criminal procedure, and concluded that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>479 U.S. at 328, 107 S.Ct. at 716, 93 L.Ed.2d at 661 (departing from the \u201cclear break exception\u201d articulated in <em>United States v. Johnson </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 537, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Egelhoff, </em>this Court, noting that the <em>Griffith </em>precedent was \u201cbinding\u201d authority, reasoned that it was necessary to reform Montana\u2019s retroactivity analysis for new rules of criminal procedure because \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court ha[d] refined its position since we decided <em>Peterson ....\u2019\u2019Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125, 900 P.2d at 267. Thus, we adopted the above quoted <em>Griffith </em>rule as Montana law in <em>Egelhoff. </em>Since \u201c \u2018evenhanded justice\u2019 \u201d dictates that a new judicial rule be \u201c \u2018applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated,\u2019 \u201d we held that a decision announcing a new rule of criminal procedure is applicable to all cases still subject to direct review and not yet final as of the date of the decision. <em>Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125-26, 900 P.2d at 267 (quoting <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 300-01, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d 334, 349). Thus, the <em>Egelhoff </em>Court, without expressly overruling <em>Peterson </em>or other Montana precedent for determining retroactivity on direct review of criminal cases, clearly shifted the analysis away from a multi-factored inquiry and towards a bright-line rule. Today, we overrule <em>Redding, Peterson, </em>and any other decision of this Court which imposes an inquiry, multi-factored or otherwise, into whether a new judicial rule of criminal procedure is to be applied retroactively or prospectively to a similarly situated criminal defendant whose case is pending on direct review or not yet final.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u00b621  Retroactivity is a threshold matter which, as this Court has recently emphasized, compels the evenhanded application of a \u201cnew rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions\u201d to all similarly sit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>uated cases that are pending on direct review or not yet final. <em>State v. Nichols, </em>1999 MT 212, \u00b6 10, [295 Mont. 489 \u00b6 10], 986 P.2d 1093, \u00b6 10 <em>(citing Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125-26, 900 P.2d at 266-67). Therefore, all defendants whose cases are pending on direct review or not yet final are entitled to the retroactive application of a new judicial rule of criminal procedure. <em>See Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125, 900 P.2d at 267 (quoting <em>Griffith, </em>479 U.S. at 328, 107 S.Ct. at 716, 93 L.Ed.2d at 661); <em>accord State v. Steinmetz, </em>1998 MT 114, \u00b6 10, 288 Mont. 527, \u00b6 10, 961 P.2d 95, \u00b6 10 (giving retroactive effect to a decision which was handed down after the appeal in question \u201cwas submitted on briefs\u201d but before a final appellate decision was rendered); <em>State v. Thibert, </em>1998 MT 207, \u00b6 13, 290 Mont. 408, \u00b6 13, 965 P.2d 251, \u00b6 13 (givingretroactive effect to two decisions handed down after the trial court had ruled but prior to a final appellate decision); <em>see also United States v. Keys </em>(9th Cir. 1998), 133 F.3d 1282, 1286 (relying on <em>Griffith </em>to hold that the defendant was entitled to retroactive application of a new constitutional rule \u201cbecause it was announced after his trial and before his case had become final\u201d). The <em>Egelhoff </em>standard applies irrespective of whether the new judicial rule constitutes a \u201c \u2018clear break\u2019 \u201d from existing precedent, <em>see Griffith, </em>479 U.S. at 324-28, 107 S.Ct. at 714-16, 93 L.Ed.2d at 659-61, and without regard to whether the new judicial rule was \u201cavailable to the District Court at the time it ruled <em>....\u2019\u2019 Steinmetz, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b622 The <em>Lane </em>decision, by holding that the oral pronouncement of sentence controls over the written sentence for purposes of finality, plainly imposed a new judicial rule of criminal procedure. Indeed, <em>Lane </em>expressly overruled inconsistent precedent in announcing the new rule. Thus, we hold that <em>Lane </em>established a new judicial rule, for purposes of direct review, regardless of the fact that <em>Lane </em>was a clear break from existing precedent. Furthermore, we hold that <em>Lane </em>applies retroactively to Waters\u2019 appeal, even though the new rule was not available to the District Court at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b623 (2.) Do the extra conditions imposed in the written Sentencing Order conflict with the oral pronouncement of sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b624 Before reaching the merits of Waters\u2019 sentencing claim, we must address the threshold, procedural question of whether Waters\u2019 failure to object to the inconsistency between the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and its written Sentencing Order constitutes a waiver of that claim on appeal. This Court generally does not review a sentencing issue which was not preserved for appeal in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>court below. Sections 46-20-104(2) and 46-20-701(2), MCA; <em>see also State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 151-52, 875 P.2d 307, 321-22 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA). However, we have noted that an \u201cexception to this general rule\u201d arises where the defendant alleges that the \u201csentence is <em>illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, </em>even if no objection is made at the time of the sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 11, 18, 906 P.2d 663, 667 (citing <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 846 P.2d 1025; <em>State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b625  As the State concedes, this case falls within the foregoing exception. Waters argues that certain portions of the written judgment conflict with the oral pronouncement of sentence and, thus, that the conflicting portions of the written sentence are \u201cinvalid.\u201d Waters alleges in essence that the extra sentencing conditions contained in the written judgment are illegal under the authority of <em>Lane. </em>For that reason, his claim comes within the exception discussed in <em>Nelson. </em>We hold that Waters\u2019 sentencing claim is not procedurally barred by \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA, and is therefore reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b626 The State acknowledges that the oral pronouncement of Waters\u2019 sentence is the legally valid final judgment pursuant to the new rule of <em>Lane, </em>which is applicable on direct review here. Under <em>Lane, </em>the written sentence is \u201cmere evidence\u201d of the oral sentence. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-40. Thus, \u201cin the event of a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment, the oral pronouncement controls.\u201d Lane, \u00b6 48. The \u201cconflict\u201d at issue in <em>Lane </em>was direct: the sentence, as orally pronounced, had <em>ordered </em>that the defendant would not be paroled until he had completed the prison\u2019s sex offender treatment program; however, the district court, in its written judgment, only <em>recommended </em>that the defendant not be eligible for parole until he completed the sex offender program. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. Hence, we held that the district court\u2019s entry of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to correct the conflict, arising from a \u201cclerical error,\u201d was within the district court\u2019s authority pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b627 The alleged \u201cconflict\u201d in this case is the inclusion of conditions in the District Court\u2019s written judgment that were not expressly enumerated at the oral pronouncement of sentence. While we did not distinguish between the types of conflict which would trigger application of the <em>Lane </em>rule, we agree with the State that the holding <em>o\u00ed Lane </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201clogically extends to omitted provisions as well as to conflicting provisions,\u201d since that holding was premised upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to be present at the time of sentencing. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 40 (adopting the new rule as \u201cmore consistent with Montana\u2019s constitutional and statutory provisions that allow for a defendant to be present at sentencing and be afforded an opportunity to respond ...\u201d). Therefore, \u201c \u2018a defendant is sentenced <em>in absentia </em>when the judgment and commitment order is allowed to control when there is a conflict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting <em>United States v. Villano </em>(10th Cir. 1987), 816 F.2d 1448, 1452-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b628 As mentioned previously, the District Court orally imposed only the following conditions on Waters\u2019 sentence: (1) a term of five years with two years suspended; (2) restitution; and (3) joint and several liability for his co-defendant\u2019s issuance of bad checks. However, there are numerous sentencing conditions in the District Court\u2019s Sentencing Order borrowed from either or both the PSI and Plea Agreement which were omitted from the oral pronouncement of sentence, as well as two extra conditions in the written Sentencing Order which were neither contained in the PSI or Plea Agreement nor imposed orally by the court. Regarding the conditions of parole contained in either or both the PSI and Plea Agreement, the State suggests that since the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence expressly \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d the Plea Agreement and PSI and since those documents contained the parole conditions imposed by the court in its written judgment, this Court should find no \u201cconflict\u201d under <em>Lane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b629 We are troubled by the implications of the State\u2019s contention that \u201c[w]here, as here, the document is part of the record and is known to the defendant, there is no ambiguity in the oral pronouncement of the sentence, and the defendant has not been sentenced <em>in absentia.\u201d </em>As Waters asserts, the State\u2019s position would \u201ceffectively gut\u201d the holding of <em>Lane. </em>The State would have this Court hold that a trial court is not required under <em>Lane </em>to \u201cread aloud each parole or probation condition\u201d at the oral pronouncement of sentence so long as the court expressly referred to an \u201cincorporated document\u201d containing the condition or conditions. Under this interpretation of <em>Lane, </em>a district court could simply pronounce that a defendant would be sentenced according to conditions contained in an outside document without putting the defendant on notice as to which particular sentencing conditions were being imposed, thereby denying the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>dant his or her constitutional and statutory rights to be present at the time of sentencing and to respond to the court\u2019s sentence. This would clearly result in a defendant being sentenced <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b630 As we noted in <em>Lane, </em>the oral pronouncement of sentence controls \u201ceven if contrary to the trial judge\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing <em>United States v. Munoz-Dela Rosa </em>(9th Cir. 1974), 495 F.2d 253, 256). Therefore, \u201c \u2018[i]t is <em>incumbent upon a sentencing judge to choose his [or her] words carefully so that the defendant is aware of his [or her] sentence when he [or she] leaves the </em>courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting <em>Villano, </em>816 F.2d at 1452-53) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b631  We cannot agree, however, with Waters\u2019 contention, pursuant to <em>Lane, </em>that the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of a term of years, restitution, and joint and several liability are the only sentencing conditions which can be lawfully imposed upon him. According to Waters, he should be excused from his two-year suspended sentence since the court failed to orally enumerate his specific parole conditions, and he should also be excused from having to pay restitution within six months of the discharge of sentence since the court failed to orally mention any specific conditions for the payment of restitution. Being mindful of the need to apply <em>Lane </em>in a principled manner and yet reach a reasonable result in this appeal, we determine that the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence was ambiguous. Under <em>Lane, </em>a written judgment may \u201chelp clarify an ambiguous oral sentence by providing evidence of what was stated at sentencing.\u201d Lane, \u00b6 37 (citing <em>Villano, </em>816 F.2d at 1452). Consequently, we hold that the written enumeration of the specific parole conditions and the amount and terms of paying restitution in the District Court\u2019s Sentencing Order were merely clarifications of ambiguous sentencing conditions imposed orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b632 Regarding the ambiguous conditions, the District Court orally pronounced that Waters would receive a suspended sentence and be liable for restitution, but failed to elaborate on the specific parole conditions to which he would be subject or the terms and conditions for paying restitution. Nevertheless, we note that during the course of the sentencing hearing, Waters acknowledged that he had \u201cread and discussed\u201d the PSI and the Addendum to the PSI, and further testified that he would be \u201chappy to follow\u201d any of the conditions of probation or parole set forth in the Plea Agreement. At the oral pronouncement of sentence, the District Court clearly put Waters on notice that he was receiving a suspended sentence subject to the parole condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tions listed in the PSI and Plea Agreement and that he was liable for restitution under the sentence. There is no indication that, when the District Court orally pronounced sentence, Waters was denied an opportunity to respond to the sentence at that time and ask for clarification. While it would be far preferable, under the authority of <em>Lane, </em>for a sentencing judge to elaborate the specific conditions and sub-conditions at the oral pronouncement of sentence, where, as here, a defendant was clearly put on notice of sentencing conditions and given a sufficient opportunity to respond to those conditions and ask for clarification, that defendant should not be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"AFa\">\u00b633  As noted before, there were two extra conditions in the District Court\u2019s Sentencing Order which were not contained in either or both the PSI and Plea Agreement: (1) payment of supervision fees; and (2) submission to Texas authorities. Regarding the payment of supervision fees, the State argues that even though that condition was not included in the oral pronouncement of sentence, the collection of probation and parole supervision fees by the clerk of court is statutorily mandated and would be imposed on a defendant regardless of whether a court ordered that condition. We cannot agree with the State\u2019s absolutist argument. The statute in question provides that a district court \u201cmay reduce or waive the fee or suspend the monthly payment of the fee if it determines that the payment would cause the probationer or parolee a significant financial hardship.\u201d Section 46-23-1031(l)(b), MCA. There is no evidence that Waters was put on notice by the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence that he would be required to pay supervision fees, nor offered an opportunity to respond to that condition and request that the court reduce or waive those fees on account of financial hardship. Thus, that condition must be stricken from the written sentence <em>unless </em>the District Court determines on remand that payment of supervision fees would not impose a \u201csignificant financial hardship\u201d on Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b634 Regarding submission to Texas authorities, that sentencing condition was contained in neither the PSI nor Plea Agreement and was never mentioned by the District Court at the oral pronouncement of sentence. We hold that this condition falls squarely within the rule of \u201cconflict\u201d announced in <em>Lane </em>and, therefore, that Waters was effectively sentenced <em>in absentia </em>as to that condition. Hence, the oral pronouncement of sentence controls and that condition must be stricken from Waters\u2019 written sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u00b635 We remand this case for entry of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order amending the written sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA, to conform with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b636 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
