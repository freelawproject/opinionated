She appeals two aspects of the sentence imposed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly ordered Kober to compensate Montana State University for its investigative efforts; and</p>\n<p id=\"ADH\">\u00b64 2. Whether the court properly denied Kober\u2019s request for credit against restitution for tax monies she paid to the Montana Department of Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b65 Debra Kober worked for the Student Health Service at Montana State University from October 1979 to December 1996. Her job included collecting all of the cash payments made to the Student Health Service, compiling daily deposits, and taking them to the University\u2019s business office. An investigation which began in 1996 revealed that Kober was stealing cash from the Student Health Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b66 In January 1998, the State charged Kober with five counts of felony theft, for five different time periods between 1984 and 1996. The parties later stipulated that Kober had taken a total of $189,773 from the Student Health Service. Because the money Kober stole was taxable income which she and her husband failed to report on their taxes, she was also charged with failing to properly report income for purposes of state income tax, in five counts correlating to the time frames set forth in the theft counts against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b67 Kober pled guilty to all of the counts of failure to report income for tax purposes, and to all but one of the felony theft charges. She was sentenced to six months in the Gallatin County Detention Center on each of the five counts of failure to pay income taxes, all suspended on the condition that she perform 250 hours of community service. On the first felony theft count, she was sentenced to serve five years under the supervision of the Montana Department of Corrections, with a recommendation that she serve at least six months of that time in prison. On the remaining counts of felony theft, Kober was given a total of thirty years\u2019 suspended sentence, with the condition that she pay restitution of $208,353 \u2014 the $189,773 stipulated as the amount she had stolen, plus $18,620 in expenses incurred by Montana State University in its investigation of the thefts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u00b68 Did the District Court properly order Kober to compensate Montana State University for its investigative efforts?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\u00b69 Section 46-18-241(1), MCA, requires that district courts order offenders \u201cto make full restitution to any victim of the offense who has sustained pecuniary loss as a result of the offense, including a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>person suffering an economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d The amount of restitution ordered by the court is based in part upon the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. Sections 46-18-242 and -244, MCA. Section 46-18-243(1), MCA, defines \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities, including without limitation the money equivalent of loss resulting from property taken, destroyed, broken, or otherwise harmed and out-of-pocket losses, such as medical expenses, loss of income, expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services that the victim would have performed if not injured, expenses reasonably incurred in attending court proceedings related to the commission of the offense, and reasonable expenses related to funeral and burial or crematory services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">(b) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b6 10 Kober argues that the use of the word \u201cand\u201d in the above definition of pecuniary loss requires that the district court must find that the victim\u2019s loss is both a \u201cspecial damage\u201d and \u201creasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.\u201d She asserts that because the bulk of the investigative costs were not out-of-pocket expenses, but instead represented salaries and hourly wages that would have been incurred regardless of her actions, these costs were not pecuniary losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b6 11 A threshold problem with this argument is that Kober did not make the argument to the District Court. This Court has repeatedly held that a party may not change its theory on appeal from the one advanced in the district court and may not raise an argument for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, \u00b6 25, 293 Mont. 490, \u00b6 25, 977 P.2d 983, \u00b6 25. Accordingly, we decline to review Kober\u2019s argument regarding the definition of pecuniary loss and her claim that she was not responsible under the restitution statutes for paying the University the $18,620 cost of its investigative audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b6 12 Did the court properly deny Kober\u2019s request for credit against restitution for tax monies she paid to the Montana Department of Revenue?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b613 This Court reviews the imposition of a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Richards </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 322, 324, 948 P.2d 240, 241. Our standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Richards, </em>285 Mont. at 324, 948 P.2d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b614 Kober and her husband sold their family home between the time she pled guilty to the charges against her and the date of her sentencing hearing. From the proceeds of that sale, $46,004.67 was paid to the Montana Department of Revenue to satisfy its lien for back income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b615 Kober argues that because these monies were then placed in the state general fund, from which Montana State University receives part of its funding, Montana State University will benefit from the back income taxes she paid. She asserts that in order to avoid a windfall to Montana State University, the court should have reduced her restitution obligation by $46,004.67. Kober cites cases from other states, and, from Montana, <em>State v. Fertterer </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 73, 841 P.2d 467, <em>overruled by State v. Gatts </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 42, 928 P.2d 114, for the propositions that restitution amounts should not provide the victim with unjust enrichment and should reflect offsets for payments which the victim has already received.</p>\n<p id=\"AHe\">\u00b616 Kober suggests that the Student Health Service or Montana State University will be unjustly enriched if she does not receive an offset. She has not, however, established that any of the $46,004.67, let alone the entire amount, will actually benefit Montana State University or the Student Health Service. The director of the Student Health Service testified that it is supported from prepaid fees charged along with a student\u2019s tuition and fees for specific services provided to specific students. According to its director, the Student Health Service receives its operational funds through these fees, and not through the general fund. Therefore, Kober has not established that the $46,004.67 paid to the Department of Revenue will ever be distributed to her victim, the Student Health Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b617  Moreover, as the District Court recognized, if Kober eventually manages to pay off her entire restitution obligation, the amount will essentially represent an interest-free loan. In short, Kober has not established that the victim of her crimes will receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>windfall or be unjustly enriched as a result of the District Court\u2019s judgment. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kober\u2019s request for a credit against restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-5\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
