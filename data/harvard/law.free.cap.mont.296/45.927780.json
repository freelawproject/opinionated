(the Cooperative) provides electric service to property where Appellant, Bonnie Granbois, lives. The property is located on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. When Bonnie Granbois moved her trailer onto the property, the Cooperative informed her that before she could receive electric service, a delinquent bill of the person who previously lived on the property would have to be paid. Thus, Granbois paid $932.07 to satisfy the bill. Thereafter, she brought an action against the Cooperative, alleging that its actions constituted an unfair trade practice in violation of \u00a7 30-14-103, MCA, and that it breached its obligation to deal with her in good faith. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted judgment in favor of the Cooperative. Granbois appeals, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b62 We restate the dispositive issues in this case as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the Cooperative\u2019s bylaw provision, requiring payment of an existing member\u2019s delinquency prior to transfer of the membership to a new member, is reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">\u00b64 2. Is a condition of receiving electric service on Indian trust land subject to paying a prior customer\u2019s delinquent bill, in effect, a lien or encumbrance upon the land in violation of federal law?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">\u00b65 By resolving the first issue in the negative, we obviate the need to address the second issue in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">\u00b66 The Cooperative is incorporated pursuant to Montana\u2019s Rural Electric and Telephone Act, now codified at Title 35, Chapter 18 of the Montana Code Annotated. The Cooperative provides the only electric service available to the property involved in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">\u00b67 The property is a 40-acre parcel of Indian trust land located on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Big Horn County. It is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of several owners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>who have undivided interests in the land. One owner is the daughter of Bonnie Granbois and the wife of Jerry Spang, who lived on the property before Granbois. Granbois\u2019s other children also have ownership interests in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b68 In 1992, the Cooperative constructed a single service line onto the property to service Spang\u2019s mobile home. The line was constructed as a result of Spang\u2019s \u201cApplication for Membership and Electric Service.\u201d In his application, he agreed to pay a minimum charge for electric service until February 25, 1997, as a condition for membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b69 In March 1995 the Cooperative terminated Spang\u2019s electric service because he was delinquent in his payments in the amount of $932.07. Spang eventually removed his mobile home from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b610 Two years later, when Granbois decided to move her mobile home onto the property, the Cooperative instructed Granbois that Spang\u2019s delinquent bill must be paid before his membership to the Cooperative could be transferred to her as a new member. In addition, Granbois paid $299.50 in normal charges associated with a new membership. Electric service was then resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b611 The bylaws of the Cooperative provide that the amount of a member\u2019s delinquent payments becomes a charge against the membership certificate \u201cwhich must be paid when the membership is transferred to another person.\u201d The bylaws expressly provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[T]he amount of any delinquent amounts unpaid by any consumer and/or member of the Cooperative shall become a lien upon the property served or a charge against the membership certificate of any consumer or member, which must be paid when the membership is transferred to another person, provided, that in the event the property is being served under the delinquent membership is Indian lands, whether allotted lands or tribal lands, said charge shall not become a lien upon such allotted or tribal Indian lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5m\">Because the Cooperative does not allow multiple memberships at any single meter location where a current membership exists, a membership must be terminated at a particular location before a new member may receive electric service at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b6 12 After Granbois paid Spang\u2019s delinquent bill and became a member of the Cooperative, she commenced this action. Her complaint, which was filed on August 27,1997, alleged that the Cooperative used its superior bargaining position against her and that its actions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>stituted an unfair trade practice in violation of \u00a7 30-14-103, MCA. She requested actual damages in the amount of $932.07 and treble damages, pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-133, MCA. She also alleged that the Cooperative breached its obligation to deal with her in good faith and that she should be entitled to recover punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b6 13 This matter was eventually submitted to the District Court on stipulated facts, and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In her brief in support of her motion for summary judgment, Granbois asked the District Court to enter partial summary judgment in her favor on the issue of liability and unfair trade practice damages, reserving the issue of punitive damages for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b614 On October 5,1998, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Cooperative from which Granbois appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b615 On appeal from a summary judgment, this Court reviews a case <em>de novo </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>See Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (citing <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663). Since the parties submitted this case with a stipulation of the material facts, we must therefore determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 377, 945 P.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b6 16 Whether the Cooperative\u2019s bylaw provision, requiring payment of an existing member\u2019s delinquency prior to transfer of the membership to a new member, is reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\u00b617 The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Big Horn and denied Granbois\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the bylaw provision which restricts transfer of a membership to a new member until delinquent accounts are made current, was reasonable as a matter of law. In doing so, it recognized that this Court addressed a similar issue in our decision in <em>Howe v. Big Horn Elec. Coop., Inc. </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 297, 670 P.2d 936, but concluded that our analysis of the issue in <em>Howe </em>was dicta and not dispositive. The District Court was persuaded by two Idaho cases, <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. East End Mut. Elec. Co. </em>(Idaho Ct. App. 1987), 735 P.2d 1073 and <em>Stevenson v. Prairie Power Coop., Inc. </em>(Idaho 1990), 794 P.2d 620 which addressed similar issues. The District Court ultimately rested its decision on the basis that cooperatives are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>exempt from regulatory control because of the unique relationship between a cooperative and its members. It determined that because of that relationship being contractual in nature, courts should not unnecessarily interfere with the parties\u2019 freedom to contract. The District Court concluded that a cooperative may place restrictions on the transfer of memberships through the enactment of bylaws. It further reasoned that the restrictions on membership are \u201cto protect other members from bearing the economic consequences of the outgoing member\u2019s default.\u201d <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>735 P.2d at 1077. Finally, the court stated that Big Horn\u2019s policy, expressed in the applicable bylaw provisions, was a reasonable means of achieving its goal of protecting its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b618 Section 35-18-301, MCA, specifically authorizes a cooperative to create restrictions on memberships. In particular, \u00a7 35-18-301(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[mjembership in the cooperative shall not be transferable, except as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may prescribe additional qualifications and limitations in respect to membership.\u201d A Cooperative has the statutory power to adopt, amend, and repeal its bylaws, pursuant to \u00a7 35-18-106(11), MCA. Section 35-18-207, MCA, grants cooperatives broad flexibility to adopt bylaws defining the rights and duties of its members and the regulation and management of cooperative affairs. According to the stipulated facts, the members of the Cooperative duly adopted bylaws subsequent to the Cooperative\u2019s incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b619 In <em>Howe, </em>we considered an electric cooperative\u2019s formal policy which allowed the manager of the cooperative to disconnect service to a member or customer who failed to pay the fees incurred for the service. <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 299, 670 P.2d at 937. The facts in <em>Howe </em>were similar to the facts presented here. Attempting to secure electrical service for her home, a potential cooperative member agreed to pay ten dollars per month toward a previous member\u2019s delinquent bill until it was paid in full, plus her own fees, to acquire electric service. When the customer was unable to pay the full amount of the bill each month, she paid only her fees and one dollar toward the delinquent amount. <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 298-99, 670 P.2d at 937. Eventually, the cooperative disconnected her service. <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 299, 670 P.2d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b620 The Court in <em>Howe </em>faced the question of whether the cooperative\u2019s actions in disconnecting the member\u2019s service were reasonable. The parties stipulated to the material facts and further stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>that the dispositive issue was \u201cwhether the policies and by-laws of the Electric Cooperative regarding the refusal of service based upon charges against the land is [sic] valid and <em>proper.\u2019\u2019Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 299, 670 P.2d at 937. On appeal, however, the appellant framed the issue as, \u201cMay a rural electric cooperative make electric service to one customer contingent upon payment of the delinquent bill of another customer?\u201d <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 299, 670 P.2d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b621 We concluded in <em>Howe </em>that the issue as framed could not be resolved on the basis of the record presented. <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 299-300, 670 P.2d at 937. We agreed with the District Court\u2019s finding that the policy of the Co-op allowing disconnection of service for nonpayment of fees was reasonable. However, we remanded the matter because we determined that the dispositive issue was not whether the policy was reasonable but whether its implementation was reasonable. We stated that this question could not be answered on the facts presented. It was clear from the record that the District Court assumed that the appellant had voluntarily agreed to pay for the previous customer\u2019s bill, thus making it reasonable to disconnect for nonpayment. We observed, however, that there was a basic disagreement between the parties as to whether the customer voluntarily agreed to make the payment or was required to do so as a condition of receiving service. We remanded the matter with instructions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">The District Court must find whether the agreement to pay was voluntary, or a result of unequal bargaining power to judge the reasonableness of the Co-op\u2019s use of Policy 24A. <em>It is unreasonable for a Co-op to use its superior bargaining position to force a prospective member to pay another member\u2019s delinquent bill and terminate service for nonpayment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 301-02, 670 P.2d at 938 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b622 On remand our message to the District Court was clear: If it determined that the appellant had voluntarily paid the previous member\u2019s unpaid bill, then the implementation of the policy, that is, disconnection of service for nonpayment, was reasonable. However, if the District Court determined that the appellant was forced to pay the previous member\u2019s unpaid bill in order to get the service connected, the implementation was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b623 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as in <em>Howe, </em>the parties stipulated to the relevant facts and the matter was submitted to the District Court on cross motions for summary judgment. The wording of the bylaw provision at issue in this case is different than the one we examined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Howe. </em>In fact, the bylaw in question here, rather than simply providing that unpaid bills may result in a disconnection of electrical service, provides that delinquent accounts must be paid when a membership is transferred to another person. The Big Horn staff advised Granbois that the Spang membership would not be transferred and there would be no electrical services provided until the delinquency was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b624 Writing for the unanimous Court in <em>Howe, </em>Justice Harrison discussed the unique relationship between a cooperative and its membership. He recognized that electric cooperatives inherently hold a favored position in the law, and that conversely, cooperative members are often in a disadvantageous position with respect to the cooperative. This disadvantage is heightened in rural areas which are less likely to be serviced by a public utility and where citizens must rely on the cooperative for power. In dealing with an unreasonable rule, a member has only limited options: attempt to amend the rule or discontinue service. He said that such remedies, in and of themselves, are inadequate, especially when the member\u2019s residence is already connected with the cooperative and finding an alternative supply of electricity would be quite costly. <em>Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 300, 670 P.2d at 937-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b625 Accordingly, this Court concluded that although the relationship between the electric cooperative and each of its members is contractual in nature, as defined by the cooperative\u2019s bylaws, rules, and regulations, the bylaws, rules, and regulations, as well as their implementation, must be reasonable. <em>See Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 300-01, 670 P.2d at 938. We stated quite clearly in <em>Howe </em>that \u201c[i]t is unreasonable for a Co-op to use its superior bargaining position to force a prospective member to pay another members\u2019s delinquent bill and terminate service for <em>nonpayment.\u201dHowe, </em>206 Mont. at 301-02, 670 P.2d at 938. We conclude that the bylaw provisions at issue here, that make transfer of a membership to a new member contingent on the previous member\u2019s delinquent bill being paid in full, are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b626 In reaching its decision that the bylaw provisions were reasonable, the District Court failed to consider whether the Cooperative\u2019s bylaws were reasonable to the potential consumer who has no other source for electric power. While existing Cooperative members protect themselves by not having to share in the debt of a delinquent member, the potential consumer may be forced to take on the burden of the debt to obtain electric service. This is especially true in sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tions like the one presented here, where a potential consumer is required to obtain a membership transfer instead of obtaining a \u201cnew\u201d membership, and when no other electric service provider is available. The Cooperative argues that it didn\u2019t require Granbois to pay the bill, it just required the bill to be paid in full before electrical service would be provided. Such a policy, however, unmistakably and unreasonably allows the Cooperative to pressure the new tenant or occupant of the property to pay the previous member\u2019s delinquent bill. There is simply no incentive whatsoever for the Cooperative to pursue payment from the person who actually owes the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b627  Thus, there is more at issue than a potential consumer simply trying to meet an electric cooperative\u2019s conditions in obtaining a membership certificate. If a previous member vacates the premises leaving a delinquent account, the bylaws effectively allow the Cooperative to compel the new consumer to either pay the predecessor\u2019s delinquent bill or go without electricity. Such a disparity in the relative positions of the consumer and the cooperative necessarily requires the cooperative to deal with its members reasonably. The rule adopted by the Cooperative in this instance, that is, requiring potential customers to pay a previous member\u2019s delinquent bill in full is an unreasonable restriction on the electric consumer\u2019s access to electric service. Thus, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Cooperative and remand this matter with instructions to enter partial summary judgment in favor of Granbois in the amount of $932.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b628 Since the District Court entered judgment in favor of the Cooperative, it never reached Granbois\u2019s claim that the actions of the Cooperative constitute a violation of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, (the Act) \u00a7\u00a7 30-14-101, et seq., MCA, specifically, \u00a7 30-14-133, MCA, which entitle her to treble damages. Nevertheless, the parties, as well as <em>amicus, </em>have partially briefed the issue on appeal. Under the circumstances, we feel it best to provide direction to the District Court on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b629 The Cooperative asserts that it is exempt from the Act because it sells a product or service as a public utility, which is excluded from protection as provided in the definition section, \u00a7 30-14-202(1), MCA. This provision is found in part 2 of the Act which is entitled \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b630 Granbois\u2019s claim, however, is brought under part 1 of the Act which is entitled \u201cConsumer Protection Act.\u201d The exemption provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>sion in Part 1, found at \u00a7 30-14-105(1), MCA, specifically exempts \u201cactions or transactions permitted under laws administered by the Montana public service commission acting under statutory authority of this part or the United States.\u201d This exemption does not include the Cooperative since the Cooperative is not regulated by the PSC. Part 1 clearly exempts only those transactions regulated by the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b631 It is apparent that the legislature provided different exemption provisions in parts 1 and 2. While part 1 offers general consumer protection, part 2 primarily covers anti-competitive practices to protect businesses from the predatory practices of other businesses. Since Granbois\u2019s claim is brought under part 1, we conclude that the Cooperative is not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b632 The remaining matters to be determined are whether the actions of the Cooperative constitute a violation of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, whether the actions constitute a breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing as alleged by Granbois, and finally whether she is entitled to any further damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b633 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b77-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b77-8\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u00b634 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on the sole issue stated because Howe\u2014 the only case cited by the Court \u2014 clearly does not support the Court\u2019s decision. I also dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to address the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u00b635 The Court properly observes that, in the similar <em>Howe </em>case, we agreed with the district court that \u201cthe policy of the Co-op allowing disconnection of service for nonpayment of fees [relating in part to a prior member\u2019s delinquency] was reasonable.\u201d <em>See Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 301, 670 P.2d at 938 (emphasis added). The Court also correctly notes that we remanded in <em>Howe </em>for a determination of whether the implementation of the reasonable policy was reasonable \u2014 that is, whether the plaintiff had voluntarily agreed to pay the delinquency, as the cooperative contended, or had been forced or required to do so, as the plaintiff alleged. <em>See Howe, </em>206 Mont. at 301-02, 670 P.2d at 938. In purported reliance on <em>Howe, </em>the Court in this similar case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>then concludes that the bylaw provisions here \u2014 comparable to the policy we determined was reasonable in <em>Howe </em>\u2014 is unreasonable as a matter of law. I cannot understand how <em>Howe's </em>opposite conclusion on the policy at issue there can be used to support the Court\u2019s decision here. Indeed, with regard to the reasonableness of the bylaw provisions at issue here, it is clear that <em>Howe </em>mandates that we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b636 Thus, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Cooperative\u2019s bylaw provision at issue here is unreasonable as a matter of law because that conclusion is totally at odds with our decision in <em>Howe. </em>Moreover, while I agree that a potential member\u2019s interests must be balanced with those of existing members, I disagree with the Court\u2019s implicit determination that the interests of existing members must give way as a matter of law to those of a potential new member. The Court\u2019s decision ignores both the interests of existing members of the Cooperative and the statutory authority of cooperatives to set the terms by which memberships can be transferred. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-18-301(2), MCA. Indeed, I fear this decision will unravel the entire basis on which cooperatives have organized and managed themselves in Montana for six decades or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b637 In addition, I simply cannot square the Court\u2019s instructions to the District Court to enter partial summary judgment for Granbois in the amount of $932.07 with its subsequent statement that matters remaining to be determined are whether the Cooperative\u2019s actions violated the Act and/or breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Here, the only two causes of action alleged by Granbois are violation of the Act and breach of the covenant. If, as the Court says, the merits of Granbois\u2019 claims under those two theories remain to be decided, what is the basis for entering judgment in her favor for a specified amount of damages? The Court does not explain and I am unaware of any legal principle under which damages can be awarded to a plaintiff as a matter of law prior to any decision that a defendant is liable for damages. This will make for interesting proceedings on remand, at the very least, and may prove to be an interesting precedent in future cases as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b638 For these reasons, I would affirm the District Court and would not address the Act itself or its applicability here. The Court having done so, however, I feel compelled to comment briefly on its discussion. In the guise of \u201cproviding] direction\u201d to the District Court on this issue never addressed there, the Court actually resolves the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of whether the Cooperative is exempt from the Act. In my opinion, it is both unwise and unnecessary for this Court to fall into the trap of addressing every issue parties brief on appeal, when the underlying proceedings never reached the stage of addressing such issues. To do so only increases our workload while, at the same time, intruding this Court into the proper realm of the district courts which are more than capable of making such determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">\u00b639 I would affirm the District Court and I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
