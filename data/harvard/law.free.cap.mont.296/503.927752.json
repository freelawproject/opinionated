Whether Weaselboy preserved his objection to a dog\u2019s \u201cfree-sniff \u201d of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">\u00b65 2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the warrantless seizure of drugs from Weaselboy\u2019s car met the requirements of the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence \u201cto determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of <em>law.\u201d State v. Stucker, </em>1999 MT 14, \u00b6 31, 293 Mont. 123, \u00b6 31, 973 P.2d 835, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">\u00b67 Late-one evening in July, 1997 two Billings police officers saw Weaselboy drive through a red light. The officers activated their car\u2019s flashing lights and pursued Weaselboy. Six blocks after the start of the chase, Weaselboy finally stopped his car in the middle of a road in a construction zone near a barricade. Officer Walters went to Weaselboy\u2019s car and asked him for proof of insurance and his driver\u2019s license. Weaselboy told Officer Walters that he did not have his license but gave him proof of insurance and registration and threw his wallet down near the car\u2019s console. Officer Walters returned to his car, called police dispatch, and determined that there was an outstanding warrant for Weaselboy\u2019s arrest on the charge of felony assault. Officer Walters returned to Weaselboy\u2019s car and told him that there was an outstanding warrant and asked Weaselboy to get out of the car. Appearing nervous, Weaselboy emerged from his car, left his keys in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ignition, and locked and closed the driver\u2019s side door. Officer Walters arrested Weaselboy and placed him in Officer Walters\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b68 Suspecting that Weaselboy\u2019s conduct meant that he was concealing drugs in his car, Officer Walters radioed for the assistance of a canine officer. Canine Officer Lamb and his partner, Tico, responded to the scene. Officer Lamb commanded Tico to perform a \u201cfree sniff\u201d around the exterior of Weaselboy\u2019s car (hereafter, Tico\u2019s free-sniff). Tico, trained and certified in the detection of illegal drugs, made \u201caggressive indications\u201d by the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s doors that Officer Lamb recognized as signals for the presence of illegal drugs. Officer Lamb so advised Officer Walters.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b69 Because Weaselboy had locked his keys inside his car, Officer Walters assumed that he would have to summon a tow truck to move the car off the road. However, Officer Lamb discovered that the passenger side door was unlocked. Without Weaselboy\u2019s consent, Officer Walters opened the passenger side door to retrieve Weaselboy\u2019s keys from the ignition. In opening the door and retrieving the car keys, Officer Walters observed several plastic baggies in plain view on the floor of the car. Officer Walters removed the baggies; they each contained yellow rock-like substances that he believed to be methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b610 Weaselboy moved to suppress the evidence obtained from his car. However, his counsel stated during the suppression hearing that he did not believe that Tico\u2019s free-sniff was a search. The District Court denied Weaselboy\u2019s motion to suppress. The District Court determined that the police officers had a particularized suspicion to stop Weaselboy after he ran the red light and that Tico\u2019s free-sniff was not a search. The District Court further concluded that probable cause arose when Tico signaled the presence of drugs in the car. Finally, the District Court concluded that the warrantless seizure of drugs from Weaselboy\u2019s car was justified under the automotive and plain view exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of a warrant for a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b611 Weaselboy pled guilty to Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (felony) but reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. In June, 1998 Weaselboy was sentenced to five years prison with all five years suspended. Weaselboy was placed on probation concurrent with a sentence that he received in another criminal case. Weaselboy appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b6 12 Weaselboy concedes that at the suppression hearing, his counsel opined that Tico\u2019s free-sniff was not a search. However, Weaselboy argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object did not prevent the District Court from fully considering the issue. Weaselboy urges that this Court can hear the issue under \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA; however, he does not explain how those statutory provisions apply in the present case. Weaselboy also argues that this Court can hear the issue under the doctrine of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b6 13 The State responds that Weaselboy failed to preserve this issue, that he does not meet the requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA, and that the doctrine of plain error should not apply because this Court\u2019s failure to review the alleged error would not result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u00b614 Section 46-20-104, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Scope of appeal by defendant. (1) An appeal may be taken by the defendant only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">(2) Upon appeal from a judgment, the court may review the verdict or decision and any alleged error objected to which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\u00b615 Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, provides in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">(2) Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded. A claim alleging an error affecting jurisdictional or constitutional rights may not be noticed on appeal if the alleged error was not objected to as provided in 46-20-104, unless the convicted person establishes that the error was prejudicial as to the convicted person\u2019s guilt or punishment and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(a) the right asserted in the claim did not exist at the time of the trial and has been determined to be retroactive in its application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">(b) the prosecutor, the judge, or a law enforcement agency suppressed evidence from the convicted person or the convicted person\u2019s attorney that prevented the claim from being raised and disposed of; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">(c) material and controlling facts upon which the claim is predicated were not known to the convicted person or the convicted per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>son\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b616 We hold that Weaselboy failed to preserve his objection to Tico\u2019s free-sniff. The rule is well established that \u201cthis Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory.\u201d <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Moreover, Weaselboy has not alleged any of the grounds recognized under \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b617 Finally, Weaselboy has made no showing that he should benefit from a \u201cplain error\u201d review of his belated objection to Tico\u2019s free-sniff. In <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzQ\">this Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the applicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"><em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. We conclude that <em>Finley </em>has no application in the present case. Because our holding that Weaselboy did not preserve his objection to Tico\u2019s free-sniff is dispositive, we do not address Weaselboy\u2019s arguments concerning whether Tico\u2019s free-sniff was a search and whether the police had particularized suspicion to search his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b618 2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the warrantless seizure of drugs from Weaselboy\u2019s car met the requirements of the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u00b619 Weaselboy argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the plain view doctrine applies in the present case. Weaselboy asserts that the testimonies of Officers Walters and Lamb \u201care both internally inconsistent and inherently unreliable\u201d regarding the baggies found in his car. Weaselboy suggests further that it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d that an officer with a suspicion that a car has drugs would enter the car \u201cmerely\u201d to retrieve the car keys. Finally, Weaselboy argues that the baggies were not in \u201cplain view\u201d and that when Officer Walters retrieved the car keys, he did not need to enter the car \u201cfar enough so that a view could be had of the area under the seat or between the seat and the console.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u00b620 The State responds that the warrantless seizure of drugs from Weaselboy\u2019s car was justified under the plain view doctrine. The State notes that Weaselboy does not dispute that the officers were entitled to enter the vehicle to remove the keys. Further, the State argues that the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the motives of the officers in entering the car are not clearly erroneous and that determinations about the credibility of testimony are within the discretion of a district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b621 Warrantless searches are \u201cper se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d Katz <em>v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585. Section 46-5-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">Searches and seizures \u2014 when authorized. A search of a person, object, or place may be made and evidence, contraband, and persons may be seized in accordance with Title 46 when a search is made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">(1) by the authority of a search warrant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">(2) in accordance with judicially recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Section 46-5-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\u00b622  One exception to the warrant requirement is the plain view doctrine. Under the plain view doctrine, peace officers may in certain circumstances seize evidence in plain view without a warrant. <em>See State v. Loh </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 460, 468, 914 P.2d 592, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">\u00b623 <em>In Loh, </em>this Court adopted the plain view doctrine as set forth in <em>Horton v. California </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 128, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112. The <em>Loh </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">The essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence is that the officer must be lawfully at the place from which he could plainly view the evidence. In other words, his initial entry onto or intrusion into the place where he views the evidence must not have been in violation of the Fourth Amendment or in violation of Article II, section 11 of Montana\u2019s Constitution. In addition, there are two conditions that must be satisfied to justify the warrantless seizure under the plain view doctrine. First, the item must be in plain view and its incriminating character be \u201cimmediately apparent.\u201d Second, not only must the officer be lawfully located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen but he or she must also have a lawful right of access to the object itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b624 We consider each one <em>oiLoh\u2019s </em>requirements in the present case. First, Weaselboy does not dispute that when the police entered his car to retrieve the keys, they were lawfully in the car. Weaselboy suggests, however, that the real purpose of the officers was to look for drugs, not to retrieve the keys. We have previously concluded that \u201c[t]he weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses are exclusively within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Doyle, </em>1998 MT 195, \u00b6 18, 290 Mont. 287, \u00b6 18, 963 P.2d 1255, \u00b6 18 (citation omitted). The District Court determined that the officers entered the car to retrieve the keys, and we will not disturb that determination on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">\u00b625 Second, Weaselboy suggests that the drugs seized were not in plain view of the officers. However, based on the officers\u2019 testimonies, the District Court determined that the baggies were in plain view, and we will not disturb that determination on appeal. <em>Compare State v. Ahmed </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 200, 212, 924 P.2d 679, 686 (concluding \u201ccredibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are to be determined by the trier of fact\u201d) (citations omitted). We note moreover that Weaselboy does not dispute that the \u201cincriminating character\u201d of the baggies was immediately apparent. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b626 We therefore address <em>Loh\u2019s </em>last requirement that \u201cnot only must the officer be lawfully located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen but he or she must also have a lawful right of access to the object <em>itself.\u201dLoh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 600. In the present case, we have already determined that Officer Walters was lawfully in the car. Having lawfully entered Weaselboy\u2019s car to retrieve the keys and move the car, Officer Walters had a lawful right of access to the contraband that was in plain view inside the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b627  We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the warrantless seizure of contraband from Weaselboy\u2019s car was justified under the plain view doctrine. Because this holding is dispositive, we do not address Weaselboy\u2019s arguments regarding the automotive exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
