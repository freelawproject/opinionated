We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court violated O\u2019Neill\u2019s right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when it allowed the State of Montana to file an information pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), without first affording O\u2019Neill a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b63 On July 22,1997, the State of Montana (State) petitioned the District Court for leave to file an information in that court charging O\u2019Neill, age 17, with having committed one count of felony burglary and two counts of felony theft on or about July 10,1997. The petition was filed pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(2), MCA (1997), effective July 1, 1997, which mandated the filing of such a petition in the district court, rather than the youth court, when the prosecution desired to charge a youth who was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offense with certain statutorily enumerated offenses, including burglary. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition over O\u2019Neill\u2019s objection. O\u2019Neill pled not guilty to the charges and a jury trial was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u00b64 O\u2019Neill subsequently moved the District Court on due process grounds to reconsider its order allowing the information to be filed and to set a hearing on the basis of which it could determine, under \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA (1997), whether the seriousness of the alleged offenses and the interests of community protection required that the case be filed directly in that court. The State opposed O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion, arguing that the Legislature had deleted the requirement for a hearing contained in \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1995), when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>amended that statute during the 1997 legislative session and that \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), was effective July 1,1997, prior to its petition regarding O\u2019Neill. Moreover, according to the State, O\u2019Neill had not met his burden of establishing that \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA (1997), was unconstitutional. The District Court denied O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion for reconsideration and for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b65 Thereafter, O\u2019Neill and the State entered into a plea agreement. The State agreed 1) to amend the information by charging misdemeanor unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in place of the first count of felony theft alleged in the original information; 2) to recommend a sentence of \u201c10 yrs suspended[;]\u201d and 3) pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204, MCA (1997), to permit O\u2019Neill to appeal the court\u2019s overruling of his objection to the State\u2019s petition for leave to file the information and its subsequent denial of his motion to reconsider and for a hearing. In exchange, O\u2019Neill agreed to plead guilty to the charges set forth in the amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b66 The court allowed the amendment to the information, accepted O\u2019Neill\u2019s guilty pleas to the charges as amended, ordered a presentence investigation report and held a restitution hearing. The District Court entered its Judgment and Commitment on October 29, 1998, and O\u2019Neill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court violate O\u2019Neill\u2019s right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when it allowed the State to file an information pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), without first affording O\u2019Neill a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b68 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that due process did not require a hearing prior to its decision pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA (1997), to permit the State to file an information, rather than proceeding in the youth court, is a conclusion of constitutional law. We review such conclusions to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT 70, \u00b6 7, [294 Mont. 17, \u00b6 7], 977 P.2d 1000, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b69 O\u2019Neill argues, the State concedes and we agree, that we resolved the issue now before us in <em>Butler, </em>which was decided after the District Court\u2019s ruling in the present case. There, we observed that \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA (1997), vests the district court with the final decision regarding whether probable cause exists to believe the youth committed the offense at issue and whether the seriousness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>offense and the interests of community protection are such that the case should be brought in that court. As a result, the court\u2019s decision is a critically important matter to the youth because it could mean \u201cthe difference between being detained until he is 25 years of age if the case is processed in youth court, and losing his life if the case in processed in district court.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 26. We concluded that, absent the opportunity provided by a hearing for the youth to challenge the prosecution\u2019s allegations that there was probable cause to believe the youth committed the offense and that the seriousness of the crime and the interests of community protection required the information to be filed in the district court, the youth did not receive the due process to which he was entitled by the federal constitution. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 27. Consequently, we held that the court violated the youth\u2019s due process rights when it allowed the filing of the information in district court under \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), without first affording him a hearing, and remanded for a hearing prior to the district court rendering a decision pursuant to the statute. <em>See Butler, </em>\u00b6 32. <em>Butler </em>is squarely on point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b610 The only remaining question is whether O\u2019Neill is entitled to retroactive application of <em>Butler. </em>Again, the State concedes that \u2014 under this Court\u2019s jurisprudence \u2014 he is, and, again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"A9A\">\u00b611  Retroactivity requires that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions be applied in an evenhanded manner to those similarly situated in cases pending on direct review or not yet final. <em>See State v. Egelhoff </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 114, 125-26, 900 P.2d 260, 267, <em>rev\u2019d, on other grounds by Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 37, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (citations omitted). <em>Butler </em>created a \u201cnew rule\u201d because it broke new ground and imposed a new obligation on the government which was not dictated by existing precedent. <em>See Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 126, 900 P.2d at 267. Moreover, O\u2019Neill\u2019s notice of appeal in the present case was filed on September 30, 1998, and we did not decide <em>Butler </em>until April 6, 1999. As a result, O\u2019Neill\u2019s case was pending on direct review and not yet final when <em>Butler </em>was decided. <em>See Egelhoff, 272 </em>Mont. at 125-26, 900 P.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b612 The requisites for retroactivity are met here. Therefore, we conclude O\u2019Neill is entitled to retroactive application of <em>Butler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b613  We hold that the District Court violated O\u2019Neill\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Constitution when it allowed the State to file an information pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), without affording O\u2019Neill a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AyY\">\u00b614 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
