We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\u00b63 1. Is the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi Foundation treatment does not qualify as a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by failing to enter sufficient findings of fact to justify its denial of Corliss\u2019 motion to enforce the Decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">\u00b65 On April 15,1992, the District Court entered a Decree dissolving Melvin and Corliss\u2019 marriage. Under the Decree, Melvin was responsible for the medical, dental, optical, hospital and other medical related expenses of the parties\u2019 three minor children and was required to maintain a supplemental insurance policy to cover those expenses not covered by Champ\u00fas, his insurance provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">\u00b66 The court subsequently modified the Decree. Pursuant to the modification, Melvin became responsible for 58%, and Corliss for 42%, of the children\u2019s medical, dental, orthodontic, optical, hospital and other medical related expenses not paid by insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">\u00b67 In 1996, Corliss had problems with the parties\u2019 daughter Hayley which led to police intervention. Hayley was taken to the Cascade County Juvenile Detention Center and, on her release, was placed in foster care for several months and ordered into counseling. Following unsuccessful local counseling, Corliss sought to admit Hayley to the Anasazi Foundation (Anasazi), an outdoor wilderness treatment program for behavioral problems, including drug and alcohol abuse, located in Arizona. She asked Melvin to pay his 58% share of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>penses for Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment, but Melvin refused. Hayley subsequently was admitted to Anasazi for approximately two months, incurring $15,000 in expenses which were decreased to $12,400 by a scholarship. Corliss borrowed her 42% share of the remaining Anasazi bill from her mother and Melvin\u2019s 58% share from her church, on the understanding that she would work in the church library 20 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b68 In June of 1996, Corliss moved the District Court to enforce the medical related expense provision of the Decree by requiring Melvin to pay $7,192 \u2014 58%\u2014of the Anasazi bill for Hayley\u2019s treatment. During the hearing on her motion, Corliss testified about the problems she had had with the parties\u2019 older son, Dan, the positive results from his Anasazi treatment, and the similarities between Dan\u2019s experience and the problems and results she experienced with Hayley. She also testified that Dr. Catherine White, a pediatrician, prescribed treatment at Anasazi for Hayley, but did not recall Dr. White\u2019s diagnosis or produce a copy of the diagnosis or referral. Finally, Corliss testified that a person could send a child to Anasazi without a medical referral and, in fact, the only purpose of the medical referral was to substantiate medical necessity and propriety of treatment for insurance purposes. Melvin testified Corliss simply decided Hayley was going to Anasazi for treatment and asked him to pay his share without giving a specific reason other than that Hayley was unmanageable. He further testified that Champ\u00fas pays for treatment programs that are medically required. While Melvin agreed that Hayley had behavioral problems, he testified that, when Hayley lived with him, he observed disciplinary problems on which he worked with her and made progress. Following the hearing, the District Court orally found that Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment was not a medical expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b69 Corliss subsequently moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s oral determination. The court denied her motion to reconsider and entered an order denying her motion to enforce the Decree\u2019s medical related expense provision by requiring Melvin to pay 58% of the Anasazi bill for Hayley\u2019s treatment. Corliss appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b610 1. Is the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi treatment does not qualify as a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u00b611 The modified Decree provides that Melvin is responsible for 58% of the children\u2019s medical, dental, orthodontic, optical, hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and other medical related expenses not paid by insurance. Corliss moved the District Court to enforce this provision by requiring Melvin to pay his share for Hayley\u2019s treatment at Anasazi.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b6 12 At the conclusion of the hearing on Corliss\u2019 motion, the District Court determined that the parties had agreed to send Dan to Anasazi for treatment, and that since Melvin had not agreed to send Hayley to Anasazi for treatment, the court could require Melvin to pay his share of the expenses for Hayley\u2019s treatment only if Hayley\u2019s treatment was considered a medical expense under the parties\u2019 Decree. The court continued that it did not find that Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment was a medical expense under the parties\u2019 Decree, explaining that it did not have Dr. White\u2019s referral, Champ\u00fas denied payment for Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment, and Corliss testified that a medical referral was not necessary to send a child to Anasazi for treatment. The court subsequently entered its order finding \u201cthat said treatment does not qualify as a \u2018medical related expense\u2019 as contemplated by the Decree of Dissolution\u201d and denied Corliss\u2019 motion. Corliss contends the District Court\u2019s finding disregarded the evidence, including the medical referral and Melvin paying for similar treatment for Dan. She further contends that, because Melvin is required to pay 58% of the medical expenses not covered by insurance, he cannot use the insurance denial to avoid paying his share.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.R A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Kovarik v. Kovarik, </em>1998 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 350, \u00b6 20, 954 P.2d 1147, \u00b6 20 (citation omitted). Thus, we focus first on whether substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi treatment was not a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b614 Melvin testified Corliss told him she was sending Hayley to Anasazi because Hayley was unmanageable and never indicated that a medical problem necessitated the Anasazi treatment. He further testified that Champ\u00fas would pay for medically required treatment programs. In that regard, Corliss testified Champ\u00fas refused to pay for Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment. Moreover, while the parties agreed that Hayley had behavioral problems, Melvin testified that when Hayley lived with him, they made good progress on observed disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plinary problems when he set clear consequences for her actions and worked with her. In his view, Hayley\u2019s problems were disciplinary, rather than medical, especially since Corliss applied to Champ\u00fas for payment and payment was denied. On this record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi treatment did not qualify as a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b615 Corliss contends, however, that her testimony regarding Dr. White\u2019s referral of Hayley to Anasazi for treatment supported her motion and the District Court erred in disregarding it. Her contention ignores our standard of review, which is not whether we could be persuaded to reach a different result after considering the same evidence, but whether the evidence supported the district court\u2019s finding. <em>Pfeifer v. Pfeifer </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 461, 474, 938 P.2d 684, 692 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b6 16 In any event, it is clear from the District Court\u2019s oral determinations that it did not disregard Corliss\u2019 testimony, but simply was not persuaded by the testimony absent Dr. White\u2019s actual diagnosis and referral. Nor was the District Court obligated to accept Corliss\u2019 unsubstantiated testimony on that subject. In <em>In re Marriage of Nash </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 231, 235-36, 836 P.2d 598, 601, we held that a trial court was free to disregard a party\u2019s unsubstantiated estimate of increased cost of living in another geographical area for purposes of obtaining a variance from the child support determined under the child support guidelines. Similarly, in In <em>re Marriage of Feisthamel </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 321, 328, 739 P.2d 474, 479, we concluded that the court did not abuse its discretion in valuing the parties\u2019 home based on a dated appraisal rather than on the husband\u2019s unsubstantiated estimate of its current value. Here, as in <em>Marriage of Nash </em>and <em>Marriage of Feisthamel, </em>the District Court was not bound by Corliss\u2019 unsubstantiated testimony regarding Dr. White\u2019s referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b617 Corliss also contends that the District Court ignored her evidence that Melvin paid for the same treatment for Dan and that Melvin\u2019s payment of those expenses for Dan obligates him to pay for the same expenses for Hayley. Again, however, the District Court did not ignore this evidence. It specifically addressed the evidence at the end of the hearing, explaining that Melvin\u2019s payment for Dan\u2019s treatment was by agreement of the parties rather than under the Decree and, therefore, that payment was irrelevant to a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>whether Hayley\u2019s treatment was a medical related expense under the Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b618 Corliss next argues that Melvin\u2019s justification for refusing to pay Hayley\u2019s Anasazi treatment expenses violates the express language of the Decree. She contends that, because the Decree required Melvin to pay 58% of \u201cother medical related expenses for the minor children, which are not paid by insurance,\u201d Melvin cannot rely on Champ\u00fas\u2019 denial of the claim to justify his decision not to pay for the Anasazi treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b6 19 It is true that the Decree clearly contemplated the possibility of medical related expenses not covered by insurance. That begs the question at issue here, however, because the Decree obligated Melvin only for \u201cmedical related expenses\u201d not covered by insurance. Having concluded that the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi expenses were not medically related was supported by substantial evidence, we need not address this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b620 Finally, Corliss asks this Court to take judicial notice of the myriad of medical diagnoses symptomized by \u201cbehavioral problems,\u201d but she advances no authorities under which it would be proper for us to do so. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to cite to authorities supporting the contentions made on appeal and we regularly decline to address unsupported issues or arguments. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Huotari </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 285, 289, 943 P.2d 1295, 1298; <em>In re Marriage of Lee </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 410, 421, 938 P.2d 650, 657; <em>Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24. Corliss having failed to comply with Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., with regard to her request for judicial notice, we decline to address that request further.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b621  We hold that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi treatment does not qualify as a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree and the finding is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b622 2. Did the District Court err by failing to enter sufficient findings of fact to justify its denial of Corliss\u2019 motion to enforce the Decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b623 Corliss urges that the total absence of findings by the District Court in its order denying her motion to enforce the Decree necessitates vacating the order and remanding for rehearing. She relies on such cases as <em>In re Marriage of Bliss </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 331, 609 P.2d 1209 and <em>Jones v. Jones </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 221, 620 P.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u00b624 In both <em>Marriage of Bliss </em>and <em>Jones, </em>we remanded for entry of specific findings. Our reasons for doing so were two-fold. First, the purpose of findings of fact is to provide a foundation for the court\u2019s judgment and, as a result, the findings must set forth the determining facts upon which the court rests its ultimate facts and conclusions of law. <em>Jones, </em>190 Mont. at 224, 620 P.2d at 851 (remanding for specific findings supporting the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding of the best interest of the child). In <em>Marriage of Bliss, </em>the trial court failed to enter the statutorily required findings that substantial and continuing changes made the current child support provisions unconscionable. We stated that \u201c[ajbsent the necessary findings, this Court will not independently search the record to determine if there is nonetheless an evidentiary basis for the order modifying the child support provisions.\u201d <em>Marriage of Bliss, </em>187 Mont. at 335, 609 P.2d at 1212. Our second concern was that, without adequate findings, this Court is forced to speculate as to the reasons for the court\u2019s decision. <em>Jones, </em>190 Mont. at 224, 620 P.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b625  In the present case, however, we need not search the record for an evidentiary basis or speculate as to the reasons for the District Court\u2019s decision. In its oral findings at the end of the hearing, the court relied on Corliss\u2019 own testimony that anyone could send their child to Anasazi without a medical referral, Champ\u00fas\u2019 denial of payment of the Anasazi treatment, and Corliss\u2019 failure to produce Dr. White\u2019s alleged medical diagnosis and referral. These findings provided both an adequate basis for the court\u2019s ultimate finding that the Anasazi treatment does not qualify as a medical related expense contemplated by the Decree and an adequate basis for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b626 We hold that the District Court entered sufficient findings of fact to justify its denial of Corliss\u2019 motion to enforce the Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b341-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"A1_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b628 I dissent. The decree, as modified, required Melvin to pay 58% of the children\u2019s medical, dental, orthodontic, optical, hospital and other <em>medical related </em>expenses not paid by insurance. Here, the insurance company refused coverage for Hayley\u2019s treatment at the Anasazi Foundation. Obviously the lack of insurance coverage does not mean that the treatment is not medically related. A contrary holding would nullify the entire provision requiring payment of expenses not paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>by insurance. Rather, \u201cmedical[ly] related\u201d has to be interpreted in the context of the parties\u2019 intent and practice. Melvin agreed that Hayley, like her brother, had behavioral problems. Furthermore, Melvin had previously paid for similar behavioral treatment for his son at the Anasazi Foundation. Given this history, and the fact that a pediatrician had referred Hayley to Anasazi, the treatment in question was clearly medically \u201crelated\u201d as contemplated by the parties in their decree. Pursuant to Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., I would reverse for the reason that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-4\">JUSTICE NELSON j oins in Justice Leaphart\u2019s foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
