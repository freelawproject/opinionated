The State responded by moving to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b62 The Petitioner was convicted in the District Court of Powell County of deliberate homicide by accountability and sentenced to death on March 19,1992. The victim of the homicide, Gerald Pileggi, was severely beaten during a softball game in the prison exercise yard and died from the injuries. The Petitioner\u2019s conviction and death sentence were affirmed by this Court in <em>State v. Gollehon, </em>262 Mont. 1, 864 P.2d 249 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 827, 115 S. Ct. 95, 130 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1994), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>274 Mont. 116, 906 P.2d 697 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b63 On March 24,1995, the District Court conducted a hearing to set an execution date. During the hearing, Gollehon requested that the prosecution disclose what assistance, if any, it provided to its two key witnesses, J. D. Armstrong and William Arnot, to be released early from their sentences. Gollehon represented to the court that he had received information that the State had assisted both witnesses to obtain early releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b64 During the hearing, the District Court granted Gollehon\u2019s request for discovery of pretrial agreements between the State and the witnesses but denied the request as to post-trial assistance or agreements. The State later disclosed that there were no pretrial agreements to assist the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b65 In his initial Petition for Postconviction Relief, Gollehon asserts that his rights protected by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were violated. Petitioner argues that the State has a duty to disclose any advantageous treatment that witnesses Armstrong and Arnot may have received post-trial. The Petitioner further alleges that any benefits that these witnesses received in return for testifying against him cast doubts upon their credibility. He argues that such a disclosure could aid him in convincing the District Court, this Court, or both, that he is entitled to a new trial or a new sentencing hearing to reevaluate the death sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b66 On March 25,1997 this Court, upon review of Gollehon\u2019s petition and the State\u2019s response, concluded that Petitioner was entitled to the discovery of any postconviction agreements the State made with witnesses Armstrong and Arnot to provide assistance to them and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>exact nature of any assistance provided to these witnesses. We further concluded that once such information is disclosed, the petitioner would be entitled to amend his petition should he so desire.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b67 Discovery was subsequently pursued, most notably, the depositions of witness Armstrong and attorney Wendy Holton. Holton, a private attorney who specializes in criminal matters, was contacted by Assistant Attorney General John Connor to assist Armstrong in his effort for an early release.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b68 On March 1,1999, Gollehon filed his Amended Verified Petition for Postconviction Relief (Amended Petition) pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-101, and -203, MCA. The Attorney General responded by moving to dismiss Gollehon\u2019s Amended Petition. Both the Petitioner and Attorney General have requested oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b69 The Amended Petition raises six claims for relief. We shall address each claim for relief in order. Before doing so, however, we deem it first appropriate to address Gollehon\u2019s omnibus contentions and his general allegations of constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b610 The Petitioner alleges that his rights under both the United States and Montana Constitutions were compromised, specifically those rights found in the Montana Constitution, Article II, Sections 16,17,19,22,24,26,28 and 34 and the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In these omnibus contentions, however, the Petitioner fails to cite to authority or offer specific argument to support his conclusionary statements. Thus, lacking any specific arguments or authority to support these contentions, we will not address them any further. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4); <em>State ex rel. Booth v. Montana Twenty-First Judicial Dist., </em>1998 MT 344, \u00b6 35, 292 Mont. 371, \u00b6 35, 972 P.2d 325, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\n<em>First Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u00b611 Gollehon alleges that there were undisclosed pretrial agreements in exchange for Armstrong\u2019s testimony. Gollehon argues that the following agreements existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">1. Witness Armstrong was promised by prison officials that he would be a trustee at the Powell County Jail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">2. Assistant Attorney General John Connor promised Armstrong he would not go back to Montana State Prison; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">3. Armstrong was promised that he would be housed in the Powell County Jail until he earned parole, prerelease, or discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b612 Gollehon further alleges that the State failed in its duty to disclose certain gratuitous benefits conferred upon Armstrong, post-trial, and in the absence of any pretrial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b613 Gollehon asserts that the disclosure requirements under \u00a7 46-15-322(l)(e), MCA, and the prosecution\u2019s responsibilities set forth in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), compel such disclosure. Gollehon further contends that under \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-327 and 46-18-310, MCA, the State had a continuing duty to disclose any gratuitous benefits Armstrong received, post-trial, because such information would tend to reduce or mitigate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AIF\">\u00b614  The suppression by the prosecution of material evidence favorable to the accused violates the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process. <em>See Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 86, 83 S. Ct. at 1196, 10 L. Ed. 2d at 218. This duty applies to impeachment evidence. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 490 (1985). The prosecution may violate the principles set forth in <em>Brady </em>by failing to disclose agreements with a prosecution witness in exchange for testimony. Promises made to a witness in exchange for testimony go directly to the credibility of the witness. <em>See Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S. Ct. 763, 766, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104, 108-09 (1972). The duty of disclosure is dependent, however, upon an agreement or understanding with tangible benefits. Where there is no agreement, there is no duty to disclose. <em>See Alderman v. Zant, </em>22 F.3d 1541, 1555 (11th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1061, 115 S. Ct. 673, 130 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b615  To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, the petitioner must establish that: (1) the State possessed evidence, including impeachment evidence, favorable to the defense; (2) the petitioner did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it with reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>See Mills v. Singletary, </em>63 F.3d 999, 1014 (citation omitted) (11th. Cir. 1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1214, 116 S. Ct. 1837, 134 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b616 Gollehon argues that the State made a deal with key witness Armstrong which was never disclosed. He argues that in exchange for Armstrong\u2019s testimony, the State reinstated his good time, and removed his dangerous offender status. Gollehon argues further that attorney Wendy Holton, contacted by Assistant Attorney General John Conner to assist Armstrong, and Conner assisted in getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Armstrong released by testifying on his behalf and writing letters to the Parole Board. He also claims that Warden McCormick aided by unilaterally overruling a prison committee recommendation that denied Armstrong\u2019s restoration of good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b617 Petitioner relies, in part, on a letter dated December 31,1991 from witness Armstrong to Connor. The Petitioner argues that Armstrong states in the letter that prison officials represented to him before trial that he would be a trustee at the Powell County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b618 A complete review of the letter, however, discloses nothing about what was told to Armstrong. In fact, in one part of the letter Armstrong indicates that he did not believe that he had been promised trustee status in exchange for his testimony. In another part of the letter, he specifically states that he did not expect to receive any special treatment for anything that he had done. Although, Armstrong desired to be a trustee at the jail, he has failed to present any convincing evidence of an undisclosed deal of trustee status in exchange for his testimony, pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b619 Holton testified in her deposition that she represented to the Parole Board in the clemency application, that Armstrong provided his testimony without requesting any benefit or consideration other than protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b620 Gollehon relates to other documents, including a letter written by Armstrong to Warden McCormick, dated November 23, 1991. Armstrong was requesting that he be reclassified so that he could work as a trustee in the Powell County Jail. McCormick\u2019s response, however, indicates that his request to be reclassified was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">\u00b621 The Petitioner also refers to a letter dated February 2,1992 that Armstrong wrote Assistant Attorney General Connor after he was transferred back to Montana State Prison. In that letter, Armstrong asserts that Connor promised him that he would never go back to the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b622 The Petitioner, however, has not presented any evidence that Connor made the above statement to Armstrong prior to trial or in exchange for his testimony. Further, in the same letter, Armstrong states at two different times that Connor did not break any promise to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b623 Gollehon also refers to a letter dated October 24, 1991 from Armstrong to an unnamed prison official where he asserts that he was promised things before trial. In his deposition, however, Armstrong explained that it probably related to a promise of guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>teed safety. Such a promise was disclosed to the jury during Armstrong\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b624 It is important to note that the jury which convicted Gollehon of this homicide was aware that Armstrong had been promised safety in return for his testimony. At trial, evidence was presented that Armstrong was receiving assurances of safety by the State in the event he testified. Gollehon had an opportunity to explore what these \u201csafety\u201d measures might entail during trial. On August 30, 1991, Armstrong voluntarily provided defense counsel an interview which was tape-recorded and transcribed. During this interview, Armstrong stated that he came forward with testimony because he felt that he should and not to get something in return. He also stated that the State assured him that his safety would be guaranteed but he did not know how that would be accomplished. During trial, Armstrong testified that he was not promised anything in return for his testimony other than a guarantee of his safety. He testified that every step would be taken to guarantee his safety, and further, no one assured him assistance in obtaining parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b625  In summary, we conclude that the Petitioner has not established the existence of any undisclosed pretrial agreement between the State and Armstrong in exchange for his testimony. The Petitioner has established no more than what was presented to the jury during his trial; Armstrong was assured his personal safety if he testified. This was corroborated in Armstrong\u2019s deposition taken on August 18,1998, when he testified that the only guarantee he received was for his safety by being housed in protective custody in the Powell County Jail in Deer Lodge. Although we concede that the State went to great lengths to assist Armstrong in his post-trial efforts for early release, we see nothing in the pretrial conduct of the prosecution that would constitute a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b626 In regard to undisclosed post-trial benefits, Gollehon asserts that Connor contacted Holton after his trial to ask if she would assist Armstrong before the Parole Board. He then asserts that Connor wrote a letter to the Parole Board in support of Armstrong\u2019s application for clemency; and that when the Board denied the application, Connor and Warden McCormick went to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to secure Armstrong\u2019s release, culminating in Governor Stephens\u2019 grant of clemency, which removed his \u201cdangerous\u201d designation and made him prematurely eligible for parole. Gollehon asserts that the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>disclose the above events which occurred post-trial and in the absence of a pretrial agreement, violated his <em>Brady </em>due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AIp\">\u00b627  In order for post-trial assistance to be relevant, there must have been an agreement for parole before trial in order to support a <em>Brady </em>violation. In the absence of evidence of a pretrial agreement, there can be no <em>Brady </em>violation because no evidence was suppressed from the jury. Armstrong testified at his deposition that, prior to trial, he was never promised restoration of any good time. He said the subject never came up. Again, any assistance that occurred after trial, must be as a result of a pretrial agreement to support a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b628 Gollehon further argues that the State\u2019s failure to disclose Armstrong\u2019s premature release violates his constitutional rights because he could have argued to this Court and a sentencing court that the benefits cast doubt on Armstrong\u2019s credibility. He asserts that such evidence could have been established as a \u201cmitigating circumstance\u201d in terms of his sentence and could have been used to argue \u201clingering doubt\u201d of his guilt. In support he cites <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh, </em>487 U.S. 164, 174, 108 S. Ct. 2320, 101 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b629 Mitigating evidence includes evidence that relates to a defendant\u2019s character, background, or the circumstances of the offense before the sentencing judge that militate against imposing the death penalty. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>280 Mont. 158, 931 P.2d 1272, 1282 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 965, 118 S. Ct. 410, 139 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1997). However, lingering doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt is not an appropriate mitigating circumstance because it is not an aspect of the defendant\u2019s character, record, or the circumstance of the offense. In <em>Franklin, </em>487 U.S. at 174, 108 S. Ct. at 2327, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 166, the United States Supreme Court stated the sentencing judge may not be precluded from considering \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense.\u201d The Court noted, however, that capital juries, in the sentencing phase, were not mandated to reconsider their \u201cresidual doubts\u201d over a defendant\u2019s guilt. Such doubts do not relate to the defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacter,\u201d \u201crecord,\u201d or a \u201ccircumstance of the offense.\u201d <em>See Franklin, </em>487 U.S. at 174, 108 S. Ct. at 2327, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b630 We further conclude that such evidence would not have been considered by this Court under our function dictated by \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA. We are required to determine pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-310(2), MCA, whether the evidence supports the sentencing judge\u2019s finding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>existence or nonexistence of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>See Smith, </em>280 Mont. at 170, 931 P.2d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b631 The First Claim for Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>Second Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b632 Gollehon argues in his Second Claim for Relief that there was overwhelming post-trial evidence that Armstrong perjured himself at trial. This, according to the Petitioner, resulted in the deliberate deception of the court and jurors by the presentation of false evidence, resulting in a violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b633  To prevail on this claim, Gollehon must establish that: (1) the witness\u2019s testimony was actually false; (2) the testimony was material to the verdict; and (3) the prosecutor knew or believed the testimony to be false. <em>See Fuller v. Johnson, </em>(5th Cir. 1997), 114 F.3d 491, 496, (5th Cir. 1997) <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 963, 118 S. Ct. 399, 139 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1997). False evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Westley v. Johnson, </em>83 F.3d 714, 726 (5th Cir. 1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1094, 117 S. Ct. 773, 136 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b634 Gollehon argues that Armstrong\u2019s post-trial behavior \u201cnever changed,\u201d therefore, Armstrong must have lied at trial about his reasons for coming forward. Holton, on the other hand, testified that she believed that Armstrong had made efforts to change his life and Connor believed that Armstrong was sincere in his rehabilitation efforts and that he provided truthful testimony of the Pileggi trial. The fact that Armstrong failed at rehabilitation is not sufficient to demonstrate that he lied at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b635 Gollehon obtained an affidavit from Monty Carrillo stating that Armstrong immediately violated his parole conditions. However, Carrillo does not state that Armstrong\u2019s testimony at trial was false. Carrillo merely speculates and draws inferences from Armstrong\u2019s subsequent conduct on parole. Gollehon also refers to information contained in an affidavit by Montana State Senator Thomas Keating. However, Keating concedes that he does not know the details of Armstrong\u2019s trial testimony or whether it was true or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">\u00b636  Gollehon has not sustained his burden to establish that Armstrong\u2019s trial testimony was actually false or that the prosecutor knew or believed it to be false. The Petitioner infers that Armstrong must have lied at trial about his reasons for coming forward. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that Armstrong\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation were not successful is not sufficient to demonstrate that he lied at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b637 The Second Claim for Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>Third Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b638 Gollehon asserts that the State\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the substantial benefits it gratuitously conferred upon witness William Arnot, post-trial, and in the absence of a formal pretrial agreement, violated his <em>Brady </em>due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b639 The Petitioner points out that Arnot has a lengthy criminal record and has escaped from custody at least three times. During one escape he possessed a deadly weapon. Twelve days after receiving an additional prison term for this offense, Arnot came forward for the first time and stated that he witnessed the Pileggi homicide. Arnot was immediately removed from prison and placed with Armstrong in a local jail. Arnot testified that he and Armstrong discussed the case and he came forward because it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b640 After Arnot testified, Connor inquired about his prerelease designation. Even though Arnot\u2019s most recent escape made him ineligible for prerelease, Department of Corrections employee Jim Pomroy arranged for an exception to be made. Arnot again escaped custody from the prerelease center. Arnot later turned himself in to Connor and was transported to the Jefferson County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u00b641 Two months later, Pomroy requested that the Parole Board consider Arnot for parole because he was \u201cthe primary witness in the Pileggi murder trial.\u201d The Board granted Arnot parole and he was released one month later. After his release, Arnot continued to engage in criminal conduct and again escaped from official detention. Arnot was apprehended and sentenced to an additional two years in prison and his parole was revoked. Arnot was discharged on May 15, 1996, and has been arrested at least twice since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">\u00b642 Gollehon asserts, as he did with Armstrong, that the State\u2019s failure to disclose alleged post-trial benefits to Arnot, in the absence of any pretrial agreement, violates his constitutional rights because he could have argued to the sentencing court and this Court, on appeal, that the benefits Arnot received directly impacted his credibility. As with Armstrong, in the absence of proving a pretrial agreement in exchange for testimony, gratuitous post-trial benefits conferred on Arnot do not constitute a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u00b643 The Third Claim for Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\n<em>Fourth Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b644 Gollehon contends that the State is responsible for an alleged \u201csubstantial delay\u201d in bringing his case to a \u201cfull and final conclusion,\u201d in violation of his rights under Article II, Sections 17 and 22 of the Montana Constitution and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and that his death sentence should be vacated. Essentially, the Petitioner argues that an unusually long period of time on death row implicates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b645 Petitioner complains that the <em>Brady </em>claim is causing the alleged delay and it is the State which is responsible for lengthy litigation of the claim. His argument finds its genesis in <em>Lackey v. Texas, </em>514 U.S. 1045, 115 S. Ct. 1421, 131 L. Ed. 2d 304(1995), a denial of certiorari, where Justices Stevens and Breyer suggested that such an argument would \u201cbenefit from further study\u201d and that the issue should be postponed until it has been addressed by other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b646 In <em>Smith, </em>280 Mont. at 183-85, 931 P.2d at 1287-88, we rejected a claim that the defendant\u2019s rights of due process and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment were violated because of the amount of time he spent on death row and the number of sentencing hearings held in his case. Smith also relied on Justice Stevens\u2019 memorandum in <em>Lackey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b647  Gollehon\u2019s argument is premised on the contention that his length of time on death row was caused by a delay in the post-trial proceedings caused by the State. Yet, despite this Court\u2019s urging on two occasions to file his postconviction petition, the Petitioner continued the delay by filing a federal habeas corpus petition and an amended petition which included a <em>Brady </em>claim which he knew had not been exhausted in the state courts. The federal court noted this and, at the Petitioner\u2019s request, stayed it pending the exhaustion of his <em>Brady </em>claim in the state court. Gollehon ultimately filed his petition on December 2,1996, four years and nine months after the date of conviction, coming just under the then five-year deadline. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the majority of the delay in this case was caused by the Petitioner pursuing his constitutional and statutory rights and not caused by the actions of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b648 The Fourth Claim of Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\n<em>Fifth Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b649 Gollehon requests that we reconsider our rulings and judgment with regard to issues Nos. 5 and 7 of his direct appeal, because the State claims in federal court that he did not present a due process and fair notice claim under the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to whether the death penalty could be applied for deliberate homicide by accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b650 The Petitioner focuses on the dissent of Justice Gray in his direct appeal and concludes that this Court understood and addressed his due process and fair notice claim when it considered his argument under the rule of lenity. Although the Petitioner states that he is confident that the federal courts will rule that these claims were addressed, he requests that we revisit claims Nos. 5 and 7 of his direct appeal for the following reasons: (1) to give this Court every opportunity to pass on a substantial and important constitutional claim before it reaches a federal venue; (2) to clarify how this Court actually dealt with these issues; (3) and because consideration of a matter previously decided in direct appeal is permissible under the 1995 postconviction statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b651  We decline to again address these issues. Postconviction relief is not available upon claims that a petitioner could have raised on direct appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. If the Petitioner failed to adequately raise these issues in his direct appeal, he is procedurally barred from doing so now. If they were adequately raised, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars relitigation of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b652 The Fifth Claim for Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\n<em>Sixth Claim for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">\u00b653 Gollehon maintains that this Court should reconsider its rulings on issues Nos. 5 and 7 because at the time the case was decided, this Court was not properly constituted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-2-101, 3-5-201, 3-1-1010 and -14, MCA, Article II, Sections 4,13,16, 17, 34, and Article VII, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u00b654 Gollehon contends that the substitution at oral argument of District Judge Lympus for Justice McDonough, violated the Montana Constitution because Justice McDonough suffered neither \u201cdisqualification\u201d nor \u201cdisability\u201d and merely failed to participate because of his retirement from the Court. Therefore, issues Nos. 5 and 7 of Gollehon\u2019s appeal were resolved in part by a judge who had no authority or jurisdiction to act. To the extent that the Court was lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>constituted, issues Nos. 5 and 7 were resolved by an equally divided court. Therefore, these issues should be determined by the present lawfully constituted Court. The Petitioner asserts that since this is a matter of jurisdiction of this Court, the issued can be raised at any time. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b655 Gollehon was aware of the substitution of Judge Lympus prior to oral argument, yet failed to raise this issue at oral argument or in his Petition for Rehearing. Postconviction relief is not available upon claims that a petitioner could have raised on direct appeal. We further note that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, contains no exception to the application of the procedural bar for issues related to \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d Also, \u00a7 46-13-101(1), MCA, relates to objections which are required to be made pretrial, and therefore is not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b656 The Sixth Claim for Relief is denied. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b657 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended Petition for Postconviction Relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b658 The Clerk of Court is directed to mail a true and correct copy of this order to all parties of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b659 DATED this 9th day of September, 1999.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-9\">/S/ J.
