Plaintiffs claim violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961-68 (Counts I &amp; II); the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (\u201cNJCFA\u201d), N.J.S.A. 56:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Count III); common law fraud (Count IV); and unjust enrichment (Count V). Plaintiffs seek economic damages only \u2014 this is not a products liability action.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>On August 29, 2007, this Court denied, without prejudice, plaintiffs\u2019 initial motion to certify a nationwide class of Consumers and TPPs that purchased Neurontin for treatment of off-label indications. <em>See In re Neu-rontin Mktg. and Sale Practices Litig., </em>244 F.R.D. 89 (D.Mass.2007) (hereinafter <em>Neu-rontin </em>). The Court held that plaintiffs\u2019 initial motion failed to satisfy the commonality, numerosity, typicality, and predominance requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 105-107, 114-16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court did, however, provide plaintiffs with an opportunity to submit a new motion for class certification that addressed the Court\u2019s concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Before the Court is plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for class certification. (Pis.\u2019 Renewed Mot. for Class Certification (\u201cPis.\u2019 Renewed Mot.\u201d) Docket No. 1016-18.) The parties have submitted numerous briefs and voluminous expert reports. Because the Court concludes that common questions will not predominate over issues affecting individual plaintiffs, in accordance with Rule 23(b)(3), the Court now <em>DENIES </em>plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II. <em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The factual underpinnings of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are discussed in great detail in <em>Neurontin, </em>and the Court will only repeat a brief summary here. <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 92-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In December 1993, the FDA approved Neurontin in doses ranging from 900 mg to 1800 mg per day for use as an \u201cadjunctive therapy\u201d for the treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy. In May 2002, the FDA approved Neurontin for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (\u201cPHN\u201d) (pain resulting from nerve damage caused by shingles or herpes zoster) in adults. Those are the only conditions that Neurontin has ever been approved to treat. <em>Id. </em>at 92. Given the limited market for such a drug and Neurontin\u2019s patent life, defendants estimated that potential lifetime sales for Neurontin would likely amount to less than $500 million. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, defendants explored ways to earn additional profit from Neurontin by marketing it for the treatment of at least eight off-label indications \u2014 bipolar and other mood disorders; neuropathic pain; epilepsy monotherapy; migraine prophylaxis; anxiety disorders; Restless Leg Syndrome (\u201cRLS\u201d)/Periodie Limb Movement Disorder (\u201cPLMD\u201d); nociceptive and non-neuropathie pain; and in doses exceeding 1800 mg per day. <em>Id. </em>at 93. Plaintiffs allege that even though defendants were aware by 1995 that Neurontin was no better than a placebo when used to treat these off-label conditions, they aggressively marketed Neurontin to doctors in the relevant fields. Although the specific decisions made and actions taken by defendants differed by indication, the general marketing approach was similar across indications and consisted of three elements. First, plaintiffs allege that defendants skirted the FDA rules against off-label marketing by formulating a complex \u201cpeer selling strategy,\u201d whereby defendants paid both doctors and medical marketing firms to organize continuing medical education events at which doctors would speak favorably about the off-label efficacy of Neu-rontin. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. Second, plaintiffs assert that defendants, in conjunction with medical marketing firms, willfully manipulated the publication of studies about Neuron-tin\u2019s off-label usefulness, delaying or withholding negative internal results, publishing negative results (if at all) in minor journals with small circulation, ghost-writing favorable studies for doctors, and pushing favorable studies toward widely read journals. <em>Id. </em>at 94-95. Third, plaintiffs contend that defendants used an army of \u201cmedical liaisons,\u201d non-doctor sales representatives, who withheld and/or misrepresented negative information and promoted inaccurate positive information about Neurontin\u2019s off-label efficacy when solicited by doctors for information about Neurontin\u2019s off-label uses. <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>For example, plaintiffs allege that defendants knew as early as 1992, but certainly by November 1995, that Neurontin was connected \u201cwith increased risks of depression with and without suicidal ideation when given as adjunctive medication in refractory partial epilepsy.\u201d (Expert Report of Daniel Furberg \u00b6 21a, Ex. B., Docket No. 1503; see <em>also </em>Pis.\u2019 Renewed Mot. at 16 n. 16.) By 1995, defendants were also aware of two negative studies regarding the efficacy of Neurontin as a treatment for bipolar. Nonetheless, defendants actively marketed Neurontin as a safe and effective treatment for bipolar and other mood disorders and as a mood stabilizer and intentionally suppressed the negative studies about its efficacy. <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In sum, plaintiffs allege that defendants\u2019 off-label promotion scheme constituted a pervasive fraud designed to saturate the medical community with false information about Neu-rontin\u2019s efficacy for several highly profitable off-label indications. The strategy was designed to generate a \u201cbuzz\u201d about Neurontin through the peer-to-peer marketing, to legitimate that \u201cbuzz\u201d through the publications of purportedly unbiased scientific research, and to preserve the \u201cbuzz\u201d by suppressing or misrepresenting studies that demonstrated Neurontin was not effective for the off-label uses. As a result of this fraud, consumers and TPPs purchased Neurontin for conditions for which there was no credible scientific evidence of efficacy, while defendants reaped billions in profits. Revenue from the sale of Neurontin rose from $97.5 million in 1995 to nearly $2.7 billion in 2003, \u201cmaking Neurontin one of the ten most popular drugs in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. Sales grew at approximately fifty percent per year, fueled primarily by off-label sales, which by 2003 accounted for approximately 90 percent of all Neurontin prescriptions. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs allege that defendants\u2019 off-label, fraudulent marketing scheme was largely responsible for Neurontin\u2019s meteoric rise in sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 initial motion for class certification was predicated on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to satisfy four distinct requirements of Rule 23: commonality, numer-osity, typicality, and predominance. Below, the Court discusses plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to remedy the shortcomings.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">A. <em>Commonality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">1. <em>Initial Shortcomings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class failed to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cRule 23(a)\u2019s requirement of commonality is a low bar, and courts have generally given it a \u2018permissive application.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re New Motor Vehicles Can. Export Antitrust Litig., </em>522 F.3d 6, 19 (2008) (hereinafter <em>Motor Vehicles </em>) (quoting 7A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1763, at 221 (3d ed.2005)). Commonality necessitates only the existence of a \u201csingle issue common to all members of the class.\u201d 1 Alba Conte &amp; Herbert B. Newberg, <em>Newberg on Class Actions </em>\u00a7 3.10 (4th ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Plaintiffs initially proposed a single class comprised of all individuals or entities who paid all or some of the price for an off-label Neurontin prescription. Plaintiffs then divided that broad class into Consumer and TPP Subclasses. The breadth of plaintiffs\u2019 original proposed Subclasses undermined plaintiffs\u2019 claim that resolution of common questions would \u201caffect all or a substantial number of the class members.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir.1986). Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccomplaint and subsequent submissions ... ma[de] clear that their proof of fraud varies considerably by [off-label] indication.\u201d <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 105. As such, the Court held that in order for plaintiffs to satisfy the commonality requirement, plaintiffs must \u201cprove up <em>fraud </em>use-by use,\u201d and \u201cthe proposed consumer and TPP classes must be further divided into subclasses by use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court identified the eight off-label conditions \u2014 (1) bipolar and other mood disorders; (2) neuropathic pain; (3) migraine and headache; (4) nociceptive and non-neuropathic pain; (5) RLS/PLMD; (6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>anxiety disorders; (7) monotherapy; and (8) doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg per day \u2014 for which both the Consumer and TPP classes would independently have to satisfy all of Rule 23\u2019s prerequisites for class certification. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe key common question for each subclass will be whether the defendants engaged in a common course of conduct to make misrepresentations or omissions regarding Neurontin\u2019s efficacy for a particular off-label use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">2. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">To address the Court\u2019s concerns, plaintiffs slightly altered the parameters of the proposed TPP Subclass<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More critically, plaintiffs identified the indication-specific subclasses for which they sought certification within the Consumer and TPP Subclasses. Plaintiffs abandoned their claims regarding RLS/PLMD, anxiety disorders, and monoth-erapy. For the remaining five indications, the following chart summarizes the relevant newly proposed indication-specific subclasses and subclass periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Subclass</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Subclass Period</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Bipolar/Mood Disorders 11/95 \u2014 12/04</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Neuropathic Pain 7/95 \u2014 12/04</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Migraine/Headache 9/95 \u2014 12/04</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Nociceptive Pain 9/95 \u2014 12/04</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Doses &gt; 1800 mg/day 3/95 \u2014 12/04</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">(Pls.\u2019 Renewed Mot. at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed subclasses are now sufficiently narrow such that for each one \u201cthere are questions of law or fact common to the [sub]class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(5) (\u201cWhen appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.\u201d). As discussed in <em>Neurontin, </em>although defendants allegedly engaged in a similar pattern of conduct while fraudulently marketing Neurontin for each off-label indication, the dates of defendants\u2019 awareness of inefficacy, defendants\u2019 efforts to suppress negative studies, and defendants\u2019 affirmative marketing plans, varied considerably by indication. Now, the claims of the plaintiffs within each of the indication-specific subclasses share common issues of fact. Consequently, at least to the extent plaintiffs are alleging a fraudulent national advertising campaign which made affirmative misrepresentations and concealed known risks specific to an indication, the Court finds that the ten remaining indication-specific subclasses (five Consumer and five TPP) satisfy Rule 23\u2019s commonality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-24\">B. <em>Numerosity</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGp\">1. <em>Initial Shortcomings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-25\">In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court surmised that \u201c[g]iven the low threshold for numerosity and the high number of off-label prescriptions,\u201d and the fact that \u201cby 2003 Neurontin was the tenth most commonly-prescribed drug in the United States,\u201d Rule 23(a)(l)\u2019s numerosity requirement would pose no barrier to class certification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 106. Still, in light of the Court\u2019s holding that plaintiffs would be required to seek certification for indication-specific subclasses, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Court insisted that plaintiffs \u201csubmit a proffer that the number of consumer and TPP plaintiffs in each subclass is sufficiently large that joinder of all members would be impractical.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Response</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In their renewed motion, plaintiffs submitted a declaration from Dr. Rena Conti (\u201cDr.Conti\u201d), a Ph.D. in Health Policy (Economics Track) from Harvard University and an instructor in Health Economics at the University of Chicago. (Decl. of Rena Conti (\u201cConti Deck\u201d), Ex. E, Docket No. 1017.) After reviewing data from the IMS National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI) and defendants\u2019 predictions of unique patient counts for Neurontin, Dr. Conti estimated that between January 1997 and December 2002, more than 350,000 individual consumers paid for at least a portion of the cost of a Neurontin prescription for each of the five indications. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Estimated No. of Consumer Subclass Members from</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Off-Label Condition 1997 to 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Bipolar/Mood Disorders 1,189,189</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Neuropathic Pain 2,283,907</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Migraine/Headache 365,641</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Nociceptive Pain 750,219</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Doses &gt; 1800 mg/day 786,236</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Total 5,375,192</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Because these figures do not include the entire proposed class period for any of the indications, they also necessarily underestimate the actual number of unique individuals who paid for a Neurontin prescription. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.) Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 proffer regarding the number of potential plaintiffs is more than sufficient to satisfy Rule 23 for all five of the indication-specific Consumer subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">Dr. Conti\u2019s analysis is equally persuasive that the number of TPPs in each indication-specific TPP subclass satisfies Rule 23(a)(1). Relying on an assumption that all TPP plans \u201ccover[ ] a representative sample of the population,\u201d Dr. Conti then estimated the number of members necessary to assure with 99, 95, and 90 percent probability that a plan had at least one member who received a Neurontin prescription for a particular indication. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.) At the 99 percent confidence interval, the migraine/headache condition required the largest minimum plan membership, 3,248 individuals; all of the other indications necessitated less than 1,600 members to ensure that at least one individual in a plan received a Neurontin prescription for each off-label indication. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54 tbl. 2.) Dr. Conti then used publicly available data regarding the membership size of various categories of TPPs to calculate that approximately 13,070 TPPs paid for at least one Neurontin prescription to treat each of the off-label conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 55-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">Defendants take issue with Dr. Conti\u2019s assumption that the membership of each plan mirrors the composition of the general population. They argue that especially with Tafi&gt;-Hartley Funds and self-insured employers, which on average are considerably smaller than commercial health plans, the demographics of a plan\u2019s membership can differ dramatically from the demographics of the entire American population. Such criticisms are certainly relevant to the class certification analysis, but speak more directly to the typicality and predominance requirements. Even if Dr. Conti\u2019s estimates are inflated by a factor of ten, plaintiffs have proffered sufficiently numerous TPP class members to justify certification. Although \u201cnumbers alone are not usually determinative\u201d for the nu-merosity analysis, <em>Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., </em>780 F.2d 124, 131 (1st Cir.1985), the quantity and geographical diversity of the allegedly affected TPPs leaves no question that joinder in this case would be impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Consequently, because the Court is satisfied that joinder of all parties would not be practicable within each of the indication-specific Consumer and TPP subclasses, plaintiffs have now met their burden under Rule 23(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">C. <em>Typicality</em></p>\n<p id=\"A11\">1. <em>Initial Shortcomings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court also found that, in light of plaintiffs\u2019 need to certify subclasses for each condition, the proposed class representatives selected by plaintiffs were not sufficiently typical to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3). The typicality requirement \u201cis designed to align the interests of the class and the class representatives so that the latter will work to benefit the entire class through the pursuit of their own goals.\u201d <em>In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 531 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">A claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and her claims are based on the same legal theory. Even though some factual variations may not defeat typicality, the requirement is meant to ensure that the named representative\u2019s claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\"><em>Arreola v. Godinez, </em>546 F.3d 788, 798 (7th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Importantly, there is some overlap between typicality and predominance, particularly in cases, such as this, where plaintiffs intend to demonstrate causation through common proof. <em>See Motor Vehicles, </em>522 F.3d at 19 (citing <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997); 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 18:8).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court held that the two Consumer Subclass representatives put forward by plaintiffs \u2014 Gerald Smith and Loraine Kopa \u2014 who were both prescribed Neu-rontin for neuropathic pain and migraine, satisfied the typicality requirement for those two indications. However, because \u201c[plaintiffs ... failed to demonstrate that [Kopa and Smith\u2019s] claims are typical of the claims of the members of the [remaining six indication-specific subclasses],\u201d the Court required that plaintiffs propose additional Consumer subclass representatives. <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 107. The Court also insisted that because \u201cthe Complaint does not identify which off-label uses the proposed TPP representatives have paid for,\u201d that \u201c[p]laintiffs must make a proffer that a proposed TPP representative for each [indication-specific] subclass likely paid for the off-label indication for that subclass. For large TPPs that reimburse for numerous Neurontin prescriptions, standing and typicality could be met by a statistical likelihood of payment for a specific indication.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">2. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">To satisfy the Court\u2019s directive, plaintiffs proposed Consumer subclass representatives for the nociceptive pain, bipolar/mood disorder, and doses in excess of 1800 mg per day subclasses. For the bipolar/mood disorder subclass, plaintiffs proposed Jan Frank Wityk (\u201cWityk\u201d) and Gary L. Varnam (\u201cVarnam\u201d). (Pls.\u2019 Renewed Mot. at 7-8.) For nociceptive and non-neuropathic pain, plaintiffs proposed Carolyn Hollaway (\u201cHollaway\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) And for doses in excess of 1800 mg per day, plaintiffs proposed Jeanne Ramsey (\u201cRamsey\u201d). <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Defendants raise objections to each of these newly proposed class representatives. (Defs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n to Pls.\u2019 Renewed Mot. at 34-35, Docket No. 1174.) They claim that Hollaway is not typical of the class she seeks to represent because she received Neurontin for treatment of nerve related pain, not for nociceptive pain. <em>(Id. </em>at 34.) They suggest that Varnam and Ramsey are not typical in that each took Neurontin for almost four years \u201cnever once expressing any reservation as to its effectiveness in treating their conditions.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Similarly, they question the typicality of Wityk\u2019s claims because she \u201cinformed her psychiatrist that Neurontin had provided her with significant benefits, and admits that she \u2018wouldn\u2019t have gone without\u2019 Neurontin over the more than two years that [she] remained on the medication.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">On the record before the Court, none of these variations undermines the typicality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the newly proposed class representatives. The class representatives meet the definition of their indication-specific subclass, paid for at least a portion of a Neurontin prescription, and rely on the same general legal theory: that defendants\u2019 fraudulent marketing of Neurontin for treatment of these off-label indications caused them to pay for an ineffective product. Accordingly, the claims of the proposed Consumer subclass representatives for the nociceptive pain, bipolar/mood disorder, and doses in excess of 1800 mg per day subclasses are sufficiently typical to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Plaintiffs have also demonstrated that the proposed TPP class representatives are typical. Dr. Conti calculated that two of the proposed TPP class representatives, BlueC-ross/BlueShield of Louisiana (\u201cBCBSLA\u201d) and ASEA/AFSCME Local 52 Health Benefits Trust (\u201cASEA\u201d), both had a greater than 99 percent likelihood of having paid for at least some portion of an off-label Neurontin prescription for each of the five indications at issue; as such, they are typical for all five of the indication-specific TPP subclasses. (Conti Decl. \u00b6 59-60 &amp; tbl. 3.) Plaintiffs\u2019 third TPP class representative, Harden Manufacturing Corporation (\u201cHarden\u201d), had a greater than 99 percent probability of paying some of the cost for a Neurontin prescription to treat neuropathic pain, and is thus also typical of that indication-specific subclass. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 60 tbl. 3)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">D. <em>Predominance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As expressed by the Court in <em>Neurontin, </em>the predominance requirement \u2014 that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\u201d of the class, Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) \u2014 posed the most substantial obstacle to class certification. Although neither RICO nor the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act requires proof that an individual\u2019s reliance upon a defendant\u2019s material misrepresentation or omission resulted in injury, both statutes do mandate that a plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the alleged injury. <em>See Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 103 (cases cited). The initially proposed Consumer and TPP Subclasses faced different predominance problems; however, the Court\u2019s concerns with respect to both groups emanated from their ability to demonstrate by common proof that defendants\u2019 fraudulent marketing of Neurontin caused financial injury to all plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">1. <em>Consumer Subclass</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">a. <em>Initial Shortcomings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The initial proposed Consumer Subclass, which included all individuals who paid for an off-label Neurontin prescription, was fatally overbroad in that plaintiffs put forward no mechanism for \u201cdetermining] <em>which </em>consumer class members\u2019 Neurontin prescriptions were caused by defendants\u2019 alleged fraud\u2014 and who therefore have a cognizable injury\u2014 and which would have occurred even in the absence of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-12 (emphasis in original); <em>see also id. </em>at 113. The degree of difficulty in proving causation and injury was magnified by a number of factors. First, the evidence of whether the fraudulent marketing resulted in a plaintiffs receipt of an off-label prescription for Neurontin rests primarily in the minds of the prescribing doctors, not with the plaintiffs themselves. Second, the questions that would need to be answered with respect to each doctor \u2014 was he or she ever exposed to any fraudulent off-label marketing regarding Neurontin? did the marketing play any role in his or her decision to prescribe Neurontin to a particular plaintiff? \u2014 seemingly defied proof by any common means.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Recognizing this difficulty, plaintiffs represented to the Court that a yet-to-be-produced econometric analysis designed by Professor Meredith Rosenthal (\u201cProfessor Rosen-thal\u201d) \u2014 incorporating voluminous data regarding defendants\u2019 off-label marketing practices, Neurontin\u2019s price and the price of its competitor drugs, and other market conditions \u2014 would be able to identify the number of prescriptions that likely resulted from the alleged fraud. Accepting the general reliability of econometric regression analysis, the Court held that \u201cProfessor Rosenthal\u2019s proposed methodology is a plausible way of determining <em>aggregate </em>class-wide liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Determining the total number of prescriptions likely caused by defendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent conduct, however, would satisfy only half of plaintiffs\u2019 burden. <em>Cf. McLaughlin v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>522 F.3d 215, 223 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cBut proof of misrepresentation\u2014 even widespread and uniform misrepresentation-only satisfies half of the equation; the other half, reliance on the misrepresentation, cannot be the subject of general proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0\">[wjhile Dr. Rosenthal may be able to statistically determine on a national basis that the majority of prescriptions were written as a result of fraudulent marketing activity, there is no way of identifying which doctors prescribed Neurontin based on this promotion as opposed to lawful off-label prescribing by a doctor who is exercising his own medical judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">If Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s model would show that some quantity of off-label prescriptions for each indication was not caused by defendants\u2019 fraudulent marketing, the fact-finder would be required to conduct inquiries to identify which prescriptions were the result of fraud and which were not. Simply put, \u201c[h]ere, there is no way to identify injured class members ... [and] to establish causation and injury the plaintiffs would need to conduct inquiries into the prescribing decisions of each class member\u2019s physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. Certifying the initial overbroad class would have resulted in the \u201ctorrent of individual trials,\u201d <em>id., </em>that Rule 23(b)(3) is designed to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Despite the seemingly insurmountable barrier these individualized inquiries posed to certification of the Consumer Subclass, the Court held that defendants \u201cshould not get off scot-free if there is a practical statistical way to address the difficult causation issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that if, within a given indication-specific subclass, a statistical analysis could show that essentially all of the prescriptions written for plaintiffs were the result of the alleged fraud, then individualized inquiries would be unnecessary and the predominance requirement would be satisfied. In other words, if Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s model could demonstrate that \u201conly a de minimis number of doctors prescribed Neurontin for an off-label condition, and then off-label prescriptions skyrocketed after a fraudulent campaign for that indication (i.e., migraines or bipolar), the Court will consider statistical proof as sufficient to demonstrate that most purchasers in that period were injured.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">In crafting the de minimis standard, the Court relied primarily on price inflation consumer fraud cases in which courts allowed plaintiffs to use aggregate, statistical proof to establish classwide causation. <em>Id. </em>113-14 (citing <em>In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., </em>188 F.R.D. 295 (N.D.Ill1999); <em>Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>449 F.Supp.2d 992 (E.D.N.Y.2006) <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. McLaughlin, </em>522 F.3d 215, 223 (2d Cir.2008); <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liability Litig., </em>493 F.Supp.2d 571 (E.D.N.Y.2007) (hereinafter <em>Zyprexa); Aspinall v. Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 813 N.E.2d 476 (Mass.2004)). The cases upon which the Court constructed the de minimis standard all had one characteristic in common; every member of the putative classes was necessarily injured because defendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent marketing caused an increase in a product\u2019s price, meaning everyone who purchased the product paid too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Some of these cases also borrowed, implicitly and explicitly, from the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory adopted by a plurality of the Supreme Court in <em>Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). <em>See Schwab, </em>449 F.Supp.2d at 1115-17 (recognizing that <em>Basic </em>is \u201cneither binding in this case, nor identical in reasoning,\u201d but holding that \u201c[s]uch a presumption may be appropriate in the present ease\u201d); <em>Zyprexa, </em>493 F.Supp.2d at 579 (relying heavily on the portions of <em>Schwab </em>that spoke to <em>Basic\u2019s </em>fraud-on-the-market presumption). When analyzing class certification in a case of alleged fraud perpetrated on an efficient securities market, the fraud-on-the-market theory \u201cobviates the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate individualized reliance on a defendant\u2019s misstatement by permitting a class-wide rebuttable presumption of reliance, thereby enabling a securities fraud class action to meet Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s commonality requirement.\u201d <em>In re PolyMedica Corp. Secs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Litig., </em>432 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2005) (hereinafter <em>PolyMedica). </em>The critical leap in the fraud-on-the-market theory is from market efficiency to a presumption of classwide reliance and injury. Because an asset\u2019s price in an \u201copen and developed securities market\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEu\">determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business[,] ... [misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.... The causal connection between the defendants\u2019 fraud and the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdJ\"><em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 241-42, 108 S.Ct. 978. The efficiency of the market, which internalizes the misrepresentation into the price of the asset, creates the presumption that everyone who purchased a share of stock both indirectly relied upon and was injured by the misrepresentation. <em>PolyMedica, </em>432 F.3d at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Of course, the instant suit does not involve price inflation or an efficient market. On the facts alleged by the plaintiffs, the Court could not simply presume that defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct caused all the off-label Neurontin prescriptions. What plaintiffs requested, and what the Court permitted in <em>Neurontin, </em>is that plaintiffs be provided with an opportunity to show, through well-established statistical methods (i.e., Professor Ro-senthal\u2019s report), that defendants\u2019 fraudulent marketing of off-label Neurontin so distorted the information in the medical marketplace that all (or nearly all) doctors who chose to prescribe Neurontin off-label were affected by defendants\u2019 fraud. In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court held that if Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model could accomplish that difficult task, plaintiffs would be entitled to a presumption of causation to satisfy Rule 23\u2019s predominance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">b. <em>Developments in the Law Since August 2007</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A quartet of cases decided after August 2007 has led the court to reconsider permitting the use of statistical evidence to establish a classwide presumption of causation. First, the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>International Union of Operating Engineers Local No. 68 Welfare Fund v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc., </em>192 N.J. 372, 929 A.2d 1076 (2007) (hereinafter <em>Vioxx), </em>forecloses the instant plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify indication-specific Consumer subclasses under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. In that case, a class of TPP plaintiffs suing under the NJCFA alleged that the defendant-pharmaceutical company\u2019s fraudulent marketing of Vioxx resulted in an increased price for the drug and its placement on TPPs\u2019 preferred status lists. Although the New Jersey Supreme Court admitted that common issues of fact permeated \u201cdefendant\u2019s marketing plan[,] withholding of adverse information, ... the FDA warning letters [Merck received regarding Vioxx\u2019s safety, and] the drug\u2019s eventual withdrawal from the market,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 388, 929 A.2d 1076, the court held that individual inquiries relating to why particular TPPs treated Vioxx in a particular manner overwhelmed questions common to the class. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">plaintiff does not suggest that each of these proposed class members, receiving the same information from defendant, reacted in a uniform or even similar manner. Rather, the record speaks loudly in its demonstration that each [proposed plaintiff] ... made individualized decisions concerning the benefits that would be available to its members for whom Vioxx was prescribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 390-91, 929 A.2d 1076. Although this holding addresses TPP plaintiffs and not consumers or doctors, its ramifications for the instant case should be immediately apparent. Where plaintiffs (or plaintiffs\u2019 doctors) react differently to a misrepresentation, a presumption of reliance cannot be utilized to satisfy the predominance requirement under the NJCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Further, even, the court squarely rebuffed plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to utilize statistical evidence to establish a presumption of causation in the consumer fraud context. The court explained that \u201c[t]o the extent that plaintiff seeks ... to be relieved [by the use of statistical evidence] of the usual requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>plaintiff prove [causation], the theory must fail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 929 A.2d 1076. The Court continued stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">[t]o the extent that plaintiff intends to rely on a single expert to establish [causation] in place of a demonstration of an ascertainable loss or in place of proof of a causal nexus between defendant\u2019s acts and the claimed damages, ... plaintiffs proofs would fail. That proof theory would indeed be the equivalent of fraud on the market, a theory we have not extended to CFA claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\"><em>Vioxx, </em>192 N.J. at 392, 929 A.2d 1076. Because Vioxx precludes NJCFA plaintiffs from establishing causation through a report from a single expert, and the instant plaintiffs seek to do exactly that, the Court must DENY plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify all the indication-specific Consumer subclasses under the NJCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Recent decisions handed down by federal courts are equally problematic for plaintiffs\u2019 proposed method for establishing classwide causation for the remaining RICO claims. Most influential among these is <em>McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., </em>522 F.3d 215 (2d Cir.2008), in which the Second Circuit reversed Judge Weinstein\u2019s certification of a nationwide class of individuals who smoked \u201cLight\u201d cigarettes in <em>Schwab, </em>449 F.Supp.2d at 992. The <em>McLaughlin </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claimed \u201cthat defendants\u2019 implicit representation that Lights were healthier led them to buy Lights in greater quantity than they otherwise would have and at an artificially high price, resulting in plaintiffs\u2019 overpayment for cigarettes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. Although the injury alleged by the plaintiffs differed from the case at bar, the <em>McLaughlin </em>plaintiffs\u2019 theory of causation was nearly identical to the theory put forward by the instant plaintiffs. Invoking the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory, they suggested that \u201cthat defendants distorted the body of public information and that, in purchasing Lights, plaintiffs relied upon the public\u2019s general sense that Lights were healthier than full-flavored cigarettes, whether or not individual plaintiffs were actually aware of defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223-24. As here, plaintiffs also argued that \u201cthey should be entitled to a presumption of reliance____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225. Plaintiffs even put forward statistical evidence from an expert purportedly demonstrating that \u201c90.1% of those who smoked Lights chose to do so because of Lights\u2019 alleged health benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Despite the fact that the packaging of every \u201cLight\u201d cigarette contained, at the very least, an implicit representation that \u201cLight\u201d cigarettes were healthier than normal cigarettes, the <em>McLaughlin </em>court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">[individualized proof [was] needed to overcome the possibility that a member of the purported class purchased Lights for some reason other than the belief that Lights were a healthier alternative \u2014 for example, if a Lights smoker was unaware of that representation, preferred the taste Lights, or chose Lights as an expression of personal style.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 223; <em>see also id. </em>at 225 (\u201c[E]aeh plaintiff in this case could have elected to purchase light cigarettes for any number of reasons, including a preference for the taste and a feeling that smoking Lights was \u2018cool.\u2019 \u201d). Consequently, because litigation of the class\u2019 claims would unavoidably involve an inquiry into each plaintiff\u2019s motivation for purchasing Light cigarettes, the court found that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the predominance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">The Eighth Circuit reached a similar result in <em>In re St. Jude Medical Inc. Silzone Heart Valve Products Litigation, </em>522 F.3d 836 (8th Cir.2008) (hereinafter <em>St. Jude). </em>Faced with a motion for class certification by a group of plaintiffs who were implanted with an unsafe heart valve, the court found that individualized questions, regarding whether patients or their doctors had ever been exposed to misrepresentations about the faulty medical device, would overwhelm issues common to the class. Even assuming that under Minnesota\u2019s consumer fraud statute the plaintiffs did not need to present direct evidence of reliance upon misleading statements, the court found that it could not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5B\"><em>prohibit </em>St. Jude from presenting direct evidence that an individual plaintiff (or his or her physician) did not rely on represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tations from St. Jude. When such evidence is available, then it is highly relevant and probative on the question whether there is a causal nexus between alleged misrepresentations and any injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 840 (emphasis in original). Such a conclusion was especially warranted where the defendants had discovered evidence that many of named class representatives and their doctors had never been exposed to any misrepresentations about the device. <em>Id. </em>at 839. As a result, the court concluded that class certification was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Finally, in <em>In re TJX Cos. Retail Security Breach Litigation, </em>a negligent misrepresentation case brought by credit card issuers against data security companies, Judge Young of this Court held that where reliance is an element of a claim, a presumption of reliance is never appropriate because \u201c[proving the element of reliance will necessarily involve individual questions of fact.\u201d 246 F.R.D. 389, 395 (D.Mass.2007) (hereinafter <em>TJX); see also id. </em>(\u201c \u2018A fraud class action cannot be certified when individual reliance will be an issue.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>84 F.3d 734, 745 (5th Cir.1996)). Of particular relevance to the case at bar, Judge Young found that, given the evidence before the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">[ejven if reliance could, in some situations, be demonstrated for the class as a whole via circumstantial evidence, doing so would not be appropriate here____ [Defendants] would have the right to introduce ... evidence [that plaintiffs had not relied on misrepresentations] at trial in order to rebut the [plaintiffs\u2019] assertion of reliance, creating precisely the type of \u201cindividualized evidentiary issue [that is] a persuasive reason for denying certification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 396 (quoting <em>Mowbray v. Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., </em>189 F.R.D. 194, 198 (D.Mass. 1999)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">These cases collectively stand for at least two propositions critical to the instant plaintiffs\u2019 motion. First, they reinforce the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Neurontin </em>that, if plaintiffs cannot prove classwide causation through Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report, all of the indication-specific Consumer subclasses will be unable to satisfy the predominance requirement. The <em>McLaughlin, St. Jude, </em>and TJX courts were unwilling to deny defendants an opportunity to present evidence that their alleged fraud did not cause a particular plaintiffs injury. As such, in all three cases, individual questions relating to exposure and causation predominated over questions common to the class as a whole. And as a result, Rule 23(b)(3) certification was not appropriate. <em>McLaughlin </em>is particularly compelling on this point. Not only did <em>McLaughlin </em>reverse <em>Schwab, </em>a case upon which this Court relied heavily in fashioning the de minimis standard, <em>See Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 113-14, but <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>holding underlines the potential problems of granting class certification in the instant ease. In <em>McLaughlin, </em>even though every single plaintiff in the class of smokers was exposed to the defendant\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations, the court still required that the plaintiffs demonstrate, on an individual basis, that the misrepresentation caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. To allow the instant plaintiffs to proceed as a class without a presumption of causation, when serious questions remain regarding individual doctors\u2019 exposure to defendants\u2019 misrepresentations and the causal nexus between those misrepresentations and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, would inevitably result in individual issues predominating over common questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Second, the cases discussed above highlight courts\u2019 general unwillingness to permit a presumption of reliance/eausation in consumer fraud cases. <em>McLaughlin, </em>522 F.3d at 225 (\u201cWe do not think that the <em>Basic </em>presumption, or the district court\u2019s variation of it, applies in this ease; we cannot assume that, regardless of whether individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>smokers were aware of defendants\u2019 misrepresentation, the market at large internalized the misrepresentation to such an extent that all plaintiffs can be said to have relied on it.\u201d); TJX, 246 F.R.D. at 395-96; <em>Vioxx, </em>192 N.J. at 392, 929 A.2d 1076 (rejecting the fraud-on-the-market theory \u201cas being inappropriate in any context other than federal securities fraud litigation\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That courts have been uniformly hostile to attempts to extend the fraud-on-the-market theory to consumer fraud cases is not a new development in the case law. <em>See e.g., Securities Investor Prot. Corp. v. BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>222 F.3d 63, 73 (2d Cir.2000) (holding fraud-on-the-market, \u201c[t]o the extent that the federal courts have adopted this concept ... has applied only in the context of the federal securities law\u201d (citing <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. United States District Court, </em>549 F.2d 686, 695 (9th Cir.1977)); <em>Prohias v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>485 F.Supp.2d 1329, 1337 (S.D.Fla.2007); <em>Heindel v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>381 F.Supp.2d 364, 380 (D.N.J.2004); <em>Mishkin v. Peat, Manwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., </em>658 F.Supp. 271, 274-75 (S.D.N.Y.1987)). Nonetheless, the more recent cases discussed above, with highly analogous facts, collectively make the Court leery of permitting plaintiffs the benefit of a presumption of causation even with a remarkably strong statistical showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Further complicating plaintiffs\u2019 task, the First Circuit\u2019s 2008 decision in <em>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litigation, </em>522 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.2008), mandates that this Court closely scrutinize the methodology and conclusions of Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report. Prior to Motor Vehicles, this Court previously held that resolution of \u201ctechnical disputes,\u201d like those presented by Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report, should generally be resolved at a Daubert hearing, as opposed to at the class certification stage. <em>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>230 F.R.D. 61, 90 (D.Mass.2005). Thus, the Court could have certified the class after conducting a preliminary review of Professor Rosenthal\u2019s results. Under Motor Vehicles, however, when evaluating a motion to certify a class, it is incumbent on the \u201cthe district court ... [to] engage in a searching inquiry into the viability of [a novel or complex theory as to injury] and the existence of the facts necessary for the theory to succeed.\u201d 522 F.3d at 26; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cSuch reliance on a novel theory to establish a primary element of a claim necessitates a more searching inquiry into whether plaintiffs will be able to prove the pivotal elements of their theory at trial. This is especially so when a case implicates the sort of factors that we have deemed important in the Rule 23(f) calculus, namely, when the granting of class status \u2018raises the stakes of litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, </em>208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is nothing if not novel; they ask the Court to permit a statistical analysis to function as common proof of causation for millions of disparate and varied human interactions that resulted in off-label prescriptions for Neurontin. Consequently, it is incumbent on the Court to look closely at how Professor Rosenthal arrived at her conclusions and to determine if the evidence already produced in this case supports her methodology and findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">With these developments in the law in mind, the Court moves on to examine Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report and whether it can operate as common proof of causation for plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims. As the following discussion indicates, the Court is not convinced that Professor Rosenthal\u2019s statistical findings are sufficient to certify any of the indication-specific Consumer subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">2. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Response </em>\u2014 The <em>Rosenthal Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">a. <em>Rosenthal Report Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Professor Rosenthal\u2019s completed report, submitted on September 9, 2008, quantifies the effect of defendants\u2019 promotion of off-label prescriptions for Neurontin for each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the five indication-specific Consumer subclasses with which plaintiffs chose to proceed. (Decl. of Meredith Rosenthal (\u201cRosenthal Report\u201d) at 1, Ex. A, Docket No. 1427.) In addition, because Neurontin prescriptions to treat neuropathic and nociceptive pain were written by neurologists, who prescribed Neu-rontin for on-label use as an anti-epileptic drug, as well as by doctors from other specialties, Professor Rosenthal further subdivided her analysis of off-label prescriptions for those indications by type of doctor. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 26.) Professor Rosenthal then compared the actual data for the number of prescriptions written for each indication to results generated in a \u201cbut-for\u201d model, in which defendants did not engage in any off-label marketing. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b647.) From this comparison, Professor Rosenthal drew conclusions about the number of off-label Neurontin prescriptions that were caused by defendants\u2019 \u201cunlawful marketing efforts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 31.) The following chart summarizes the results of Professor Rosenthal\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b374-106\"><em>(Id., </em>attach. G.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-107\">Before the Court addresses defendants\u2019 challenges to Professor Rosenthal\u2019s methodology, a few conclusions are immediately apparent. First, the percentage of fraudulent Neurontin prescriptions written for migraines (27.90 percent), for doses greater than 1800 milligrams per day (37.50 percent), and for neuropathic (25.10 percent) and noci-ceptive pain (32.90 percent), by neurologists, falls short of demonstrating that defendant\u2019s off-label promotion caused all but a de min-imis number of off-label prescriptions. In Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model, an individual prescription for any of these indications written by the specified type of doctor has no greater than a 50 percent (and in some cases much lower) likelihood that it was caused, directly or indirectly, by defendants\u2019 fraudulent marketing. As such, individual inquiries into why a doctor prescribed Neurontin off-label would plainly be required, and common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>issues would not predominate under Rule 23(b)(3). For those indication-specific Consumer subclasses, the Court denies the motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The motion for class certification with respect to all neuropathic and nociceptive pain Consumer plaintiffs is a closer question. Non-neurologist prescriptions written for those conditions satisfy the Court\u2019s de min-imis standard, but only if the subclass definitions are modified to delineate by condition and the specialty of the potential class member\u2019s physician, as done in the chart above. According to Professor Rosenthal\u2019s analysis, virtually 100 percent of Neurontin prescriptions written by non-neurologists for the treatment of neuropathic pain and nocicep-tive pain, respectively, were caused by defendants\u2019 off-label marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The bipolar and mood disorder subclass is another indication for which Professor Ro-senthal\u2019s model shows the type causal nexus between defendants\u2019 off-label marketing efforts and the increase in Neurontin prescriptions that could support a conclusion that a fraud had been perpetrated on the entire prescription market. According to Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report, 99.4 percent of Neurontin prescriptions written by psychiatrists for bipolar disorder were the direct or indirect result of defendants\u2019 unlawful marketing. In other words, absent defendants\u2019 fraudulent off-label promotion, only 0.6 percent of the Neurontin prescriptions given to patients with bipolar/mood disorders would have been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Because essentially all of the Neurontin prescriptions for these indications were, according to Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model, the result of fraudulent promotion, plaintiffs\u2019 claims for the indications would not require an individual inquiry into why a particular prescription was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">b. <em>Rosenthal Report Methodology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Class certification of these subclasses would only be appropriate if Professor Ro-senthal\u2019s methodology can withstand close scrutiny. At this juncture, it is important to reiterate that Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model must show that defendants\u2019 <em>fraudulent </em>marketing, not simply their off-label marketing, caused the prescriptions written for the putative class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model addresses the unsurprising hypothesis that \u201cpromotional expenditures will increase prescribing of Neurontin.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 35.) It takes into account four primary variables: the retail price of Neurontin, the retail price of Neurontin\u2019s competitor drugs within a given indication, the amount of spending by defendants to promote Neurontin with respect to a particular specialty, and the amount of spending by Neurontin\u2019s competitors to promote their drugs for that same specialty. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 34.) Of these factors, the promotion variable is by far the most important, as it is the only factor that purports to capture the extent of defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct. Within the model, the promotion variable is equal to the sum of the spending by defendants on (1) detailing (i.e., sending paid representatives to doctors\u2019 offices to discuss uses for a particular drug and deliver samples) and (2) professional journal advertising, and excludes all other expenses defendants may have incurred in marketing Neurontin for off-label use. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 36.) She views expenditures on detailing as the \u201ckey explanatory variable\u201d in a doctor\u2019s decision to prescribe Neurontin. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">As such, expenditures on detailing are the primary drivers of the methodology. Professor Rosenthal\u2019s model relies on the amount spent on detailing to physician groups that ordinarily do not prescribe Neurontin for its approved uses to measure the impact of defendants\u2019 fraudulent off-label marketing campaigns. Professor Rosenthal has assumed on instruction of counsel that all detailing during the class period was both off-label and fraudulent. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b646, 47, attachs. 1.1, 1.4.) She explains that \u201c[bjecause of the limits in [her] data, [she is] unable to account systematically\u201d for the influence that the \u201cmanipulation of the published literature to which physicians look for impartial information\u201d had on prescribing. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 53.) As such, she views her numbers as \u201cconservative.\u201d <em>{Id.) </em>Plaintiffs argue: \u201cAll such detailing was necessarily fraudulent, because it promoted Neurontin\u2019s use for indications for which it had either been proven ineffective or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which there was no scientific evidence of efficacy.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Resp. to Defs.\u2019 Suppl. Opp\u2019n at 5 n. 7, Docket No. 1453.) The core assumption in the Rosenthal model is that off-label prescriptions caused by detailing expenditures were necessarily caused by a fraud, that is, that off-label promotion was the same as fraudulent promotion. As Madison Avenue would have predicted, Professor Rosenthal finds a strong correlation between expenditures on Neurontin promotion and the number of prescriptions written for the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">While in the aggregate Professor Rosen-thal\u2019s report has some surface appeal, the record in this case demonstrates why the use of spending on fraudulent off-label detailing as a means to ascertain the number of prescriptions subject to the fraud is flawed. Significantly, the testimony of the prescribing physicians for the bipolar/mood disorder, nociceptive pain (non-neurologist), and neuro-pathic pain (non-neurologist) subclass representatives indicates that only one of them, Dr. Gregory A. Rogers, was ever detailed by defendants about Neurontin. <em>(See </em>Dep. of Gregory A. Rogers) (\u201cRogers Dep.\u201d), at 95, Ex. 12, Docket No. 1175 (stating Dr. Rogers, family doctor for nociceptive and non-neuro-pathic pain subclass representative Hollaway, was certain he had been detailed by defendants about Neurontin); Dep. of Jerrold Gray (\u201cGray Dep.\u201d), Ex. 14, Docket No. 1175 (containing no evidence that Dr. Gray, the primary care physician for bipolar/mood disorder class representative Wityk, was ever detailed by defendants about Neurontin); Dep. of John Arness (\u201cArness Dep.\u201d), at 65-66, Ex. 18, Docket No. 1175 (containing affirmative testimony from Dr. Arness, the only psychiatrist who treated bipolar/mood disorder class representative Varnam and who was deposed, that he was never detailed by defendants about Neurontin and never requested information from defendants about Neurontin); Dep. of Thaddeus Poe (\u201cPoe Dep.\u201d), Ex. 4, Docket No. 1175 (containing no evidence that Dr. Poe, family doctor for neu-ropathic pain subclass representative Smith, was ever detailed by defendants about Neu-rontin (or ever prescribed Neurontin for Smith).) And Dr. Rogers testified that all of the Neurontin detailing of his office was with respect to on-label uses for the drug. (Rogers Dep. at 95.) Because of the absence of evidence of detailing of the doctors at issue in this case, the requirement that plaintiffs establish a nexus between the doctor and the sales team will create individualized issues that will inevitably predominate over the common questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Even if this hurdle could be overcome, Professor Rosenthal\u2019s analysis does not take into account any other factors that may have led doctors\u2019 to prescribe Neurontin for off-label indications. The deposition testimony of the doctors for the bipolar/mood disorder class representatives shows that their decisions to prescribe Neurontin resulted from a wide variety of influences unrelated to the three components of defendants\u2019 alleged fraud. Dr. Gray, primary care physician for bipolar/mood disorder class representative Wityk, testified that the main reason he prescribed Neurontin for Wityk was that Wityk\u2019s prior physician had prescribed Neurontin and Wityk was unwilling to change medication. (Gray Dep. at 50; <em>see also id. </em>at 101-102 (explaining that Wi-tyk ceased taking Neurontin for a four or five month period of time because she could no longer afford it with her insurance coverage).) Dr. Arness, psychiatrist for bipolar/mood disorder class representative Var-nam, testified that he prescribed Neurontin because of information he had learned about Neurontin from fellow doctors, because of his personal experience in successfully using the drug with other patients, because anti-convulsants like Neurontin were \u201cwidely known and widely accepted as a treatment for bipolar disorder,\u201d and because Neurontin had a relatively benign set of side effects. (Arness Dep. at 23-25, <em>62-64.)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Finally, Professor Rosenthal, at the instruction of plaintiffs\u2019s counsel, assumes that all detailing to specialists other than neurologists was both off-label and fraudulent. (Rosenthal Report \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47.) To be certain, this assumption has validity, especially as it might apply to the bipolar/mood disorder subclass. Evidence produced by plaintiffs indicates that defendants, at least by 1995, were aware that Neurontin (1) was no better than a placebo in treating bipolar/mood disorder and (2) was connected with an increased risk of depression and suicide. Plaintiffs assert that \u201cthe fraudulent marketing of Neurontin for bipolar disorder represents the most serious claim by the Plaintiffs and the most egregious breach of ethical conduct by Defendants.\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Mot. for Leave to File Suppl. Expert Reports at 6, Docket No. 1503.) It is a short leap from that evidence to a reasonable conclusion that no plausible, non-fraudulent reason existed for defendants to detail psychiatrists.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, it is reasonable to infer that information about depression and suicidal side effects was material to a psychiatrist\u2019s decision-making about which drug to prescribe. However, many doctors were not detailed, and even if they were, the plaintiffs would have to demonstrate doctor-by-doctor that defendants\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions during the off-label promotion caused the doctor to prescribe the medication. The model, while persuasive in the aggregate, cannot provide a shortcut for the indication-specific Consumer subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Given the limitations in Professor Rosen-thal\u2019s analysis, her report does not suffice to defeat the predominance challenge. As is discussed above, without this statistical proof to support a presumption of causation, plaintiffs cannot meet Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement. Consequently, the Court must also deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify the bipolar/mood disorder consumer subclass, and the non-neurologist nociceptive and neuropathic pain Consumer subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">3. <em>Third Party Payors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">a. <em>Initial Shortcomings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In <em>Neurontin, </em>the Court indicated that \u201c[a] different problem in manageability exists for TPPs which reimburse for Neurontin____\u201d 244 F.R.D. at 114. Because many of the TPPs are quite large, covering more than one million individuals, the Court held, as a hypothetical matter, that \u201c[i]f Dr. Rosenthal has an accurate methodology for calculating that, say, 85% of all Neurontin prescriptions for migraines resulted from a fraudulent marketing campaign, it seems reasonable for a TPP to allege that 85% of its reimbursements for that indication were a result of the fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such would not be the ease, however, \u201cif TPPs are unable to distinguish between payments for on- and off-label prescriptions, or among the indications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Due to insufficiencies in the record, it was \u201cunclear\u201d if causation and injury with respect to the TPPs could be \u201cresolved statistically.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">b. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">As is addressed in the Court\u2019s discussion of numerosity, the plaintiffs have put forward sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that all or nearly all of the members of the proposed indication-specific TPP subclasses paid for at least one off-label Neurontin prescription. But as with the indication-specific Consumer subclasses, such a showing does not, by itself, demonstrate that common issues predominate with respect to the claims of the TPPs. To prevail on the merits, the TPPs must prove that defendants\u2019 <em>fraud </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>caused the off-label Neurontin prescriptions for which the TPPs paid. If, in the process of establishing causation, individualized issues would overwhelm common questions, certification under Rule 23(b)(3) would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">To begin with, certification of the TPPs\u2019 claims under the NJCFA is prohibited by <em>Vioxx. </em>As in <em>Vioxx, </em>plaintiffs here seek to use a single causation expert in the place of presenting individualized proof of causation. <em>Vioxx, </em>192 N.J. at 392, 929 A.2d 1076. The New Jersey Supreme Court held unequivocally that such a showing cannot satisfy the New Jersey predominance requirement, which parallels the federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Further, though Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report provides reliable proof that a certain percentage off-label prescriptions for Neu-rontin reimbursed by the TPPs was caused by defendants\u2019 promotion for certain indications, differences among TPPs would still necessitate individualized inquiries into whether defendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent marketing caused each TPP any economic damages. <em>See generally </em>Deck of Gregory K Bell (\u201cBell Deck\u201d), Ex. 35, Docket No. 1175; <em>see also Vioxx, </em>192 N.J. at 378-381, 929 A.2d 1076 (discussing the complexities inherent in how different TPPs approve the use and reimbursement for a particular pharmaceutical).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">As documented in the Declaration of Dr. Gregory Bell, TPPs exhibit a great degree of heterogeneity. Most critical to the instant analysis are differences between TPPs with respect to how they approved and reimbursed off-label Neurontin prescriptions for their members. Most TPPs, 89 percent according to a 2000 study, use complex schedules, called formularies, to define \u201c(1) which drugs are covered; (2) guidelines and restrictions on prescribing and use; (3) the number of tiers in the formulary; (4) the placement of particular drugs in preferred or nonpre-ferred positions on the formulary; and (5) patient cost-sharing provisions [i.e., copays].\u201d (Bell Deck \u00b6 53.) Some formularies require prior authorization before a particular drug can be prescribed; others require that a drug can only be dispensed for a particular indication (\u201cuse limits\u201d), by a particular type of doctor (\u201cspecialty limits\u201d), in a limited amount (\u201cquantity limits\u201d), or after other drugs have been tried and found unsatisfactory (\u201cstep therapy\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.) Some TPPs produce their own formularies, while others, typically smaller TPPs, purchase for-mularies <em>from </em>other TPPs or <em>from </em>independent companies known as pharmaceutical benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d). Alterations to any of the formulary\u2019s characteristics can dramatically change the amount that a TPP and its members pay for drugs and influence the prescribing decisions of the members\u2019 doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The formularies themselves are typically generated by Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics (\u201cP &amp; T\u201d) Committees, small working groups housed within a TPP or PBM. P &amp; T Committees are usually comprised of independent physicians from various medical spe-cialities, clinical pharmacists, a medical director, and a representative of the quality assurance department of the entity creating the formulary. (Id. \u00b6 49.) According to Dr. Bell, before deciding how to treat a pharmaceutical in a formulary, \u201c[t]hese committees review a variety of types of information in evaluating a drug, including the FDA-approved label, clinical trials, randomized control studies, uncontrolled studies, other clinical literature, and the TPP\u2019s own experience with how patients respond to a drug in the real world____\u201d (Id)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Within this context, formularies classified the off-label use of Neurontin for the indications at issue in this case in many different ways. According to Dr. Bell, by 2000, \u201capproximately 30 percent of covered lives were under plans that excluded coverage for off-label prescriptions.\u201d (Id \u00b6 57.) Those TPPs and PBMs that agreed to reimburse for off-label Neurontin prescriptions chose to include Neurontin in their formularies with varying prior authorization, use, specialty, and quantity limitations. (See id. \u00b6 59 (describing how 16 different TPPs included off-label Neurontin prescriptions in 16 different ways).) Indeed, Dr. Bell asserts that many TPPs recommend or require <em>and continue to require </em>the use of Neurontin to treat off-label conditions. <em>(Id </em>\u00b6 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Given this background information, formu-laries, and hence the decision-making of the P &amp; T Committees that created the formular-ies, become central to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. To prevail, plaintiffs must prove that defendants\u2019 fraudulent omissions or representations caused these committees to approve the use and reimbursement of Neurontin for off-label indications in a manner that was different from what would have occurred absent the alleged fraudulent marketing. In attempting to satisfy that burden, the TPP plaintiffs have fewer difficulties regarding causation than their Consumer plaintiff counterparts. The burden is less onerous because a TPP plaintiff would not have to prove that the misrepresentations caused a specific doctor to prescribe Neurontin to an individual patient. An aggregate model makes particular sense for the larger TPPs, or clusters of TPPs that rely on the same formulary, because a TPP plaintiff would only have to prove that the P &amp; T Committee was fraudulently induced to approve Neurontin for a specific indication. If 99 percent of all bipolar prescriptions, say, were caused by a fraudulent campaign, in some circumstances, it would be reasonable to conclude that 99 percent of the TPP\u2019s reimbursements for that indication were fraudulently caused. Still, though there were far fewer P &amp; T Committees that approved Neurontin\u2019s use for off-label indications than there were doctors who prescribed Neurontin off-label, in order to establish the requisite causation for the TPPs, plaintiffs would have to present individualized evidence about what information a P &amp; T Committee was exposed to regarding Neurontin and how the absence of fraudulent information would have altered Neurontiris placement within its formulary and how that alternative classification of Neurontin would have saved the TPP money.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In response to these contentions by defendants\u2019 expert, plaintiffs rely exclusively on their experts\u2019 submissions that defendants had perpetrated a fraud on the entire pharmaceutical market. They claim that the all P &amp; T Committees \u201cwere undoubtedly influenced by the same pervasive disinformation campaign as were the physicians writing the prescriptions.\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Resp. to Defs.\u2019 Supplemental Mem. at 17.) However, because of the limitations in Professor Rosenthal\u2019s report and the heterogeneity of the TPPs\u2019 for-mularies, plaintiffs simply have not presented the court with an acceptable form of common proof that would justify class certification of the TPP subclasses. The Court finds that class certification of the TPP subclasses would inevitably result in a tsunami of individual, complex trials. <em>Neurontin, </em>244 F.R.D. at 114. Accordingly, the Court denies plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for class certification with respect to all five indication-specific TPP subclasses on the grounds that common questions will not predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Court is still quite troubled by defendants\u2019 blatantly illegal off-label promotion activities for which they have been criminally sanctioned. Defendants have fought this suit tooth-and-nail, and a small TPP would be wary of taking on the drug Goliath. Still, much of the work has been done. This denial of class certification does not preclude individual TPPs from bringing suit on their own behalf, as many well-heeled TPPs have already done. In addition, hundreds of individual consumers press products liability and fraud claims as part of this multi-district litigation. Any liability findings in favor of these plaintiffs (i.e., whether there was a fraud), will have issue preclusion effects for smaller TPPs and other consumers with fewer resources. Accordingly, given the complexity of each TPP\u2019s method of reimbursement, the class action mechanism is not superior to other methods of affording relief to other TPPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for class certification is <em>DENIED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">.

The evidence regarding Neurontin prescriptions written by non-neurologists for subclass representatives suffering from neuropathic and nociceptive pain also fails to comport with Professor Rosenthal\u2019s assumptions. Dr. Poe, physician for neuropathic pain subclass representative Smith, never prescribed Neurontin to Smith; rather. Smith\u2019s Neurontin prescriptions were written by Dr. Kylene Huler, a neurologist to whom Smith was referred. <em>(See </em>Poe Dep. at 29-36.) Although Dr. Rogers, family doctor for no-ciceptive pain subclass representative Hollaway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>was detailed regarding Neurontin (for on-label uses only), he began prescribing Neurontin to treat neuropathic pain before he was ever detailed by defendants regarding Neurontin.
