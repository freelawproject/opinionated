He had paid all taxes and fees required of him. His license expired and he applied for its renewal. An ordinance of the city required such applicants, before receiving such license, to \u201cproduce the written recommendation of four of his nearest neighbors, each signature to represent a separate and distinct establishment.\u201d Whitten did not produce such a recommend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ation, (but did present one of many persons not his nearest neighbors;) and for want of it the Mayor and Council refused to grant him license. Pie sued out <em>mandamus </em>to compel them to issue such license. They answered as above and the Court refused to make the <em>mandamus </em>absolute. That is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-5\">L. B. Anderson, by E. JST.

The city authorities showed for cause why said license should not be granted, that the peittioner had failed to comply with that part of the city ordinance in relation to the issuing of license to retail spirituous liquors in said city, which is as follows: \u201c He shall, before receiving such license, produce the written recommendation of four of his nearest neighbors, each signature to represent a separate and distinct establishment.\u201d On hearing the <em>mandamus </em>the Court refused to make the same absolute, but dismissed it; whereupon, the petitioner excepted. This was a legal and valid ordinance of the city, under the grant of power conferred by the 13th section of the city charter, and there was no error in the Court below in refusing to make the <em>mandamus </em>absolute and dismissing the same. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
