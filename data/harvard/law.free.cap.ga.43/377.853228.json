Hall, and a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued thereon, on the 19th of February, 1869, was levied upon certain land as her property.

Miller put in evidence a deed by which, in June, 1868, the sole heirs of Mrs. Hall conveyed said land to him in fee simple. And he testified that when he bought the land from them he did not know there was any judgment against Mrs. Hall. He then put in evidence, over plaintiff\u2019s objection for irrelevancy, a petition and proceedings thereon, under which Miller had this land set aside as his homestead in April, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">By consent the matter was submitted to the Judge, and he held that the land was not subject to the judgment. A new trial was moved for upon the grounds that the Court erred in allowing as evidence the petition, etc,, under which Miller claimed said land as his homestead, and in holding that the land was not subject, because the Homestead Act of 1868, as against this judgment, cannot be enforced without impairing the obligation of the contract between Gunn and Mrs. Hall. He refused a new trial, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-7\">William D.

The judgment against Louisa Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>is dated 12th May, 1866. On the 3d of June, 1868, Miller purchased the land from T. K. Hall and Eliza R. Young, the heirs-at-law of Louisa Hall, the defendant in the judgment, who died after the rendition thereof. On the 10th of April, 1869, Miller applied for and obtained from the Ordinary of Randolph county a homestead on the land. The Court below decided that Miller was entitled to the homestead .as against the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, to which decision the plaintiff excepted. The Court below erred in holding, and deciding, that Miller was entitled to a homestead in the land as against the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, on the statement of facts contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
