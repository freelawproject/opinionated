Salter, plaintiff in error, <em>vs. </em>John Howard, defendant in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-5\">Where A sued B to recover damages for the enticement and employment by B, of servants on the plantation of A, which he alleges were hired by him for the year 1866, and a motion was made for a non-suit by defendant on the ground that the proof failed to show a valid and mutually binding contract between A and the servants; the fact being that A and such servants had entered into a written contract, but which had not been signed or approved by the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau, though contemplated that it should be so submitted for approval by the parties thereto, but the servants had gone on under the contract, and was at work at A\u2019s plantation, and had been there nearly a month, and the Court overruled the non-suit:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-6\"><em>Held, </em>That this was not error by the Court. After the emancipation of the slaves in Georgia, they were competent to contract for their labor, and while in the employment of one under a contract, it was illegal for any other party to interfere and hire them, and such person cannot, under our laws, defend himself against the wrong by setting up questions arising on the contract of such servants by A.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-7\">2. <em>Held again, </em>Where upon the trial for enticement of servants from the employment of another, the Court permitted evidence of consequential damages,- to go to the jury, to the effect that the servants he first employed had provisions, and those he subsequently employed to take their place had not, by which he was compelled to furnish provisions, and, making a poor crop, such persons were unable to pay him for the provisions furnished out of their share of the crop, by which he was damaged; that this was error. The damage the law recognizes as legal to be recovered upon such actions are actual damages sustained by the act at the time of its commission, and the expense and time lost in getting other servants, or injury to the crop by interruption of the labor thereon or failure to obtain other labor after faithful effort to do so ; or losses of like character are proper and legal for the consideration of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-8\">8. <em>Held, </em>The Court erred in refusing a new trial upon.the admission of illegal evidence which misled the jury on the question of damages under the facts in this case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-9\">Master and servant. Damages. Before Judge Cole. Houston Superior Court. December, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-10\">Howard averred that certain eighteen negroes were employed by him as his servants for carrying on his farming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>operations, yet Salter, knowing this fact, and with a view to injure him, on the 29th of January, 1866, wrongfully enticed them away into <em>Ms </em>service, whereby Howard lost the profits of their labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">Howard testified about the 24th of December, 1865, he hired said negroes to work on his plantation for 1866. They were to furnish themselves and get one-third of the crop. These terms were reduced to writing, he took a copy and gave them one, but neither he nor they signed the contract, because it was desirable to fill up the number of hands wanted before Agoing to sign before the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agent. These negroes were on his place till about the 22d of January, 1866, when they left, saying they were going to defendant. About that time Salter\u2019s wagon came for them, but Howard sent it back, with a note that he had employed them for 1866, and he supposed he, Salter, would not employ them. Salter\u2019s agent sent back an insolent reply. Subsequently the negroes left. He found them on Salter\u2019s place and demanded them from him. Salter replied that he would not drive the negroes off, but Howard could send the sheriff after them. Howard said he would send the sheriff after them and him too. Salter said he had made no contract with the negroes as the papers were not signed. Howard considered the signing not necessary to constitute the contract, but whether the negroes did he did not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">He said he was damaged $3,000*00. Because these negroes had provisions, while those whom he afterwards employed had none, he had to furnish them, and failing to make a crop he lost the price of these provisions. Thus ho lost $2,500 00. The interruption in the preparation of his crop, extra expense and loss of time were worth $500 00. Here the plaintiff rested his cause. Defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a non-suit, upon the ground that the alleged contract of Howard was incomplete. The motion was overruled. The defendant offered no testimony. The jury found for plaintiff for $1,200 00. Defendant\u2019s counsel moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>a new trial upon the grounds that the verdict was contrary to the principles of\u2019equity, decidedly against the weight of the evidence, and contrary to law, and because the Court erred in overruling the motion for non-suit. The new trial was refused, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-5\">Poe, Hall &amp; Poe; S. D.

The case came for trial at August Adjourned Term of Houston Superior Court, and the jury found for the plaintiff the sum of $1,200 00.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">A motion for a new trial was made by the defendant upon the following grounds, to-wit: 1st. That the Court erred in refusing a non-suit. 2d. That the verdict was contrary to evidence and law, etc. The Court overruled the motion for a new trial, and this constitutes the ground of error assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>1. The motion for non-suit was upon the ground that the plaintiff had proven no contract, consummated and complete, for the hiring of the negroes charged to be enticed by the defendant from the service of the plaintiff. The evidence in the case substantially showed that the servants <em>were </em>upon Howard\u2019s place, and at work at the time they left, and that he had made a contract with them which was to be approved by the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, but which had not been done. From an examination of the evidence we are of opinion that the written contract was incomplete, and we do not place our judgment in this case upon the validity of that contract. But the fact that these servants were under employment by Howard, and, in performance of such agreement, were upon his place at work, constituted, as to third parties, such a relationship of master and servant as protected them from being interfered with or enticed to leave his plantation. We do not hold that it is necessary to sustain this action that there must be a written contract, or that any third party can take advantage of formal defects in one if written. If under employment the servants are at work, any person intruding upon the rights of the master by enticing <em>them </em>away, is liable in an action of damages, and we therefore concur with the Court in refusing the new trial sought upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">As to the other grounds of error alleged, we are satisfied from the evidence that there was sufficient proof to sustain the verdict of the jury, so far as relates to the enticing of these servants. The defendant\u2019s wagon went to plaintiff\u2019s place after them, and plaintiff sent it back, with a note stating the negroes were in his employment, and subsequently the negroes left and were found on defendant\u2019s plantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">2. But we hold that the Court erred in admitting the evidence of damage upon the part of plaintiff in relation to the fact that these servants had- provisions to furnish themselves with, and those he employed in their place had nonej and he had to furnish them, that he made a poor crop, and never got pay for these provisions, losing thereby f2,500 00. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>damage the law gives iu cases of this character are limited to actual damages incurred at the time and by reason of the loss of the servants, and not the speculative damages arising out of poor\u2022 <em>erops, </em>or such remote causes of damage. The loss arising from the interruption in the preparation or planting of his crop, loss of time and expenses in replacing them with other hands; or if at a season of the year when the crop may be lost by such interruption, or actual damage incurred by such loss of labor to his crop at the time, is the measure of damages which should be allowed by the jury. And, inasmuch as the Court erred in the admission of this evidence, we reverse the judgment of the Court below upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
