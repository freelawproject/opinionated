Booher, plaintiff in error <em>vs. </em>Edmund H. Worrill, defendant in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b587-9\">A suit was instituted upon a joint note and one only was served, and at the trial, upon objection being made, plaintiff\u2019s counsel discontinued the suit as to the party not served, upon which the defendant then pleaded the facts in abatement, to which plea a demurrer was filed, which the Court sustained and then defendant excepted to the judgment and retired.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b587-10\"><em>Held, </em>Under section 3274 of the Code, it was error in the Court to have sustained the demurrer to the plea. This plea distinctly set out the facts, it showed that the note was joint, that the joint contractor, not served, lived in the jurisdiction of the Court and in the county where the Court was then sitting. And as to the form of the plea we may only say all the technicalities of pleading and the subleties of form have been brushed away by the sweep of an enlightened progress in the administration of justice.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-11\">Parties. Pleading. Before Judge Johnson. Muscogee Superior Court. November Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-12\">Worrell sued D. L. Booher and Milo Booher, of said county, upon a promissory note for rent, whereby they jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>promised to pay a sum of money to one Cheney\u2019s order. Worrell indorsed upon his petition, \u201cLet the sheriff return as to Milo Booher not to be found, etc., E. H. Worrell.\u201d The sheriff served D. L. Booher, and as to Milo returned only as follows: \u201c Wo copy furnished me to serve upon the other defendant, Milo Booher.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">When the cause was called for trial, D. L. Booher\u2019s counsel objected to trying it till Milo Booher should be served. The plaintiff took an order dismissing the cause as to Milo, and thereupon the Court ordered the trial to proceed. D. L. Booher then pleaded as follows : \u201cMilo Booher is, with said defendant, jointly liable to the said plaintiff on said note, and said Milo Booher resides within the jurisdiction of the Court, and did so reside at the commencement of the suit, to-wit: in the county of Muscogee in said State, and, though apparently sued in said action with the . said defendant, yet at the time of the filing of the declaration in the office of the-Clerk of the Superior Court of Muscogee county, the said plaintiff in writing instructed the said Clerk not to have the said Milo Booher served, and this the defendant is ready to verify, wherefore he prays judgment,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">This plea was demurred to and the demurrer was sustained. The defendant declining to offer other defense, judgment was entered against him by default. The sustaining said demurrer and signing said judgment are assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-7\">Moses <em>&amp; </em>Downing, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-8\">Peabody <em>&amp; </em>Brannon, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amd\">Said defendant should have pleaded the non-joinder in abatement: R. Code, secs. 3424, <em>3529; </em>23d Ga. R., 600. This was not a plea in abatement: 3 Ch., 900. He should have asked that Milo be served : 36th Ga. R., 407.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Lochrane, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The legal question presented by the record is whether a joint promissor, living within the jurisdiction of the Court when the suit is filed, must be sued with the other joint maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Suit was brought against both, but' one only was served, by direction of the plaintiff. Upon the trial the defendant objected, and the plaintiff discontinued the suit as to the party not served, and then defendant pleaded the facts in abatement. Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the plea, which the Court sustained, and the plaintiff took judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In our opinion it was error in the Court to have sustained the demurrer to the plea under section 3274 of the Code. The facts pleaded showed there was a joint contractor who lived within the jurisdiction of the Court who had not been served. And the form of the plea was immaterial to the merits of the case. Technicalities in pleading, and subleties of form have been brushed away by the sweep of an enlightened progress in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
