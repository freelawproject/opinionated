The case having been carried up to the Superior Court by writ of <em>certiorari, </em>the Court affirmed the ruling of the Justice and dismissed the same :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-7\"><em>Held, </em>That the admission of the parol evidence by the Justice to contradict the note and prove <em>conditions </em>not expressed therein, was error ; and that the Court below erred in not sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>certiorari </em>and ordering a new trial in the Justice\u2019s Court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">Parol evidence to vary writing. Before Judge Knight. Forsyth Superior Court. April, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">Fowler and one Dunaway, in 1857, gave to Lester &amp; Lester their promissory note for $20 00, due one day after date. \"When sued upon it, they \u00a1^leaded the Scaling Ordinance, and that the consideration had failed. \u2022 On the trial, the makers and a person who was present when the contract was made, testified that the note was given to get Lester <em>&amp; </em>Lester to defend the makers for riot, and that they told defendants that if they proved what they said they could, they should be cleared or not have to pay the note; that they did prove what they said they could, but were convicted. All this evidence was objected to, upon the ground that it varied the note; but the Justice overruled the objection. The Justice gave judgment against the plaintiffs. They sued out a <em>certiorari, </em>averring that the Justice erred in admitting said evidence. The judgment of the Justice was sustained, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-10\">H. P.
