Rent. Homestead. Lien. Before Judge Johnson. Stewart Superior Court. April Term, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">Harrell made affidavit that J. K. Davis owed him seven bales of middling cotton, each weighing five hundred pounds, and worth $700 00, for the rent of a plantation for 1868. A distress warrant was issued, and on the 20th of November, 1868, was levied upon four thousand eight hundred pounds of cotton seed, four thousand five hundred pounds cotton in the field, four hundred and ninety-five bushels of cotton seed, three mules and a cow and calf, and two yearlings. This cotton and cotton seed were treated here as raised on said land in 1868. Charles Davis claimed the cow and calf and half of the cotton and cotton seed, according to law, and the balance was by the Ordinary, on the 28th of November, exempted under the Homestead Act under a petition filed on the 18th of November, 1868. The sheriff being required to show cause why he had not-made the money on the warrant, answered the facts aforesaid. His answer was demurred to. The Court overruled the demurrer and refused to grant a rule absolute against the sheriff. That is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Moses &amp; Downing, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A22\">cited 41 Georgia Reports, 95, and Pry <em>vs. </em>Talliaferro, last term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-5\">J.
