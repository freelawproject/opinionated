Where, in the trial below, the claim, of certain claimants to property was predicated upon their right as grand-children of the decedent, and there were several witnesses examined upon the issue, and the evidence supports the verdict of the jury, and no rule of law was violated in submitting the case, and the Judge below refused a new trial, this Court will not interfere to set it aside.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b596-11\">2. When a motion for a new trial, upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, was overruled by the Court, and the evidence does not accompany the motion, and the character of the evidence, as suggested by the movant, is cumulative, it is not error in the Court to refuse a new trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-12\">New trial.

He had brothers and a sister, who claimed to be his heirs-at-law. This was denied by others, who claimed to his heirs, because they were his grand-children. Ross filed a bill to have them interpleaded and settle their rights. The mother of these children was known, but whether Joe\u2019s son begat them was the question in dispute. The mother was a slave at their birth, and the evidence of their paternity was conflicting. The jury found that they were his grand-children. A new trial was moved for, upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to law, etc., and because of certain newly discovered evidence. The newly discovered evidence was, that their mother always said they were the children of Joe\u2019s son, and of her intimacy with him. But there was no affidavit by the witnesses that they would testify the facts stated. Besides, the movants said they had discovered that a bribe was offered to one of the adversary\u2019s witnesses. This was positively denied by the party charged with the bribery. The Court below refused a new trial, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-5\">Nesbits &amp; Jackson ; M. B.

The claimants in this case put in evidence their being the grand-children of the decedent, whose property was the subject-matter of dispute; the other side introduced several witnesses to the contrary. But the verdict of the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>favor of <em>the </em>claimants was <em>fully </em>supported by evidence, and the law was fairly submitted to the jury by the Court, and upon a motion for a new trial the presiding Judge refused to grant the motion. And upon the settled adjudications of this Court, we will not interfere with his judgment in the premises. The ground of newly discovered evidence, overruled by the Court in refusing the motion for a new trial, presents nothing upon which this Court can interfere, as the evidence does not accompany the motion, and if we were to take it by the general presentation of its character, it would be cumulative merely, and not a good ground for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
