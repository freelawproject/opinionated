That this was not error in the Court. The provisions of the Constitution clothes the Superior Court with power to change the venue when the presiding Judge is satisfied an impartial jury cannot be obtained in the county, and while the Judge may, in his judgment, become satisfied of this fact by <em>aliunde </em>evidence, still we hold that that most satisfactory method of arriving at such conclusion, as well as that most within the contemplation of the provision of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>stitution, is to test the question by trying to get a jury in the county where the crime was committed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-5\">2. Where the witness for the State, admitted upon cross-examination, that he had given a different statement upon examination at the inquest, and stated his reason to be fear of the accused with whom at the time he lived as a servant, and that he had made a similar statement to that, then given, to the brother of the accused, and <em>aliunde </em>evidence was admitted to show his conduct and appearance upon the former trial as a part of the original evidence offered by the State :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-6\"><em>Held, </em>That this testimony, under the facts in this case, was properly admitted, and the theory of the defense upon cross-examination by them, let in the facts disclosed by the evidence in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-7\">3. When in an indictment for murder the evidence showed the accused to be a rejected suitor and the deceased an accepted suitor, rumors of the approaching marriage and of such engagement was brought home to the accused and was offered and admitted by the Court as a fact to show motive for the crime:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-8\"><em>Held, </em>That it was properly' admitted as a fact or circumstance in the case.

When in the argument before the jury, counsel for the State contended that confessions were the highest species of evidence, and the counsel for the defendant insisted it was not, under the rule laid down in the Code, and the Court refused to charge the jnry that it was not the highest evidence, but charged the jury in the very language of the Code on the subject of confessions :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-10\"><em>Held, </em>That this was no error \u2014 it was not the duty of the Judge to classify the evidence as to its weight or consideration, or intimate any opinion thereon.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-11\">5. When the evidence in the case was mostly, if not entirely as to its material parts, circumstantial, and the Judge charged the jury, as to their rights under the facts, if they found their verdict upon circumstantial evidence, reading from the Code :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-12\"><em>Held, </em>That this was not error, for the reason that the jury by such charge were only instructed as to their legal rights in the premises.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-13\">6. - Where, upon the trial, after some of the jury were in the box, but the whole not impanneled, and in the presence of the Court, those sworn were seen by counsel for accused reading a newspaper which contained an article reflecting upon the counsel for prisoner, etc., and no motion or notice was then taken in regard thereto :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-14\"><em>Held, </em>That this was not such irregularity upon the part of the jury as ' would be sufficient to set aside the verdict, and that such acts transpir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ing in the Court room and in the presence of the Court and of counsel, when not objected to, will not be favorably regarded after the verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b485-5\">7.

November Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-10\">Thomas M. Alexander, on the night of the 12th of July, 1870, was found in the road, in said county, dead. His death was caused by several buckshot projected from a gun, eight or ten steps off, into one wound, in the posterior part of the right shoulder. A coroner\u2019s inquest was had, and subsequently Jimpsey A. Hunter was indicted for murdering him. Before going to trial he made affidavit that, <em>\u201c </em>on account of the excitement and prejudice against him in the community he could not obtain a fair trial in the county of Brooks, and moved for a change of venue. The Court held that he ought not to change the venue unless, after trying to get a jury, it should appear that an impartial jury could not be had in Brooks county, and refused then to change the venue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-11\">A jury was impanneled after about two hundred persons had been put upon their <em>voir dire. </em>The Quitman Banner is a newspaper published in said county every Thursday afternoon. Three persons who subscribed for it, and another who was a son of another subscriber, got the paper of that week, and, on Friday morning, were summoned as <em>tales </em>men and sworn to try said case. While the balance of the jury was being made up these jurors had and were reading their said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>paper, and Hunter\u2019s counsel saw them doing so. The paper contained the following two allusions to said case :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">THE SUPERIOR COURT.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">\u201c The November Term of Brooks Superior Court commenced on last Monday morning \u2014 Judge J.

Hunter/ charged with murder, was called, the C\u00f3urt-room was soon filled by an apparently interested and anxious public. For it is a case -\"of great importance \u2014 the issue involved being life or death\u2014 and the circumstances surrounding the case being of such a character as to astound, and, in a measure, mystify hundreds who have only heard rumors of the circumstances attending the killing of Thomas M. Alexander.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">\u201c The prisoner having been brought before the Court, his counsel moved that, for certain specified reasons, the trial of the case be transferred to another county. The motion elicited considerable argument, and occupied the balance of the day. On the following morning, (Thursday) his Honor, Judge Alexander, after a review of the argument, decided to overrule the motion for a change of venue, until after an attempt had been made to secure a competent jury. At this writing the call of the special venire is progressing, and it is our opinion that an impartial jury can be procured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-9\">DEFAMATION OF THE CITIZENS OF BROOKS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">\u201cAs a general rule, the eccentricities of certain members of the legal profession are excusable; the display of their oratorical ability, although frequently damaging to their clients, is amusing; but when they override precedent, set at defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>anee established rules of courtesy, and in an effort to carry their point, cast off all restraint, and characterize an entire community as lawless, prejudiced and unjust, we must consider and protest against such a line of argument, as simply <em>infamous.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">\u201cIn an argument before the Superior Court on last Wednesday, on a motion to transfer the important case of the * State <em>vs. </em>Jimpsey A. Hunter,\u2019 to another county for trial, a zealous advocate from the county of Thomas, took occasion (and it is not the first time) to villify and outrageously slander the entire community of Brooks county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">\u201cHe charged that the entire body of county officials, from the Ordinary to constable, were inimical to the defendant, in the case; by implication, he charged that the large, intelligent, respectful and orderly assemblage of citizens then in the Court-room, was a mob, thirsting for the blood of the prisoner; that our entire people, from the devout preacher to the most humble laborer, was <em>prejudiced </em>against the State\u2019s prisoner; and that it was utterly impossible to irupannel a jury of twelve men who would render an honest verdict in the case under consideration \u2014 notwithstanding they would be <em>sworn </em>to render such verdict in accordance with the law and the testimony; that the <em>swelling tide of prejudice </em>would swerve them from the path of duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">\u201c Of course this is <em>only </em>the <em>honorable </em>gentleman\u2019s <em>opinion </em>of the character of our citizens, and, therefore, strictly speaking, is of <em>little </em>consequence; but even if true, our condition might be worse \u2014 a greater infliction than all alleged depravity, <em>might </em>be imposed upon us. We thank our God the <em>distinguished </em>lawyer is not a resident of the county !</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">\u201c We do not censure the gentleman for the exhibition of zeal in the defense of his client; it is right and proper \u2014 and we pray God he may be able to produce evidence abundance to free him of the serious charge preferred \u2014 but think such zeal should be bounded by a trifle of <em>discretion. </em>The intemperate charges preferred against our people, are, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>utterly false and slanderous, and we spurn them as the impotent ravings of one who has lost the vigor of youth, and now mistakes billingsgate for legal lore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\"><em>\u201c </em>In this connection, on behalf of the vilified citizens of the county, we tender thanks to Captain H. G. Turner, for his eloquent, vehement and masterly vindication of our character, as order-loving, law-abiding men, and peaceful, moral citizens. It was a grand spectacle to behold the cool, modest and eloquent young attorney, (who will, ere long, take position at the head of the bar of Georgia,) hurling back the anathemas and rebuking the aspersions and false conclusions of one whose age and experience should have, at least, counseled moderation and discretion, when assailing the manhood, justice and morality of an entire community of high-toned citizens.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">Counsel did not call attention to this matter till after the verdict, though they knew the contents of the paper. It was shown that Alexander had been at the house of Colonel Gaulden visiting his daughter till a late hour that night; that his horse had been hitched near Gaulden\u2019s gate and in sight of the public road; that his dead body was found in the road not far from a haw bush, about one o\u2019clock that night, had, in the wound, three buckshot; and that paper wadding, blood and tracks were found near this bush. The evidence to show that Hunter shot him was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">Henry Frazer, a negro, living with defendant at the time of killing, had been out serenading, and was of the party who found the dead body. He testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">\u201cWe went home, to defendant\u2019s; he was at home when we got there; the dogs barked as we came up to the house; defendant said : \u2018 Hello ! Serenaders !\u2019 We told him what a bad misfortune we had found. He said, <em>\u2018 </em>What was it ?\u2019 told him we had found Mr. Alexander dead. He said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">\u2018 Lord, what a pity!\u2019 and told two of us to go into the field and hunt the horses; I and Sampson Maxwell went; we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>were gone about one hour; did not get the horses; defendant, Ben. Henderson and Sampson Maxwell then went on down to Mr. Alexander\u2019s body ; I went to Colonel Jones\u2019, with Mitcliel Harvey, to let Colonel Jones know it; defendant did not send any one to Dr. Alexander\u2019s ; he made remarks about sending there, but did not send any one; next morning I noticed a mark on defendant\u2019s hand; it looked like it was scratched by the briars \u2014 the mark seemed to be fresh. Some two or three weeks before this defendant came to Quitman to get his gun fixed, and told me not to use it any more; it was a double-barrel gun. I never heard defendant say anything about Mr. Alexander more than other gentlemen, but heard him say, * if he and another young man was going to see a young lady, and the other young man was to cut him out unjustly, he would flog him ;\u2019 have heard him say, <em>\u2018 </em>he had no use for Mr. Alexander,\u2019 but did not hear him assign any reason for it. The body of the deceased was found in Brooks county; I came down to Quitman with defendant to sell oats; we stayed all night; he and Hardy Hunter came in the buggy together; went back home next day, in the evening; I went also the next day, in the evening; he was at his mother\u2019s when I got there; I went on home with the wagon ; I came after that back to Quitman with sheaf oats; Edmondson &amp; Peacock sold them; it was late in the evening before they got through it; I suppose I was about a mile from town when dark overtook me; when I got home defendant was absent; went in the house and lighted the lamp ; soon after I went out to the lot with my oxen, to take them out; I called to him; he did not answer; he came up after awhile \u2014 did not say where he was \u2014 .but said he could have laid his hand upon me; in going home,.I went by Abram Hunter\u2019s, Colonel Jones\u2019, Captain Gaulding\u2019s, and Mr. Morrow\u2019s ; do not remember seeing any horse at Captain Gaulding\u2019s gate that night; got home that night about 10 or 11 o\u2019clock ; it was oats made this year; deceased was killed after this, I think; defendant was standing in his. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>door when we got there, after we found Alexander\u2019s body. I left Ben Henderson, Mitch Harvey, Rose Maxwell, Sampson Maxwell, Delia Thomas or Thompson, at Mr. Hunter\u2019s when I started off on the serenade. Ben Henderson and Mitch Harvey came to me at Col. Jones\u2019, after supper; went serenading frequently before this ; went one Saturday night with Mr. Hunter to take a bee tree; went over to Mr. Jones\u2019, and failed taking it; loaded our cart with shucks; started back home ; as we passed Mr. Gaulding\u2019s, he insisted that I should go and look at a horse, and see whose it was ; went to see the horse, and told him it was Mr. Alexander\u2019s; he said nothing more, and we went on home; the horse was hitched to a tree in front of the house; can\u2019t say how long it was before the killing; it was this year, but can\u2019t say what month; though it was about the first or last of July when he .went to take the bee tree; can\u2019t remember the month Mr. Alexander was killed ; it was after the trip made with the oats; the bee tree trip was made before-the killing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\"><em>Cross-Examined. </em>\u2014 \u201cI was at Col. Jones\u2019 on the night Mr. Alexander is said to have been killed; I went over there for some tobacco; I went at my own accord; got the tobacco ; stayed there until about 11 o\u2019clock, then went to Adolphus Wright\u2019s, stayed there about one hour; then went to Matilda\u2019s, stayed there about half an hour; then went for home ; I played for Hardy Hunter that night, at Colonel Jones\u2019, until about 11 o\u2019clock; it was at Captain Gaulding\u2019s place I saw Matilda; got there, I think, about one o\u2019clock; Colonel Jones\u2019 is a mile or so from Captain Gaulding\u2019s; Colonel Jones\u2019, in a straight line, is about a mile or three-quarters, the near way, through the plantation, from defendant\u2019s ; the same distance from Hunter\u2019s to Captain Gaulding\u2019s, I think; I don\u2019t know how far from Captain Gaulding\u2019s to the Okapilco bridge, but I think three miles and a half; from Captain Gaulding\u2019s to the Peacock store is two hundred yards; thence to the corner fence sixty or seventy yards ; thence to the gin-house three-quarters of a mile; defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>lives about half way the lane \u2014 nearer to the old gin-house than the creek; Dr. Alexander lives beyond Mr. Lane\u2019s; I thinkit isfour and a half miles from defendant\u2019s to Dr. Alexander\u2019s ; we found the body between Capt. Gaulding\u2019s and the old bridge \u2014 nearest to the bridge \u2014 about half amile or three-quarters from Capt. Gaulding\u2019s \u2014 about half a mile from Morrow\u2019s; it was nearest to Mr. Morrow\u2019s; when the body was found I was excited, and I felt that home was the nighest to me, and said, \u2018 let us go home.\u2019 Defendant was standing at the door when we got to his house; the dogs barking at us; the door was open; it was bright moonlight; do not recollect swearing before, that he came out of the door; can\u2019t say what defendant\u2019s habit was about getting up when the dogs barked; don\u2019t recollect that defendant told us to go and give the news until after we went for the horses. I was so excited at the time that I can\u2019t state certainly, whether it was before or after we went for the horses that defendant said to carry the news; I think what I have said to-day is correct; I was so excited that I can\u2019t tell whether it was before or after we came from the field. I know that was what he wanted with the horses, but can\u2019t say the time exactly he said it. Have not taken anything to drink since we went to dinner; did not find the horses in the field : defendant told Mitch to go to Col. Jones\u2019; I went with him; I went nowhere else; there was no horse found to go anywhere else; Mr. Hunter was not in the habit of visiting his neighbors much at night; he went to Mr. Morrow\u2019s occasionally in the day time. Defendant and I were in conversation together about courting, and he, defendant, said, if any young man was to cut him out unjustly he would put him to punishment; can\u2019t say how the conversation got up; Sampson Maxwell was present; can\u2019t say who first got up the conversation; did not say who he was courting; did not mention anybody\u2019s name; can\u2019t say what I replied, if anything; did not hear Mr. Alexander\u2019s name mentioned at that time; at another time heard him say he had no use for Mr. Alexan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>der; I think this was said to Sampson; I heard the remark. I never went to defendant to borrow his bowie-knife \u2014 I carried it sometimes. I just carried it to carry it in the name of bowie-knives; I carried his gun sometimes; he never told me not to use it till after he had it mended. This was sometime before Alexander was killed \u2014 the first part of the year; he shot birds off his oats; I shot turkeys, squirrels, etc.; the gun was generally kept loaded; when I brought the gun home empty, or he wanted to use it next day, he would load it; I think there was a light in Capt. Gaulding\u2019s house the night I passed there, with defendant and Sampson Maxwell in the cart, and I went to see whose horse was tied there; do not remember anything was said about any one being sick, or doctor, etc.; can\u2019t say positively there was a light, but think there was; can\u2019t say how long before Mr. Alexander was killed; think it was a moonshining night.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYo\">Col. John Dunn testified as follows: \u201c On the morning after the homicide, information was brought to the family, and Dr. Alexander and myself went to the place as soon as we could get there; reached there a half or three-quarters of an hour by sun ; found several persons present \u2014 remember Capt. Gaulding was there. A few minutes afterwards looked down the road towards Clark\u2019s creek, and saw defendant coming up the road ; turned my face from him; set down in the corner of the fence; did not look at him for sometime; did not notice particularly what effect the presence of the dead body would have upon him; shortly after this some one suggested we walk up the road to the place where it was supposed the shooting was done; within two hundred or more yards we saw fragments of paper in the road; two or three parties, with myself, picked them up\u2014 as near all as we could \u2014 they were handed to me; defendant, near by, remarked that was not half; I made no reply; Capt. Gaulding said he would like to know what became of the rest; Mr. Hunter made no reply; very soon thereafter I returned to Dr. Alexander\u2019s home; just before I got to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Clark\u2019s creek, I noticed defendant on his horse, going in the direction of his home; he rode in a gallop most of the way from the creek to his home \u2014 at least faster than I drove; he got to his house a few minutes before I passed it; I turned over the fragments of paper picked up to the jury of inquest; Capt. Kingsberry handed me a package this morning; witness then opened it, and said the fragments of paper therein resembled those he picked up \u2014 they looked as though they were well suited for wadding; saw some foot prints rather on the north side of the tree, as if some one had been stamping around there; did not examine them minutely; witness here explained a diagram, pointing out the various places referred to; saw signs of blood near by there; going from Dr. Alexander\u2019s to Capt.

I went with the key and unlocked the door; he went in, lit his lamp, took up his gun, commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>wiping it out, and said to me: \u2018Sampson, how long is it to supper? I want to go and look round my hogs.\u2019 I asked what was his hurry ? He replied, he wanted to go and see if he couldn\u2019t catch old Monk; I said to him, the hogs are not fat enough for anybody to steal yet; he said, \u2018you don\u2019t know how them hogs have improved since I put them in the field ; go and hurry Rose with supper.\u2019 I then started out, and Ben. Henderson and Mitch Harvey was coming in the door; after supper I went into the lot, helped Rose milk the cows, came right back and lay down; I became restless and could not sleep ; I lay there, and after awhile I got up, pulled off my shirt, and thought I would sleep then; about midnight, as near as I can come to it, I heard a gun shot, and then two screams, and sounded (as witness imitated to jury.) I hunched Rose; she spoke and said, \u2018 Do you hear that gun?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes \u2014 that person hollows like he was hurt, and I hope none of the black folks have gone yonder and pestered Mr. Planter\u2019s hogs, and now he has shot them.\u2019 I got right up and went to the door, opened it and looked out, heard nothing then. I shut the door, walked right back to the bed, and just as I got to the bed, heard the horse come a running, and the dogs ran out, and I went out. I glimpsed the horse as he ran bjr, but never spoke to the dogs ; just as I went to speak the dogs hushed ; then I felt troubled, and turned right round by the little steps that were there, and sat down; by this time I heard a fiddle \u2014 heard one tune played while sitting there; sat there ten or fifteen minutes; the next thing I saw, was the defendant coming right through the field towards me, very fast, with his gun on his shoulder ; he came up to me, and about ten or fifteen steps from me he said, \u2018Who is that, Sampson ?\u2019 I got up and said to him, \u2018I thought you would have had beef \u2014 I heard you shoot!\u2019 he said, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t shoot!\u2019 I said, \u2018 Yes \u2014 why, didn\u2019t you shoot? I heard some one hollow, and they hollowed like they were hurt.\u2019 He then said to me : \u2018 Yes, I shot, but don\u2019t you say nothing about it; if you do your life will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in danger!\u2019 Then he said something else, which I cannot now recollect; he went into his house, and I went into mine; about an hour and a half afterwards, theserenaders came up : Ben. Henderson, Mitch Harvey and Henry Frazer ; I heard very loud talking at the house; by this time defendant commenced calling me: \u2018 Oh ! Sampson! Oh ! Sampson ! they say that Alexander is killed !\u2019 Then I got up and opened the door; he said : \u2018Come here, quick !\u2019 came to the door, and said, \u2018 Yes, I heard the horse running by/ He said, \u2018 Yes, I heard it too, but I thought it was some of Bill Bryant\u2019s fool,\u2019 and said, \u2018 go and get my horse; you must go and let the neighbors know.\u2019 I said to him, the horses are in the field. He said, \u2018 Go and get them ; take Henry along to help you.\u2019 I and Hemy went into the field and hunted an hour; came back and told him we couldn\u2019t find the horses ; he said, \u2018 well, let us take it afoot; Henry, you and Mitch go over and let Mr. Jones know ; and I, Ben. Henderson and witness will go up to where Mr. Alexander is killed.\u2019 He, I and Ben went on to about ten steps of deceased, and he said: Sampson, you and I\u2019ll stay right here; Ben, you go on and let Mr. Morrow and Gaulding know, and we will stay right here till the company gathers. After the company gathered, I, defendant .and Henry Frazer went back to the house to breakfast; in going back, just before we got to the house, he went ahead; after we went back, I saw Mr. Hunter, when we were carrying deceased up to Mr. Morrow\u2019s, going up the road toward Mr. Gauldings, and a short time afterwards \u2014 can\u2019t tell how long though\u2014 Rose came to Mr. Morrows, and said for me to go there, the cattle is on your cotton ; when I went there, defendant said to me : \u2018 Have they questioned you any ?\u2019 I told him yes. Defendant said : \u2018 What all have they said to you ?\u2019 I said, I have not said anything to hurt you ! Defendant said, \u2018No, don\u2019t you!\u2019 then said, \u2018I did love Charlie Gaulding \u2014 she and I were engaged to be married when we were going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>school, but old man Gaulding kept her out of my way \u2014 carried her off up the country.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\"><em>Cross-Examined. </em>\u2014 \u201c Was sworn on the inquest; what was read over I testified then; swore to tell the whole truth then, but I was afraid, because Mr. Hunter threatened my life for seeing what I did; he threatened it when he first came up to me in my yard; no one was present but he and I; swore on the inquest to a lie, because I was- afraid to tell the truth. Suppose I could have told a lie and said I knew nothing about it, as well as have sworn to one by telling what was said then ; the remark that defendant made that scared me was: c Yes, I did shoot; don\u2019t you say anything about it; if you do your life will be in danger.\u2019 I did not say anything about it before sworn; thought I would tell some of the truth ; don\u2019t know Captain Turner, that I know of \u2014 Oh, yes, Mr. Turner \u2014 know him; he wrote out a paper I swore to before Mr. Dukes a few days after the inquest \u2014 it was on Saturday; did not say the reason I made that affidavit I was afraid they would put me or my wife in prison ; was at Mr. Morrow\u2019s when that affidavit was written out for me ; Mr. Dukes was there when I swore to it; they sent for him ; Kingsbery was there; Jesse Hunter, Hardy Hunter and <em>W. </em>McCall, came there after the affidavit was made; Captain Gaulding and Dr. Alexander were not there; Smith was there. Mr. Kingsbery carried me there from my place. They told me they wanted the truth out of me; Kingsbery did not tell me what they wanted as we were going on; Henry Erazer was there, sitting on the door; I knew what I had told him; they told me they wanted the truth out of me \u2014 if I knew anything, they wanted me to tell them. I said I was a poor black man, had no protection, no friends, and if they would protect me I would tell them the truth, so far as I knew it; they said they would protect me; that I would live as long as God would let me; that I wouldn\u2019t die by people killing me; they did not say how long they would protect me. I then told them the truth, and they wrote out the affidavit; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>they then carried me to Mr. Alexander\u2019s, and then to Mr. Smith\u2019s; went in a wagon; Smith\u2019s is sixteen miles from Quitman ; it was Captain Gaulding\u2019s wagon;'Mr. Smith is in Florida, on Mr. May\u2019s place; they carried me there to work; Smith hired me to work on the farm after I got there; they said they would send me down there to stay \u2014 it would be a safe place; people could not get in there to interrupt me. I am scary of white folks; always have been ; aint afraid of a negro; never was; was scared and troubled when Kingsbery came after me; was more troubled than scared; was scared all the time; Kingsbery was the sheriff; when I got over to Morrow\u2019s I was scared, troubled and felt bad; did not talk with Jesse Hunter after the affidavit was made; don\u2019t recollect telling him that I wms afraid some of the black ones would be put in jail; talked with McCall and Mr. Hunter; felt, after I was told that they would protect me, that I was delivered;' defendant was in jail then; was not afraid of him then, but was afraid of his people; they could have found me down in Florida; they never threatened me; they treated me kindly. <em>I once told Jesse Hunter %ohat 1 saw and heard, and he said, keep that to yourself till the judgment day; this occurred the next day after defendant was brought down here. </em>Rose was present; Jesse Hunter was present, talking to Rose, trying to get her to say that Jimpsey was in the house; said that house there would save Jimpsey; Rose was scared also. A colored man named Jack came down to Florida to see me ; did not tell him I was afraid I would be put in a dungeon; did not tell him I was afraid any of the serenaders would be put in jail; told him I believed I was put there by the Lord, as a witness; didn\u2019t know what I was doing; was at Morrow\u2019s when the dead body was there; I put my hand on the bead and said: If I know anything about this more than I have said, I hope God Almighty may strike me dead! Mr. Gaulding told me to say this to see if He would; and said if I told a lie and did this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>God Almighty would kill me. I am a member of the Methodist church; Capt. Gaulding is a Baptist minister; he said this to me, but I did not believe it; I have seen many ministers who didn\u2019t tell the truth. Jimpsey Hunter put his hand on the dead body; saw defendant about one hundred and fifty yards before he came up to me, when I was on the steps ; this was the night of the shooting ; it was moonlight; I knew it was him by his walk; there was a fence between us. I watched him coming on towards me; there was no house between us; he did not come from right around my house; he came sorter quartering by my house. I did swear as was read to me, and meant that he came sorter quartering, as described by the witness. He did not have to come from round the house for me to see him. Jimpsey Hunter is a lame man. Think the gun was fired about midnight; the horse came quick after that; I jumped up, saw a glimpse of the horse; in an hour and a half the serenaders came; heard the fiddle after the gun was fired. Frazer used the gun when he wanted to; was in the habit of going in the house and getting it when he wanted to. When the serenaders came up to the house, there was loud talking; there was no one at the body when we got there; defendant was at home when the serenaders came; he was there an hour and a half before they came; they came in an hour and a half after the gun fired. Hunter got to the house in ten or fifteen minutes after the gun fired; I went to bed soon that night, and stayed there until the gun fired; then got up at once; the horse passed very quick after the gun fired ; never sent word by Rose to any one that if defendant got clear I would be killed; never sent any such word by Rose to anybody.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">Colonel William Jones: \u201cI was present part of the time when the neighbors collected around the body of the deceased; prisoner had some conversation with me near Morrow\u2019s house. Doctor Williams came up and said he would like to have some conversation with me; we stepped off to talk; as we commenced to converse defendant came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>up and said: {I would like to have a word with you;\u2019 I said, Doctor, hold on till I see what Jimpsey wants ; we went to one side a little, and he said to.me, \u2018I am accused of killing Tom Alexander, and don\u2019t want to stand a law-suit; I believe I\u2019ll leave; what do you think about it ? \u2019 I said, Jimpsey, you know whether you can prove yourself at home that night; he said he could ; said I, who by? He said by Sampson and Eose; I said, Jimpsey, if you can prove that, I don\u2019t see why you should be in any dread of a law-suit; said I, were you at home all that night? He remarked to me he had thought of going to the mill pond to go in washing, but recollected he had been taking sulphur and turned back; I said, if you want to leave, Jimpsey, I will give you all the assistance I can; I then said, you had better go see your mother and brother- Hardy, and advise with them, and not take my advice; he said, my horse is hitched over yonder; will you take him over to your place and I will walk; he then went to my place. This conversation occurred at 8 or 9 o\u2019clock in the morning; did not see him any more till 12 or 1 o\u2019clock; he was then in Morrow\u2019s house; at 2 or 3 o\u2019clock, in Morrow\u2019s house, he touched me and we walked off towards the water pail, and he said to me, \u2018 What do you think about it?\u2019 I said, I do not know what about it; I have been standing round here since you left, but have not yet been called in question about it; asked him if he had seen his mother and brother; he said he had; what did they tell you ? he said they told him to come back; if he left suspicion would rest upon him. We then went to the opposite side of the house, west from the water pail; he then asked me again what I thought about it; I said, I don\u2019t know, Jimpsey; as your mother and brother have advised you t\u2019o remain, perhaps it is best. He said, fI don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t want to be troubled in law; can\u2019t you go and see Sampson, and find out what he is going to swear to ?\u2019 I said, I don\u2019t know, Jimpsey; I don,t like to go out there and hold any conversation with Sampson; they might think I was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>meddling where I had no business ; he said, \u2018go and seeand find out what he is going to swear to; I\u2019ll stand about here, and if you can find out, come back and let me know.\u2019 I left him and looked about for Sampson; got my eye on him. Just then the jury of inquest was got together, and Sampson was called, and I had no further conversation with him. I live about a mile and three-quarters from the prisoner, through the fields, but the usual route is along the road by Capt. Gaulding\u2019s; that way is further. I was at home the night of the homicide; but did not see the defendant; directly I got in the house from the field, the supper bell rang ; I went in and my little boy came running in and asked his mother to let him go home with Jimpsey; she said no, at first; I asked then where Jimpsey was; he said, out at the gate; and then I directed him to be called in to supper; sent word back he did not have time; I said to my wife, let the little boy go on with him ; this was quite early \u2014 not dark good; the boy went; I have heard him say that he could have married Miss Charlie Ganlding, if it had not been for the Captain and his wife; on one occasion I said to defendant, Jimpsey, I think Charlie is gone \u2014 she is going to marry Tom Alexander; he sorter laughed, and said he thought it was doubtful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>Oross-Examined. </em>\u2014 \u201c I and Jimpsey went a fishing once, and in our conversation Charlie Gaulding\u2019s name was brought up, and I said to him to marry her if he could; he said the Captain and his wife were opposed to it, and that he had no place to take her; I said you can take her to my place; on another occasion he also said that the Captain and his wife were opposed to it, and talked as though he did not have much use for them; this was after the land disagreement. Do not know of defendant visiting them for a year; it was spring a year ago, he said he didn\u2019t have much use for Captain, etc.; can\u2019t say of my knowledge that he has visited there since. I was at the inquest; did not see Graham or Sampson sworn ; I did not hear anything said as to any particular per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>son they wanted to fasten it on ; they seemed to want to find out the man that did the deed ; in the afternoon conversation, the defendant, in reply to a question from me, said it was Captain Gaulding that charged him ; he remained there after I left and went home; have never had any conversation with Sampson. Defendant brought my little boy, four years old, next morning, to where the dead body was; I carried him up to Morrow\u2019s; he was carried home from there. I pretty generally kept my gun loaded, and have loaded it at night; have seen Henry Frazer going about with a double-barreled gun ; have seen him with defendant\u2019s gun a few times; he has applied to me for powder and shot; am familiar with defendant\u2019s place; know how the houses are situated.

She said, \u2018 it is Jimpsey cleaning out his gun.\u2019 She said he had some fat hogs in the field, and lie was going out to look round his hogs; supper was eat; Sampson and his wife went to the cow pen ; I washed up the dishes ; when she came back she fixed a place and told me to lie down ; did so; when the gun fired that woman got up in the bed and said, \u2018Lord, Sampson, I heard a gun fire!\u2019 He said, \u2018Which way ?\u2019 She said, \u2018 Up the road.\u2019 In a few minutes the horse came by, and tried to come to the house two or three times, but the dogs wouldn\u2019t let him come; Sampson got up then and went out, and never came in the house no more till after defendant come and was talking to him; when defendant came up, he said, \u2018Sampson, this you?\u2019 Sampson said, \u2018Yes, this is me.\u2019 He and Sampson stood and talked awhile, and I heard him say, \u2018Sampson, if you ever tell this I will kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>you.\u2019 This was about an hour and a half before the serenaders came in.

He replied he was just across the branch. Defendant said, \u2018 Boys, it wont do to let him lie there till daylight in the morning ; some of you go down there and stay with me till they gather the company.\u2019 He lighted a lamp; then he, Maxwell and Ben. Henderson went on down where he was; the defendant came back to the house the next morning when the sun -was about an hour high; he took Sampson out to the chicken house, and they talked a right smart while, and he then came in and ate his breakfast; then he took one of his little brothers behind him, and one in his lap, and they went on up to Mr. Morrow\u2019s; I did not see him any more till 10 or 11 o\u2019clock, when he came back home; when he came back he came through the field, from towards his mother\u2019s; he called Rose before he got to the house. I said, Rose, somebody is calling you ; and he said, \u2018 Rose, come here, quick !\u2019 Rose met him at the horse lot gate, just behind his house; I went to the door to look for Rose, and saw her ruuning up the road towards Mr. Morrow\u2019s; defendant came then to the cook house, and said to me, \u2018How nigh is dinner done, girl?

I had frequently heard it spoken of that Alexander and Miss Charlie were going to marry; Gaulding, myself and Hunter live on the Coffee road; Gaulding and Hunter on the south side; I on the north side; the land is all cleared on the north side \u2014 woods on the south side; two hundred and seventy-five steps from the haw bush to where the body was found; seven and a half feet from the haw to the middle of the road ; the haw bush is thorny, dense growth ; the limbs come out near the ground \u2014 it was very thick. I suppose a man might pass there in the day time, and not discover a man standing behind it; saw track behind it, as if some one had heen standing there; the night of the homicide was a very bright moonlight night. Alexander usually hitched his horse to a black jack, eight or ten feet from the gate when he went to Captain Gaulding\u2019s ; ten or twelve steps from the road that passes Gauldiug\u2019s, going from Colonel Jones\u2019, the ground is open.

Henderson came and told me Mr. Alexander was dead in the road between there and defendant\u2019s; I was much agitated ; sent out word to neighbors; went down with Morrow to the place; when we got there, Jimpsey Hunter said, \u2018Is that you, Colonel Gaulding ? there is a dead man there; as you have come, we will see now who it is;\u2019 that he had kept the tracks in the road, lit a match, went up and said, \u2018it is Tom poor fellow;\u2019 as if he had been in doubt who it was. Witness described the localities ; he and Hardy Hunter had some conversation. After Dr. Alexander- came, he and I examined and found blood between the body and haw tree; most blood near the tree; under the tree saw where the breech of a gun had made an impression; saw no tracks; the direction of the wadding would show that the gun was fired from behind the tree, and a little after the tree had been passed ; the wadding consisted of two kinds of paper \u2014 one was newspaper and the other looked like house-papering. At the time of the killing, don\u2019t think defendant\u2019s home was enclosed on the front; saw, a day or two afterwards, traces of blood on deceased\u2019s saddle. Mr. Alexander\u2019s visits to my home were acceptable to all the family; Mr. Hunter\u2019s were not and had not been for a long time; the rest of his family\u2019s visits were; defendant\u2019s were not, and never had been acceptable to my daughter. Sometime, I think in the spring of last year, wife and daughter Avere standing together, one of them beckoned to me; daughter said, \u2018 Father, Jimpsey is in the parlor and I am not going to see him.\u2019 I said, you are right, daughter, I will go and tell him.

Defendant has not been at my home on a visit (that I can say certainly to my family and daughter,) since the time I speak of. The affidavit presented is my daughter\u2019s; he had visited my home previously to addressing my daughter; but it was not acceptable to my daughter. I had told him at one time that I would not sell him some oats; did not feel unkind to him, but there were some things which made me think it was best not to have anything to do with him; have had no dealing with him, that I recollect, in a year or two ; never had much except to buy a horse from him. Sampson denied to me knowing anything about this case, especially as to Mr. Hunter ; I tried to lead him on; it was not my expression, that if he put his hands on the dead body, etc.; another man made that expression, but he may have understood it was me. I did not say the words that he said I did; if he made the expression to-day, that I said these words; he did put his hand on the head of deceased, and said he did not do it and didn\u2019t know who did; there was no danger then of anybody hurting him. I sought an interview with defendant, and asked him the ground of his objections to me; one of the grounds of his objections mentioned, was that I and my wife were the cause of his not being seen by my daughter. He also alluded to the oats matter, and I aeknowedged that I may have gone too far in that case; he also complained of my buying some land that he wanted; defendant was not a prisoner when Sampson was put to the test of putting his hands on the dead body.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">Simost Williams testified: \u201cI lived with Captain Gaulding when the killing took place; Mr. Alexander was there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that night, his horse was hitched to a little oak about ten steps from the gate, in front of the house; the road runs within twelve or thirteen steps of the gate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">Captain II.

I was at the inquest, conducted the examination; Sampson was sworn; what I got out of him I got out by questions. He was interrogated and I don\u2019t think he made any statement only in reply to my questions; some person may have asked him a question, but I do not recollect it now. After the inquest, on Saturday, myself and others met at Morrow\u2019s, to obtain all the evidence we could ; on the way to Morrow\u2019s we met Frazer; he went with us; there we met several colored persons; Sam Bryant, Gus McAfee, Morrow and his brother, and J. J. Hodges were present; we were seated on the steps; Sampson came up; did not see Captain Gaulding during the day. I said to Sampson, perhaps you are in fear, and if you will tell all you know about it, you shall be protected, if we can do it; some one else, perhaps Dunn or Smith, said the same thing; and while they said this I perceived a change in the witness. The conversation then ceased, and Sampson made his statement, just after saying, \u2018 I\u2019m a poof negro and my life is in your hands, and you must protect me;\u2019 that he had felt trouble about this thing; and after the statement made in the affidavit; but before it was reduced to writing, he also said: \u2018He believed God had put him there to see that thing.\u2019 [The above evidence of witness, as to the circumstances attending the taking of Sampson\u2019s affidavit, objected to by the defendant, and objection overruled.] Witness here explained a diagram showing the various localities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\"><em>Ch'oss-Examined. </em>\u2014 \u201c The description of the diagram made by Dunn and myself differ in the points of the compass; I examined Sampson at the inquest, and the paper shown is the examination; the affidavit shown is the one taken on Satur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>day.

Defendant\u2019s counsel said that was not true, and asked the Court to charge the contrary as hereafter appears. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested the Court to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">1st. The law presumes the defendant innocent when placed on trial, and requires that his guilt should be proven by competent and credible witnesses, before the jury can find him guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">2d. In civil cases the jury may weigh the evidence, and find according to its preponderance, but in a case of this character a greater strength of mental conviction is required and held necessary to justify a conviction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>3d. When the evidence is entirely circumstantial it should connect the defendant with the Criminal Act, 26 Georgia Reports, 633, head note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">4th. To convict upon circumstantial evidence the proof must be so clear as to exclude every other reasonable supposition but that of the guilt of the defendant; and if the jury can find any reasonable supposed case, consistent with the facts and yet consistent with the innocence of defendant, they are, under the law, to find him not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">5th. A witness may be impeached by proof of contradictory statements previously made by him as to matter relevant to his testimony and the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">6th. If the jury are satisfied from the evidence that any of the witnesses have sworn falsely in this case, then the credit of such'witnesses is impeached, and such witnesses are entitled to no credit, except so far as they may be corroborated by other satisfactory evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">7th. Under the present law of this State admissions or confessions <em>are not considered as the highest species of evidence, but the law is that they </em>should be scanned with care and received with great caution, and a confession alone, uncorroborated by other evidence, will not justify a conviction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">8th. It is the dnty of the jury to consider the evidence carefully, and to give credit only to such witnesses as they may think entitled to credit; and in judging of that credit, they may take into consideration the manner of the witnesses on the stand, the consistency or inconsistency of the witnesses\u2019 statements, and whether their evidence is contradicted either by statements of other witnesses under oath, or by their own statements, as to matters relevant to this cause heretofore made, whether under oath or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-10\">9th. It is with the jury, under the rules of law, to decide as to the amount of credit to be given to each witness, and if, upon full investigation of the law and evidence in this case, they have any reasonable doubts resting upon their minds as to the guilt of the defendant, they must acquit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In charging the jury, he left out of the seventh request the italicized words, giving the balance of it. He further charged the jury that if there was any conflict in the evidence it was their duty to reconcile the same if they could, and if not to give the credit to such of the witnesses as they might believe entitled thereto. He also charged them as to the penalty in cases where the conviction is founded solely ou circumstantial evidence, and read to them section 4257 of the Code, and instructed them to consider the question of recommending the punishment of confinement in the penitentiary for life, if they found defendant guilty. The other requests and such other instructions as were proper were given in charge to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">The defendant was found guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">His counsel moved for a new trial upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">1, 2, 3. Verdict contrary to law, evidence, etc. 4. The Court erred in not changing the venue. 5. In allowing the evidence of Maxwell, which was objected to as aforesaid. 6. In allowing evidence of rumors of reported marriage of Alexander and Miss Gaulden. 7. In allowing the evidence of Turner objected to as aforesaid. 8. In leaving out the italicized words in the 7th request of charge. 9. In charging, as he did, as to reconciling conflicting evidence, etc. 10. In charging, as he did, as to recommending commuting of \u25a0punishment, the jury being thereby made to believe that the Judge could, in his discretion, so commute the punishment. 11. Because of the said four jurymen having read said articles in the Quitman Banner while they were setting as jurors. 12. Because W. H. Harrell, one of the jury, was not impartial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">This juror, Harrell, had not only shown himself competent by his answer to the statutory questions propounded on his <em>voir dire, </em>but he had been <em>tried </em>by the judge and pronounced competent. To attack Harrell, defendant\u2019s counsel presented the following affidavit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Mary E. Rainey affirmed, on the 2d of December, 1870, that on Sunday in July, preceeding the Court, she heard Harrell say, \u201c from what he knew, the prisoner ought to be hung, and in substance, the prisoner was guilty of murder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">B. M. Collins and W. M. Collins each affirmed that about the 5th of October last, he heard Harrell say, \u201cthe prisoner should be hung.\u201d Timothy Carroll affirmed that said Dunn asked him not to allow prisoner\u2019s counsel to get <em>W. </em>M. Collins\u2019 affidavit as to said Harrell\u2019s statements. J. B. Pucket affirmed that he heard Plarrell say, soon after the difficulty between defendant and one Robinson, that \u201cthey should take said Hunter up and hang him.\u201d Affidavit of one McCall, that B. <em>W. </em>Collins reviewed his affidavit sometime after it was made, and said it was correct. Affidavit of prisoner and his counsel, that they did not know these things before the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">In reply the State\u2019s counsel produced the following evidence: .Affidavit of Harrell, that when on his <em>voir dire </em>lie stated that \u201c he had heard a good deal said about the case; that when he heard these reports he supposed he made up an opinion; that sometimes he heard reports adverse to the prisoner and would have an unfavorable opinion to the prisoner; sometimes he heard favorable reports in regard to the prisoner, his opinion would be favorable to him ; that at the time of the trial he had no opinion, one way or the other, in regard to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, and he would require strong evidence to hang a man.\u201d He further affirmed that he was impartial, and had decided on the evidence without reference to reports or former opinions, hoping defendant would vindicate himself at the trial. Further, he and prisoner had been friends from boyhood, and he gave the verdict reluctantly and only because he felt the evidence compelled him to do so; that Martin Collins, since making his affidavit, had told him that what he intended to say was that Harrell said, \u201c <em>if </em>what As <em>heard was true, </em>defendant should be hung,\u201d and that he supposed it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>so, not being able to read or write; that he had seen the other Collins, a boy ten or twelve years old, and desired to question him about said affidavit, but was prevented from seeing him by his two uncles, one of whom said the boy \u25a0would tell anything, and the other of whom said he should tell nothing but what his father had told; that he did not see Mrs. Rainey at the time specified by her, and never said what she attributed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">Two jurymen swore Harrell was the last to agree to the verdict. Another said he was last or next to last. One Stotemaker and one Stansel, each testified that the elder Collins told him that what he heard Harrell say was qualified as stated by Harrell\u2019s affidavit, <em>ante; \u201c </em>if,\u201d etc., and that if he had said otherwise he would go and correct it, that he did go next day, but said McCall had the affidavit and was out of the way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">Mrs. Rainey, by another affidavit, said that all she heard Harrell say was, if reports were true and Hunter was guilty, he ought to be hung. Dunn affirmed denying the assertion as to him, made by Timothy Collins, and stated the same substantially as did Harrell as to the uncles keeping them from conferring with the boy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">The Court refused a new trial and sentenced defendant to be hung.

This was an indictment from Brooks Superior Court. Preliminary to the trial a motion was made to change the venue, which was overruled by the Court, and this is the first ground of error assigned. This motion was predicated upon the affidavit of the defendant, in which he alleges that upon the ground of excitement and prejudice, he could not obtain a fair trial in the county of Brooks. The Constitution of 1868, Code, section 5102, declares that criminal cases shall be tried in the county where the crime was committed, except cases in the Superior Courts where the presiding Judge is satisfied that an impartial jury cannot be obtained in such county. The law is silent as to the mode of ascertaining, by the presiding Judge, the fact upon which this judicial discretion is to be exercised. <em>The presiding Judge must he satisfied, </em>and inasmuch as this question has been the subject matter of grave forensic ' disputation, we feel invoked to express our opinion. We premise by saying, that we do not think the affidavit of the defendant as to the existence of excitement and prejudice against him ought to be sufficient to invoke a change of venue. It is but natural that a community of peaceful citizens, attached to law and the good order of society, would feel the shock produced by a great crime, and exhibit towards the criminal some of that natural and healthy dislike, which he would more aptly term excitement and prejudice. It is only in such cases where such a community have given utterance to their feelings by prejudging the case, and an upheaval of popular indignation has shaken the sober convictions of the people, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>so as to include within its influence those who are otherwise qualified as jurors, and exclude the idea of a fair and impartial trial, that the Court would be properly informed, so as to be justified in changing the venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Such an exercise of power was not, in our opinion, delegated by the Constitution as comprehends its capricious exercise, but only in cases where the facts are developed by the strongest proof. And while we do not lay it down as a legal rule that the Judge should first try to obtain a jury by the ordinary process of the Court, before changing the venue, still we are clear in the opinion that, perhaps, this is the most satisfactory test, and the one most in consonance with the provisions of the legal interpretation of the Constitution. And in the case at bar, we concur with our Brother Alexander in the mode and manner in which he exercised this judicial duty, and affirm his judgment upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">2 and 3. The second ground which we will review, is in relation to the admission of the sayings of Sampson Maxwell, one of the witnesses for the State. It appeared, on the examination of this witness, that at the time of the homicide, he was one of the servants of the accused, and on the trial before the inquest, had given in evidence statements contradictory of that which he was then giving. Upon cross-examination as to this fact, in which he admitted this contradiction and inconsistency, he gave as a reason that he was afraid of the defendant, who, on the night of the homicide, had told him he would be in danger if he ever said anything about his shooting the' gun; and also what he had stated to Jesse Hunter, brother of the accused, and his reply, to <em>\u201c </em>keep that to yourself till the judgment dayalso, in admitting the testimony of Turner, as to the conduct and appearance of Sampson Maxwell on the previous examination, and also allowing evidence as to rumors in the neighborhood relative to the marriage of Miss Gaulding and deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">It was urged by counsel for the accused, that the above evidence ought to have been rejected, upon the ground, first, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>it was hearsay, and that it was illegal to admit evidence to sustain a State\u2019s witness, and that before he was impeached by the witness of the defense the rumors were not admissible under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We propose briefly to glance at the character of this evidence and the conduct of the parties, before reviewing the question of the admissibility of this evidence :</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">It.appears that the accused was a rejected suitor of Miss Gaulding, and that Alexander, the deceased, was an accepted suitor. On the night of the homicide the prisoner passed by Captain Gaulding\u2019sgate, in returning from Colonel Jones\u2019 to his own house, and there saw the horse of Alexander, hitched or standing. Immediately on his return home, he cleaned out and loaded his gun with buckshot, hurrying supper, and went out with the gun. At a point between his own house and Captain Gauldiug\u2019s, some half way, a gun was fired, and soon thereafter the horse of Alexander galloped by the gate of Hunter. In a short time Hunter returned through the fields to his own house, with his gun, and met Sampson Maxwell in the yard and a conversation took place, about which he testified. A company of serenaders returning from Captain Gaulding\u2019s found the dead body of Alexander on the road. They came on to prisoner\u2019s house, finding him up and they told him that they had found Mr. Alexander dead. The prisoner went to where Alexander was lying, having a lamp, but sat down with some others and waited the arrival of Captain Gaulding, apparently as if he did not know who it was. Before any accusation was made against him, he consulted with Colonel Jones about making his escape, and sent a party to Maxwell to see what he would swear. The day before the homicide he had a conversation relative to the marriage of Miss Gaulding and Alexander, and there was also evidence of some bad feeling existing between Hunter and Alexander, on account of the marriage, and evidence of some private conversations between himself and Maxwell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Upon his trial for this homicide, the testimony of Maxwell in the manner stated was drawn out.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We think there was no error in the Court, under the facts, in admitting the evidence. The attempt of the defendant, by cross-examination, was to impeach the witness in showing his contradictory statements, and he was entitled to give a reason for these contradictory statements elicited by cross-examination, by showing that he was in fear at the time that he uttered them. And the evidence of Captain Turner was properly admitted to show any facts or appearances upon that examination which went to show the witness was laboring under fear. And it was equally his right to show similar statements made by him previous to his relation to the prosecution, which would go to show the truth of his testimony: Greenleaf on Evidence, 1 volume, 469. And the fact that there was a rumor of the approaching marriage of the deceased to Miss Gaulding, was properly admitted as a circumstance in the case, for the purpose of showing motive upon the part of the accused, especially as the rumor was brought directly home to him, and conversations growing out of this, exhibited on his part towards Alexander an unfriendly feeling. It was immaterial, in fact, whether the marriage was approaching or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We do not deem it necessary to multiply authority upon these propositions. They stand out under the rules of law, commonly recognized and supported by the opinion of publicists and the adjudication of Courts; and looking to the facts of the case, were material to the elucidation of the truth. The various springs by which human motives are supplied, are frequently difficult to trace, but perhaps none are more difficult than those having their fountain head in envies and jealousies which agitate the human heart. The unfortunate prisoner, from this record, seemed to mark with more than ordinary prejudice, the man to whom he may have attributed his defeat, in the accomplishment of what he regarded the object of his domestic happiness. He evidently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>cherished toward him, from the proof in this case, an animosity kindled out of the embers of his own disappointment, and by utterances of vindictive feelings, which he could not suppress, warmed into life the suspicion against himself before it found existence elsewhere. Its picture became so vivid on his immagination as to induce him to seek the advice of Colonel Jones about flying from it before it had been felt or expressed by others. In the administration of the criminal law, any fact shedding light upon the motives of the transaction will not be excluded from the consideration of the jury, whether it goes to the attestation of innocence, or points to the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Again, complaint is made that in as much as no evidence was introduced by the defense, this evidence was improperly admitted to sustain the witness for the prosecution. It is not necessary to await the admission of evidence of the witnesses for the defense, to support the witness for the State, by the admission of material evidence supporting them, as to the truth of their testimony, and this is especially true from the fact that the defense may introduce no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">4. During the argument counsel insisted upon the authority in 17 Georgia, that confessions were the highest species of evidence, while the counsel for the defense, under the authority of the Code, section 3739, insisted they were not. The Court was requested by defendant\u2019s counsel to charge that confessions were the highest evidence, which he declined, and charged the jury in the language of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We see no error in the charge made by the Judge, under the laws of this State. He charged the jury what the law was, and it was not his duty to have intimated to them its effect or to have graded its influence upon their verdict by any classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">It is alleged as error that the Judge charged the jury under the general rule to reconcile the testimony, and the ground of complaint is, that this rule does not apply to cases where the evidence is only introduced by the State. We hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>rule is equally applicable, whether there be evidence by the defense or not. The rule in relation to evidence is without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">5. Another ground of error complained of is, that the Court charged the jury in this case in relation to circumstantial evidence. In the view we take of the case under the facts proven, the charge of the Judge below on this subject was not only correct, but proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">6. In relation to a portion of the jury before the completion of the pannel reading the <em>\u201c </em>Quitman Banner,\u201d it appears that this newspaper contained no portion of the testimony, either for or against the prisoner, but contained a diatribe against one of the counsel of the accused for a speech made on the motion to change the venue. It is difficult to draw any line sufficiently well marked to constitute a rule upon this subject, and we can readily appreciate the propriety of keeping the jury, from the moment they are sworn in chief, away from all influences and communications which might, in the most remote degree, influence their verdict; but we are not prepared to say that the reading of a mere newspaper under the circumstances, being known to the counsel of the accused, not excepted to by him, then and there, and transpiring in open Court, would constitute a ground of error sufficient to set aside a verdict. On the contrary, we hold that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">7. Another ground of complaint is in relation to the competency of the juror*, Harrell. We have examined the evidence by affidavits, inculpatory and exculpatory, and are clearly of the opinion that he was a qualified juror, and sustain the ruling of our brother below, whose pertinent and able opinion embraced in this record entitles it to great weight with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">8. In view of the whole case we are satisfied that the verdict of the jury is sustained by the evidence, and therefore affirm the judgment refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
