They had no copy of the proposed contract, but stated what they supposed were its terms, and attacked it as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">\u201c Said lease was made by the President of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company in collusion and conspiracy with the officers of the said Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company, and in fraud of the rights of complainants; that it was arranged clandestinely with said officers and consummated in hot haste; it was entered into without consultation with complainants, who own a large portion of the stock of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, and two of whom are directors therein, and hurriedly assented to by a meeting of the board of direction, which was not legally called or legally constituted, in that several directors were not notified of said meeting, as required by the by-laws of said Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, either verbally or in writing, and especial care and active measures on the part of the President of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, were taken to keep those directors, who were not notified of said meeting, as hereinbefore stated, ignorant of the call for said meeting and of its object. At said meeting, after said contract was agreed upon, a resolution was proposed by one of the directors of said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company, to submit said contract of lease to the stockholders of said company for their ratification or rejection, to which resolution the other directors present at length gave an unwilling consent. The pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ident of said company, in disregard of said resolution, is about to deliver said Maeon &amp; Western Railroad, and all of its property, to the said Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company, without awaiting the action of said stockholders under said resolution, and this will be done unless said company is restrained by an immediate order of this Court. Said contract of lease is illegal\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><em>\u201c </em>1st. Because it was entered into by a portion of the directors of said Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, at a meeting of which no proper or legal notice was given \u2014 the by-laws of said company requiring that a written notice of the hour of the meetings of the board of direction shall be given to each director, and the fact being that no notice of said meeting of any kind was given to at least four of the directors of said company; at which said meeting so clandestinely and illegally called, the President of the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company produced said contract of lease, an instrument long, elaborate and important, already prepared, and the same was hurriedly adopted, the said president urging its immediate adoption, strenuously opposing any postponement of action or consultation with the stockholders, as well as all amendments proposed in the interest of the stockholders of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\"><em>\u201c </em>2d. Because at said meeting a proposition to submit the question of the lease of the road and its property to the stockholders before any action should be taken, which was submitted by one of the directors present, was summarily voted down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\"><em>\u201c </em>3d. Because said lease was made without authority of law on the part of either of the parties to the same. It purports to have been made in pursuance of an Act of the Legislature, approved January 22d, 1852, and of the charter of the said Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company: but said Act does not authorize the sale, but simply the lease of connecting roads, and the said agreement, if permitted to be consummated, will amount to an absolute sale of the entire prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>erty, rights, privilegs, immunities and franchises of the said Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, and such an absolute sale is not within the purview and spirit of said Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">\u201c Such construction of said Act directly contravenes and defeats the policy of the State, as exhibited in its legislation for a long series of years in reference to railroads and other corporations. The true intent and meaning of the said Act is to authorize the Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company to lease the road-bed and fixtures of connecting roads, and to run their own locomotives and cars thereon, and this is apparent from the third section of said Act. Said Act was passed at the instance of the said Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company, and they deny the constitutional power of the Legislature to authorize the Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company to lease connecting roads through the action of the directors of such connecting roads without the assent of their stockholders, in such an'Act, even with the assent of a majority of their stockholders against the wish of a minority of said stockholders. There is not anything in the charter of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company, or in that of the company of 'which it is the successor, to authorize said Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company to enter into said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">\u201c4th. Because said contract is such an one as cannot be made by the directors of a railroad corporation without the consent of its stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">\u201c Because it is a contract which cannot be made against the dissent of a single stockholder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">\u201c 6th. Because it is a contract which is <em>ultra vires </em>and in contravention of public policy, and cannot be entered into even with the assent of every stockholder of each of the contracting roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">\u201c Said contract is a fraud upon their rights, and if allowed to be consummated according to the obvious intention and design of the parties thereto, will work great and irreparable injury and damage to them. Even if the directors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Macon &amp; Western Eailroad Company have the authority to enter into any contract of lease of said road, still they, stockholders as aforesaid, insist that said contract was a fraud upon them and other stockholders in said company. Had the property embraced in said lease been advertised for sale or lease publicly, or offered for sale or lease privately, under circumstances which would have insured competition in bids, a much larger price would have beeu obtained. Other railroad corporations competing with the said Central Eailroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company for freight and travel from Macon to the Atlantic, are deeply interested in the management and control of the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Eailroad Company, and they would have become bidders for the purchase or lease of said railroad, if an opportunity had been offered them. They, in fact, say that the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Brunswick Eailroad Company, owning a road which is one of the natural connections of the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Eailroad, accidently hearing of said meeting and its object, hurriedly prepared and submitted to the said meeting a proposition for the lease of said road, upon terms which were admitted to be more favorable than those then under consideration, offered by the Central Eailroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company, which was laid aside without being submitted to a vote, a copy of which proposition is stated <em>ante. </em>By this private, clandestine and predetermined arrangement between the officers of the Central Eailroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company and a portion of the directors of the Macon &amp; Western Eailroad Company, made without their knowledge or consent, their large interest in the Macon &amp; Western Eailroad Company has been sacrificed for a consideration wholly inadequate to its great value at this time with such great and rival competition for its control, and wholly inadequate to its intrinsic value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\"><em>\u201c </em>Said contract, if consummated, does not give them even the advantage of a permanent investment or certain income, inasmuch as the said Central Eailroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company, in it, reserve to themselves the power to terminate it at will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>and inasmuch as the dividends which the said company is to pay, are dependent upon the net earnings of this speculative company, burthened and complicated with leases and indorsements and guarantees almost innumerable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">\u201c The said contract is in fraud of their legal rights, made by their agents without their authority and consent, made in the interest of their agents and, not in their interests ; made without authority of law, and in perversion and distortion of the plain and obvious import of the statute, and made in the face of an admitted better proposition from the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Brunswick Railroad Company, which offered to lease said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad and pay to its stockholders a certain dividend of tvtelve per cent, <em>per annum </em>upon their stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">\u201cThe Mayor and Council of the city of Macon, represent that the said contract of lease, if consummated and executed, will cause irreparable damage and loss to the real estate and to all the interests of the said city, and that it will be unparalleled in injustice, ingratitude and unprovoked wrong to the said city. They show that the said city was an original corporator in the Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company of Georgia, and made a subscription to the stock of said company which resulted in a loss to her of more than half a million dollars, and that but for the active efforts of the said city and of her citizens, the said Central Railroad would probably never have been built, and the said Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company would never have had a legal existence. They further show unto your Honor, that the said city of Macon contributed a large sum of money to the building of the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad, and took stock in said road, then known as the road of the Monroe Railroad &amp; Banking Company, and that said subscription also resulted in the loss of a large sum of money to said city. Said city of Macon subsequently, and in pursuance of her policy, to aid all roads terminating within her limits, permitted the said Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company, and the Southwestern Railroad Company, by crossing the Ocmulgee river and extending their lines, to connect the same within its limits, with the covenant on the part of said railroad corporations, that they would pay to the city in perpetuity an annuity of five thousand dollars, and would never discriminate against the said city or the citizens thereof, in the regulation of their tariffs of freight in favor of the then <em>termini </em>of the said Macon &amp; Western and the said Southwestern Railroads, as will fully appear by reference to a copy of the contract between the said city and the said railroad corporations, entered into on the 24th day of January, 1851, attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\">\u201cThe Mayor and Council of said city, insist that the true spirit and intent of said contract and equitable construction to be given to the same, is that the said corporations thus connecting by the liberalty of said city, should never discriminate against her or her citizens, no matter how far their lines should be built or what might be their future <em>termini; </em>but such discrimination has already and for a series of years been made, and is now being made, and the intention and object of the said lease between the said Central Railroad &amp; Banking and the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Companies is still further to discriminate against Macon and her citizens, to rob her of all the advantages of her position as one of the <em>termini </em>of the said Central Railroad and said Macon &amp; Western Railroad, to make her a mere way-station upon this connected line, to divert cotton and other produce from her market, to destroy all competition at Macon in transportation to the sea, and thus most seriously to injure said city and her citizens, in violation of the spirit of said contract of 1851, and in pursuance of a policy of monopoly and consolidation which is opposed to the spirit of all the legislation of the State in reference to corporations. The Mayor and Council distinctly charge that the object of said lease is as they have stated it, and that the result of said arrangement, if it is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>mitted to be consummated, will cripple the commerce and depreciate the value of all property in said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">\u201c The Mayor and City Council represent that by said contract with said city of Macon, the said three railroad companies were jointly and severally liable for the payment of said annuity; that said Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company has already absorbed the Southwestern Railroad Company, and if said contract of lease of the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company is consummated, they will only have the Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company as security for the payment of said annuity, and they charge that in this the security of the city will be greatly jeopardized, by reason of the fact that said Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company is engaged in so many speculative enterprises to build and control other railroads, both within and without the State of Georgia, that its individual security is much less than that afforded by all three roads acting independently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">\u201cFurther, said city, in pursuance of its policy to aid railroads terminating within its limits, has burthened itself with debt by subscriptions heretofore made to the Macon &amp; Augusta Railroad and the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Brunswick Railroad, both of which are lines of railway competing with the said Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company in the business of transportation. They further show that its said subscriptions were made in view of the fact that the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Augusta and Macon &amp; Brunswick Railroads were competing lines with the Central Railroad, and with the assurance that a fair and open compedon with said last mentioned road would always be open to them; but they show that such open, fairand legitimate competition is not permitted between said roads, and that the said city and her citizens have lost all the advantages of such competition. The Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company has swallowed the Southwestern Railroad Company and left no trace of it, as a distinct organization, except a few favored officials in the enjoyment of handsome salaries, free tickets and an abundant supply of stationery; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>it is now proposing in the same way and with the same incidents, to swallow the Macon &amp; Western Railroad Company; it has secured by these consolidations, and by indorsements and guaranties to other roads, connections with, and control of long lines of railway stretching westward and northwestward, which have made it a huge monopoly and enabled it to shut out the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Augusta Railway, and the Macon &amp; Brunswick Railway from all connection with all railroads west of the city of Macon, and restricted them to a local business. This policy, which is in flagrant violation of the policy of the State, has restricted and curtailed and crippled the business of the said city and rendered its investments in the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Augusta and Macon &amp; Brunswick Railroads, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, not only unproductive, but almost worthless upon the market. Successive administrations of 'the government of said city have suffered the aggressions of the said Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company upon its rights, and those of its citizens, for a series of years without an appeal to the Courts, but they ask intervention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-4\">\u201c Said contract of lease was effected by the influence of the Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company in the management of the Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company through the large interest which it owns, without authority of law, in the stock of the said Macon <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">They are interested, to the extent of millions of dollars, in the stock and bonds of the Macon &amp; Brunswick and Macon <em>&amp; </em>Augusta Railroad Companies; they made these investments upon the faith that the State of Georgia would not permit any one railroad corporation to monopolize the business of transportation to the serious injury of other competing railroads, and with the knowledge on the part of those of complainants who are owners of the bonds of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, said bonds were indorsed by the State of Georgia to the extent of more than two millions of dollars, and the indorsement of the bonds of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Company was but a part of a general policy of aid to railroads, recently adopted by the State, and with the conviction that it would never permit other rival railroad corporations to defeat or interfere with said policy, or to lessen its security for such use of its credit, by injuring and crippling the business of the railroads which have received its aid, through any combinations not authorized by the strict letter of the law.

The usual notice was given in this case, and precisely as is usual, and perhaps with more than ordinary care and emphasis. Perhaps three of the directors living in the city of New York did not receive notice from the president of the company, but these non-residents have never attended a meeting of the board, and are never expected to attend, and are, in fact, only nominal directors.

Emmel, signing himself Secretary and Treasurer of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, did send a proposition during the sitting of the board on the 25th of May, a copy of which proposition defendant believes is correctly set forth <em>ante. </em>This defendant was shown no authority in said Enamel to bind the president and directors of said company, and no authority in said president and directors to bind the said corporation, and no law vesting authority in said corporation to lease the road of defendant, or any other connecting road. But even if such authority existed, this defendant would be unwilling to make a lease to said Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company on any other terms, because said company, by its own official reports, is shown to be of very doubtful splvency, and has not been able to pay its expenses and the interest on its debt, and exhibits no income, whatever, out of which to pay a dividend of twelve per cent., or any other per cent., for the lease of the road and property of this company. Said Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company is already under bonded debts and obligations which, in the opinion of this defendant, it will never be able to discharge; and there is no consideration of law, equity, wisdom or policy, which could induce this defendant to link its fortune with any corporation in the financial condition of said Macon and Brunswick Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">\u201cDefendant admits that complainants \u2018own a much larger interest as stockholders and bondholders of said Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, than they own in the corporation of this defendant.\u2019 And this deponent has reason to believe, and does believe, that complainants purchased the stock of this company solely with the intent of enabling them, if possible, to use this defendant\u2019s property to sustain and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>serve the value of their interest in said Macon and Brunswick Railroad, and without any reference to the interest of this defendant, or of the other stockholders in the road of this company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Defendant denies that any damage, whatever, irreparable or otherwise, will be done to complainants as stockholders in the Macon and Western Railroad Company, by said lease. On the contrary, they will, as such stockholders, be greatly benefited by said lease. The market value of the stock of the said the Central Railroad and Banking Company was, at the date of said lease, and for a long time before, had been greater than the market value of the stock of this defendant, and the income of said the Central Railroad and Banking Company very largely exceeds its expenditures, and renders it amply able to pay remunerative dividends, and to preserve and increase the value of the property of this defendant during the entire term of said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">\u201c This defendant knows of no other corporation connecting with the road of this defendant having either the authority in law to make said lease, or the financial ability to discharge its obligations as lessee; and, therefore, this defendant admits that no other corporation was applied to make said lease, and no competing bid was sought or expected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-7\">\u201cIf any injury results to complainants from said lease, it can result to them only as stockholders and bondholders of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, and it will result to them in that character chiefly, if not entirely, by defeating their long cherished scheme of controlling and using, by lease, purchase, or otherwise, the road and property of this defendant, to give a strength and value to their stock in the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company; and defendants believe and charge, that complainants have exhibited their bill, and seek to embarrass and enjoin the lease actually and legally, solely in their interest, as stockholders and bondholders in the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company. The well known acts and purposes of complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ants, looking to the final control of the Macon and Western Eailroad in the interest of the Macon and Brunswick Eailroad, solely with the intent of advancing the interests of complainants in the latter road, and with the result of certain and material damage to all the remaining stockholders of the Macon and Western Eailroad Company, did have the effect of depreciating the stock of this company in the market, at least ten per cent.; and to avoid further depreciation, and protect themselves from constant apprehension on this subject, formed one of the important reasons influencing the remaining stockholders to seek and desire the connection established by the lease with the said the Central Eailroad and Banking Company. It was the natural preference for a safe and altogether responsible corporation over one that was deemed unsafe and irresponsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\"><em>\u201c </em>The president of this company did confer freely and frankly with the stockholders of the company touching the proposed lease, before it was consummated. He did visit Charleston and other places, for he desired to act in accordance with the will of the stockholders on this subject. He did find them anxious and urgent for the lease. He did not, probably, confer with complainants, for the reason that they were known to be controlled by their predominant interest in another corporation, and did not favor a lease because of its supposed effect upon those other interests.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">On the 20th of June, when this cause came on for hearing, Judge Cole was absent by reason of sickness, and Judge Alexander, of the Southern Circuit, presided. Before the hearing, the Governor, by counsel, prayed to have the State made a party complainant, upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">1st. The proposed lease is unauthorized by any law of said State, or by the charter of the said Central Eailroad and Banking Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-7\">2d.

Said lease, if consummated, will not only greatly injure the said Macon and Augusta Railroad, and defeat the object the State had in view in authorizing the construction thereof, but it will render valueless the said Macon and Brunswick Railroad, whose bonds to the amount of more than two and a half millions of dollars, have been indorsed by said State, and are now held by persons who have purchased the same <em>bona fide </em>and for value, and to whom said State is liable for the payment thereof; and will render the said Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, by diverting freights and travel and business therefrom, wholly unable to pay said bonds, or the interest accruing thereon, and thus involve said State in the loss of the amount aforesaid with the accruing interest thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-6\">4th. The State is a stockholder in the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company, also a rival line of the road of the Central Railroad and Banking Company, and of which the Macon and Brunswick Railroad is a connecting road and a feeder; said lease, if consummated, will, as already alleged, divert freight and travel from the said Macon and Brunswick Railroad, and so impair its business as to render it valueless, a large amount of freight and travel which now passes over the said Macon and Western Railroad, and said Macon and Brunswick Railroad, and thence along and over the said Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, will be wholly diverted therefrom, and entirely lost to the last named road, to the great injury of said State as a stockholder therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>5th.

This is a bill filed in behalf of a portion of the stockholders of the Macon and Western Eailroad Company, and in behalf of the Mayor and Council of the city of Macon, who sue in behalf of said city and of the citizens thereof, and as stockholders of the Macon and Augusta Eailroad Company, and of the Macon and Brunswick Eailroad Company, against the Macon and Western Eailroad Company, and the Central Eailroad and Banking Company, praying for an injunction to restrain the consummation and execution of a contract for the lease of the Macon and Western Eailroad to the Central Eailroad and Banking Company. On motion, the State was made a party complainant to the bill. A rule to show cause why the injunction should not be granted, was served on the defendants, who appeared and filed their answers to the allegations in complainants\u2019 bill, and objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>State being made a party, and that the city of Macon was not a proper party complainant; which objections were overruled. On hearing the motion for an injunction, the same was granted by the presiding Judge, to which the defendants excepted. The State was not a stockholder in either the Macon and Western or Central Railroad ' Companies, and, therefore, had no <em>direct interest </em>in the decree to be rendered, as between the contestants. If the State had any interest in the controversy, it was in her sovereign capacity as the representative of the whole people of the State, and should have appeared before the Court in her sovereign capacity, by the appropriate mode of procedure in such cases. The consummation or non-consummation of the private contract of lease between these two corporations, was not a claim inconsistent with the sovereignty, jurisdiction or rights of the people of the State. It was a mere <em>private suit </em>between these two corporations, to which the State, in her sovereign capacity, was not a proper party. The city of Macon suing in behalf of the citizens thereof, or other artificial persons, had no <em>direct interest </em>in the decree to be rendered, as to the legal right of these two corporations to make the contract in question, which would entitle it to be made a party complainant. The question as to the legal right of the two companies to make and accept a lease of the road, is a question which involves the legal rights of the complaining stockholders in the respective companies, and the legal rights of those companies under their respective charters. The decree as to the legal right of the two corporations to make the contract, would only bind <em>them, </em>as to their legal l\u2019ight to make it, and that is the sole question presented by the complainant\u2019s bill, with which the State or the city of Macon have no concern, so far as the <em>legal right </em>of the two corporations to make the contract of lease, is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The main question in the case, as made by the pleadings in the record, is as to the legal right of the Macon and Western Railroad Company to <em>lease </em>that road to the Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Eailroad and Banking Company, in the manner therein set forth. By the 11th section of the charter of the Monroe Eailroad Company it is declared, \u201cthat said Monroe Eailroad Company shall have the <em>exclusive right </em>of transportation and conveyance of persons, produce, merchandise and all other things over the railroad to be by them constructed, as long as they shall see fit to exercise such exclusive right.\u201d And it is further provided in the same section of the charter, \u201cthat said company may, when they see fit, <em>rent or farm out </em>any part or the whole of their said exclusive right of transportation on said railroad, <em>with the privileges thereof, </em>to any individual or individuals, or <em>other company, </em>subject to the rates above mentioned.\u201d By an Act of the General Assembly of 1847, the Macon and Western Eailroad was incorporated, and all the powers and <em>privileges </em>conferred on the Monroe Eailroad Company were conferred on the Macon and Western Eailroad Company, with certain exceptions, which are not pertinent to the question now before the Court. The grant to the Monroe Eailroad Company was certain enumerated privileges, with the exclusive right of transportation over the road to be constructed by them, as long as they should see fit to exercise such exclusive right; but if the company should see fit to rent or farm out any part or the whole of their exclusive right of transportation on'said railroad, they were authorized to do so, <em>with the privileges thereof, </em>that is to say, <em>with the privileges of the railroad </em>which had been granted to the company, as well as the exclusive right of transportation thereon. The privileges conferred on the company by the charter, was to enable them to construct the railroad for the transportion of persons, produce and merchandise, as long as they might see fit to do so; but whenever they should see fit to rent or farm out their exclusive right of transportation on the road to another company, then it became absolutely necessary that the <em>privileges of the railroad </em>granted to the company should be also rented and farmed out, so as to enable the lessee to enjoy the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the exclusive right of transportation on the road. The charter not only confers the power on the company to lease the exclusive right of transportation on the railroad, but also the <em>privileges of the road </em>granted to the company by the charter, so as to enable the lessee to have, enjoy and control the exclusive right of transportation on the road, in as full and ample manner as the original grantees could have done under the charter. The grant in the charter to rent or farm out <em>the privileges of the road, </em>was indispensable to secure the exclusive right of transportation on the road, to the lessee thereof, unless the right could be maintained on the principle, that when the law doth give anything to one, it giveth impliedly whatsoever is necessary for enjoying the same. The authority, however, is expressly granted in this charter to the company, not only to rent and farm out the exclusive right of transportation on the road, but <em>the privileges thereof, </em>so as to enable the lessee of the road to enjoy such exclusive right of transportation. The power to lease <em>the privileges of the road, </em>as conferred by the charter, was necessary to the enjoyment of the exclusive right of transportation, in the opinion of the Legislature, as manifested by the grant conferring that power. The Macon and Western road had the legal power and authority, under its charter, to make the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Did the Central Railroad, under its charter and the Acts of the General Assembly amendatory thereof, have the legal power and authority to purchase and accept the lease under the contract made between that company and the Macon and Western road? In 1850 the General Assembly passed an act to <em>unite </em>the Central Railroad and Banking Company and the Macon and Western Railroad Company, and other railroad companies, reciting in the preamble of that Act, as a reason for its enactment, \u201cthat large sums of money had been expended by incorporated companies (one of which was the Central road) and from the State Treasury, for the purpose of opening and constructing railroads from the seaboard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>to the Western limits of the State, and in order that the citizens of the State should derive the full benefit intended by the line of railroads so constructed, it is expedient that the transportation of freight and passengers over said line should be as free from interruption and transhipment as possible.\u201d The Act then declares that it shall be <em>lawful </em>for the Central Railroad and the Macon and \"Western Railroad and the Southwestern Railroad Companies to <em>unite </em>their respective railroads in one common depot at or near the city of Macon, so that the cars of the respective roads may <em>pass from one road to another uninterruptedly. </em>It appears from the record that the Macon and Western railroad is <em>united </em>and <em>connected </em>with the Central Railroad, and is indeed but an extension of the latter road from the city of Savannah to the interior of the State. In 1852 the General Assembly passed an Act amendatory of the charter of the Central Railroad Company, enlarging the powers of that company, the object of which was, as shown by the caption of the Act, to authorize the company to lease and work such other railroads as <em>then </em>connected with it, or might <em>thereafter </em>connect with it for a term of years, or during the continuance of their respective charters. The first section of that Act declares, <em>\u201c </em>that it shall and may be <em>lawful </em>for the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia to lease and work, for such time, and on such terms as may agreed on by the parties interested, the Augusta and Waynesboro Railroad, the Milledgeville and Gordon Railroad, the Eatonton Branch Railroad, the Southwestern Railroad, and such other railroads as <em>now connect </em>or may <em>hereafter connect </em>with the Central Railroad, and to collect, by suit or otherwise, the fares of travel and the charges of transportation on railroads so leased. The second section of the Act declares, \u201c that the respective boards of directors of the incorporated companies owning the railroads above mentioned, or owning such other railroads as <em>now connect, </em>or may <em>hereafter connect </em>with the Central Railroad shall have power and authority so to lease to the Central_Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>and Banking Company of Georgia, their respective railroads for such time, and on such other terms as they respectively may deem best.\u201d By this Act the Central Railroad Company has the power expressly conferred upon it, by this amendatory provision of their charter, to <em>lease </em>not only the railroads specified by name, but such as <em>then </em>connected with it or <em>thereafter </em>might connect with it; and the Act further confers the power and authority on the respective boards of directors of other incorporated railroad companies owning such other railroads, (than those specified by name) as <em>then </em>connected or might <em>thereafter </em>connect with the Central Railroad, to lease to the last named railroad company their respective railroads, for such term of time, and bn such terms as they respectively may deem best. Whether this power, so clearly and expressly conferred on the Central Railroad Company, was <em>wisely </em>or <em>unwisely </em>conferred by the General Assembly, is not a question for the Courts to determine. The question for the Courts to decide is whether the power has been granted, and if it has, to protect the company in the enjoyment of their rights acquired under that grant of power conferred by the General Assembly. What is a <em>connecting </em>road, in the sense in which that term is used, in the Act of 1852? The best definition of' a <em>connecting </em>railroad, as applicable to this case, is that given by the General Assembly in the Act of 1850, providing for the <em>wilting </em>the respective railroads therein named: \u201cso that the cars of the respective roads may pass from one road to another uninterruptedly, without the transhipment of freight or passengers.\u201d That was the kind of <em>connecting roads </em>the Legislature had in contemplation in the passage of the Act of 1852. What is the character and effect of the instrument set forth in the record as the evidence of the contract between the two companies, when construed and interpreted in accordance with the acknowledged principles of the law applicable to such an instrument? It purports on its face to be <em>a lease </em>of the Macon and Western Railroad to the Central Railroad, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>recites the provision of the charter of the Macon and Western Railroad Company, which authorizes that company to rent or farm out its exclusive right of transportation on said railroad with the privileges thereof, to any individual or individuals, or other company. It also recites the provisions of the Act of 1852, which authorizes the Central Railroad to <em>lease connecting roads. </em>And it is quite clear on the face of the instrument that it was <em>the intention </em>of the parties to make a contract for <em>a lease </em>of the road, and not a contract for <em>the sale </em>and absolute conveyance of the title to the road. In the construction of a deed, if there be two clauses utterly inconsistent, the <em>former </em>must prevail, but the <em>intention </em>of the parties from the whole instrument, should, if possible, be ascertained and carried into effect: Code, 2655. The cardinal rule for the construction of contracts is to ascertain <em>the intention </em>of the parties. If that intention be clear, and it contravenes no rule of law, and sufficient words be used to arrive at <em>the intention, </em>it shall be enforced, irrespective of all technical or arbitrary rules of construction. The intention of the parties may differ among themselves. In such case the meaning placed on the contract by one party, and <em>\u00a1'mown to </em>be thus understood by the other party, at the time, shall be held as the true meaning: Code, 2713, 2714. In this case both parties intended to make a contract for <em>a lease </em>of the road, and both parties understand it now to be <em>a lease </em>of the road, and there is nothing in the instrument itself which requires that the Court should understand it differently. The words employed are not such as would indicate an intention to make <em>a sale </em>of the road, and convey an absolute title thereto to the purchaser thereof; but, on the contrary, the Macon and Western Road expressly reserves the right to enter upon and resume the possession of the road and its appurtenances, on the failure of the Central road to comply with the terms and stipulations of the contract between the parties. Construing the contract in accordance with the <em>expressed intention </em>of the parties on the face thereof, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the legal effect of the words employed therein, it is a contract for <em>a lease </em>of the road to the Central Eailroad and Banking Company, and not <em>a sale </em>of the Macon and Western road to that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In view of the facts contained in this record, the two complaining stockholders in the Central Eailroad Company must be presumed to have accepted the previsions of the Act of 1852, authorizing that company to <em>lease connecting railroads ; </em>the more especially as that company has exercised the power granted by that Act, and leased other railroads, without any objection on their part, as stockholders, to the exercise of such power on the part of the company. It is now too late for them to say that, as stockholders in the company, they never accepted and assented to the power granted to the company in the Act of 1852, to <em>lease connecting railroads. </em>This is an <em>absolute </em>contract for the lease of the Macon and Western Eailroad, and contains <em>independent </em>covenants. If the legislation mentioned in the covenant for the <em>amalgamation </em>of the two roads, so soon as the necessary legislation for that purpose can be secured, should be held, when that legislation is had, to be in violation of the legal rights of the stockholders in either company, under their contract as such stockholders, still, the <em>absolute </em>contract for the lease of the road would be a good and valid contract, this latter covenant in relation to the amalgamation of the two roads, being an <em>independent </em>covenant, could not defeat the <em>absolute contract </em>for the lease of the road, that contract not being <em>dependent </em>on the performance of the last named covenant for the amalgamation of the two roads in the manner therein expressed. But the contemplated legislation mentioned in that <em>independent </em>covenant, is not now before the Court, and we express no opinion in regard to it. When the contemplated legislation shall be obtained, and the stockholders of either of the companies shall complain of it as illegally interfering with their contract as such stockholders, under the charters of their respective companies, then it will be time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>enough to consider that question. The State of Georgia and the city of Macon, on the statement of facts disclosed by the record, were not proper parties to the complainant\u2019s bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The Macon and Western Eailroad Company had the legal power and authority, under the provisions of its charter, to lease that road to the Central Eailroad and Banking Company of Georgia, and the latter company had the legal power and authority, under the provisions of the Act of 1852, to accept said lease as specified in the contract set forth in the record. In our judgment, the Court below erred in granting the injunction prayed for in complainants\u2019 bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b649-6\">Lochrane, Chief Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The questions involved in this ease have been ably argued by counsel upon both sides, and we have carefully examined the authorities presented, and weighed their application to and effect on the important legal principles involved in the controversy. After a careful consideration of the whole case, I concur in the judgment of the Court just pronounced, for the following reasons, which I shall confine to the main questions in issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Did the Central Eailroad have the right to lease the Macon and Western Eailroad, and did the Macon and Western Eailroad have the legal right to enter into such contract of lease, and is the instrument into which they entered such a conveyance as is authorized by law ? These questions, with such as grow out of them, and will be discussed in proper-place, constitute the controlling merits of the case at bar. In 1850, the Legislature of the State of Georgia, in the exercise of its sovereign authority, passed \u201c an Act to authorize the Central Eailroad and Banking Company of Georgia, the Macon and Western Eailroad Company and the Southwestern Eailroad Company, to unite their respective rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>roads in one common depot, at or near the city of Macon.\u201d The public policy of the State is declared by the preamble in the following language : \u201c Whereas, there has been expended in the State by incorporated companies, and from the State treasury very large sums of money for the purpose of opening and constructing railroads from the seaboard to the western limits of the State; and, whei\u2019eas, in order that the State and the citizens thereof should derive the full benefit intended by the line of railroad so constructed, it is expedient that the transportation of freight and passengers over said line should be as free from interruption and transhipment as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In 1852, the Legislature passed an Act to authorize the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, to lease and work such railroads as now connect or may hereafter connect with the Central Railroad, and to authorize the board of directors of such railroad companies as now have or may hereafter have their respective railroads connecting with the Central Railroad, to make leases thereof for a term of years, or during the continuance of their respective charters. The law provides that it shall and may be lawful for the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, to lease and work for such time and on such terms, as may be agreed on by the parties interested, the Augusta and Waynesboro\u2019 Railroad, the Milledgeville and Gordon Railroad, the Eaton-ton Branch Railroad, the Southwestern Railroad, and such other railroads as now connect or may hereafter connect with the Central Railroad, and to collect, by suit or otherwise, the fares of travel and the charges of transportation on railroads so leased. And, also, that the respective boards of directors of the incorporated companies owning the railroads above mentioned, or owning such other railroads as now connect or may hereafter connect with the Central Railroad, shall have power and authority so to lease to the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, their respective railroads, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>such term of time, and on such other terms, as they, respectively, may deem best.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">These Acts, taken together, establish, beyond all judicial controversy, two important propositions: first, that the Macon and Western Railroad is a connecting road; the Legislature has so declared; second, that the Central Railroad has the right to lease connecting roads, for such is the express power granted to it by the Legislature. And the Act of 1852 is equally emphatic that the directors of the incorporated companies owning such connecting roads, are clothed with power to lease them to the Central Railroad, in the terms of the Act. We need not, therefore, in the decision of this question, follow the very able argument of our brother Bacon, in relation to the powers conferred by legislation upon the corporations, or discuss the public policy of the State of Georgia, iu its auxiliary importance, in arriving at the correct construction of legislative intent; for the statutes are clear, plain and unequivocal, and leave nothing to supply by intendment or construction. This Court has nothing to do with the policy or impolicy of legislative enactments. The Constitution wisely delegates that power to the General Assembly, and they alone are charged with its execution, with a view to the advancement of the public interest, and enhancement of the public welfare. And where the statutory law is plain, neither strictness nor liberality of construction can judicially limit or enlarge the legislative will. We have, therefore, arrived at the conclusion that the Central Railroad has the legislative right to enter into the lease of the Macon and Western Railroad, under the provisions of the Acts recited; and we hold further, that the exercise of the privileges of the Act of 1852, in the leasing of other roads, which has been continuous since its passage, disposes of the complaint of Mr. Gresham, <em>et al., </em>whose acceptance, by acquiescence, estops such dissenting complainants, as stockholders, from now being heard. Corporations once organized under the laws of the land, and represented by di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>rectors, in the management of their chartered organizations a minority of their stockholders are bound by their acts, when done within the walls of their charter, or within the general provisions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The next question, and most important in the adjudication of this case is, whether the Macon and Western Railroad had the power to lease its road. The 11th section of the original Act of 1853, says: \u201cThe said Monroe Railroad Company (now Macon and Western Railroad) shall have the exclusive right of transportation and conveyance of persons, produce, merchandise, and all other things over the railroad to be by them constructed, so long as they shall see fit to exercise such exclusive right: <em>Provided, </em>the charges for transportation or conveyance shall not exceed, etc.; <em>and provided, also, </em>that said company may, when they see fit, <em>rent or farm out any part or the whole.o\u00ed </em>their said exclusive right of transportation on said railroad, with the privileges thereof, to any individual or individuals <em>or other company, </em>subject to rates above mentioned.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Under this provision the Macon and Western Railroad has the right to lease their right of transportation <em>with the privileges thereof, </em>to any individual or <em>other company. </em>It will not bejdenied that the Central Railroad Company comes expressly within the term \u201c <em>other company;\u201d </em>and we can realize no possible or positive difference between the power to lease the exclusive right of transportation on said railroad and the railroad itself. The one is essential to the use of the other, and if there were left any imaginable doubt between the one and the other, we might invoke legislative construction of the Act of 1852. But the language of the charter, in connection -with the right of transportation on said road with the privileges thereof, carries with overwhelming conviction the right to lease the road, for transportation over the road, which is conceded must bear with it the privilege of the road itself. It would be too strict a construction to say the transportation of the road and the privileges thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>meant only to convey the right of going over the road. As well might we hold that the lease to a plantation did not include the right to plow the land or give a right to the land or all the privileges thereof, during the term of the lease. We, therefore, hold two propositions settled. The first, the right of the Central Railroad Company to lease the Macon and Western Railroad, and the right of the Macon and Western to lease itself to the Central.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The next proposition which we deem it necessary to notice, is based upon the ground that the instrument entered into by the contracting parties, it is argued, is not a lease. We have examined this instrument, and are satisfied, under the Code of Georgia, that it was the intention of the parties to execute a lease, and the cardinal rule of construction of all contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties. If that intention be clear, and it contravenes no rule of law, and sufficient words be used to arrive at the intention, it should be enforced, irrespective of all technical or arbitrary rules of construction. And to our minds it was the intention of the parties to execute a lease, and nothing in the instrument can be construed legitimately to impute a different construction. The covenant entered into between the parties to the effect \u201c that so soon as the necessary legislation for that purpose be secured there shall be an amalgamation of these roads,\u201d even if it were true that such contract was in itself illegal, which we do not think, by the laws of Georgia would not in the slightest degree invalidate the lease. For, under the law, contracts are severable, and that which is valid will be maintained by the Courts. But for myself, I do not think that provision agreed to by the contracting parties subject to the will of the Legislature to enforce by appropriate legislation is invalid. The legal objection is that this provision may have formed one of the chief inducements to the consummation of the lease, and inasmuch as such act of amalgamation would be illegal without the unanimous consent of all the stockholders, the consideration provides for an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>thing, to-wit: bind the stockholders not consenting thereto by a legislative act. We do not agi\u2019ee with either the premises or the consequences. In the first place, the lease is a good lease irrespective of the provision, and severable therefrom. In the second place, this Court will not anticipate the action of the Legislature, but presume always that that body will act in conformity to law. And in the third place, after legislative provision has been granted to a corporation to do a particular thing, within the scope and enlargement of its powers, I do not hold such act depends upon the unanimous consent of each and every stockholder to give it operation and effect. On the contrary, I hold that the individual contract of the stockholder, from the date of the legal organization of the company, becomes merged in the company, and all contracts afterwards made are contracts of the corporation, and subject to the direction or ratification of a majority of the stockholders. And while it may be the right of an individual stockholder to invoke equitable interposition against the company for an .act about to be executed in violation of law, still I hold that as to all acts permitted by the Legislature after such permission, a majority of the stockholders represent the company, and their will, when legally ascertained and expressed, bind the minority. And in the case at bar, if such provision of the lease is ratified by a majority of the stockholders, individual dissent by any portion of a minority would be unavailing to prevent it. And upon the same principle I dispose of the complaint of the two dissenting stockholders as to the action of the Central Eailroad and Banking Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b654-6\">McCa.Y, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AsF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">I agree, that, under the Act of 1853, and under the charter of the Macon and Western Eailroad, it is competent for the Central Eailroad Company to lease the Macon and Western Eailroad, and that it is also competent for the Macon and Western Eailroad to be leased. And were this contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>only a lease, I should agree to the judgment of the Court. But, as I understand this agreement, it is for more than a lease. It is a contract, that if the Legislature consents, the Macon and Western Eailroad Company shall lose its separate existence, and be merged into the Central Eailroad Company. Now, as I understand the law, this is a contract that a <em>majority </em>of the stockholders of a company cannot make, either without or with the assent of the Legislature. Any one stockholder in either company may, of his own motion, and at his option, prevent it, unless the power be in the charter, or be assented to by all the stockholders. In every charter, there is first the contract between the company and the public, and second, the contract between the stockholders themselves. The leading idea of the latter contract is, that the majority may make every contract and do every act authorized by the charter, and no more. If it be desirable to get new powers inserted into the charter, all the corporators must assent to it. A subscriber who has taken stock in one enterprise, does not agree that the majority shall, even with the legislative assent, divert his funds to a new and different enterprise against his consent. And this I understand to be the settled rule of all the Courts, both in England and America. But it is replied, that admitting this to be the law, the argument before the Court is for the lease, and the contract to manage the companies is not a part of the lease; that in fact, it contemplates, on its completion, that the lease shall be merged into it; that it is an independent affair, and even if not itself within the power of the majority, that it does not affect this lease. I do not think so. The <em>consideration </em>of the lease is stated to be the <em>mutual covenants </em>of the parties, and one of these covenants is this agreement. Who shall say that one of the leading motives of those who have assented to the lease, was not that, as soon as the Legislature consented, the two roads should be merged? And without doubt, <em>under this contract, </em>if the Legislature does consent, either of the contracting parties can compel the other to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>sent to this merger. If this be so, then the contract now entered into is a contract of merger, and in my judgment, must . have the assent of all the stockholders. At any rate, any one may dissent and break it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">I think the State a proper party to this bill. As a matter of course, if the companies have the right to make the contract, the bill is not a good bill in the name of any body. If, however, this contract is contrary to the charter \u2014 an assertion of a franchise not granted to the company \u2014 'then tiie attempt to make it is contrary to law, contrary to public policy, and the State has a right to be a party, either under its general power to prevent violations of the law, or by virtue of its interests in the Macon and Brunswick road.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The bill is filed on this idea, that the companies are violating their <em>charter, </em>not only infringing on the rights of the dissenting stockholders, but violating the public law, to-wit: setting up a chartered right that belongs to neither road. I think, therefore, the State was a proper party if the bill was good, and as I think the bill <em>mas. gaad, </em>I think the State a proper party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
