Fi. fa. </em>issued, there was a levy, claim, etc. This levy was dismissed in May, 1870. On the 9th of November, 1870, Dawson made affidavit as to the payment of taxes, as is required by the Relief Act of 13th of October, 1870, with a view to proceed on the <em>fi. fa. </em>Rankin then made affidavit that he, as the executor of William Rankin, lost one hundred and fifty-five slaves, worth $75,000 00, and one hundred and seventy shares of Columbus bank stock, worth $25,000 00, and mules and cotton worth $10,-000 00, by or in consequence of the late war against the United States by the people of this and other States, and \u201c he desires to set-off said losses against the judgment in said case, and have them entered as a credit on the same; such credit or set-off was not allowed on the original trial, and said judgment has not been reduced under the Relief Act of <em>1868.\u201d </em>This affidavit was demurred to as insufficient in law to stop said <em>fi. fa. </em>The demurrer was sustained and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-9\">Peabody &amp; Brannon; Smith &amp; Alexander, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvI\">Act of 13th October, 1870.

This was the essential part of the oath, and the Act only applied to that class of contracts. And we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court below sustaining the demurrer filed and dismissing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
