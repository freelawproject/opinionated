When, upon the trial of an indictment for murder, the Judge admitted evidence of the character of the accused for violence, and also of the deceased for peaceableness, the same not being in rebuttal and objected to by the prisoner:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b88-8\"><em>Held, </em>That such ruling was error, under the well established principles of the law of evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b88-9\">2. Where the accused, by his counsel, offered in evidence the testimony of a witness, taken down by the Court in a former trial, and the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>rejected it, except such parts as he decided to be in conflict, characterizing such testimony as heresay:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b89-4\"><em>Held, </em>That such testimony, taken down in writing on a former trial, when properly proven, may be offered in evidence by either party to discredit the witness, in whole or in part \u2014 in whole, to show the negative of something stated, not testified to on former examination, or in part to contradict the witness, and such evidence may he read to the jury, who will apply it by their memory of what was then sworn to before them, and adjudge the question of its conflict or its materiality, and such application and consideration is a question for the jury under the charge of the Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b89-5\">3. When the Court admitted in evidence a particular act of insult, a quarrel between the prisoner and deceased, occurring several months before the homicide, and not connected with the cause occasioning it :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b89-6\"><em>Held, </em>That the admission of acts of previous quarrels, of particular acts, to be admissible against the prisoner, must not be a separate, distinct and independent act, but there must be some link of association, something which draws together the preceding and subsequent acts, something which gives color of cause and effect to the transaction, and sheds light upon the motive of the parties, to render such particular act or acts admissible.

When the Court complimented a witness for the prosecution, the mere fact of compliment being certified without giving the language used:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-5\"><em>Held, </em>That such action by the Court was calculated to give an improper potency to the influence of his testimony, and was not proper in a case involving life.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-6\">8. When the fact appeared, upon motion for new trial by the affidavit of the sheriff, that he had, at the request of the jury, brought to them, in their room, loose papers, purporting to be the evidence in the case, not knowing what the papers consisted of, and no exculpatory explanations given:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-7\"><em>Held, </em>That, in a case of murder, a new trial ought to have been granted upon this ground.

Criminal Law. Before Judge Andrews. Wilkes Superior Court. June, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-9\">On the 25th of February, 1867, Pound killed John E. Harrison, in Hancock county. He was arrested and committed to jail, after a hearing. He was indicted for murder. At October Term, 1867, there was a mis-trial, because the jury could not agree. At the next term, a jury was selected from the grand jurors, by consent, and Pound was again put upon his trial. Another mis-trial was declared, because of the sickness of a juror. By consent, he was again put upon trial, at an Adjourned Term, before a jury taken from grand jurors, and they failing to agree, another mis-trial was declared. By consent, the case was then transferred to Wilkes county, because an impartial jury could <em>not be </em>had in Hancock county. These proceedings were had before Judge Reese.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-10\">A copy of the said proceedings having been transmitted to Wilkes Superior Court, Pound was there put. upon his trial, in June, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The evidence adduced on that trial was as follows: The objections made to it, etc., appear hereafter in the motion for new trial, the recitals of which are true.

[Diagram shown to the jury.] When witness and deceased reached back of Pound\u2019s lot, deceased found his fence down, and asked witness to help put it up; witness at that time had deceased\u2019s axe; while putting up fence Pound went back in lane and commenced cursing witness; witness first came opposite accused, near furthest end of the lane from road, Pound being in his corn field, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and deceased in his with witness; neither said anything to Pound at that place, after loading two barrels; lane seven or eight feet wide where they were putting up fence ; Pound told witness his d \u2014 d old hog had torn down his fence, and got in his field, and cut his hog ail to pieces; witness asked if he could help what his hog did when witness was not there? Pound said witness <em>had </em>been calling him a coward, and saying he would not fight, and if witness did not believe he would fight, to come over and try him; witness replied he had nothing to fight him with; accused called witness d \u2014 d dog soup and maggot soup, and other unpleasant things; accused then stepped on a log in mouth of lane; his daughter then stepped up by him; his daughter said something to Pound which witness did not understand; Pound came up to the road to front of where they were putting up fence; all fence at that time but last rail was up; deceased had just picked up the rail when Pound cursed him; called deceased a d \u2014 d something \u2014 witness does not remember what, and deceased told him he would not take it; Pound then told deceased to come over, and deceased stopped to set rail up to his left side; Pound then presented his gun at Harrison, and then took his gun up across his left breast for a few seconds; then Pound presented it at Harrison again and fired. When the gun fired, deceased stepped one foot backwards and said, \u201c Oh, Lord, Pm killed;\u201d Pound then presented gun at witness, and witness got behind a stump, and turning saw Pound still had gun presented at him. Witness then went home and carried <em>the axe </em>with him, <em>and </em>started after a doctor; went in his house and got his father\u2019s pistol out of the desk, and carried it with him; Mr. Morris, witness\u2019 mother and Mrs. Duggin, then went up to where the homicide took place; witness had no weapon but pocket knife; had on vest, and about like he is now; Harrison had no weapon, witness thinks, and had on no coat, only \u00a1rants and shirt; Harrison carried axe to field, but witness took it, and had axe when difficulty occurred, and witness carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>axe immediately to his father\u2019s house, about one mile distant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\"><em>Gross-Examined: </em>At the time Pound was cursing him, witness told Pound he had nothing to fight him with; Pound asked witness if he would fight him at any other time and place, or in any way, and witness replied that he would; Pound had double-barrel shot gun, worth about $8 00 or $10 00; witness says diagram shown is correct; deceased and accused were about six or seven feet apart when the shooting occurred, and deceased was about three feet from fence, on Harrison\u2019s side; muzzle of gun was about two and a half or three feet from deceased when he was shot; lane between fields was about a quarter of a mile long; shooting of Harrison occurred about eight or nine panels of fence from mouth of the lane; found Pound shooting hog about one hundred yards from other end of the lane; after Pound left the log where he had been with his daughter, he continued cursing witness until he got where they were; witness does not think he cursed Harrison but one time; witness was then about twenty years old; Harrison was about twenty or twenty-one; Harrison and Pound had been acquainted nearly all their lives; Harrison had lived about a mile and a half, or two miles below Pound the year before, and was at the time of the shooting living about one half or three-quarters of a mile from Pound; Harrison was killed about sun-down; witness has been sworn in this case three or four times, and once in addition before the coroner\u2019s inquest; thinks he was also sworn before a magistrate; he thinks he was sworn at October Term, 1867, Hancock Superior Court \u2014 is not positive; thinks he was sworn at April Term, 1868 ; thinks he was sworn at May adjourned Term, 1868 \u2014 is not certain; witness thinks he has not stated before on oath that Harrison said on the evening of the killing that he was taking the axe along to help the negro cut logs, if he found his help necessary to enable the negro to finish the field that evening; witness, upon being further interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>gated, says, he don\u2019t know but what he has; remembers to have heard his testimony in this case commented upon in the Court-house before ; witness does not think he heard his testimony commented on as being improbable in this: that it was unreasonable for Harrison to be at that hour of the evening carrying his axe to the field to cut logs; witness and Harrison were over half way from road to where Pound was when the rabbit jumped up; this is the place where he first heard Pound tell his children to load the gun, where he discovered it was his father\u2019s hog Pound was after, and where he said he would go and see if Pound would kill the hog ; he went to see about the hog, and Harrison went with him; after witness took the axe he kept the axe in his hand all the while; helped put up the fence \u2014 did not put down the axe while helping ; there were but few rails thrown off the fence on the ground; when Pound accused witness of having called him a coward, witness asked him who told him so ? Pound said he could prove it by good authority; do not remember that he denied having called Pound a coward ; do not know but what he testified before that he asked Pound who told him this ; Pound accused witness of having killed his dog; doesn\u2019t think he owned or denied it; doesn\u2019t know whether he killed his dog; last time he saw the dog he was running; don\u2019t remember that Pound called Harrison a damned meddlesome rascal; don\u2019t remember what he said further than cursing him; don\u2019t remember that Pound warned Harrison if he got over the fence he would kill him; don\u2019t think he told him so; witness don\u2019t think he has stated this in any previous testimony; witness says if he did he may not have intended it, or interrogator may have misunderstood him; when Harrison told Pound, in response to his cursing, that he wouldn\u2019t take it, he started towards the fence and stopped; was not putting the rail on the fence when he said this \u2014 had not got to it; Harrison was putting up the fence about the time Pound vras loading his gun in the road; witness says he omitted on direct examination to state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Pound drew back his gun as if he was going to strike him; witness has said Harrison started towards fence with a rail and stopped; witness don\u2019t know that he has any impression that Harrison was going to the fence with any intention to put it up; don\u2019t think he had any idea of getting over the fence; witness can\u2019t tell what he thought at that time was Harrison\u2019s motive in going towards the fence; witness don\u2019t remember whether it was a full length rail or not; thinks it was long enough to go on the panel; Harrison never put the rail on the fence; when deceased fell he thinks the rail fell right across the fence, one end lodging on the fence; thinks the rail fell across deceased \u2014 won\u2019t be positive about it; when the rail fell, witness thinks the lower end of it remained on Plarrison\u2019s left side; the upper end, he thinks, fell over towards Harrison\u2019s right side; thinks deceased picked up the rail just before or just as Pound cursed him; when deceased first picked up rail he did so as if. he was going to put it on the fence, and not as if he was going to strike Pound; deceased had the rail in this same position until he put it down by his side; witness doesn\u2019t know that he thought at the time whether he was going to strike Pound; witness don\u2019t know but what he has testified before that Harrison had the rail in a position as if he intended to strike Pound; witness and deceased were in a moderate walk when they walked through the field where they were when they first saw Pound; when witness and deceased went towards where Pound was, his son and daughter were the only members of Pound\u2019s family with him; don\u2019t remember that he saw his wife or any other of his family but the said son and daughter; don\u2019t remember testifying on any previous examination that Mrs. Pound told him, (witness,) to go off; witness saw nothing to indicate that Pound\u2019s family came out as if they expected a difficulty; thinks he stated in a previous testifying that deceased stepped a foot back; witness don\u2019t know that he has ever heard any comments upon the possibility^ of accounting for the body of deceased being as far from the fence as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>found; when witness said he would go and see if Pound would kill the hog, deceased said he would go too to see if there were any logs down there; didn\u2019t say he would go to see if it was his, (Harrison\u2019s,) hog; Harrison saw the hog; deceased didn\u2019t go to see if it was hog; when deceased and witness first went to where the negro was cutting, witness went because Harrison asked him to go with him; witness had no purpose of his own in going; witness says he has not testified before that he went to the field to look for sheep there; there were sheep there, one sick, and they found the sick sheep; witness says he testified about the sheep at one time; he doesn\u2019t know that he did every time he has been sworn; witness doesn\u2019t know that he has testified at anytime that the sole reason he or deceased had for going to the field was to look for logs; he doesn\u2019t remember exactly whether he ever gave in his testimony this way or not; witness says Harrison didn\u2019t pick up rail with both hands as if he intended to strike Pound across the fence; witness thinks he testified at October Term, 1867, that Harrison took the rail in both hands, as if he intended to hit Pound across the fence; this was after Pound cursed him; it was after deceased said he wouldn\u2019t take that, (referring to the cursing); witness don\u2019t think he said on this examination that when Harrison said he wouldn\u2019t take that, he immediately put the rail down by his left side, and remained standing with it there until he was shot; witness supposes he and Pound were on bad terms before this difficulty; don\u2019t know whether deceased and accused were, but adds, \u201c I believe too they were <em>-,p </em>witness says Harrison said he spoke to Pound and he would not speak to him; witness does not think he has testified once there was no bad feeling between accused aud witness; witness never testified that he and Pound were friendly; witness states that Pound\u2019s son told him to go away from there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\"><em>Re-Direct: </em>Saw Pound\u2019s dog once after he saw him running; it was between his father\u2019s house and the branch; wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ness says the dog was drawn out of his father\u2019s well after that; witness didn\u2019t see him drawn out himself; negro boy cutting logs was between one-fourth and one-half mile from Harrison\u2019s house; these logs were between seventy-five and one hundred yards from where Harrison was killed; witness says his impression is that he merely saw the rail in the act of falling across Harrison; Harrison, when shot, fell right back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">Ur. W. H. Green, sworn: Direct: Witness was not called to see Harrison the evening he was shot; didn\u2019t see him until twenty-four hours after deceased; was in his house when he first saw him; witness examined wound; it was one and a half inches above right nipple, inclined downwards, backwards and obliquely to the left; it had on the flesh evidences of powder; when witness saw it, it had been bleeding profusely, and was, at the time, still oozing a little; the wound, he supposes, was about one inch, irregularly, in diameter, bearing marks of being a gunshot wound; didn\u2019t see the shot, but supposes they were double B\u2019s, or perhaps larger \u2014 not larger than small buckshot; witness was, at that time, and is now, a practicing physician, and his medical opinion is, deceased died from the wound; doesn\u2019t know the exact angle, but thinks it was at an angle of about forty-five degrees when the body was erect; striking the skin or bone very frequently deflects the ball; the balls passed probably between the ribs without breaking either; witness probed the wound; has known accused about fifteen or sixteen years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\"><em>Oross-Examined: </em>Witness thinks some of the shot changed direction after striking the body, but only such as struck \u00e1 rib; all the shot had the same range until they struck the bones; those that struck rib were even more vertical than those that did not \u2014 that is, they glanced after striking the ribs; witness says the lower part of the rib being thinner than the upper, would have been broken, had not the shot come from an angle of forty or forty-five degrees; a load, with as large shot as that, discharged horizontally, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>probably have broken a bone larger than the lower surface of the rib; the place where the wound was, in the lung, was very near the root of the right lung; that part of the lung is very little changed in location by death; witness thinks he got the correct range of the shot, from his examination, and he was examining with a view to get the range; witness does not think the wound could have been given with the range it had if both parties \u2014 the one shooting and the one shot\u2014 had been standing erect; thinks it impossible, at the distance the parties were apart; if Harrison had been on the fence, leaning over, that would have been a complete explanation of the wound, and of the direction the balls took after entering the body of Harrison; witness examined fence where it was said the body lay; saw powder marks on the top rail; the rail was rather triangular; the powder mark was on the side of the rail next to where Pound is said to have stood; the powder spot on the rail was somewhat in the shape of a half-moon, the convex side, towards the lane, five or six inches in diameter; witness thinks if Harrison had been with his breast resting on the top rail, and his body leaning <em>over, </em>this position would have fully explained the powder marks witness saw; witness has experimented with a shot-gun, with reference to this case, and this opinion with regard to the powder marks on the body is the result of such experiments; the fence was not exceeding five feet high, witness does not suppose; thinks it would strike about or below his chin; witness is a little over six feet high; the lower part of the rib is thin compared with the other part; witness thinks even smaller shot than these would have carried away the lower part of the rib if the gun had been horizontal when shot; doesn\u2019t think, from his experiments, that the muzzle of the gun, when shot, could have been more than two feet from the body; knew Harrison about one and a half years; was not a large man; about one hundred and fifty pounds in weight; about five feet, six or eight inches high; was an active man, witness thinks; from an examination, am satisfied Pound\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>leg has been broken; limps sometimes; this was his condition before killing Harrison; can\u2019t say when Pound\u2019s leg was broken ; has seen Pound get along very well on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\"><em>Me-Direet: </em>The doctrine of the medical books is that a ball frequently is deflected when it strikes the skin or other hard substance; a wind sometimes deflects a ball; Harrison\u2019s lungs, when examined, were not inflated \u2014 partly collapsed, and partly filled with blood ; thinks the death was within a few seconds after the shot; thinks a shot from a gun, within two feet of an erect body, would throw the body backwards; witness thinks if the body had been against the rail, a shot from a gun, with the muzzle two feet off, might possibly have thrown the body three feet back; does not recollect whether, on a previous examination, he said such a shot, when instantaneous death ensued, would cause the body to fall down when it was on one side or other of the fence; does not think the wound could have been inflicted at that angle by shooting over the fence, Harrison being erect; witness says it is recognized as true by his profession that the direction a ball takes in .a body is no certain criterion of the direction in which the ball entered, but it is further laid down, that a ball, going with great velocity, generally continues in the same direction as that from which it entered; there is an instance in the books of when a Frenchman was shot in the neck, and the ball ranged round and came out at the same hole where it entered; and another, where a man in battle was shot in the sternum, and the ball was found in the scrotum ; witness\u2019 opinion is, that it is impossible that the ball could have taken a range of forty-five degrees, if both parties had been standing erect, and at the distance apart that they were; witness thinks the range of the shot could have been accounted for by supposing that Harrison, being two or three feet from the fence, endeavoring to screen himself behind the fence, and was in the act of stooping when shot; the lane at this point was about eight feet wide, as far as witness\u2019 acquaintance goes; deceased was a peaceful, quiet and industri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ous man; witness never knew of deceased having a fight ; knew deceased about eighteen months before his death ; was a young man, about twenty-one or twenty-two years old; of his own knowledge, witness knows little or nothing of defendant\u2019s character for violence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">By Defense: Witness don\u2019t know whether deceased was a high-spirited man; never suspected him of being a cowardly man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">By the State : From the distance at which the parties are represented to have been apart, Pound also being represented to have been three or three and a half feet from the fence, witness does not think deceased could have been on the fence, as the powder would have burnt the flesh more than it was burned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">By Defense : Knows nothing of the position of the parties, except from the evidence of the witnesses preceding him; if deceased had been on fence and the muzzle two feet from him, this position would fully explain the range, powder marks, and all other signs the witness discovered; wood, from experiment, scorched ot twelve to eighteen inches; cloth also at twelve inches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">Next witness by State \u2014 James Y. M. Morris: Witness saw deceased\u2019s body soon after he was killed; was at Green B. Carr\u2019s 12th February, 1867, at six o\u2019clock, p. <em>m. </em>; John Carr came and stated to witness that Pound had shot Harrison, and desired witness to go to him while Carr went for the doctor; Green B. Carr and witness immediately started to the place, and when they got there, Harrison\u2019s wife and Mrs. Duggin were there; found Mr. Harrison lying on his back, his left hand by his side, and his right hand lying over behind his head; his hat was about three feet from his head, immediately behind him; Harrison was dead when witness reached there; his forehead was cold and his body warm when witness reached him; his feet were about three feet from the fence; those present determined to carry the body to the house, and all left but witness; witness remained about half-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>hour and examined the place, position of the body, and took particular notice of the distance from the fence of the body; examined the wound; witness thought it was large enough to admit his two fingers, but did not put them in the wound; there was powder smoke on Harrison\u2019s shirt all around the wound; the wound had not bled at all more than would naturally flow from breaking the skin; only one drop of blood on the ground next morning, and that came from his (deceased) mouth; witness noticed that night a rail leaning over against the fence where he was shot; he supposed the rail had been leant there; body was moved to deceased\u2019s house that night, about one-fourth or one-half mile distant; next morning witness returned to the spot, after breakfast, with other gentlemen; examined next morning and saw no signs about the place where killing occurred to show that deceased had ever struggled; measured from where deceased\u2019s head lay, five feet, eight inches towards the fence, at which place witness supposes deceased\u2019s feet lay; supposes five feet, eight inches to have been his height; from where witness supposed deceased\u2019s feet lay to the fence, witness found, by measurement, to be three feet; discovered powder spot on top rail, about midway the panel; walked to the fence to examine powder spot; fence was about four feet eight inches high; witness measured it by his body; in examining powder spot, witness found it on outside of the rail from the field in which Harrison lay; powder spot was narrow towards the lane and widened towards the field; no smoke on either side of rail \u2014 \u25a0 only on top ; witness also saw, on the third or fourth rail from bottom, that a little piece of the rail was knocked off and was lying on the ground; witness then went back to the house, and there saw coroner\u2019s examination and Dr. Green\u2019s examination;

First, because you are \u25a0made the judges of the law; and I have always thought the Court should not be compelled to give it in charge to men who are its judges. But the Supreme Court having adjudged otherwise, I comply with its ruling on the subject. And secondly, because but a few sections need be read to cover the points in issue. And because, also, they are so plain that they need but little if any comment. Ii is <em>\u2018 </em>not contradicted but that the accused committed the homicide \u2019 charged in the indictment, and that very much shortens the investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-9\">\u201cAs the case has been argued on the ground that the offense was either murder or justifiable homicide, I will proceed to read to you a few sections of the Code that treats of the law on that subject. Here the Court read section 4264 of the Code, and said: To find the homicide justifiable under this section you must believe that when Pound killed Harrison he acted under the fears mentioned in section 4264, and not in a spirt of revenge. The important question with you is, by which motive was he influenced under all the circumstances of the case. The Court then read section 4266, and said: If you believe the facts bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the ease within this section, to justify the homicide you must believe the killing of Harrison was absolutely necessary to prevent an attack by him. A question is made whether this section applies to violence to the person. I am of opinion it does. And I am presented with the charge \u2014 or part of a charge \u2014 of Judge Reese on this section, and am requested to give it in charge as the law, which I do. Indeed, I agree with the whole of the charge, as I heard it read in the progress of the trial. But as I have been requested to charge particularly on the eleventh section of said charge, I will read it to you first. (Here the Court read part of Judge Reese\u2019s charge, for which see 7th section of the motion for a new trial. It is said that he did read it correctly.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>So, if Pounds had said to Harrison, if he came over that fence he would kill him, and he had gone over, Pound might have been justified in killing him, if you believe such admonition amounted to persuasion, remonstrance, or a gentle measure j and provided, also, that such killing was absolutely necessary while Harrison was on the fence as described, and before he had gotten over.

For section 4267 applies to all murders, including any part that may be committed, contemplated in section 4266. Here the Court read section 4267 twice, and said that it read said section as appplicable to section 4266, in addition to, and as a part of Judge Reese\u2019s charge. <em>\u201c </em>The above charge is applicable more particularly to facts proven by the defendant.\u201d If you believe Carr, the Court charges that the homicide set forth in the indictment is murder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-7\">\u201c Whether you will believe his version, is a question for the jury only.

But if they believe the witness has corruptly perjured himself in any of the statements, he should not be believed in anything.

The first error assigned arises upon the admission of evidence by the State as to the defendant\u2019s character for violence and evidence of specific acts in regard thereto, as original evidence. The general rule is, that the prisoner may give in evidence the character of the deceased for turbulence and violence. The rule contemplates only the general character in this regard, and particular acts of violence are not admissible: 4 Parkins\u2019 N. Y., 558; 12 Rich. S. C., 430; 1 Met., Ky., 370. This rule is founded on the plainest principles of justice; for the character of the deceased affords strong light in which to view the transactions. In cases particularly of self-defense, that the deceased was a man of riotous and disorderly conduct, of overbearing and passionate disposition, easily excited to quarrels, and notoriously reckless of the feelings and rights of others, would constitute an essential element for the consideration of the jury, to ascertain whether the prisoner acted under the influence of self-preservation or was actuated by malice in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">But the Judge below enlarged this general rule by permitting the State to prove the general character of the accused for violence, and also particular acts. The principle upon which we presume the Judge acted was deduced from the language used by this Court in 18th Georgia Reports, and in fact such was the argument of Mr. Harrison, the counsel who argued this case ably for the State. That language is substantially, \u201c that when the facts of the killing show <em>any doubt </em>as to whether the prisoner was actuated by the principle of self-preservation or malice, any testimony calculated to illustrate the motive to the jury would be proper.\u201d We have examined this question in its application to cases of homicide, but do not concur in the construction that the rule applies equally as the right of both \u00a1jar-ties. The prisoner may give in <em>any testimony </em>calculated to explain the motive under which he acted. He is the party charged, and the law presumes malice, from the fact of the killing, against him; and, to remove this presumption, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>evidence is admissible, when offered by him to explain the motives of his action. But specific acts are not thus admissible except so connected with the homicide or growing out of the causes which led to it, or so cotemporaneous with its occurrence as to form a link in the chain of circumstances by which the case is bound together. And if the character of the deceased for violence is put in issue by the evidence offered for the accused, then the right to rebut such evidence is invoked, as a matter of right; but only then, and not till then. A new trial was granted when proof of the violent temper of the prisoner was introduced by the government where it had not been put in issue by him : State <em>vs. </em>Merrill, 2 Der., 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u2022 Intimately associated in law with this principle is the ground of the second exceptions, founded upon the admission of evidence by the Court of the character of the deceased for peaceableness. We think it was inadmissible, and the Code, section 3704, does not change the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">When the State of Georgia charges the commission of crime against the citizen, it is incumbent on the State to prove the accusation and to rebut, by proper testimony, matters permitted to be given in evidence for the defense, but not, in the first instance, to repel the presumption of the defense before these are put in issue by proof. We, therefore, hold that the Court erred in its ruling upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The third ground of error is in the Court admitting the testimony of the witness, Carr, relative to what the deceased said to him touching the purpose with which the deceased took his axe to the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In the view we take of this case, this ground of error is not material; but as a matter of evidence was it properly admitted ? It may constitute a rule in other cases where its importance might Aveigli with significant influence on the verdicts of juries. The proposition is whether declarations of the deceased of peaceful intent, antecedent to the difficulty, connected with his taking a weapon or instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>with him, are admissible evidence for the State on trials for homicide. Nothing is more difficult than to lay down a general rule in cases of this character; the rules must, of necessity, bend with the weight of circumstances depending upon them. Accuracy of definition of what constitutes the <em>res gestee </em>is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In <em>Munroe vs. State, </em>5th Georgia Reports, 85, this Court has laid down the general rule as nearly and clearly as it can be reached by legal rules, and to which we may only add that, in matters involving the motives of parties, Courts should lean rather to admitting what may have even slight weight than in excluding light from the jury. Human action generally is inspired by some motive, which may lie on the surface and be suggested by the results, or may lie deeper and find its solution by some act or declaration preceding it; and what significance such acts or declarations bear to the main transactions rests in the judgment of the jury, whose duty it is to see its reasonableness of connection and importance, if it has any, in the influence of the conduct of the party, drawn from the whole and especially subsequent facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">2. The fourth error combines the principle of objection assigned in the fifth, and we will notice them together. It appears from the record in this case that a part of the evidence taken down on a former trial was offered in evidence for the purpose of showing the witness, Carr, had previously failed, on full examination, to give in evidence a material statement testified to in the then examination before the Court, and also to contradict the witness by the conflict in such previous and present examinations. The Court held that the evidence could not be admitted except such parts as the Judge presiding decided to be in conflict, and characterized such previous record evidence to be <em>hearsay. </em>It after-wards appears that the State put the whole in evidence without objection; but as a question of practice and principle we are called to adjudge the right to the admission of evidence as offered by the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We premise by saying, that evidence taken down by the Court on a previous trial, when properly proven, is not hearsay, but is entitled to the fullest consideration and weight as evidence; and it is the right of the defendant or State to offer it, under proper rule, to the jury,- either in whole or in part; if the whole is offered, to show the negative of something stated, not testified to on a former trial by the witness, and the character of the admission whether previously the subject matter was inquired about, and what was said at that time \u2014 or if a part is offered, then to read such part to the jury, who will apply it by their memory of what was then sworn to, and the question of conflict or its materiality, or its motive and effect, is for the jury and not for the Judge, under our system of evidence and practice. And, if upon the admission of such part or parts of the evidence as is thus given in, the State desires to offer the whole to explain or to rebut the parts previously given in by the prisoner, it is a right clearly recognized by the law for them to offer it, or <em>vice versa, </em>and read it to the jury, who must charge their minds with it and recollect it, as such testimony does not properly go out with the jury, but forms only a part of the general evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">3. The sixth ground is predicated upon the admission of evidence concerning a particular fact of bad feeling between the prisoner and the deceased. The fact proven was, that in October or November, 1866, the deceased spoke to the prisoner at the Sunday-school, and he did not answer him. The killing took place in February, 1867. Was this testimony admissible to show the <em>quo animo, </em>upon general principles? For we do not care to limit these questions to any particular specialties arising out of this case. In <em>Hatcher vs. The State, </em>18th Georgia Reports, 460, when there was a previous fight and continuing threats down to the transaction for which the prosecution was instituted, this Court held that it was necessary to commence and to go back by the connecting evidence to such previous difficulty, and this upon the principle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>accruing provocation at the time ignores the effect of antecedent acts of provocation or threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Dufree vs. The State, </em>33d Alabama, 380, proof of violence offered a servant of the prisoner, several weeks before the homicide, was not admitted. In <em>Newcomb vs. The State, </em>37th Mississippi, 383, the mere fact that the deceased severely beat the prisoner, six weeks before the killing, was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">And cases might be multiplied to this effect, excluding evidence for the defense of particular acts of violence; the rule being that there must be some particular intent to kill in the previous quarrel, and this only for the purpose of showing malice, as threats or other intent are admissible for that purpose. But, under our rulings, we may say \u201cthat this Court stands pledged, by its past history, for the abolition, to the extent of its power, of all exclusionary rules which may serve directly or remotely, to reflect light upon the transaction upon which they are called on to pass:\u201d <em>17th Georgia Reports, </em>460.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In <em>Dillon vs. The People, </em>8th Michigan, when the prisoner was absent eight or ten months preceding the homicide, evidence of the state of feeling between the prisoner and deceased was admitted. The Courts have not agreed upon the time dividing legal or illegal evidence, so far as its admissibility is permitted ip relation to acts between the parties preceding the.homicide, and no general rule can be distinctly traced over this disputed ground of judicial controversy. All we may assert, within the principles recognized, is, that there must be some link of association, something which draws together the preceding and subsequent acts, something which presents cause and effect in the transaction. If separate, distinct and independent, they ought to be excluded; for while every spark of light may be admitted, it must be struck out of the facts of the case, by bringing them together. As for illustration, if A and B had a previous difficulty, and A attempted to shoot B, and by interference, was prevented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>and the parties separated, and several months elapsed, and upon meeting A and B commence an attack, and either get killed, who was right or wrong in the previous difficulty is not material, and not to be considered by the jury; but the fact of the difficulty itself, showing the temper of the parties when they subsequently met, might lead the jury into a proper understanding of the acts of the relative parties and their conduct at that time. But the mere fact of not speaking, or slight personal difficulties, could only tend to embarrass the jury by introducing an element not connected with the case, and could only darken the counsels of the jury, if let in as an element for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Between these two illustrations lies the dividing line dependent on the facts of the case, under the proper guidance and control of the Court, keeping in mind, as a cardinal rule, connection of causes with the final act, if particular acts are offered. As if A, jealous of his wife, finds B with her, and forbids him speaking to her, and afterwards meets B and her together, though weeks and even months have elapsed, the previous difficulty, though slight, would be proper evidence to go to the jury in case of homicide. But if A afterwards met B, and upon new cause of quarrel, distinctly separate from the first, the difficulty sprang up, the acts relative to the first ought to be excluded as not throwing light upon the homicide, and the fact of unfriendly feelings existing, is all which yyould be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">4. The seventh ground of error is upon the charge of the Court. The Judge charged the 4266th section of the Code as applicable to this case, and qualified its application by the provisions in section 4267. In a word, the Court held that, \u201cif, after persuasion, remonstrance, or other gentle measures used to prevent a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another, it could not be prevented, the party attacked might kill the person so forcibly attacking, if it appeared that the killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>intended or might accrue to the person, property or family of the person killing (section 4266); and it must appear, in such case, that the danger was so urgent and pressing at the time of the killing, that in order to save his own life the killing of the other was absolutely necessary, and that the person killed was the assailant, or that the slayer had, really and in good faith, endeavored to decline any further struggle before the mortal blow was given \u201d: Section 4267. The Judge added that this last section applied to all <em>\u201cmurders.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The substance of the charge further was that the Court held section 4266 to apply to cases of violence of the person, and therefore added, \u201cIf the prisoner had said to deceased, \u2018If he came over the fence he would kill him, and he had gone over, he might\u2019 have been justified in killing him, if the jury believed the words uttered amounted to a persuasion, remonstrance or gentle measure, and provided such killing was absolutely necessary, while deceased was on the fence, as described, and before he had gotten over, and then stated such killing must have been done under the conditions in section 4267/\u201d He added, \u201cSection 4267 applies to all murders, including any that may be committed, eontemjfiated in section 4266.\u201d We may say at the outset of this question, that we differ with our brother below in his application of section 4266 to this case, under the facts, and in that section 4267 had any connection or application to section 4266, or a case where that section legitimately applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The facts of this case show Pound in a lane and deceased on the fence, in his own field, opposite. The evidence for defense claims that Pound stood a few yards from Carr, and deceased with his gun and Harrison with an axe. Pound said something to Carr about killing his dog. Carr did not reply. Pound then told Carr he had been sajdng he was a coward and would not fight, but if he believed he would not, come over the fence and try him. Carr said something not understood. Pound then said John Harrison, (deceased), a grand scamp, had been meddling himself about it. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ceased then said, \u201cI won\u2019t take that; you have done that that is unjust.\u201d When deceased said this, he was chopping with his axe on the fence. Then Pound said, \u201cDon\u2019t you come over here, if you do I will kill or shoot you.\u201d Deceased commenced getting over the fence, and, after giving him this warning, Pound shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">This, in brief, presents the question whether this act was within section 4266 of the Code. We think not. That section applies to cases where remonstrance or gentle means .fail to prevent a forcible attack on the habitation or property of another, and that it was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion or serious injury to the person, property or family, to kill the assailant. The whole section contemplates an attack upon the property or habitation of another, or to his person or his family, by an invasion of his rights of property, in the defense of which, after remonstrance, we may repel the force; for the attack must be forcible, and absolutely necessary, to justify taking life. The qualification of this section is apparent from its intent to justify the killing of one who forcibly invades the habitation or property of another, and who persists, after remonstrance with him, and qualifies section 4264, which gives permission to kill one who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony on either habitation, property or person. In the one case, as in burglary, robbery, or attempt to kill or maim, the law permits it without question, remonstrance, or other act. Such burglar, robber or felon, deserves death, and the law classes his killing with executions in advancement of public justice. If two or more tumultuously attempt to enter, the law permits instantaneous killing of such mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">But the law puts to the act one <em>proviso </em>(section 4265) that bare fear of the acts alleged, will not bring the party within the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Now section 4266 classes another line of defense after remonstrance. Such forcible attack may not comprehend fel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ouy, but serious injury; and the person mentioned in the section 4264, is again contemplated in section 4266 if his rights are forcibly attacked, and after remonstrance, the party persists in his forcible assault, and he cannot induce him to desist. The law does not contemplate his running away from him, and disgracing himself and family. When he is assaulted he has, in law, the right to stand against every assailant. Pie is not obliged to run ; he may warn off invasion ; he may say, \u201c I will shoot you if you approach forcibly to invade my habitation, or injure my property, or deprive me of it, or if you design a serious injury to myself,\u201d defending the same, and if the party persists in such forcible attack and invasion. The difference between the two illustrations from 4264 and 4266, is that in the one you may kill on sight, in the other you must first use gentle meaus to prevent the assault and invasion; but if the party keeps on forcibly to consummate his nefarious purpose, he forfeits his life to his assailant. And this law seems to be well founded in reason and justice. The peaceable and law-abiding are too often overrun by the rude violence of the reckless and unprincipled outlaw, and meet the outpourings of oaths and maledictions without resort to their natural and legal rights. If a man, q&gt;eacebly walking the streets, is assailed by one threatening to cowhide him, and remonstrates with him, declining combat, is he bound, because a cowhide is not a weapon likely to produce death, and therefore the attack is not a surprise or a felony, to go into mutual combat to justify the killing under section 4267 ? And is life not more sacred than property, and may it not, in such case, be defended, after remonstrance, with equal privileges ?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">5. We have heard this construction frequently given to the section 4266; and the use of the word person in the section has given some embarrassment in applying its provisions. Our opinion is, construing all the sections together, (and such is the proper mode of ariving at the correct conclusion,) that section 4266 applies only to the defense given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to the citizen in protecting his habitation, or property, or family, or himself, while in such place, from forcible attack. The Code eularges the class, for at common law the dwelling house only was within the privilege of such protection. Now, under the Code, the habitation, property, or family, are expressly within it. The section is, \u201c if after persuasion, remonstrance, or other gentle measures used, a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another cannot be prevented, it shall be justifiable homicide to kill the person forcibly attacking and invading the property or habitation of another. But it must appear that such killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was intended, or might accrue, to the person, property or family of the person killing.\u201d This applies to the right of defense growing out of an attack upon a man, or his property, or family, where they are at his home; the household gods, so to speak, are regarded with peculiar sanctity in the protection of the law. For life would be without object if home and family could be invaded and the father could not slay the invader. That right which Chatham boasted for the English citizen in his castle, has come down as an heritage of the common law, and is the same found in section 4266, enlarged in the language, though not changed in the effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">And the illustration given, if a man meets another and attempts to cowhide him, the assailed stands in his rights of self-defense on a different principle of the law; for while an assault may not amount to felony, yet if accompanied with such great personal indignity as arouses the party to kill, such justification of the act comes within section 4268: \u201cAnd all other instances which stand upon the same footing of reason and justice as those enumerated,\u201d etc. And the jury, under the facts-in the particular case, would be the judges; and, as we have said, the character of the deceased for violence is admitted to show the motive explanatory of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In the ease at bar, whether there was or was not an attempt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>to cross the fence, the facts did not bring the case within the section 4266 of the Code. If A, peaceably, in the discharge of his business, is attacked by B, who forcibly attempts an invasion of his habitation or property, or serious injury to them or him, and A remonstrates with B \u201c by soft words, turning away wrath,\u201d persuading him to desist, and A does not invite or provoke B, by mutual disposition, to quarrel or abuse of him, but stands under the shelter of the law, boldly, and B still follows up A, and, despising warning, rushes upon him, A may kill B, if in his defense of habitation, property or family. But if A commences the difficulty and pursues it, and, when B takes it up, gives him warning to desist or he will kill him, A has no right to fall back on the doctrine of remonstrance and persuasion, under section 4266.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We, therefore, say we differ with the Judge below in his application of section 4266 to this case, for the proof shows nowhere such remonstrance as carries the case within the rule. The case was one simply of Pound, being where he had a legal right to be, with bad feeling between him and Carr, protecting his property originally from \"interference by Carr\u2019s hogs. He had his gun with him, rightfully, on his plantation, to protect his premises. The deceased, a tenant of Carr\u2019s, with Carr\u2019s son, ran out to the scene, deceased carrying an axe at an untimely season, for it was late in the evening. Why go to where Pound was? Why follow him up and down the fence? Admitting they were on their own ground, their acts show that they were disposed not to shun any consequences that might arise. The two went together to the field. When they were coming, Pound\u2019s daughter goes to her father; his wife and son and little ones all gather around him. Why all this, if there was nothing in the approach, and the manner of the approach, to excite their apprehension ? A man may be deceived as to danger, but his wife and little ones grouping about him shows more to my mind than an ordinary act of deceased and Carr. I do not take the mere <em>words </em>of witnesses, but acts. And, while in this position, as I be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>lieve, both looking to a difficulty, Pound used language provocative of both Carr and Harrison. Harrison seemed, from the evidence, disinclined to take it, said he would not. And, if the physician\u2019s testimony is to be regarded, (and for myself, I must be permitted to express my very high appreciation of medical testimony; thousands of cases have depended on it for conviction, and I certainly give it full weight for the accused) as he said he would not take it, he was a very few feet from Pound, ascending the fence, axe in hand. If the jury believed this, the mere question for the jury was, whether he intended to strike Pound with the axe. It was for the jury to say whether he was going over the fence after saying \u201c he would not take it,\u201d meaning the words used by Pound. And if they so held, it seemed reasonable that he had the axe, inasmuch as Pound had his gun and gave warning he would shoot if he did come over. And, therefore, the law applicable to this case, upon the facts, was not under section 4266, but under the principles of self-defense and the exceptions of reasonable fears in his mind, if deceased succeeded in the attack then made. And we hold the Court erred in its charge, generally and specially, on the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">6. The next ground of error is the charge of the Court: <em>\u201c </em>If you believe Carr, the Court charges that the homicide set forth in the indictment is murder.\u201d This charge was error. The State had more witnesses than Carr. Out of their testimony arose many questions of fact, and to single out any witness by name and give this charge, where there was more than him, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">7. Again, we say it was error in the Court to compliment any witness in the case. Although the words used are not given, it appears, by the certificate of the Judge, that he complimented one of the witnesses for the State in the presence of the jury. Such act was improper in the Judge. The error, though unintentional, may have seriously affected and influenced the jury, and, as a practice, is liable to criticism, not commendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>8. There is another ground of error in this case, which we do not regard as needing any comment, and must express some surprise at its reaching this Court, except upon the principle that frequently the Judges below overrule motions for new trial with the purpose of letting this Court hear the arguments and dispose of the case. The fact certified to is, that the sheriff handed the jury, while in their room finding their verdict, loose papers, purporting to be evidence. What effect these papers may have had on the verdict is immaterial; the act was illegal, and the verdict found by such jury was illegal, and the refusal to grant a new trial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
