Jurisdiction in this matter is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 1334(3). This action was filed in this Court on April 6, 1976. A three-judge panel was constituted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. The case was submitted upon depositions and other documentary evidence on September 2, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">Plaintiff Joseph Alvin Tolbert is a truck driver from Montgomery, Alabama. He brings this action in his own behalf and on behalf of the class consisting of all persons whose Alabama driver\u2019s licenses have been or may be suspended without the licensees first receiving a hearing. Plaintiff also brings the action on behalf of a subclass of persons who have lost their licenses because of a recommendation of the Alabama Medical Advisory Board. The defendants in this case are variously connected with the suspension of driver\u2019s licenses by the State of Alabama. Defendant G. L. McGriff is the Chief of the Driver License Division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Department of Public Safety, which is charged with the enforcement of laws permitting suspension of licenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant E. C. Dothard is the Director of the Department of Public Safety. The Medical Advisory Board is a body, composed of physicians, that advises the department in certain suspension cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Section 68 of Title 36 of the Alabama Code authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to suspend a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license on the ground of incompetence to drive a motor vehicle without first affording the person a hearing. This category includes those who are medically incompetent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that such action violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They ask this Court to issue a declaratory judgment that such a procedure is unconstitutional, and to enjoin it. They further seek injunctive and declaratory relief against the practice of interrogating licensees without warning them of the possible use of any statements that they make and ask the Court to enjoin defendants from establishing or utilizing an anonymous Medical Advisory Board that makes judgments without giving notice or an opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The proposed class of all persons whose licenses have been suspended without a pre-suspension hearing fails for lack of the typicality of the representative, which is required by Rule 23(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, a class of all persons whose licenses have been or may be suspended for medical reasons would be proper. The proposed subclass of persons deprived of a driver\u2019s license by recommendation of the Medical Advisory Board is also proper. The typicality, commonality, and numerosity<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requirements of Rule 23 are met by this class. And the defendants have acted and propose to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Plaintiff Tolbert had brain surgery as a youth, and has been required to take the medications dilantin and valium since that time in order to avoid seizures. He can recall only one seizure during the past fifteen years, and that occurred during a period when he had ceased taking the medication. He maintains, without contradiction, that he has now resumed taking the drugs and has had no more difficulties in that regard. His Alabama driving record shows no seizure-related problems. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>receipt of an outside complaint, the Driver License Division began investigating Tol-bert as possibly unfit to continue driving. The investigation was conducted by Sergeant E. C. Fordham. On December 4, 1975, Sergeant Fordham conducted a tape-recorded interview with Tolbert, during which he questioned him about his medical problems. Tolbert misled Sergeant Ford-ham in this regard, denying that he took dilantin and valium.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At least two other persons were interviewed, and the results of the investigation were turned over to Lieutenant Coleman of the Driver License Division. A report was requested from plaintiff\u2019s doctor and given to Lieutenant Coleman <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as later an electroencephalogram was requested and provided. Lieutenant Coleman requested an opinion from the state Medical Advisory Board on Tolbert\u2019s case, and it gave an unfavorable recommendation. Thereafter, Lieutenant Coleman decided to suspend Tolbert\u2019s license, and he was so informed. He was not told of any opportunity to contest the decision. Other than the interview with Sergeant Fordham, Tolbert was not given the opportunity to present his side of the story. He was not called before Lieutenant Coleman or the Medical Review Board, whose members did not in fact even meet with each other. The evidence indicates that plaintiff Tolbert\u2019s experience is representative of the procedure followed with other members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The interest of the holder of a driver\u2019s license in keeping that license is one that is protected by due process. <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). That interest is particularly strong in this case, as plaintiff Tolbert lost his job as a truck driver because the suspension of his license prevented him from performing his duties. In <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bur-son, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cdue process requires that when a state seeks to terminate an interest such as that here involved, [a driver\u2019s license] it must afford \u2018notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case\u2019 <em>before </em>the termination becomes effective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 91 S.Ct. at 1591.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants rely principally on two theories to demonstrate that their discretionary suspension procedures do not violate the rule of <em>Bell. </em>They maintain that the interview that Sergeant Fordham had with Tolbert, and presumably any interview with other members of the plaintiff class, constituted the hearing that due process requires. Further, they submit that the administrative and judicial review of a suspension permitted by Section 68 of Title 36 are sufficient to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The \u201cformality and procedural requisites\u201d of a hearing can vary, <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 378, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) and they should be \u201cappropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). But an interview by an investigating officer can hardly be elevated to the level of a hearing. The Fifth Circuit distinguished between an investigation and a hearing in <em>Genuine Parts Co. v. FTC, </em>445 F.2d 1382 (5th Cir. 1971). It said \u201cthe purpose of an investigative proceeding conducted by an administrative agency \u2018is to discover and produce evidence not to prove a pending charge or complaint, but upon which to make one if, in the [agency\u2019s] judgment, the facts discovered should justify doing so\u2019. <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 501, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946). Id. at 1388.\u201d The court went on to say \u201cAn investigation discovers and produces evidence; an adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tion tests such evidence upon a record in an adversary proceeding before an independent hearing examines to determine whether it sustains whatever charges are based upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1388. The interview conducted by Sergeant Fordham appears to be an investigation in the classic sense, involving nothing more than Fordham asking Tol-bert some questions. No effort was made to confront Tolbert with any of the evidence against him. And the due process requirement of a hearing \u201cembraces not only the right to present evidence but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet them.\u201d <em>Morgan v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 776, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1937). In <em>Bell v. Burson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court cited <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) as presenting the standard of due process that applied in driver\u2019s license cases. <em>See Bell v. Burson, supra, </em>at 539, 541, and 542, 91 S.Ct. 1586. And <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>states that \u201cIn almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d 397 U.S. at 269, 90 S.Ct. at 1021. And quoting from <em>Greene v. McElroy, </em>360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959), it continued: \u201cCertain principles have remained relatively immutable in our jurisprudence. One of these is that where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government\u2019s case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has the opportunity to show that it is untrue.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 270, 90 S.Ct. at 1021. Tolbert\u2019s license was suspended largely on the basis of the reports of the Medical Advisory Board, yet Tolbert never saw those reports. Rather than confronting Tolbert with charges, the state simply tried to get information from him. The gathering of information simply does not, by itself, constitute a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The procedure followed in Tolbert\u2019s case is typical of that in all medical cases. Lieutenant Coleman referred to an interview of a licensee before the department had decided on a medical suspension as being part of the \u201cinvestigation,\u201d not as being a hearing. He further indicated that a licensee receives a hearing only if he requests one following notice of his suspension.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This clearly indicates that, at least prior to the announcement of the suspension, the licensee is not afforded a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The defendants maintain that the possibility of appealing the department\u2019s decision to suspend brings the state\u2019s procedure into conformity with the requirements of due process. Under Title 36, Section 68, a person whose license has been suspended may obtain a hearing within thirty days, and where the suspension is discretionary he may later obtain a <em>de novo </em>hearing in state court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under Alabama law, when a licensee files a petition for a <em>de novo </em>hearing in state court, the filing acts to vacate the order of suspension. <em>Ex parte State ex rel. L. B. Sullivan, </em>262 Ala. 188, 78 So.2d 322 (1955). Though administrative reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>dies must be exhausted before an appeal can be taken, <em>Ex parte State ex rel. Lyerly, </em>38 Ala.App. 630, 91 So.2d 233 (1956), Lieutenant Coleman testified that filing for a hearing with the Department of Public Safety was considered as staying a suspension. He further stated that suspensions were made effective as of a date later than notice of the suspension. Thus when a license was suspended, the licensee could request a hearing before the suspension took effect. This request would stay the suspension until the hearing was over, and then the licensee could petition for a <em>de novo </em>hearing in state court, which would also stay the suspension. He could, therefore, obtain a hearing before losing the right to drive. <em>Bell v. Burson, supra, </em>only requires a hearing before \u201cthe termination becomes effective,\u201d not before it is announced. And <em>Jennings v. Mahoney, </em>404 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 180, 30 L.Ed.2d 146 (1971), held that where a court order stayed a suspension until a hearing had been conducted, the right to a hearing had been satisfied. Therefore, defendants contend that their procedure was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">However, plaintiff Tolbert did not receive notice of his right to appeal the suspension of his license. And Lieutenant Coleman stated in his deposition that the form letter notifying a licensee of his right to appeal is not sent in cases involving medical problems.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the department\u2019s procedure in these cases still would not be constitutionally sound because due process requires notice as well as a hearing. <em>See Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, supra; Wisconsin v. Constaneau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971); <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, supra; Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). In instances where licenses are being suspended for medical and mental incompetence to drive, the licensees are not being afforded the hearing and notice that due process requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">There are at least two approaches that defendants can take to conform with constitutional requirements. They can, for example, institute hearings before a license is suspended. Another potential approach would be to give notice to a licensee before the suspension takes effect of the possibility of a <em>de novo </em>appeal, which would stay the suspension until'the appeal was concluded. Whatever procedure is adopted, it must give the licensee the opportunity for a full hearing before his right to drive on the public roads actually terminates, and he must be given adequate notice of this opportunity. An investigative interview will not satisfy the requirement of a hearing. The licensee must be apprised of the charge against him and confronted with the evidence which supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Additionally, in emergency situations, <em>Bell v. Burson, supra, </em>recognized that summary suspension may be appropriate. In view of the state\u2019s compelling interest in highway safety, an appropriate official of the Department of Public Safety may temporarily suspend a license without hearing if he has probable cause to believe that the driver presents an immediate threat to the lives of motorists and pedestrians, as more fully set forth in our opinion of contemporaneous date in <em>Smith v. McGriff, </em>434 F.Supp. 673 (D.C.Ala.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin defendants from interrogating licensees without warning them of the possible consequences. Elaborate procedural due process safeguards are not necessary in a civil investigation, as opposed to an adjudicative hearing. <em>Genuine Parts Co. </em>v. <em>F.T.C., </em>445 F.2d 1382 (5th Cir. 1971). Thus that portion of the requested relief is not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">An order will be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\">. Title 36, Section 58(56), Code of Alabama 1940 (Recomp.1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">. \u201cThe director of public safety is hereby authorized to suspend the license of a driver without preliminary hearing upon a showing by court records or other sufficient evidence that the licensee: Has been charged with an offense for which mandatory revocation of license is required upon conviction; is an habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle; is an habitual violator of the traffic laws; is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle; has permitted an unlawful or fraudulent use of such license; or has committed an offense in another state which if committed in this state would be grounds for suspension or revocation.\u201d Title 36, Section 68, Code of Alabama.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">. Plaintiffs also ask that the suspension of plaintiff Tolbert\u2019s license be lifted. However, his license has been restored, so that this request for relief is mooted. However, the defendants still maintain the propriety of the procedures by which Tolbert was deprived of his license. As his medical condition continues as before, he could still be deprived of his license in the same manner. Thus the case is still appropriate for declaratory and injunctive relief even without reference to the class action feature. <em>United States v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); <em>United States v. Richberg, </em>398 F.2d 523 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\">. Plaintiff Tolbert had his license suspended for medical reasons. This suspension was discretionary with the Director of the Department of Public Safety. The evidence in this case shows that there is a critical difference in the way that medical and non-medical discretionary suspensions are conducted. (In non-medical discretionary suspension, the licensee is informed of a right to <em>de novo </em>appeal, whereas in medical suspensions he is not.) Further, mandatory revocations of licenses are treated entirely differently by the state from any discretionary suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b744-14\">. During the period from October 1, 1974, to September 30, 1975, for example, 236 persons had their driver\u2019s licenses suspended for medical reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\">. Plaintiff explained that he made these incorrect statements because he feared that he would lose his license if he were candid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">. Dr. Poteet indicated that Tolbert was having no problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. An exception is made for \u201cemergency situations.\u201d <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 542, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). Defendants do not assert that this was an emergency and the fact that the state took at least four months to suspend the license and that plaintiffs Alabama driving record revealed no seizure-related difficulties indicates that such a position would be untenable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b746-4\">. This notice occurs during the period between when the decision is made by the department to suspend and when the suspension actually takes effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\">. .\u201cUpon suspending the license of any person as hereinbefore in this section authorized, the director of public safety shall immediately notify the licensee in writing and upon his request shall afford him an opportunity for a hearing as early as practical within not more than thirty days after public safety or his duly authorized agent, . . Any person denied a license or whose license has been cancelled, suspended or revoked by the director of public safety except where such cancellation or revocation is mandatory under the provisions of this article shall have the right to file a petition within thirty days thereafter for a hearing on the matter in the county court, circuit court or court of like jurisdiction in the county wherein such person resides, and such court is hereby vested with jurisdiction and it shall be its duty to set the matter for hearing upon thirty days\u2019 written notice to the director of public safety, and thereupon to take testimony and examine into the facts of the case and to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to a license or subject to suspension, cancellation, or revocation of license under the provision of this article.\u201d (1939, p. 300) Title 36, Section 68, Code of Alabama.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b747-12\">.
