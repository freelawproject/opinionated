Bar Counsel charged Respondent with engaging in \u201cprofessional misconduct\u201d within the scope of Maryland Rule 16-701(i)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> leading to a violation of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 8.4(b), (c), and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>arise from Respondent\u2019s felony theft conviction in the Circuit Court for Howard County. Felony theft is a \u201cserious crime\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Rule 16-701(k)(l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enabling Bar Counsel to file the Petition pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-751(a)(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 16-771(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On June 19, 2014, this Court issued an order instructing Respondent to show cause why he should not be suspended immediately from the practice of law in Maryland until further order of this Court. After receipt of the parties\u2019 respective responses to the Show Cause Order, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-771 (c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this Court issued an order on September 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>2014, suspending Respondent from the practice of law in the State of Maryland, effective immediately, pending further order of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Respondent appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals and on May 26, 2015, in an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed Respondent\u2019s conviction. <em>Sweitzer v. State, </em>No. 582, slip op. at 23, 2015 WL 5920319 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. May 26, 2015). On September 21, 2015, this Court denied Respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Sweitzer v. State, </em>445 Md. 7, 122 A.3d 976 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On January 29, 2016, Bar Counsel filed a Motion for Further Proceedings in this matter. On February 2, 2016, this Court transmitted the matter to the Circuit Court for Washington County and designated the Honorable Daniel P. Dwyer (the \u201chearing judge\u201d) to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The hearing judge held a hearing on June 29, 2016. Respondent did not attend the hearing. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Notwithstanding his absence from the hearing, Respondent has filed exceptions. Those exceptions, rather than challenging the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, generally attack the underlying criminal conviction, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion affirming the conviction, and this Court\u2019s denial of Respondent\u2019s certiorari petition. Respondent also filed a \u201cSecond Motion to Terminate Petition for Disciplinary Action, and/or to Disqualify Bar Counsel Glenn Grossman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Esq., Deputy Bar Counsel Raymond Hein, Esq., and Assistant Bar Counsel Marianne J. Lee, Esq.,\u201d which, in an order filed on September 14, 2016, this Court deferred pending oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"ajb-dedup-1\">We heard argument on November 3, 2016. Respondent did not appear at that hearing. Bar Counsel recommended disbarment as the appropriate sanction. We issued a per curiam order on November 4, 2016, disbarring Respondent immediately from the practice of law in the State of Maryland. We now explain the reasons for that order, including our decision to overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions and our conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). On December 2, 2016, Respondent filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider and Vacate Disbarment Order, to Reinstate and to Reset Oral Argument.\u201d For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hereby deny that motion. We hereby also deny Respondent\u2019s \u201cSecond Motion to Terminate Petition for Disciplinary Action, and/or to Disqualify Bar Counsel Glenn Grossman, Esq., Deputy Bar Counsel Raymond Hein, Esq., and Assistant Bar Counsel Marianne J. Lee, Esq,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A06V\">i-H</p>\n<p id=\"Aux\">\n<em>The Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Arq\">The hearing judge made the following findings of fact by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-757(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>2005. On February 13, 2013, Respondent was indicted on the theft of property of Dr. Allen Tsai of at least $10,000 but less than $100,000, which, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 7-104 (2009, 2012 Repl. Vol.), is a felony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Honorable Dennis Sweeney, Senior Judge, presided over the bench trial in the Circuit Court for Howard County, and, on October 7, 2013, found Respondent guilty of felony theft. The trial court relied on the following facts in reaching that decision, as later recounted in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In early 2011, Dr. Tsai hired Respondent to assist him in his claim for disability benefits from his insurer, Penn Mutual (the \u201cPenn Mutual Case\u201d). <em>Sweitzer, </em>slip op. at 2. Respondent agreed to the representation for a flat fee of $4,000, which Dr. Tsai paid. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Tsai\u2019s claim was premised on the medical opinion of Dr. Gerwin, who eventually reversed his medical opinion and concluded that Dr. Tsai was not totally disabled. <em>Id. </em>As a result, Respondent urged Dr. Tsai to settle the Penn Mutual case and pursue a possible claim against Dr. Gerwin. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Meanwhile, Nu Image, a film company, filed a copyright claim against Dr. Tsai, alleging that he illegally downloaded movies from the internet (the \u201cNu Image Case\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Respondent also represented Dr. Tsai in that matter for a flat fee of $1,000, which Dr. Tsai paid. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. When Respondent informed Dr. Tsai that Nu Image indicated its willingness to settle the case for $2,000, Dr. Tsai sent Respondent $2,000 to settle the case. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Respondent did not settle the case, nor did he return the $2,000 to Dr. Tsai. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Dr. Tsai employed another attorney to settle the Nu Image Case but was unable to recover his $2,000 from Respondent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In early 2012, Respondent informed Dr. Tsai that Penn Mutual would settle its case for $40,000-$50,000. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Eventually, Dr. Tsai agreed to settle for $54,000, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>settlement agreement was executed on May 21, 2012. <em>Id. </em>Per the terms of the settlement agreement, Penn Mutual sent Respondent the settlement funds. <em>Id. </em>The disbursement sheet Respondent sent to Dr. Tsai indicated that Dr. Tsai was to receive $54,881.93. <em>Id. </em>Over the following months, Dr. Tsai made \u201crepeated attempts to get his settlement proceeds\u201d from the Penn Mutual Case. <em>Id. </em>During that time, Respondent exhibited a \u201ccollection of excuses and [a] litany of impediments that allegedly prevented him from delivering Dr. Tsai\u2019s funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Respondent never paid Dr. Tsai the $54,881.93 in settlement proceeds from the Penn Mutual Case. <em>Id. </em>at 4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On April 28, 2014, the trial court, having found Respondent guilty of felony theft of property of at least $10,000 but less than $100,000, sentenced him to five years of incarceration, with all but one year suspended, to be followed by two years of supervised probation. The court ordered Respondent to pay restitution to Dr. Tsai in the amount of $57,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The hearing judge, relying upon Maryland Rule 16-771(g), found that Respondent\u2019s conviction of felony theft, affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, supplied \u201cconclusive evidence of his guilt of that crime.\u201d Maryland Rule 16-771(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajs-dedup-0\">Conclusive effect of final conviction of crime. In any proceeding under this Chapter, a final judgment of any court of record convicting an attorney of a crime, whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty, nolo contende-re, or a verdict after trial, is conclusive evidence of the guilt of the attorney of that crime. As used in this Rule, \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means a judgment as to which all rights to direct appellate review have been exhausted. The intrpduction of the judgment does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline should be imposed.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\n<em>The Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s theft conviction, coupled with the facts pertinent to that crime as discussed in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, established Respondent\u2019s violations of MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b) because \u201cit is beyond question\u201d that the act of theft constitutes a criminal act reflecting on Respondent\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law. The hearing judge quoted a portion of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 rejection of Respondent\u2019s claim that the conviction was not supported by legally sufficient evidence: \u201c[A] rational finder of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sweitzer willfully or knowingly exerted unauthorized control over [his client] Dr. Tsai\u2019s property (specifically, the Penn Mutual settlement and the funds to settle with Nu Image) and that he intended to deprive Dr. Tsai of that property.\u201d <em>Sweitzer, </em>slip op. at 10-11. The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c) because, as the Court of Special Appeals explained, there was \u201ccopious evidence that Sweitzer was lying to his client, stalling for time, and exploiting his client\u2019s friendship and sympathy,\u201d and Respondent \u201cintended to deprive his client of the property.\u201d <em>Sweitzer, </em>slip op. at 12. Finally, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) because a criminal conviction stemming from theft of client funds negatively impacts the image of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The hearing judge noted in his conclusion that, despite the opportunity for Respondent to introduce additional evidence in his disciplinary proceeding, Respondent \u201cfailed to avail himself of that opportunity by failing to appear at the June 29, 2016 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, no evidence has been presented that would mitigate Respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"ALK\">II</p>\n<p id=\"A58\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Page, </em>430 Md. 602, 626, 62 A.3d 163 (2013). If no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are filed, this Court may treat the facts as conclusively established. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 659-60, 984 A.2d 865 (2009). If exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are filed, we will not overrule the findings unless we are persuaded that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>435 Md. 84, 104, 76 A.3d 1198 (2013). This Court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 515, 979 A.2d 146 (2009). Accordingly, this Court must determine, based on a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof, whether sufficient evidence existed in the record to support the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 27, 45 A.3d 281 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"AjA\">hH 1\u2014i</p>\n<p id=\"A0s\">\n<em>Respondent s Exceptions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"a4o-dedup-0\">Bar Counsel did not file any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent has filed numerous exceptions, but does not specifically refer to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Instead, Respondent argues generally that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>from the outset because Judge Sweeney, who presided at the criminal trial, lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case, rendering the conviction \u201cvoid <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>Respondent argues that the criminal trial was \u201cnothing but an elaborate hoax: an unauthorized attorney disciplinary proceeding, couched forcibly and impermissibly within the context of a criminal trial, this Court having never conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court to make any foray whatsoever into fact-finding in attorney-client matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Respondent further argues that the appellate process \u201cappears to have been rigged,\u201d evidently viewing this Court\u2019s issuance of the Order of Suspension in the present disciplinary proceeding as \u201ctemporally-coordinated\u201d with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion affirming the underlying conviction. Respondent also argues that this Court \u201cabusively denied\u201d the petition for writ of certiorari. In a similar vein, Respondent charges the hearing judge in this disciplinary matter with having \u201cfailed to even address the subject matter jurisdictional issue.\u201d Respondent asserts that there was an impermissible \u201cblending\u201d of his criminal trial and attorney grievance matter. Respondent\u2019s arguments on this point include conflict of interest allegations. According to Respondent, the entire criminal trial constituted a conspiracy between the prosecution and the judiciary. Respondent also asserts that, because his motions to vacate both the criminal conviction and Bar Counsel\u2019s petition for disciplinary action went largely unopposed by the State and Bar Counsel, this Court should have granted the motions in Respondent\u2019s favor. Finally, Respondent asserts that he \u201cearned the fee in question in the underlying attorney/client controversy under the prevailing ABA standard, and neither the State nor Bar Counsel has proven otherwise, even under a clear and convincing evidentiary standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We shall treat Respondent\u2019s arguments as \u201cexceptions\u201d and overrule each of them. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s various arguments, there was no impermissible \u201cblending\u201d of the criminal and disciplinary matters. Maryland Rule 16-771(b) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon receiving and verifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>information from any source that an attorney has been convicted of a serious crime, Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals.\u201d Maryland Rule 16-751(a)(2) further provides: \u201cIf authorized by Rule 16-771(b) ..., Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals without prior approval of the Commission.\u201d The record shows that Bar Counsel complied with those provisions. Upon receipt of proof of the conviction, and following a show cause order, this Court may suspend the attorney pending a final disposition of the disciplinary or remedial action. Md. Rule 16-771(c). This Court\u2019s issuance of the Order of Suspension on September 22, 2014, complied with those procedures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We overrule as well Respondent\u2019s exception that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed at the outset because the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions rested on facts that underlay the verdict of Judge Sweeney, who had found Respondent guilty of theft of funds belonging to Dr. Tsai. In Respondent\u2019s view, Judge Sweeney did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Respondent\u2019s attorney/client relationship with Dr. Tsai. Respondent does not seem to be arguing that Judge Sweeney did not possess the subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the charge of felony theft, for such jurisdiction no doubt resides in the judges of Maryland\u2019s circuit courts. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 1-501 (1998, 2013 Repl. VoL). Rather, Respondent seems to argue that Judge Sweeney had no jurisdiction to decide facts that are within the purview of the attorney grievance process and, once Judge Sweeney wrongly decided the existence of such facts, the hearing judge could not rely upon the conviction as conclusive evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Respondent\u2019s having violated one or more rules of professional conduct. That argument is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Facts that give rise to an attorney\u2019s having been adjudicated guilty of a crime likewise can establish the attorney\u2019s having violated one or more of the rules of professional conduct. That is particularly so when the victim of the attorney\u2019s crime is or was the attorney\u2019s client. Maryland Rules 16-751 and 16-771 recognize and provide for the Commission and Bar Counsel\u2019s response to that situation. In the present case, those rules came into play once Respondent was convicted of felony theft. Thereafter, his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court denied certiorari review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At that point, the hearing judge was entitled to rely upon the final judgment of conviction as \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of Respondent\u2019s guilt of theft from his client, Dr. Tsai. Md. Rule 16-771 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">To the extent that Respondent\u2019s exceptions can also be understood to be an attack upon the merits of the underlying conviction, we overrule those exceptions as well. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 590, 837 A.2d 158 (2003) (\u201c[T]he integrity of a criminal conviction \u2018cannot be attacked in a disciplinary proceeding by invoking this Court to reweigh or to re-evaluate the respondent\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City v. Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 527, 340 A.2d 710 (1975)). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wingerter, </em>400 Md. 214, 230 n.11, 929 A.2d 47 (2007) (concluding that, although an attorney convicted of a crime may offer evidence that a sanction should not be imposed in an attorney grievance proceeding, \u201c[t]hat does not give license, however, to a respondent to prove that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>conviction was not justified and, on that basis, to argue for no sanction\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>The Rule Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We turn now to consider whether we agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). We have examined the record and, in our independent review of it, agree with the hearing judge that Respondent violated each of those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">MLRPC 8.4(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">MLRPC 8.4(b) provides that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d The hearing judge reasoned that Respondent\u2019s theft of monies belonging to his client, Dr. Tsai, constitutes a criminal act within the purview of MLRPC 8.4(b). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Respondent\u2019s conviction for theft of at least $10,000 but less than $100,000 in violation of \u00a7 7-104 is a felony and therefore constitutes a \u201cserious crime\u201d under Maryland Rule 16-701(k) warranting reciprocal discipline before this Court. \u00a7 7-104(g)(1)(ii); <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Eckel, </em>443 Md. 75, 88, 115 A.3d 142 (2015) (concluding that a conviction of a \u201cserious crime\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Rule 16-701(k) is a MLRPC 8.4(b) violation). This Court has routinely held that violations of MLRPC 8.4(b) follow criminal convictions. <em>See, e.g., Eckel, </em>443 Md. at 88-89, 115 A.3d 142 (holding that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b) following convictions of assault and related offenses); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nusbaum, </em>436 Md. 609, 614-15, 84 A.3d 98 (2014) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>(concluding that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b) following a conviction for illegal combination and conspiracy); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Black, </em>362 Md. 574, 579, 766 A.2d 119 (2001) (holding that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b) following a conviction for possession of cocaine). A violation is especially warranted here, where the theft involved client funds, compelling the conclusion that Respondent\u2019s conviction reflects poorly on his honesty and trustworthiness as a lawyer. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. 432, 453, 983 A.2d 477 (2009). Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">MLRPC 8.4(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">MLRPC 8.4(c) provides that \u201cit is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The hearing judge emphasized the evidence supporting Respondent\u2019s intent to deprive his client of the funds. As summarized by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion and restated by the hearing judge, there was \u201ccopious evidence\u201d of Respondent\u2019s lies and misrepresentations regarding the funds in question. <em>See Sweitzer, </em>slip op. at 12. It necessarily follows that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton, </em>444 Md. 163, 193, 118 A.3d 958 (2015) (\u201cWe have held consistently an attorney\u2019s intentional misappropriation of client funds violates MLRPC 8.4(c).\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 358, 974 A.2d 331 (2009) (concluding that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by keeping client funds without consent). Clear and convincing evidence supports Respondent\u2019s violation of MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">MLRPC 8.4(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">MLRPC 8.4(d) provides that \u201cit is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that the felony theft of client funds negatively impairs the public confidence in the legal profession. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>with the hearing judge. \u201cConduct which is likely to impair public confidence in the profession, impact the image of the legal profession and engender disrespect for the court is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d and falls within the purview of MLRPC 8.4(d). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brigerman, </em>441 Md. 23, 40, 105 A.3d 467 (2014) (citation omitted). Theft or misappropriation of client funds clearly constitutes such conduct, especially when coupled with the deceitful behavior Respondent exhibited in accomplishing the theft.

Hodes, </em>441 Md. 136, 204-05, 105 A.3d 533 (2014) (concluding that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by misappropriating client trust funds and, thereafter, falsely informing Bar Counsel that he had executed a guaranty in exchange for the funds); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Carithers, </em>421 Md. 28, 56, 25 A.3d 181 (2011) (\u201cThe intentional misappropriation of client funds is conduct which erodes public confidence in the legal profession, and such conduct also violates [Rule] 8.4(d).\u201d); <em>Gisriel, </em>409 Md. at 383-84, 974 A.2d 331. Respondent\u2019s conduct casts doubt on a client\u2019s ability to trust that his or her attorney will take the proper steps as a fiduciary to safeguard and return client funds. <em>See Gisriel, </em>409 Md. at 384, 974 A.2d 331 (concluding that an attorney\u2019s self-dealing involving misappropriation of client funds \u201cundermines public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law\u201d). Clear and convincing evidence establishes that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We turn now to the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. \u201cThe appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of the case before us.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Levin, </em>438 Md. 211, 228, 91 A.3d 1101 (2014). Bar Counsel recommends disbarment. In making that recommendation, Bar Counsel notes that Respondent did not appear before the hearing judge, nor this Court, for oral arguments, and has not offered any mitigating evidence. Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Counsel argues that, even absent a criminal conviction for Respondent\u2019s actions, disbarment would still be appropriate in the present case, as disbarment ordinarily follows from \u201can act infected with [such] deceit and dishonesty.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Prichard, </em>386 Md. 238, 248, 872 A.2d 81 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We agree with Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation. When an attorney \u201cengage[s] in dishonest and deceitful conduct for personal gain,\u201d this Court, absent compelling circumstances, ordinarily will impose the sanction of disbarment. <em>Levin, </em>438 Md. at 231-32, 91 A.3d 1101; <em>see also Nusbaum, </em>436 Md. at 616-17, 84 A.3d 98 (concluding that, unlike violations involving competence or diligence, intentionally dishonest conduct such as misappropriation of client funds is \u201cclosely entwined with the most important matters of basic character\u201d and is \u201cbeyond excuse,\u201d warranting disbarment) (citation omitted); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463 (2001) (\u201cDisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In the present case, Respondent exhibited intentionally dishonest behavior in committing theft against his client. Indeed, Respondent was convicted of felony theft of his client\u2019s funds, an act that was perpetuated by Respondent\u2019s falsehoods and misrepresentations made to his client. Despite having the opportunity to do so, Respondent did not present to the hearing judge any facts or circumstances that arguably would mitigate his conduct, let alone did he offer to the hearing judge or, for that matter, this Court, compelling circumstances that would lead us to impose a lesser sanction. Respondent\u2019s misconduct is deserving of the ultimate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we issued a per curiam order disbarring Respondent on November 4, 2016.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">.

Code Ann., Crim. \u00a7 7-104 (2009, 2012 Repl.

The record does not reflect whether, following our denial of the petition for writ of certiorari, Respondent sought further review of his conviction in the Supreme Court of the United States, and our research does not disclose any such filing. Respondent's theft conviction is, without doubt, a final judgment. <em>See </em>Md.
