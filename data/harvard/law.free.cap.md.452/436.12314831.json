Yuan, M.D. (\u201cDr. Yuan\u201d), challenges the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that there was no clear public policy mandate to support a claim for wrongful termination for reporting research misconduct in a federally funded project at Respondent institution Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (\u201cJHU\u201d), a scientific research institution. Dr. Yuan was a researcher employed by JHU. The suit arises from Dr. Yuan\u2019s allegation that he was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for his repeated protests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of research misconduct in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289b and 42 C.F.R. Part 93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We hold that these provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment. The self-regulating provisions direct the federally funded scientific institutions to provide procedures to investigate allegations of research misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.300-93.304. The scientific institution, not this Court, is in the best position and has the expertise to determine whether the research results of its employees amounted to impermissible research misconduct or permissible error or differences of opinion. Dr. Yuan did not follow the protocol outlined in JHU\u2019s policies for research misconduct claims. Further, Dr. Yuan acknowledged in his brief filed in this case that the regulations do not provide him with legal redress in the form of damages and he therefore seeks tort damages based on a theory of wrongful termination. However, there was no clear violation of the research misconduct regulations to warrant a cause of action for wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Dr. Yuan also alleged conversion because after the termination of his employment, he was denied access to stored research materials he had collected. However, JHU owned the research materials pursuant to its policy, and it is well settled that a party may not convert that which it owns. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Dr. Yuan alleged in a lengthy amended complaint the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Dr. Yuan was Board-certified in General Pediatrics and Pediatric Gastroenterology. He was employed by JHU as a researcher with the Pediatrics Faculty. In July 2001, he joined the lab of Dr. Jef Boeke (\u201cDr. Boeke\u201d), a Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the head of a yeast genetics lab. The lab was largely funded through the National Institute of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d), an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d). Between February 2002 and June 2011, the NIH provided over $11.8 million to the lab for research on the Synthetic Lethality Analyzed by Microarray (\u201cSLAM\u201d) project, which was an ambitious yeast genetics research project using a novel methodology, as well as a $34 million grant for a project related to the SLAM research. In Dr. Boeke\u2019s lab, Dr. Yuan was initially responsible for developing the computational infrastructure to manage the SLAM project\u2019s massive data-sets.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">When SLAM entered its Production phase, in 2004, Dr. Yuan discovered and reported to the Production team a concern that contaminating traces of DNA from preceding SLAM experiments had led to false positive results. However, the team resisted his concerns and suggestions for addressing the issue and instead began withholding data files from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Dr. Yuan stated that from 2005 through 2011, he repeatedly reported research misconduct concerning the yeast genetics research claiming that the SLAM researchers were falsifying the results. In particular, on November 28, 2005, Dr. Yuan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>emailed Dr. Boeke about issues he identified in research completed by Xuewen Pan (\u201cDr. Pan\u201d), a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Boeke\u2019s lab. Dr. Yuan stated that Dr. Pan\u2019s \u201cgenes are preselected,\u201d and that continuing with those research projects \u201cwill only generate more useless data.\u201d He also stated that the SLAM team had already established that \u201cmost of the [SLAM Project] hits being identified are bogus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Dr. Pan\u2019s research was published in a biomedical journal, <em>Cell, </em>with Dr. Boeke as the senior author in early 2006. Moreover, Dr. Boeke cited Dr. Pan\u2019s research when he applied for grant renewals through the NIH. After the NIH renewed the SLAM project funding in late 2006, Dr. Boeke issued a new organizational chart which had the effect of excluding Dr. Yuan from extensive involvement with the SLAM research. Dr. Yuan maintained that he protested his lack of a definite professional role in the SLAM Project and found himself increasingly marginalized and excluded from the data management.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Between 2006 and 2008, the SLAM research was unsuccessful; the lab did not have significant results to report to NIH. Dr. Boeke asked other researchers to review the SLAM project data, excluding Dr. Yuan. The researchers corroborated Dr. Yuan\u2019s findings and found that the data had an extraordinarily high \u201cFalse Discovery Rate.\u201d In the summer of 2008, Dr. Boeke decided not to renew the NIH grant for SLAM, although, some funding remained available to operate SLAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In January 2009, after analyzing Dr. Pan\u2019s microarray data from his <em>Cell </em>publication, Dr. Yuan determined that Dr. Pan could not have obtained the results he claimed. His conclusion was not that Dr. Pan fabricated the results; instead, Dr. Yuan asserted that Dr. Pan likely conducted the experiment with preconceptions of the results he wanted to find\u2014and then managed to find those results. Dr. Yuan also concluded similarly with respect to a paper published in 2008 by Dr. Yu-yi Lin (\u201cDr. Lin\u201d) in <em>Genes &amp; Development </em>In January of 2009, Dr. Yuan also notified both Dr. Boeke and SLAM\u2019s project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>manager, Dr. Meluh, of the problems with Dr. Pan\u2019s 2006 and Dr. Lin\u2019s 2008 papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Dr. Yuan was informed by Dr. Boeke in December 2009 that Dr. Boeke would not be renewing his faculty contract for 2011, unless he was able to secure self-sustaining funding within the next year. Dr, Boeke explained this was due to limited funding; however, at that time, Dr. Boeke established three new full-time positions with the SLAM Project for three other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Dr. Yuan again reported problems with SLAM research, in January 2010, at a lab seminar where he identified bizarre zigzag patterns after plotting data for individual genes in SLAM\u2019s Production data in chronological order. Dr. Yuan concluded that these zigzags were both non-random and unpredictable and were also large enough to masquerade as the genetic interactions that SLAM was looking for; thus, according to Dr. Yuan, attempts to interpret SLAM\u2019s data were doomed to fail. Further, during the last week of the NIH funding of SLAM, on June 29, 2010, Dr. Yuan wrote to Dr. Boeke that after analyzing the production team\u2019s last 118 experiments, he found about ten percent had \u201cnoise\u201d (bad data) with no apparent cause and only about ten percent \u201clooked pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In October 2010, two of the grant applications Dr. Yuan sought funding for had failed. Dr. Yuan asserted that Dr. Boeke falsely conveyed to him that there was no available funding to support him. On December 14, 2010, Dr. Carol Greider (\u201cDr. Greider\u201d), the director of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, offered Dr. Yuan a part-time support staff position for the 2011 year to expire at the end of that year. The salary was $24,800, well below his salary as a researcher. Dr. Yuan accepted the employment contract; however, from January 2011 forward, Dr. Boeke excluded Dr. Yuan from lab activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On April 29,2011, Dr. Lin held a seminar in Dr, Boeke\u2019s lab. Dr. Yuan alleged that the data results were inaccurate because when he asked Dr. Lin several questions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>research neither Dr. Lin nor Dr. Boeke could provide adequate responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Further issues arose when on June 29, 2011, Dr. Yuan submitted a publication and listed himself as the sole author. Dr, Boeke asked Dr. Greider to issue a written reprimand to Dr. Yuan for failing to offer Dr. Boeke shared authorship of the published manuscript. Dr. Greider issued a reprimand to Dr, Yuan. This led to Dr. Yuan meeting with Joan Johnson, a human resources representative for JHU School of Medicine, on July 8, 2011, to discuss Dr. Yuan\u2019s concerns about Dr. Greider\u2019s reprimand. Dr. Yuan also initiated JHU\u2019s Grievance Appeals Process. He explained that his employment problems arose over the context of results produced in the lab, and that there was an inexplicable vehemence that Dr. Boeke and Dr. Greider exhibited towards him. JHU denied Dr. Yuan\u2019s grievance appeal on December 22, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Dr. Yuan\u2019s employment contract was set to end on December 81, 2011. Prior to his end date, he requested a property pass from Dr. Boeke, which would allow him to move his research collection of archived cells out of the lab. Dr. Boeke refused to provide him the pass until they could come to an understanding of all the issues relating to which files and materials Dr. Yuan could take.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On November 30, 2011, Dr. Yuan requested an affidavit or other confirmation that Dr. Boeke would give Dr. Yuan access to Dr, Yuan\u2019s archived cells for five years. According to Dr. Yuan, Dr, Boeke initially accepted this request, but later failed to mention the matter in any correspondence between Dr. Yuan, Dr, Boeke, and JHU. Later, JHU declined to provide such access. On December 15, Dr. Yuan went to JHU to seek access to his materials and was escorted from the workplace by JHU Security Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">After Dr. Yuan\u2019s employment contract with JHU had expired, in early 2012, a \u201cLetter\u201d (equivalent to a research paper) was published in a scientific research journal, <em>Nature, </em>with Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke named as the authors. After reviewing the publication, Dr, Yuan believed there were seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ous conceptual errors in the paper. He concluded that the underlying data was not reproducible. Dr. Yuan\u2019s counsel, on May 14, 2012, told Ronald J. Daniels, the president of JHU, and Edward D. Miller, the president of the School of Medicine, about these \u201cserious scientific problems\u201d in the publication. Patricia L. McClean, JHU senior associate general counsel, responded on May 21, 2012 stating that, \u201c[t]he School of Medicine is looking into the allegations of research misconduct made in your letter under its Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct.\u201d No one from JHU, however, sought further information from Dr. Yuan nor contacted him regarding the <em>Nature </em>paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On July 24, 2012, Dr. Yuan submitted a \u201crebuttal analysis\u201d to Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke about the <em>Nature </em>article for submission to <em>Nature. </em>Dr. Yuan requested that both Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke respond. A response was due on August 7, 2012. Neither doctor responded. On August 8, 2012, someone emailed Dr. Yuan, using Dr. Lin\u2019s account stating, \u201cDr. Yuan, Yu-yi [Dr. Lin] passed away this morning. Now you must be very satisfied with your success. Congratulations[.]\u201d The death appeared to be a suicide as news accounts in Taiwanese media made clear that Dr. Lin had died in his lab from a self-administered overdose of sedatives. Moreover, the media reported he had attempted to jump off a building the previous evening. His wife stated that Dr. Lin was concerned about a \u201cconduct-of-research\u201d case and had trouble sleeping from the pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Dr. Yuan received an email from Dr. Boeke on February 11, 2013, asking if he would sign a \u201ccorrection\u201d that was prepared for the 2006 <em>Cell </em>paper. \u201cThe gist of the correction was that the fraction of genetic interactions that could be traced back to the paper\u2019s SLAM-based microarray data was 75[%], not 90[%] as originally stated.\u201d Dr. Yuan responded to Dr. Boeke that he would not sign a correction, but Dr. Boeke still submitted them to <em>Cell, </em>which published it as an \u201cErratum\u201d on May 23, 2013. On November 6, 2013, the <em>Nature </em>paper was also retracted. There was no \u201ccorrection.\u201d Dr. Boeke admitted that \u201cthe Methods section in our Letter is inaccurate, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>for 38% of the interactions found by the primary screen there was discordance in sign,\u201d which was consistent with Dr. Yuan\u2019s findings. Dr. Yuan implies that this acknowledgment of incorrect data indicates that research misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">On December 13, 2013, Dr. Yuan filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a complaint for damages against JHU. He alleged wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Dr. Yuan based this wrongful discharge action on 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.100-93.104, which provides that DHHS, including NIH, must investigate and punish intentional, knowing, or reckless \u201cresearch misconduct\u201d that represents \u201ca significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community.\u201d The regulations direct the federally funded institutions to provide procedures to investigate misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.300-93.304. \u201cResearch misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.103. Dr, Yuan also brought claims for conversion and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. JHU filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment and a request for a hearing. On May 12, 2014, the Circuit Court held a hearing and granted JHU\u2019s motion to dismiss because Dr. Yuan failed to identify a public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Judge Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, for the Circuit Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">There certainly are ample allegations that Dr. Yuan raised and continued to raise issues within his lab with Dr. Boeke and with others about the conclusion being reached by the research, [and] the manner in which the research was conducted. But the allegations very carefully skirt the line of fraud, falsification of data or manipulation of data. And it is a good illustration of why this tort needs to be drawn narrowly [so] that it does not amount to the opportunity for courts to litigate debates, intellectual debates within the scientific community about methodology or research methods or conclusions. Based on the allegations, even giving them full credit, until after Dr. Yuan was fired, his objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tions amounted to those types of intellectual debates and challenges within the lab.... \u201c[W]hile there\u2019s not [sic] question that academic integrity and research integrity is an important value, I conclude that it does not rise to the level that the Court of Appeals would recognize as the clear public policy necessary to support [a] cause of action for the tort of wrongful discharge in Maryland. \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The Circuit Court also rejected the conversion claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Y\">[Although it may be that there is a policy at Johns Hopkins University to on a case-by-case basis allow research material or research data to be released for the individual or non-Hopkins use by researchers who have developed it at Hopkins, the basic policy, which is clearly stated and has not been challenged here, is that Hopkins asserts its ownership of all research material and all research data that has been developed within labs of the University.... Hopkins could not have converted what it in fact had ownership of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Dr. Yuan filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Yuan v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>227 Md.App. 554, 135 A.3d 519 (2016). The intermediate appellate court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">[T]hat the broad language and complex nature of these federal provisions, their deference to institutions, such as Hopkins, for the prevention and detection of research misconduct, and the difficult line they draw between scientific errors and wrongdoing and between falsity and fraud, make this a poor State public policy vehicle to carry a wrongful discharge action. Because the Circuit Court for Baltimore City did not err in rejecting this claim and others advanced by Yuan, we affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>Yuan, </em>227 Md.App. at 558, 135 A.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Dr. Yuan filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court. We granted the Petition for Certiorari to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in precluding Md. employees from bringing wrongful termination claims based on retaliation for reporting research misconduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>by refusing to recognize the federal law prohibiting research misconduct as a public policy basis, contrary to this Court\u2019s recognition of wrongful termination claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALW\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in precluding Md. employees from bringing conversion claims based on the employer\u2019s conversion of the employee\u2019s personal research materials, by improperly drawing inferences in favor of Respondent when it interpreted Respondent\u2019s research materials policy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>Yuan v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>449 Md. 412, 144 A.3d 706 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We hold that the provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment. The self-regulating provisions direct the federally funded scientific institutions to provide procedures to investigate allegations of research misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation. Dr. Yuan did not follow the protocols outlined in JHU\u2019s policies for such claims. Although Dr. Yuan is correct that the federal regulations do not provide him a legal remedy and damages because the public policy he is alleging is not clearly discernible, there is no basis to support a claim for wrongful termination and tort damages. Dr. Yuan was not wrongfully terminated and his at-will employment came to an end due to the expiration of his employment contract. Moreover, Dr. Yuan\u2019s allegation of conversion must fail because JHU owned the research materials pursuant to its stated policies. Accordingly, JHU, as a matter of law, cannot convert property that it already owns.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">On appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>i.e., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. We must conf\u00edne our review of the universe of \u201cfacts\u201d pertinent to the court\u2019s analysis of the motion to the four comers of the complaint and its incorporated supporting exhibits, if any. The well-pleaded facts setting forth the cause of action must be pleaded with sufficient specificity; bald assertions and conclusory statements by the pleader will not suffice. Our goal, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of dismissal, is to determine whether the court was legally correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Parks v. Alpharma, Inc., </em>421 Md. 59, 72, 25 A.3d 200, 207 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Moreover, the interpretation of a statute or regulation requires reviewing the decision of the Circuit Court <em>de novo. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 181, 909 A.2d 694, 699 (2006) (\u201cThe resolution of these issues [by the Court] requires statutory interpretation. Interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and, therefore, we review the decision of the Circuit Court <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AmSO\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Dr. Yuan contends this Court should hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in upholding the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Dr. Yuan\u2019s claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, when both courts below refused to recognize the federal statutes and regulations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289b and 42 C.F.R. Part 93, that prohibit research misconduct as sources of public policy. Further, according to Dr. Yuan, the intermediate appellate court erred in upholding the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of his conversion claim. Dr. Yuan states either (a) JHU\u2019s policy expressly recognizes his entitlement to possession of the research cell lines he created, or, in the alternative, (b) JHU\u2019s policy is ambiguous on Dr. Yuan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>entitlement to those cell lines and further discovery is thus necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">JHU, however, contends Dr. Yuan\u2019s claim for wrongful termination fails because the regulations related to research misconduct are too vague and variable to give rise to a clear public policy of Maryland supporting a claim for wrongful termination under the circumstances. According to JHU, sound public policy should promote debate among researchers, protecting this process from the specter of jury adjudication and damages, rather than impose a wrongful discharge penalty for unfettered discussion. In addition, JHU maintains that Dr. Yuan does not own the materials which he claims JHU took from him and, as a matter of law, JHU cannot convert what it already owns.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Wrongful Termination Claims Based on Public Policy of Retaliation for Reporting Research Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201cThe common law rule, applicable in Maryland, is that an employment contract of indefinite duration, that is, at will, can be legally terminated at the pleasure of either party at any time.\u201d <em>Adler v. Am. Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 35, 432 A.2d 464, 467 (1981). \u201cThe doctrine was bom during a laissez-faire period in our country\u2019s history, when personal freedom to contract or to engage in a business enterprise was considered to be of primary importance.\u201d <em>Suburban Hosp., Inc. v. Dwiggins, </em>324 Md. 294, 303, 596 A.2d 1069, 1073 (1991). However, there are limitations to the at-will employment doctrine. This Court has recognized the competing interests in at-will employment including the employer\u2019s interest in terminating an employee without reason and an employee\u2019s and society\u2019s interest in ensuring employees are not terminated in violation of public policies. <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 42, 432 A.2d at 470. According to Maryland law, there is a public policy exception to the at-will employment rule for wrongful termination \u201cwhen the motivation for the discharge contravenes some clear mandate of public policy!.]\u201d <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 47, 432 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>[F]ew courts have flatly rejected the notion that the wrongful discharge of an at will employee may give rise to a cause of action for damages.

This Court adopted the reasoning of <em>Szaller v. American Nat\u2019l Red Cross, </em>293 F.3d 148 (4th Cir. 2002), in <em>Parks v. Alpharma, Inc,, </em>421 Md. 59, 25 A.3d 200 (2011) (holding that the FDA\u2019s regulations which an employee reported that the employer allegedly violated was not sufficiently clear to provide the basis for her wrongful discharge claim). <em>See also Adler, </em>291 Md. at 43, 432 A.2d at 471 (holding that Maryland\u2019s corporate fraud law did not clearly explain what the employer was legally bound to perform, or refrain from performing; thus, the employee\u2019s complaint that he had been retaliated against for reporting employer\u2019s fraud did not raise a clear wrongful discharge action). This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">If a court were to announce that the FDA\u2019s regulations were all sources of Maryland public policy, an employee could immunize himself against adverse employment action <em>simply by reporting an alleged violation of any regulation. </em>And the narrow wrongful discharge exception, carefully carved out by the Maryland courts, would then supplant the general at will employment rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 86-87, 25 A.3d at 216 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">This Court, in <em>Parks, </em>set forth \u201climitations on a court\u2019s ability to articulate a new public policy mandate\u201d to establish wrongful termination. <em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 79, 25 A.3d at 212, A court must look to the \u201caccepted purpose behind recognizing the tort in the first place: to provide a remedy for an otherwise unremedied violation of policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).

On the other hand, where a statute already has its own remedy, \u201callowing full tort damages to be claimed in the name of vindicating the statutory public policy goals upsets the balance between right and remedy struck by the Legislature in establishing the very policy relied upon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, Dr. Yuan has noted that the federal regulations do not authorize damages against JHU and he therefore seeks tort damages based on a theory of wrongful termination. Under the circumstances, however, there was no clear violation of the research misconduct regulations to warrant a cause of action for wrongful termination. There is no clearly discernible public policy to support Dr. Yuan\u2019s claim of wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Even where there is an unremedied violation of public policy, the second limitation is that the subject policy must \u201cbe reasonably discernible from prescribed constitutional or statutory mandates.\u201d <em>Wholey, </em>370 Md. at 53, 803 A.2d at 491 (citations omitted). The Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court, in the case at bar, relied on <em>Parks, </em>as controlling this determination. The Court of Special Appeals noted that in <em>Parks, </em>this Court held that overly broad federal regulations could not form the basis for a wrongful discharge claim; specificity is important when relying on a statute or regulation. Moreover, although accepting as a general matter that federal laws and regulations could form the basis for a wrongful termination claim in Maryland, the <em>Parks </em>Court determined that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Federal Drug Administration (FDA) regulations lacked \u201cthe specificity of public policy that we have required to support a wrongful discharge claim.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 83, 86, 25 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>202-03, 215 (\u201cThe regulation at issue provides the FDA\u2019s standard for what details must be included on a prescription drug label if there is \u2018reasonable evidence\u2019 that a particular drug has a \u2018clinically significant hazard.\u2019 What is not clear from the regulation is the specific public policy mandate that [the employer] Alpharma allegedly violated to support the instant wrongful discharge claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">To be specific, <em>Parks </em>involved a FDA regulation (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57(c)(6)(i)) which provided that pharmaceutical companies must label drugs to notify customers of any \u201cclinically significant hazard.\u201d 421 Md. at 70, 25 A.3d at 206. The employee, Parks, was allegedly fired for reporting her employer\u2019s, Alpharma\u2019s, violation of the regulation. <em>Id. </em>However, this Court refused to recognize the FDA regulation as a source of Maryland public policy for which an employee could base its wrongful termination suit. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">The regulation at issue provides the FDA\u2019s standard for what details must be included on a prescription drug label if there is \u2018reasonable evidence\u2019 that a particular drug has a \u2018clinically significant hazard.\u2019 What is not clear from the regulation is the specific public policy mandate that Alphar-ma allegedly violated to support the instant wrongful discharge claim. Under such circumstances, we are left with only our own discernment to determine whether the behavior Ms. [Parks] alleges constituted non-compliance by Alp-harma, a judgment we abjure, absent a clear, unmistakable signal in the law.... [I]f we were to recognize a mandate in the FDA\u2019s labeling standard, we are at a loss for articulating precisely what the contours of that mandate would be. For all of the reasons stated, we conclude that Ms. Parks has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for wrongful discharge, and therefore, affirm the decision of the Circuit Court. The public policy that Ms. Parks alleged Alpharma violated was not sufficiently clear to provide the basis for her wrongful discharge claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 86-87, 25 A.3d at 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The circumstances in <em>Parks </em>are similar to those in the case at bar. Pursuant to the federal regulations, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>researchers can be found to have engaged in research misconduct when they violate scientific research norms. However, a violation of the scientific norms is not a sufficiently clear public policy to serve as the basis for a claim of wrongful discharge. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.104. <em>See also U.S. ex rel. Milam v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., </em>912 F.Supp. 868, 889 (D. Md. 1995) (\u201cThe Court finds that it would be an unconscionable intrusion of law into academia to force a jury to decide whether [researchers] should have informed NIH of [non-supportive] results sooner than [they did].\u201d). Not unlike in <em>Parks, </em>where the determination of a violation of the regulations was vested with federal agencies, here, the self-regulating provisions contained in the federal regulations direct the federally funded institutions to address allegations of research misconduct, to determine if research misconduct took place, and to address retaliation and whistleblower claims. The scientific institution, not this Court, is in the best position and has the expertise to determine whether the research results of its employees amounted to impermissible research misconduct or permissible error or differences of opinion. As we stated in <em>Parks, </em>the research misconduct regulations lack specificity as to what constitutes a violation and thus we are at a loss to determine what the contours of a wrongful termination claim based on reporting research misconduct would be. We hold that these provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289b and the regulations of 42 C.F.R. Part 93 indicate that federally funded scientific institutions are in place to detect and prevent research misconduct that involves Public Health Service (\u201cPHS\u201d) funding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289b requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations to define and prevent \u201cresearch misconduct\u201d and protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The regulations adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services declare, relevant to the case at bar, \u201cresearch misconduct\u201d is defined as \u201cfabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.103.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">(a) Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">(b) Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">(c) Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person\u2019s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(d) Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\"><em>Id. </em>The regulation notes that errors or differences of opinion do not constitute research misconduct. 42 C.F.R. 93.103(d). Similar to the facts in <em>Parks, </em>the regulations are not sufficiently clear and specific for a court to determine whether research misconduct occurred. To show that there was a violation of the regulations, Dr. Yuan indicates that the results were falsified because Dr. Boeke issued a correction to the 2006 Lin paper (stating 75%, instead of 90%, of the reported genetic interactions were supported by the data) and he retracted the 2008 Pan paper. Simply because the researchers were incorrect or erroneous in their findings does not equate to falsifying or fabricating evidence. Thus, such determinations are best made by the institution receiving the federal funding and not by a court. In the case at bar, we can only determine that there was no clear violation of the research misconduct regulations to warrant a cause of action for wrongful termination. Moreover, before a finding of research misconduct can be made, federal regulations require that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">(a) There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">(b) The misconduct be committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">(c) The allegation be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.104. Institutions which receive federal funds have the primary duty to report and respond to such research misconduct. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.300(b), (d) (\u201cInstitutions under this part must ... (b) Respond to each allegation of research misconduct for which the institution is responsible under this part in a thorough, competent, objective and fair manner, including precautions to ensure that individuals responsible for carrying out any part of the research misconduct proceeding do not have unresolved personal, professional or financial conflicts of interest with the complainant, respondent or witnesses ... (d) Take all reasonable and practical steps to protect the positions and reputations of good faith complainants, witnesses and committee members and protect them from retaliation by respondents and other institutional members\u201d). The institutions are best situated and have the expertise to address the allegations of research misconduct through self-enforcement. Further, these self-regulating provisions direct federally funded institutions to provide procedures to investigate misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.300-93.304.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">[RJesearch institutions are left to set their own policies for, and conduct their own investigations of, the wide-ranging category of \u2018questionable research practices\u2019 and all cases of negligent misconduct. This deference to self-enforcement, embedded in the federal definition of research misconduct, is a defining trait of the oversight scheme for federally funded research generally[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Patrick O\u2019Leary, <em>Policing Research Misconduct, </em>25 Alb. L.J. Sci. &amp; Tech. 39, 50 (2015) (footnotes omitted). \u201cAs for defining research misconduct as a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community, this presents both difficult line drawing problems and ... the possibility of holding similarly situated individuals to disparate standards.\u201d 25 Alb. L.J. Sci. <em>&amp; </em>Tech. at 79. O\u2019Leary observes that the problem with resolving research misconduct allegations through the judiciary, \u201cwhether through civil litigation or criminal prosecutions, is that determinations of misconduct in this area frequently require a sophisticated understanding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>scientific methods and principles that courts and juries rarely possess and are often badly positioned to obtain, even with assistance from expert witnesses.\u201d 25 Alb. L.J. Sci. <em>&amp; </em>Tech. at 71. Thus, we cannot say that the public policy allegedly violated by JHU is sufficiently clear to provide the basis for Dr. Yuan\u2019s wrongful discharge claim and JHU appears to be in a much better position to address research misconduct, consistent with its internal policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In fact, JHU had such procedures in place as reflected in its \u201cProcedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct\u201d document. <em>See 42 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 93.300(d) and JHU Research Misconduct Procedures at Section II, JHU\u2019s Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct provide that an employee who \u201csuspects that research misconduct has occurred has an obligation to report that suspicion to the director of the department or division affected, or to the Dean of the School of Medicine.\u201d Dr. Yuan did not report that he believed he was fired in retaliation for reporting alleged research misconduct according to the procedures in place. He directed his complaints about the SLAM data and experiments to other researchers in the lab in which he and Dr. Boeke worked. Dr. Boeke, a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the head of a yeast genetics lab, and the other researchers were the same individuals who Dr. Yuan accused of the misconduct and did not fall into the category of the Dean of the School of Medicine or directors of the department affected. Furthermore, Dr. Greider was the director of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. Dr. Yuan, however, does not state in his complaint that he reported allegations of research misconduct to her. Moreover, wrongful discharge requires termination by the employer. Here, Dr. Yuan\u2019s employment contract simply expired; he was not wrongfully terminated in violation of a clear and specific public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Furthermore, Congress has explicitly vested broad authority in the scientific institutions to determine how to address retaliation and whistleblowers. The Secretary of HHS even proposed regulations which would allow relief to whistleblow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ers and would require a federally funded organization to deal with these retaliation claims by providing an administrative hearing where they could recover money damages. Public Health Service Standards for the Protection of Research Misconduct Whistleblowers, 65 Fed. Reg. 70,830, 70,839 at \u00a7 94.445 (proposed Nov. 28, 2000) (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. pt. 94). However, these regulations were not adopted and were, in fact, withdrawn. Office of Mgmt. <em>&amp; </em>Budget, Exec. Office Of The President, RIN: 0937-AA03, Public Health Service Standards For The Protection Of Research Misconduct Whistleblowers (2011). Thus, the federal research misconduct scheme does not create a legal remedy, granting employees damages, for retaliation for reporting research misconduct. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for this Court to step in and recognize a public policy against research misconduct in order to grant tort damages to complaining employees. In view of the research misconduct regulatory scheme, as O\u2019Leary observes, the federal regulations show \u201ca long tradition of government deference to the norms and integrity of the academy,\u201d 25 Alb. L. J. Sci. &amp; Tech. at 90, and a \u201cdeferential attitude favoring scientific self-regulation of research,\u201d 25 Alb. L.J. Sci. &amp; Tech. at 72. As the Court of Specials pointed out \u201c[a] broader remedy, such as damages, for research misconduct would invite judicial intrusion into the norms of the academy. [Accordingly, t]his may be one reason why Congress did not expressly create a damage remedy for research misconduct.\u201d 227 Md.App. at 576, 135 A.3d at 532 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from cases where this Court has recognized the tort of wrongful termination because in those cases the public policy was sufficiently clear to establish the basis for the employee\u2019s wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We have recognized a wrongful termination claim where an employee refuses to engage in unlawful conduct and is terminated as a result. <em>See Insignia Residential Corp. v. Ashton, </em>359 Md. 560, 573, 755 A.2d 1080, 1087 (2000) (holding that the employee\u2019s termination because she refused sexual advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>from her employer violated a clear public policy against prostitution).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">The statute precluding prostitution and attempts to induce or coerce women and men into engaging in prostitution represents a clear mandate of public policy that is violated when an at-will employee is discharged for refusing to engage in conduct that would constitute prostitution (or lewdness or assignation, which is also prohibited by \u00a7 15 of Article 27). The fact that both the inducements themselves and a discharge for rejecting them may constitute a violation of the Federal and State employment discrimination laws does not require that we ignore that such conduct also violates the entirely separate, independently based, public policy embodied in \u00a7 15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>Ashton, </em>359 Md. at 573, 755 A.2d at 1087. <em>See also Magee v.

In the case at bar, Dr. Yuan was not terminated for refusing to engage in clearly unlawful conduct. Dr. Yuan merely alleges that he complained about incorrect research results which he believed amounted to research misconduct and was terminated as a result of his complaints. Whether or not there was research misconduct is not a question to be determined by the courts. That determination is left to the sound discretion of the research entities involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Court of Special Appeals has also recognized the tort of wrongful termination when an employee was fired for performing affirmative legal duties that the employee was required to perform by law. <em>Bleich v. Florence Crittenton Servs. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>98 Md.App. 123, 140, 632 A.2d 463, 471 (1993) (holding that employee teacher had a duty under the law to report matters involving abuse of children, but was wrongfully terminated when she reported suspected abuse). In contrast, JHU, a federally funded institution, is responsible, under federal regulations, for conducting an investigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>research misconduct after Dr. Yuan, the employee, brought his allegations to JHU\u2019s attention in accordance with their policies. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.300 (\u201cInstitutions under this part must ... (b) Respond to each allegation of research misconduct for which the institution is responsible under this part in a thorough, competent, objective and fair manner, including precautions to ensure that individuals responsible for carrying out any part of the research misconduct proceeding do not have unresolved personal, professional or financial conflicts of interest with the complainant, respondent or witnesses!.]\u201d). As we have discussed, Dr. Yuan did not follow the procedures outlined by JHU. It was not until May 14, 2012, after his employment contract had expired, that Dr, Yuan informed Ronald J. Daniels, the president of JHU, and Edward D. Miller, the president of the School of Medicine, about these \u201cserious scientific problems\u201d in the publication. Patricia L. McClean, JHU senior associate general counsel, responded on May 21, 2012 stating that, \u201c[t]he School of Medicine is looking into the allegations of research misconduct made in your letter under its Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct.\u201d However, JHU did not contact him further nor did they find that research misconduct had taken place. Determining if research misconduct took place is an internal process for JHU to determine with its scientific expertise and in accordance with self-regulation as directed by Congress. Under the circumstances, we can only determine that there was no clear violation of the research misconduct regulations to warrant a cause of action for wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">This Court has also recognized the tort of wrongful termination based on public policy when an employee is discharged for exercising his or her legal rights. <em>Watson v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. 467, 481-83, 588 A.2d 760, 767 (1991) (holding that a wrongful termination claim existed when plaintiff was fired for suing a coworker for assault and battery). We stated, \u201cwhere, as here, a retaliatory discharge is in response to an [employee] seeking legal redress against a co-worker because of sexual harassment which does amount to assault and battery, <em>Adler\u2019s </em>requirement of a clear mandate of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>policy is satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. See also Ewing v.

The Legislature has made a strong statement to that effect in making such conduct a criminal offense, and our perception of the magnitude of the public interest in preserving the full benefits of the worker\u2019s compensation system to employees, and deterring employers from encroaching upon those rights, is equally strong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Watson, </em>this Court held that the interest in preserving bodily integrity was a sufficiently clear public policy basis to raise a claim of wrongful termination for employees who reported conduct involving sexual harassment that amounts to assault or battery. <em>Watson, </em>322 Md. at 481, 588 A.2d at 767. We noted that federal and state laws prohibited retaliatory discharge for complaints about sexual harassment in the workplace, however, the laws did not provide for legal redress against sexual harassment that amounted to assault or battery. 322 Md. at 483, 588 A.2d at 768 (holding that the plaintiff employee suffered sexual harassment which amounted to assault or battery by her employer). However, the employee\u2019s interest in preserving bodily integrity was reinforced by the state\u2019s interest in \u201cpreventing breaches of the peace\u201d and \u201cstatutory policies intended to assure protection from workplace sexual harassment.\u201d 322 Md. at 481, 588 A.2d at 767. Thus, this Court found a wrongful termination claim based on public policy would support the employee\u2019s tort damages claim because the public policy was clearly discernable and the violation of the policy was otherwise unremedied. <em>Id. </em>Such is not the case under Dr. Yuan\u2019s circumstances. We cannot clearly determine what the contours of a wrongful termination claim based on a public policy against research misconduct would entail.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We hold that the provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Conversion and Interpreting Respondent\u2019s Research Materials Policy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">Conversion is an intentional tort, consisting of two elements, a physical act combined with a certain state of mind.

Therefore, he does not have a property interest in the research materials under such a theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Specifically, Dr, Yuan does not challenge the validity of JHU\u2019s \u201cPolicy on Access and Retention of Research Data and Materials.\u201d Instead, he alleges JHU violated its own policy when Dr. Boeke first indicated that Dr. Yuan could have access to the materials, but JHU later denied Dr, Yuan such access. The Policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">3. OWNERSHIP OF RESEARCH DATA: The University owns all Research Data generated by research projects conducted at or under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins University regardless of funding source, unless specific terms of sponsorship, other agreements or University policy supersede these rights. This policy does not attempt to determine relative rights of researchers and issues surrounding collaborative efforts such as authorship....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">5. RIGHTS TO ACCESS: ... The University will have access to the Research Data as necessary for technology transfer, compliance and other purposes. The University also has the option to take custody of the Research Data as determined by the appropriate University official. Such option will not be invoked without cause and subsequent notification of the Primary Responsible Investigator....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">6. DESTRUCTION OR REMOVAL: ... With respect to removal of the Research Data, the university recognizes the importance of Research Data to the future research and career of its faculty. Therefore, should removal of Research Data be approved, for example, because of the transfer of the investigator to another institution, the following requirements apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>I. Researchers may receive approval to remove original Research Data. The University may retain copies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">II. Research Data generated during the Researcher\u2019s employment at the University will be maintained in accordance with Johns Hopkins policy[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">III. Research Data that are integral to the ongoing research of another Johns Hopkins employee or student will continue to be made available for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\"><em>Johns Hopkins University Policy On Access And Retention Of Research Data And Materials </em>(January 2, 2008) [http:// perma.cc/476F-Y6G5].</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In addition, Dr. Yuan does not dispute that he took possession of research samples prior to his time working in Dr. Boeke\u2019s lab. However, he argues that JHU violated its policy because he was originally told by Dr. Boeke that he could take his research materials, but he was later prevented from doing so. JHU policy states researchers \u201cmay\u201d receive permission to remove property; however, where that information is \u201cintegral\u201d to ongoing research, JHU may retain it. Moreover, the policy stated that JHU \u201cowns all Research Data generated by research projects conducted at or under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins University.\u201d Accordingly, all of the research data at issue was generated at JHU while Dr. Yuan was employed by the institution. The Supreme Court of the United States stated long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">If one is employed to devise or perfect an instrument, or a means for accomplishing a prescribed result, he cannot, after successfully accomplishing the work for which he was employed, plead title thereto as against his employer. That which he has been employed and paid to accomplish becomes, when accomplished, the property of his employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZS\"><em>Solomons v. United States, </em>137 U.S. 342, 346, 11 S.Ct. 88, 89, 34 L.Ed. 667, 668 (1890) (holding that the use of employer\u2019s property and machinery to devise an internal revenue stamp was part of the duty of the employee and therefore the employer owned the right to use the stamp without compensating the employee). Dr. Yuan\u2019s employment involved molecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>lar biology and genetics research for JHU. Further, we have found no law, nor did Dr. Yuan offer any law, to support the proposition that Dr. Yuan was entitled to continue his possession of research materials when his employment ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Under the JHU Policy, there is no absolute right of a discharged or former researcher to have access or ownership of the research materials. Rather, JHU maintains ownership, \u201cunless specific terms of sponsorship, other agreements, or University policy supersede\u201d JHU\u2019s rights. Notably, Dr. Yuan\u2019s complaint seems to indicate that all research data and materials were created during Dr. Yuan\u2019s tenure at JHU; thus, their ownership is determined by JHU policy, which provides that research data may remain with JHU. Clearly, one cannot covert property which one owns. <em>Borzym, </em>379 Md. at 261-63, 841 A.2d at 835-36 (discussing case law that defines \u201cconversion\u201d to mean taking another\u2019s property); <em>Interstate Ins.
