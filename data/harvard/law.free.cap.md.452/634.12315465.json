Proc.\u201d) \u00a7 8-301 was improperly denied prior to a hearing, when the petition alleged \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that a trial witness stated, twenty years later, that he \u201clied[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">In 1993, Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. (\u201cRespondent\u201d) was convicted of two counts of felony murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of attempted armed robbery, and three counts of first-degree assault, stemming from a 1992 armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>robbery that resulted in two deaths. Respondent was sentenced to life without parole for the murders, and additional periods of incarceration for the remaining unmerged offenses. At trial, Jerome House-Bowman (\u201cMr. House-Bowman\u201d) testified regarding Respondent\u2019s intent to commit an armed robbery and identified Respondent as the individual who shot the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Twenty years later, Mr. House-Bowman, in a signed statement, alleged that he \u201clied\u201d during Respondent\u2019s trial \u201cto save [his] niece, (Stephanie Stevenson) from prosecution and conviction .... \u201d Based on Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation, Respondent filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of actual innocence under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, alleging that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that created a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the result [of Respondent\u2019s trial] may have been different.\u201d Respondent appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court, concluding Respondent was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">I. Underlying Criminal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">On the afternoon of November 28, 1992, a gunman entered Brodie\u2019s Barbershop in Catonsville, Maryland. During the course of an attempted robbery, two people were killed and another was wounded. Witnesses identified Respondent as the gunman. At a six-day trial, the State called several witnesses, including Stephanie Stevenson (\u201cMs. Stevenson\u201d) who testified regarding Respondent\u2019s criminal agency. Ms. Stevenson also testified that she participated in the attempted robbery, but that Respondent was the person who shot all three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Ms. Stevenson\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Mr. House-Bowman, her uncle. Mr. House-Bowman testified that sometime in December 1992, Respondent told Mr. House-Bowman, in confidence, that Respondent was involved in the \u201c[b]arber-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>shop murder,\u201d and that \u201cit first started out as a robbery. It was supposed to be a robbery and somehow it got fouled up and [Respondent] had to shoot two people.\u201d Mr. House-Bowman also testified that Respondent told him that Respondent knew where the money was kept in the barbershop, which was why he decided to rob it. Mr. House-Bowman also stated that Respondent described to him in detail how Respondent escaped from the barbershop after he shot the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">At trial, the State also introduced into evidence a Browning semi-automatic 9 mm pistol that was alleged to have been used during the course of the incident, and purchased by Todd Timmons from Respondent sometime in November 1992. Additionally, the State called Joseph Kopera (\u201cMr. Kopera\u201d), a ballistics and firearm expert employed by the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, who testified that all the spent cartridge casings and bullets recovered from the bodies of the victims were fired from the same Browning semi-automatic 9mm pistol that was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Respondent was convicted of two counts of first-degree felony murder, one count of attempted second-degree murder, one count of attempted armed robbery, and three counts of first-degree assault. The court imposed a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on the murder counts, and imposed an additional 80 years of incarceration, to run concurrently, as to the remaining unmerged counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Respondent\u2019s convictions were upheld in an unreported, <em>per curiam </em>opinion in the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 1809, Sept. Term, 1994 (filed July 20, 1994). This Court granted Respondent\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, and also upheld his convictions. <em>See Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 671 A.2d 974 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by Calloway v. State, </em>414 Md. 616, 996 A.2d 869 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Respondent subsequently filed postconviction petitions in 1997 and in 2007, but withdrew both without prejudice prior to a hearing. Respondent also filed a petition for writ of actual innocence in 2011, based on the trial testimony of Mr. Rop-era\u2014the ballistics expert. That petition was denied after a hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The denial of Respondent\u2019s petition was affirmed on appeal in an unreported opinion in the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 1342, Sept. Term, 2012 (filed June 16, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">II. Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On May 7, 2015, Respondent filed a new petition for writ of actual innocence, <em>pro se, </em>in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In the new petition, Respondent alleged that one of the witnesses from his original trial, Mr. House-Bowman, \u201crecanted his statement and testimony[.]\u201d Respondent attached a statement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Mr. House-Bowman, dated January 5, 2013, which stated in relevant part, \u201cI lied, in court, at the trial of Jeffrey Edd [sic] to save my niece, [Ms. Stevenson] from prosecution and conviction, facing her, I just did not tell the truth at the trial, I was trying to help my niece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On July 17, 2015, the circuit court denied Respondent\u2019s petition without a hearing. In its order, the circuit court concluded that Respondent\u2019s petition contained \u201cmerely impeaching evidence, and not material evidence, because [Respondent] was linked to the crime by several other witnesses\u2014including eye witnesses.\u201d The circuit court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai4\">Stephanie Stevenson testified in detail about [Respondent\u2019s] involvement in the crime, and Charles Dunlop, an eye witness, identified [Respondent] from photographs. Kevin Johnson, another eyewitnesses [sic], testified that he recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>nized the [Respondent] as the shooter in this case when he saw [Respondent\u2019s] picture on the news and notified the police. More importantly, ballistics reports linked the murder weapon to [Respondent].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On July 24, 2015, Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied in an order dated August 26, 2015. In its denial, the circuit court reiterated there was \u201coverwhelming evidence, independent from Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s testimony, supporting] [Respondent\u2019s] conviction. This evidence includes testimony from [Respondent\u2019s] accomplice, two eye witnesses, and [a] ballistic report[ ] that linked the murder weapon to [Respondent].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Thereafter, Respondent filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">III. Court of Special Appeals\u2019 Reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the circuit court\u2019s denial of Respondent\u2019s petition without a hearing. <em>See State of Maryland v. Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr., </em>No. 1427, Sept. Term, 2015, 2016 WL 3002469 (filed May 25, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The Court concluded that an individual who is convicted of a crime and eligible to file a petition for a writ of actual innocence under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, \u201cis entitled to a hearing on the merits of the petition, provided that the petition sufficiently pleads grounds for relief under the statute, includes a request for a hearing, and complies with the filing requirements of [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(b).\u201d <em>See Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 165, 31 A.3d 250, 255 (2011); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>443 Md. 238, 250-51, 116 A.3d 477, 484 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">The Court noted that a petition is not required to prove the petitioner\u2019s assertions, but rather, that the trial court is obligated to view the facts asserted in the light most favorable to the petitioner, and required to hold a hearing if \u201cthe allegations could afford a petitioner relief, [assuming] those allegations would be proven at a hearing.\u201d <em>Ebb, </em>No. 1427, Sept. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Term 2016 at 6 (quoting <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 251, 116 A.3d at 484)). The Court also noted that in <em>Douglas, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">[A] trial court may dismiss a petition without a hearing when one was requested, pursuant to [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(e)(2), only when a petitioner fails to satisfy the pleading requirement. The pleading requirement mandates that the trial court determine whether the allegations could afford a petitioner relief, if those allegations would be proven at a hearing, assuming the facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner and accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the petition. That is, when determining whether to dismiss a petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing pursuant to [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(e)(2), provided the petition comports with the procedural requirements under [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(b), the trial court must consider whether the allegations, if proven, consist of newly discovered evidence that \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331\u201d and whether that evidence \u201ccreated a substantial or significant possibility that the result [of the trial] may have been different. [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(a),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 180, 31 A.3d at 264. The Court concluded that the trial court erred in resolving the petition without a hearing because Petitioner met the pleading requirement by \u201calleging facts that theoretically could have resulted in a different trial.\u201d <em>Ebb, </em>No. 1427, Sept. Term 2016 at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The Court also noted that in <em>Douglas, </em>we described the analysis the circuit court is obligated to undertake when a petition has satisfied the procedural pleading requirements of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. <em>Id. </em>at 10. We concluded in <em>Douglas </em>that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 \u201cauthorizes the trial court to dismiss a petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing even though one was requested, if the court concludes that the allegations, if proven, could not entitle a petitioner to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 185, 31 A.3d at 267. The Court concluded that the circuit court erred in denying Respondent\u2019s petition on the grounds that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation was \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d because \u201c[i]f, in fact, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>material witness has recanted testimony about facts that played a significant role in the case, that recantation could be evidence that is directly exculpatory and not \u2018merely impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. The Court also held that, \u201c \u2018[A]s long as a court could reasonably conclude that the newly-discovered evidence, if believed, could create a substantial or significant possibility of a different result, the court may not dismiss a petition\u2019 based upon a characterization of the new evidence as merely impeaching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 (quoting <em>Snead v. State, </em>224 Md.App. 99, 113, 119 A.3d 137, 145 (2015)).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The Court reversed the circuit court\u2019s denial of Respondent\u2019s petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The State noted a timely Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court, which was granted on September 2, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The standard of review is <em>de novo </em>when appellate courts consider the legal sufficiency of a petition for writ of actual innocence that was denied without a hearing. <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 247, 116 A.3d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">I. Petition\u2019s Compliance with Pleading Requirements Contained in Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(b) and Md. Rule 4-332(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">a. Pleading Requirements for Petitions of Writ of Actual Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">i. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">In 2009, the General Assembly enacted Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 to address the statutory gap for convicted defendants who could not secure postconviction relief because they obtained newly discovered evidence that was either non-biologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>cal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or discovered after the one year limitation in Maryland Rule 4-331. <em>See Smallwood v. State, </em>451 Md. 290, 313-20, 152 A.3d 776, 789-93 (2017) (discussing Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301\u2019s legislative history). Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 contains specific pleading requirements for a petition. Sub-section (b) requires a petition to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">(b) A petition filed under this section shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">(1) be in writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">(2) state in detail the grounds on which the petition is based;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">(3) describe the newly discovered evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(4) contain or be accompanied by a request for hearing if a hearing is sought; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">(5) distinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition from any claims made in prior petitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Additionally, sub-section (e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed under this section if the petition satisfies the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ments of subsection (b) of this section and a hearing was requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">(2) The court may dismiss a petition without a hearing if the court finds that the petition fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In <em>Douglas, </em>we concluded that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 only \u201crequires that a petition \u2018assert\u2019 grounds for relief, it does not require the petitioner to satisfy the burden of proving those grounds in the papers submitted.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 179, 31 A.3d at 264; <em>see also Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 251, 116 A.3d at 484 (quoting <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 179, 31 A.3d at 264). Additionally, \u201c[njothing in the language of the statute requires more than that a petitioner plead those assertions [in sub-section (b) ] before the hearing requirement [in sub-section (e) ] is triggered.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 180, 31 A.3d at 264.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We concluded, therefore, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">the statute establishes only a burden of pleading grounds for relief, not of proving them, and that a trial court may dismiss a petition without a hearing when one is requested, pursuant to [Crim. Proc.] \u00a7 8-301 (e)(2), only when a petitioner fails to satisfy the pleading requirement. The pleading requirement mandates that the trial court determine whether the allegations could afford petitioner relief, if those allegations would be proven at a hearing, assuming the facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner and accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\"><em>Id.; see also Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 251, 116 A.3d at 484 (quoting <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 180, 31 A.3d at 264).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">We also recognized in <em>Douglas </em>the persuasive value of holding a hearing in cases brought under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 31 A.3d at 265 (citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>358 Md. 612, 625, 751 A.2d 473, 479-80 (2000)). In <em>Douglas, </em>we quoted <em>Jackson </em>at length, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>[The right to a hearing] represents an assessment by us of the significance of the matter under consideration, at least to the parties, and, given that significance, of their right, if they choose to exercise it, to present directly to the court, <em>viva voce, </em>the reasons why they should prevail. It is a recognition that personal, vocal communication with the judge may not only itself be a more effective means of persuasion than written documents that may be read hurriedly and not fully appreciated or understood, but that a hearing offers at least a limited opportunity for dialogue, allowing for clarification, for greater precision, for addressing concerns harbored and expressed by the judge. It is a right that, ordinarily, may be waived, but when not waived, we are loathe, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, to find its denial harmless. It would often be a matter of pure speculation whether prejudice ensued\u2014 whether, had the party been given the opportunity to make his or her \u201cpitch\u201d at a hearing, the result may have been different\u2014and that is much more likely the case when the decision may rest upon the resolution of factual disputes or the exercise of discretion and judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson, </em>358 Md. at 625, 751 A.2d at 479-80).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In reviewing petitions brought under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, we also \u201cconstrue liberally filings by pro <em>se </em>inmates, particularly when the statute involved is remedial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 31 A.3d at 266 (quoting <em>State v.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301(b). The petition complied with subsection (b)(1) and (b)(4) because it was in writing and requested a hearing. Respondent\u2019s petition also satisfied sub-section (b)(5) because the alleged newly discovered evidence of Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation was distinct from his prior alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>newly discovered evidence regarding Mr. Kopera\u2019s perjury,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, as discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>Respondent\u2019s petition satisfied subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) because\u2014under the <em>Douglas </em>pleading standard\u2014Respondent included in his petition Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement from January 2013 that asserted he had \u201clied\u201d at trial. Respondent also provided sufficient evidence that the State relied, in part, on Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s testimony in establishing Respondent committed several crimes for which Respondent was later convicted, thus creating a \u201csignificant or substantial possibility\u201d that the outcome of Respondent\u2019s trial may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">ii. Maryland Rule 4-332</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On September 8, 2011, we adopted Maryland Rule 4-332, effective October 1, 2011, to clarify the pleading requirements under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. Specifically, Maryland Rule 4-332(d) requires a petition filed under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(d) The petition shall be in writing, shall be signed by the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s attorney, and shall state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(1) the court in which the indictment or criminal information was filed and the file number in that case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">(2) if the case was removed to another court for trial, the identity of that court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">(3) each offense of which the petitioner was convicted, the date of the judgment of conviction, and the sentence imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">(4) if the judgment was appealed, the case number in the appellate court, a concise description of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>raised in the appeal, the result, and the date of the appellate court\u2019s mandate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">(5) for each motion or petition for post-judgment relief, the court in which the motion or petition was filed, the case number assigned to each proceeding, a concise description of the issues raised, the result, and the date of disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">(6) that the request for relief is based on newly discovered evidence which, with due diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">(7) a description of the newly discovered evidence, how and when it was discovered, why it could not have been discovered earlier, and, if the issue of whether the evidence could have been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331 was raised or decided in an earlier appeal or post-judgment proceeding, the identity of the appeal or proceeding and the decision on that issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">(8) that the newly discovered evidence creates a substantial or significant possibility, as that standard has been judicially determined, that the result may have been different, and the basis for that statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">(9) that the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">(10) if the petitioner is not already represented by counsel, whether the petitioner desires to have counsel appointed by the court, and, if so, facts establishing indigency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">(11) that a copy of the petition, together with all attachments, was mailed to the State\u2019s Attorney of the county in which the petition was filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">(12) the relief requested; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">(13) whether a hearing is requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">Sub-section (j) requires a court to hold a hearing on a petition filed under Crim.

Under sub-section (i)(l) a court may either dismiss a petition filed under Grim.

In considering whether to grant leave to amend the petition, sub-section (h) states that, \u201c[amendments to the petition shall be freely allowed in order to do substantial justice.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-332(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In discussing Maryland Rule 4-332\u2019s pleading requirements, we clarified in <em>Hunt </em>that sub-section (d), in addition to requiring the recitation of certain procedural information,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> also \u201celaborates on the contents of petitions for writ of actual innocence.\u201d <em>See </em>Hunt, 443 Md. at 249, 116 A.3d at 483. We determined that petitions filed under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 must comply with the requirements stated in sub-section (d)(6)\u2014(9), and (12)-(13). <em>See id. </em>at 249-50, 116 A.3d at 483-84. In <em>Hunt, </em>we considered two petitions for writ of actual innocence, only one of which\u2014Hardy\u2019s\u2014was subject to Maryland Rule 4-332.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 254, 116 A.3d at 486. We concluded that Hardy\u2019s petition complied with the pleading requirements contained in (d)(6), (7), and (9), but acknowledged that Hardy\u2019s petition did not comply with other technical requirements contained in the Rule, including subsections (d)(3), (4), and (5). <em>Id. </em>at 255, 116 A.3d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Despite the procedural deficiencies, we held the circuit court was not required to dismiss Hardy\u2019s petition because Mary-land Rule 4-332(i)(l) provides a \u201crelief valve\u201d for the circuit court to avoid dismissal of a petition if the petition \u201ccomplies] substantially with the requirements of [subjsection (d) [of Maryland Rule 4-332.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 255-56, 116 A.3d at 487.

Rather, \u201c[w]here petitions were dismissed, it was for more substantive violations of other requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ward v.

Proc.] \u00a7 8-301(b)(3)\u2019s \u2018newly discovered evidence\u2019 requirement, adding that a petition for writ of actual innocence must allege that the newly discovered evidence, \u2018with due diligence, could not have been discovered\u2019 in time to move for a new trial pursuant to [Maryland] Rule 4-331.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 254, 116 A.3d at 486. In Respondent\u2019s petition, he alleges that the newly discovered evidence in his case was that the \u201c[p]rosecut[or\u2019s] material witness [Mr. House-Bowman] recanted his statement and testimony on January 5, 2013, under penalties of perjury.\u201d Respondent also included in his Memorandum of Law and Facts in Support of Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, the statement that, \u201c[Mr. House-Bowman], did not come forward until January 5, 2013, twenty years after [Respondent\u2019s] trial. Thus, [Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s] false testimony could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under [Maryland] Rule 4-331.\u201d In his brief, Respondent noted that a defendant convicted on perjured testimony \u201cwould have no way of knowing that a witness who falsely implicated him under oath would later come forward and recant.\u201d As Respondent argues, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation was not available to Respondent until Mr. House-Bowman contacted Respondent and volunteered to recant. We conclude, therefore, that these statements are sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirement of Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We concluded in <em>Hunt </em>that Hardy\u2019s petition satisfied Mary-land Rule 4-332(d)(7) because the petitioner attached a <em>Baltimore Sun </em>article that raised questions about Mr. Kopera\u2019s academic qualifications and an affidavit from the public de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>fender who represented the petitioner that recounted her discovery of Mr. Kopera\u2019s misrepresentations, and this information was included in his petition. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 254-55, 116 A.3d at 486. Here, Respondent attached the statement from Mr, House-Bowman recanting his original testimony to his petition, and in his petition he alleged that \u201c[Mr. House-Bowman] has now come forward to renounce the testimony and statements he gave against Petitioner and revealed they were all false.\u201d Respondent also noted in his petition that \u201c[o]n January 5, 2013, Mr. Floyd Turpin, a private investigator, conducted an interview with [Mr. House-Bowman]. During this interview, [Mr. House-Bowman] signed an affidavit, recanting his statement and testimony at trial, which constitutes newly discovered evidence.\u201d We conclude the statements included in Respondent\u2019s petition and the attachment of Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation statement are sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(7). Additionally, as discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>we conclude Respondent\u2019s petition also satisfied the requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(8) requiring the alleged newly discovered evidence to create a substantial or significant possibility that the result in Respondent\u2019s trial may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The parties both acknowledge that Respondent\u2019s petition does not comply with the requirement in subsection (d)(9) that the petition include an averment \u201cthat the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9). The State also argues that Respondent\u2019s evidence \u201cis so lacking in specificity that one cannot even find an implicit protestation of innocence in the pleading\u201d as we concluded in <em>McGhie v. State. See </em>449 Md. 494, 509, n. 6, 144 A.3d 752, 761, n. 6 (2016). In contrast, Respondent argues that because we found in <em>McGhie </em>there was no \u201cjurisdictional concern with the lack of an averment of innocence[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>our holding \u201clends support to the conclusion that \u2018substantial\u2019 compliance does not require a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of actual innocence to expressly state \u2018that the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not eommit[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In <em>McGhie, </em>we noted that Maryland Rule 4-332 was promulgated to \u201celaborate on the procedures for filing a petition for writ of actual innocence.\u201d <em>McGhie, </em>449 Md. at 509, n. 6, 144 A.3d at 761, n. 6. Relying on our holding in <em>Hunt, </em>and the \u201crelief valve\u201d contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(i)(l)(A), we held that there was no reason to dismiss the petition for its failure to comply with sub-section (d)(9). <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 255-56, 116 A.3d at 487). In so holding, we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aem-dedup-0\">[t]he record makes plain that [petitioner had testified at trial to his actual innocence of the charged crimes. The State has not moved to dismiss the petition for lack of an averment of innocence and, in response to this Court\u2019s questions at oral argument, had no quarrel with the adequacy of the petition. Moreover, the hearing judge evidently did not recognize any problem in this regard and proceeded to conduct a hearing on the merits of the petition. Under these circumstances, and detecting no jurisdictional concern with the lack of an averment of innocence, we have no just reason to direct a dismissal of the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In another case considering a petition that did not contain an averment of innocence, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201c[Maryland] Rule 4-332 became effective on October 1, 2011 and applies to all petitions filed on or after that date,\u201d but then concluded that \u201c[b]eeause the circuit court did not grant leave to amend the petition prior to dismissing it, <em>see </em>[Maryland] Rule 4-332(h) ..., and made no mention in its order as to the reasons it denied the petition, we do not rely upon noncompliance with [Maryland] Rule 4-332 for affirmance.\u201d <em>Keyes v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 660, 666 n. 3, 84 A.3d 141, 144 n. 3 (2014). The Court, instead, focused its analysis on whether the petition at issue \u201csufficiently [pled] grounds for reliefi,]\u201d and concluded the petition failed to allege \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that \u201ccreate[ed] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different[.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 668, 84 A.3d at 146. Central to the <em>Keyes </em>Court\u2019s determination that the petition should not be dismissed for noncompliance with subsection (d)(9) was the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>circuit court did not grant the petitioner leave to amend his petition pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-332(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Our holding in <em>McGhie </em>and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion in <em>Keyes </em>make clear that a petition\u2019s failure to include an averment of innocence, alone, is not a basis for dismissing a petition under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. Rather, for petitions that otherwise satisfy the pleading requirements contained in subsection (d), but fail to assert an averment of innocence, the hearing court may grant the petitioner leave to amend his or her petition to correct the deficiency pursuant to Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(i)(1)(B) and (h) if in so doing, it would do substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In the case at bar, we acknowledge that the circuit court did not dismiss Respondent\u2019s petition due to its failure to aver that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. Rather, the circuit court dismissed Respondent\u2019s petition because it concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">there was overwhelming evidence of [Respondent\u2019s] guilt in this case and thus Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation of his testimony is merely impeaching evidence. For similar reasons, Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s recantation of his testimony under oath does not create a substantial possibility of a different outcome at trial\u2014given the overwhelming evidence of [Respondent\u2019s] guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">As discussed more fully, <em>infra, </em>we conclude that, on its merits, Respondent\u2019s petition has sufficiently alleged \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could create a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d that the outcome of his trial may have been different. For Respondent to be entitled to a hearing on the petition\u2019s merits, however, we hold that the circuit court must first make a determination that allowing Respondent to amend his petition to comply with Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9)\u2019s pleading requirement would do substantial justice. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-332(h). Respondent is not entitled to a hearing unless the circuit court determines that amending his petition would do substantial justice. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-332(h); <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 249-50, 116 A.3d at 483-84 (requiring petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>filed pursuant to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 to, <em>inter alia, </em>comply with the pleading requirement contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9)). In determining whether allowing Respondent to amend his petition would do substantial justice, the circuit court must articulate its reasoning on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">If the circuit court concludes that Respondent may amend his petition to comply with the pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9), Respondent\u2019s averment must allege which convictions he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of, meaning which offenses he alleges he \u201cdid not commit.\u201d <em>See Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 320, 152 A.3d at 793 (holding that \u201c[o]nly defendants who can allege they are \u2018actually innocent,\u2019 meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted, may bring a petition for relief under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9). Additionally, we leave it to the petitioning court\u2019s discretion to determine a reasonable time-frame within which Respondent may amend his petition to comply with Rule 4-332(d)(9)\u2019s pleading requirement, and for the State to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be vacated, and the case remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">II. Respondent\u2019s Entitlement to A Hearing Under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(e)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Because the circuit court may find on remand that Respondent is entitled to amend his petition to comply with pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9), we must consider whether Respondent\u2019s petition pled sufficient grounds for relief that would otherwise entitle him to a hearing under Crim. Proc. 8-301(e)(l). The plain language in Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 (a) requires a petitioner to assert that \u201cthere is newly discovered evidence that ... (1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined ... [.] \u201d We previously held that the \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d standard \u201cfalls between \u2018probable,\u2019 which is less demanding than \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 and \u2018might\u2019 which is less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>stringent than probable.\u201d <em>McGhie, </em>449 Md. at 510, 144 A.3d at 762 (quoting <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 588, 556 A.2d 230, 234-35 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Additionally, as noted, <em>supra, </em>we determine whether the allegations in Respondent\u2019s petition could afford him relief, if the allegations can be proven at the hearing, and we assume the facts in the light most favorable to Respondent, accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from his petition. <em>See Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 180, 31 A.3d at 264. We also \u201cconstrue liberally\u201d Respondent\u2019s petition because he filed it <em>pro se. See Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 182, 31 A.3d at 266 (quoting <em>State v. Matthews, </em>415 Md. at 298, 999 A.2d at 1057).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">i. Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The State argues that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement is not \u201cevidence,\u201d let alone \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d as those terms have previously been defined. The State avers that \u201cevidence\u201d is defined as \u201ctestimony or an item or thing that is capable of being elicited or introduced and moved into the court record, so as to be put before the trier of fact at trial.\u201d <em>See Hawes v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 105, 134, 85 A.3d 291, 308 (2014). Additionally, the State argues that \u201cnewly discovered\u201d means that the evidence could not have been found through the exercise of due diligence within the time allotted for seeking a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8\u2014301(a)(2) (\u201c[a] person.. .may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence.. .if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that ... (2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under [Maryland] Rule 4-331.\u201d). Under both these definitions, and in the favorable light in which we view a petitioner\u2019s assertions, we conclude that Respondent properly asserted that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement is \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Respondent included a statement in his petition from Mr. House-Bowman asserting that he \u201clied, in court.. .to save [his] niece, (Stephanie Stevenson) from prosecution and conviction, facing her, [he] just did not tell the truth at the trial, [he] was trying to help [his] niece.\u201d It is reasonable to infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that if Respondent was granted a hearing on his petition, Mr. House-Bowman would be able to provide testimony that would expound on what he lied about at Respondent\u2019s trial. We also note that in his petition, Respondent alleged that Mr. House-Bowman \u201chas now come forward to renounce the testimony and statements he gave against [Respondent] and revealed they were all false.\u201d A reasonable inference could be drawn that Mr. House-Bowman may renounce his previous trial testimony. We therefore disagree with the State\u2019s argument that Respondent did not include any \u201cevidence\u201d in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We also conclude that Respondent sufficiently asserted that the \u201cevidence\u201d is \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement is dated January 5, 2013\u2014twenty years after Respondent was originally convicted. Respondent also references in his petition that Mr. House-Bowman \u201c[came] forward\u201d to recant his testimony in January 2013. Although the State contends that Respondent failed to explain why this \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was not ascertained in sufficient time to seek a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331, we conclude that Respondent\u2019s assertions are sufficient, at this stage, to satisfy this requirement. We also note that, absent evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer that Respondent had \u201cno way of knowing that a witness who falsely implicated him under oath would later come forward and recant[,]\u201d until Mr. House-Bowman actually came forward in January 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">ii. Significant or Substantial Possibility of a Different Result</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">We also conclude Respondent\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d could \u201ccreate a substantial or significant possibility\u201d that the outcome of Respondent\u2019s trial may have been different. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(a)(l). In Respondent\u2019s petition, he notes that at trial Mr. House-Bowman testified that: (1) Respondent confided in Mr. House-Bowman that he was the person police were looking for concerning the barbershop murders; (2) Respondent went to the barbershop to rob it, but he saw a guy reaching for a gun, so he shot the man in the barber chair; (3) because the barber knew Respondent, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>also shot him; and (4) Respondent discarded his clothes as he ran through some woods, and exited on a highway and made it to his home from there.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Respondent also quoted at length the State\u2019s opening, trial presentation, and closing arguments to highlight the State\u2019s reliance on Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s testimony during his trial. For example, Respondent notes at trial, the prosecutor stated \u201c[t]he [Respondent] in his statement to [Mr. House-Bowman], \u2018I went to rob Brodie\u2019s Barbershop. I knew he had money and I knew where he kept it.\u2019 That is specific intent to rob, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d Respondent also notes that in his closing-statement, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5n-dedup-0\">some of the most damning testimony of this trial, the [Respondent] met his friend, [Mr. House-Bowman] and he said [Mr. House-Bowman], I got something to tell you, but you have to take it in the utmost confidence. Absolutely, [Mr. House-Bowman] says. The [Respondent] say I feel that we are that kind of friends where I can tell you what I am about to say. Absolutely, [Mr. House-Bowman] says. You heard about the barbershop murders. Brodie\u2019s barbershop? Yeah, I heard about it, [Mr. House-Bowman] said. He dropped the bomb. I am the one the police are looking for. I am the one who did the murders in the barbershop. [Mr. House-Bowman] asked him to expound upon that a little bit. [Respondent] tells [Mr. House-Bowman] that he went to rob the barbershop because he knew the barbershop kept money. [Respondent] told [Mr. House-Bowman] that he shot the man with the gun. Ladies and gentlemen, the man with the gun was Kevin Johnson. The barber was James Brodie. The man in the chair was Michael Peters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">No one knew it: The other thing [Ms. Stevenson] could not have told [Mr. House-Bowman] is that [Respondent] planned to rob Brodie\u2019s barbershop, because she didn\u2019t know that. She went in expecting to get money. She had called two minutes earlier on the telephone from the pay phone behind the station and Brodie said yeah, come on over, I will finish this up, I will give you the money. She had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>no expectation of murder and robbery, so she couldn\u2019t have told [Mr. House-Bowman].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">So how did [Mr. House-Bowman] know? Because [Respondent] told him. Remember the circumstances of the conversation between [Mr. House-Bowman] and [Respondent]. [Mr. House-Bowman] was very frank about it. We are sitting around, we are getting high. I have known him for about a year. Not a year from the date [Mr. House-Bowman] testified, but a year from the day he gave the statement. [Respondent] told me. That is what happened. Ladies and gentlemen, you clearly can\u2019t dismiss people because of their criminal record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">At this stage of the proceedings, it is reasonable to infer that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement that he \u201clied, in court, at the trial of Jeffrey Edd [sic] ...\u201d was a reference to his testimony regarding statements Respondent allegedly made to him about robbing the barbershop. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such an inference is true, then the State would have had greater difficulty proving Respondent intended to rob the barbershop. Without evidence of a robbery, the felonious component of the felony-murder convictions would also be in jeopardy, thereby creating a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that [Respondent\u2019s trial] may have been different[.]\u201d <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The State argues that there is an \u201cinnate suspicion that must surround all claims of recanted testimony.\u201d It further argues that Mr. House-Bowman\u2019s statement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">presents no coherent reason as to why the court should accept that he is telling the truth now. His proffered explanation\u2014that he lied to save [Ms.] Stevenson from prosecution\u2014seems false on its face, as the prosecution was well aware that [Ms.] Stevenson was [Respondent\u2019s] accomplice and nothing about [Mr.] House-Bowman\u2019s testimony seemed to exculpate [Ms.] Stevenson.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>We agree that there are serious questions regarding whether Respondent will be able to demonstrate that he should be entitled to a new trial, but that does not preclude his ability to obtain one. Consistent with <em>Douglas </em>and <em>Hunt, </em>although we conclude that Respondent may be entitled to a hearing on his petition, \u201cit does not follow automatically ... that he can prove his claim at that hearing.\u201d <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 257, 116 A.3d at 488 (quoting <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186, 31 A.3d at 268) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Hunt </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">[petitioners] face significant hurdles in convincing a hearing judge that the questions regarding Kopera\u2019s qualifications \u2018create[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different\u2019 and \u2018could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial.\u2019 [Petitioners\u2019] causes are by no means doomed, however; a hearing judge may determine, based on whatever evidence and arguments as may be presented at the hearing, that [petitioners] are entitled to a new trial, resentencing, or other appropriate relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 116 A.3d at 488 (citations omitted). While it is unclear at this juncture whether Respondent will prevail on his petition, we hold that he has alleged sufficient \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could create a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d that his original trial may have been different, and is therefore entitled to a hearing under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In summary, we hold that a petition that otherwise complies with the pleading requirements contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(d), but fails to include an averment of innocence, may be amended under Maryland Rule 4-332(i)(l)(B) and (h) if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>circuit court determines that allowing the petitioner to amend his or her petition would do substantial justice. Here, for Respondent to be entitled to a hearing on the merits of his petition, recognizing that Maryland Rule 4-332(h) indicates that \u201cAmendments to the petition shall be freely allowed in order to do substantial justiee[,]\u201d the circuit court must first determine whether allowing him to amend his petition to comply with the mandatory pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9) would do substantial justice, and must articulate its reasoning on the record. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS VACATED.

I write simply to emphasize the significance of the requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9) that a petitioner like Mr. Ebb must affirmatively assert that he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted before a circuit court would be required to hold a hearing on a petition. This might be considered a fine point, but it goes to the heart of the statute that allows for a writ of actual innocence\u2014Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), \u00a7 8-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In his petition, Mr. Ebb did not assert, as required by Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9), that \u201cthe conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that [Mr. Ebb] did not commit.\u201d This is not mere boilerplate. As this Court recently stated, \u201c[o]nly defendants who can allege that they are \u2018actually innocent,\u2019 meaning they did not commit the crimes for which, they are convicted, may bring a petition for relief under [the writ of actual innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>statute].\u201d <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>451 Md. 290, 320, 152 A.3d 776 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">It is true that a petitioner might be found to be in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with this requirement where the record establishes that the petitioner has previously asserted actual innocence under oath, particularly when the State has never objected to the failure to repeat that assertion in the petition. <em>See McGhie v. State, </em>449 Md. 494, 509 n.6, 144 A.3d 752 (2016). It is also true that the rule was drafted in recognition that many such petitions would be filed by <em>pro se </em>petitioners and therefore provides that amendments should be \u201cfreely allowed in order to do substantial justice.\u201d Rule 4-332(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">But here there is no indication, at least in the materials available to us, that Mr. Ebb has ever asserted under oath (or otherwise) that he was actually innocent of the offenses for which he was convicted. Nor has Mr. Ebb apparently ever sought to amend his petition to that effect. And the State has certainly raised the issue of compliance with Rule 4-332.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The closest that Mr. Ebb has come is his assertion, in his brief to the Court of Special Appeals, that he \u201chas maintained his innocence as being wrongfully convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That is not an assertion of actual innocence. In our system of criminal justice, even one who has actually committed a criminal offense may legitimately maintain that he was wrongfully convicted. A criminal defendant has the right to put the State\u2019s evidence to the test and, if that evidence was obtained in violation of the Constitution or if there is some other serious defect with the prosecution, may quite correctly assert that he was \u201cwrongfully convicted\u201d and obtain reversal of a conviction. But that is a far cry from actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In his brief, Mr. Ebb argues that his \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d\u2014actually, an alleged recantation of inculpatory trial testimony by a prosecution witness\u2014would lighten the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of the evidence against him such that it would no longer satisfy the standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d That may be an assertion that he was wrongfully convicted, but it is not an assertion that he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As this Court\u2019s detailed analysis of the legislative history of CP \u00a7 8-301 in <em>Smallwood </em>demonstrated, the statute was designed to provide relief to a \u201cnarrow subset\u201d of convicted defendants who are actually innocent of the offense for which they had been convicted, but have no other means of litigating the claim of innocence. <em>See Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 316-20, 152 A.3d 776. It is not an open-ended, deadline-free vehicle for raising any alleged defect that can framed as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d relevant to a conviction that has already been affirmed on direct appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Judge Watts has advised that she joins this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\">. Mr. Ebb does not repeat that assertion in his brief to us, other than to quote the statement in his brief in the Court of Special Appeals and to argue that <em>it </em>satisfied Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\">. I note that the Court of Special Appeals did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Smallwood </em>or <em>McGhie </em>when it issued its unreported opinion in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
