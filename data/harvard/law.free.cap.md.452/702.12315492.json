Johnson, Petitioner, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>serts that the answer must be yes, while the State would answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The four questions raised by Johnson in his petition for certiorari,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 449 Md. 410, 144 A.3d 705 (2016), which we have collapsed into two for clarity, queue up the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">1. Was the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion for judgment of acquittal procedurally proper because the court had the authority to reconsider and retract the grant of a mistrial because it retained the fundamental jurisdiction to render the ruling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">2. Did the trial court\u2019s grant of petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the express basis of legally insufficient evidence preclude further proceedings under the Maryland common law of double jeopardy and/or the Federal Constitutional prohibition upon double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>We shall hold that the trial judge did not have the authority to grant an acquittal, after he had declared a mistrial and discharged the jury, so that federal Constitutional and Mary-land common law principles of double jeopardy are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The saga in the present ease began when Johnson was acquitted of murder in the first degree but convicted of murder in the second degree after a jury trial in February 2013 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Johnson then filed a Motion for New Trial arguing various discovery violations under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as \u201cprosecutorial vouching,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the State had withheld evidence. The Circuit Court Judge, who had presided over the trial, granted the motion for a new trial, and the second trial began in December of 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Prior to the second trial, Johnson moved to redact recorded portions of his conversations captured in a wiretap of his cell phone in 2011 and in a recorded jail call in 2013. In the motion, Johnson requested that references to his first-degree murder charge, of which he had been acquitted, as well as any references to his attorney from the first trial, Russell Never-don, be redacted from the recordings. A different circuit court judge presided over the second trial and, during trial, ruled that the redactions should occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Later during the proceedings, it appeared that redactions of a recording of a conversation with Johnson from Johnson\u2019s cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>phone on October 19, 2011, had not occurred. In his call, Johnson referred to his former attorney, Russell Neverdon, as well as a call from \u201cTabbie\u201d to Mr. Neverdon. In the same recorded conversation, there was still reference to the first-degree murder charge, which also was supposed to have been redacted by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Johnson\u2019s counsel immediately moved for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">[JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, may we stop the playing of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">(Counsel and Defendant approached the bench, and the following occurred:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">[JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, objection and we would move for a mistrial. Clearly, the disk has not been redacted and it\u2019s starting to talk about first-degree and second-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">[THE STATE]: The transcript is redacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">THE COURT: Yeah, give me a copy of the transcript. (Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">THE COURT: I mean, that was to\u2014oh, it\u2019s way back when. [THE STATE]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to deny the motion at this time. Let\u2019s send the jury upstairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">After a recess, the Circuit Court Judge asked that the State \u201caddress the issue\u201d regarding the unredacted statements in the recordings, because he \u201cha[d]n\u2019t ruled yet\u201d with respect to the mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-14\">[THE STATE]: So what I would suggest is\u2014we have it paused just after where we stopped, I would suggest we just resume when the jury comes down, finish playing it, keep it moving. Obviously, it will have to be redacted before it goes back to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">THE COURT: Yeah. The Defense is\u2014why don\u2019t you address the issue, the Defense has requested a mistrial as a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>[THE STATE]: Oh, I apologize, Your Honor. You indicated you were\u2014I thought you indicated you were denying their motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">THE COURT: No, I haven\u2019t ruled yet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">After discussion about redactions having occurred in the transcript but not in the recordings, the judge ordered the recordings to be replayed. Upon hearing the recordings, the judge ordered the tapes to be \u201ccleaned up again\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>structed the jury to disregard any reference to the warrant, which mentioned first-degree murder charges, as well as \u201cany reference to actions taken by a person identified as \u2018Tabbie.\u2019 \u201d The tapes of the wiretapped conversation on October 19, 2011, began, but again, problems arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Johnson objected to additional references to the first-degree murder charge in the tape. After reviewing the recording with counsel, the Circuit Court Judge announced, \u201cI\u2019m going to give [the jury] the same instruction, but we\u2019ll revisit this,\u201d and that he would \u201chave the weekend to think about this.\u201d The jury was reconvened, and the trial continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The State rested its case later that day, after which Johnson made a motion for judgment of acquittal. The Circuit Court Judge declared that he would consider the motion \u201cfirst thing\u201d on Monday morning: \u201cI would prefer to put that issue off until Monday because ... I\u2019ve got this other issue to consider between now and then, too,\u201d referring to the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Immediately upon reassembling the next Monday, the Circuit Court Judge granted Johnson\u2019s motion for mistrial made the previous Friday and ordered that a new trial date be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">THE COURT: Good morning. In addition to any potential preliminary matters you all may have, we still have pending before the Court, a motion by the Defense for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">For the reasons, which I\u2019ll state in a moment, I\u2019m going to grant that Motion for a Mistrial. The substance of the issue relates to the playing of certain information, which was\u2014by agreement and Court Order\u2014not to be heard by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A92\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>If there was one incident of such material, and it was addressed by the Court, and a motion for a mistrial was denied as to that\u2014but the second incident is somewhat different; in that, it\u2019s repetitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">If the Court believed that it was intentional or so grossly negligent on the part of the State, the ruling would be different than it is now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">But because the Court had the opportunity to actually observe the reaction of the Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys conducting this trial, in realizing what was happening\u2014and clearly, I have never seen a look of shock on an attorney in my courtroom, more than I detected the look of shock on the faces of [the State]\u2014and for that reason I am going to grant the Motion for a Mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">What is now going to happen as a result of the mistrial, is that we will reconvene tomorrow morning, and we will pick a new trial date. So, I\u2019ll ask Counsel to be present tomorrow morning at 9:30 with their calendars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In response, Johnson objected to the judge\u2019s characterization of the State\u2019s actions in bringing about the mistrial as unintentional and announced his opposition to retrial on double jeopardy grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">[JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, I\u2019ve had an opportunity briefly to speak with Mr. Johnson. And I do want the record to reflect that obviously, Your Honor, has granted our request for a mistrial. But that we do not agree or accept the Court\u2019s factual findings regarding the State\u2019s position in this case. We do not accept that it was not an intentional act on their part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">It will be our position that a re-prosecution of Mr. Johnson in this case will be barred by double jeopardy, as a result of the State\u2019s actions. And I just wanted to make that clear on the record at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">There was no reference by anyone to Johnson\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal made the previous Friday. The Circuit Court Judge discharged the jury, telling them \u201cthe case has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>been concluded\u2014at least in that case which you would be required to consider the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The next day, the Circuit Court Judge scheduled Johnson\u2019s retrial for March 9, 2015, after meeting with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On January 15, 2015, weeks after the case was rescheduled, Johnson filed a Motion to Dismiss Indictment on Grounds of Double Jeopardy, wherein he argued that his reprosecution was barred, because the State had intentionally provoked the mistrial, there was no manifest necessity at the time the mistrial was granted, and \u201cthe State\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d A week later and almost a month after declaring the mistrial and discharging the jury, the Circuit Court Judge, on January 20, 2015, held a hearing on Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the case on double jeopardy grounds and referred to Johnson\u2019s suggestion that the State\u2019s evidence in the case was insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">THE COURT: Good morning. Before the Court are motions of the defense essentially to dismiss the case on the basis of double jeopardy grounds. And also, as part of that same motion is an issue related to whether or not the Court did or should address the issue of whether or not the evidence was sufficient at the close of Plaintiffs case which is where we were when the mistrial was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">In light of the fact that I\u2019ve received the motion and it\u2019s in writing, I would suggest that I hear from the State and then I\u2019ll allow you to respond unless there\u2019s something additional you feel that should be added to your motion \u2019cause your motion\u2019s rather detailed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The Circuit Court Judge solicited arguments from both parties on the \u201cmerits of the motion for judgment of acquittal\u201d with respect to the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">After hearing arguments, the judge struck his previous grant of a mistrial and dismissed the second-degree murder charge against Johnson based on insufficiency of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3\">THE COURT: Good afternoon. We had a hearing this morning with regard to the\u2014the title of the motion was motion to dismiss indictment on grounds of double jeopardy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>For reasons that are more fully set forth in the order which I\u2019ll be filing, the Court is striking the granting of the mistrial and the Court will find that there is insufficient evidence as presented at the trial to convict Mr. Johnson and the charges are therefore dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">An \u201cOrder Striking Motion for Mistrial and Granting Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\u201d was entered the same day. In the Order, the judge responded to Johnson\u2019s arguments that the State had goaded him into making the Motion for Mistrial when he wrote, \u201c[T]he Court is still unpersuaded that its observations were wrong,\u201d with respect to the State\u2019s lack of intent in playing the unredacted audio recordings, but also expressed that he was \u201ctroubled by the posture of the case because of the failure to rule upon the [motion for judgment of acquittal] which the record clearly demonstrate^] the Court [had] stated it was to consider \u2018first thing.\u2019 \u201d The Order manifested the Court\u2019s reconsideration of both the grant of the mistrial and his failure to rule upon the motion for judgment of acquittal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">[T]he Court will treat the Motion of the Defense as a motion to reconsider its rulings, both with regard to the subject matter of the [motion for judgment of acquittal] and the [motion for mistrial], and will strike the grant of the mistrial and consider the [motion for judgment of acquittal].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In his Order, the Judge granted the motion for judgment of acquittal after considering that the State\u2019s evidence was \u201cunarguably circumstantial,\u201d with \u201cno smoking gun\u201d in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">The case against the Defendant is unarguably circumstantial. With essentially no direct evidence, the State presented many intriguing issues that suggest the Defendant may have been involved in the disappearance and death of Ms. Barnes. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">* \u215b \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">There was a tremendous amount of testimony from investigating officers of the Baltimore City Police Department, Maryland State Agencies and the Federal Bureau of Inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>tigation. Among other things, their testimony included information as to sex-related websites the Defendant visited, and hundreds of text messages between the Defendant and the decedent as well as a sexually explicit video which included the decedent and the Defendant, which was found on the phones of Defendant and Ms. Barnes\u2019 sister as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">As conceded in argument by the State, there was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d in this case. Accordingly, the Court concludes there was insufficient evidence when taken as a whole, to establish the criminal culpability of Michael Johnson of second-degree murder. That being the conclusion of the court, the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal must be granted, there not being legally sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The State subsequently reindicted Johnson for second-degree murder. In response, in February of 2015, Johnson filed a Motion to Dismiss the Indictment, arguing that Johnson\u2019s acquittal barred further proceedings under double jeopardy. The trial judge dismissed the indictment following a hearing on the motion, orally expressing his belief that he had the authority to \u201ccorrect a procedural misstep\u201d by retracting the mistrial and granting the motion for judgment of acquittal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">I don\u2019t disagree that there were procedural missteps, but the procedural misstep came in this case when I failed to do what I said I was going to do, which was to address the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal first thing Monday morning and then failed to do what I had indicated I was going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">I believe, I did believe at the time that I had the authority to correct a procedural misstep that I had made in a commitment that I had made to both the State and Defense to rule on the issue of the joint\u2014the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, that I corrected that by striking the Motion for Mistrial and ruling as I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>... I thank you for indicating the difficulty that is presented when a judge is called upon to essentially judge his own prior determinations, but judges have to do that all the time, and in this case I believe that my ruling on the Judgment of Acquittal was correct at the time I ruled it, and I will grant the Motion to Dismiss the Indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> arguing, as it does before us, that the judge\u2019s declaration of a mistrial and discharge of the jury terminated the judge\u2019s authority over the case, which obviated the judge\u2019s ability to acquit Johnson. Johnson countered, as he does before us, that the trial judge had jurisdiction to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal and had broad discretion to reconsider his having granted the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the dismissal of Johnson\u2019s case, determining that the principles of double jeopardy did not bar Johnson\u2019s retrial, because the trial court could not acquit Johnson after declaring a mistrial and discharging the jury. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>228 Md.App. 489, 139 A.3d 1095 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In so doing, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the judge lacked the authority to do so after he had declared a mistrial and discharged the jury, explaining that, \u201cthe grant of a mistrial had the legal effect of declaring that the trial in the second prosecution had never taken place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 139 A.3d 1095. Once the mistrial was declared, according to the Court of Special Appeals, the judge could not \u201cexercise fundamental jurisdiction over subject matter that no longer exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 139 A.3d 1095. The Court also noted that the Circuit Court Judge could not reconsider the grant of the mistrial, in the absence of any statute or rule permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>exercise of that kind of \u201crevisory power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 139 A.3d 1095. Further, the Court of Special Appeals opined that if such power did exist, it could not be exercised after the jury is discharged, because \u201c[ajfter the jury is discharged, there is no legal or practical way to place the parties in the same position as they held immediately prior to the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The dissent penned by Judge Daniel Friedman, however, rejected the notion that the mistrial and discharge of the jury left the Circuit Court Judge without jurisdiction to later acquit Johnson. He iterated that a mistrial brings the parties back to a point earlier in the prosecution but does not deprive the trial court of the fundamental jurisdiction to render an acquittal. Judge Friedman noted that the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal was \u201cprocedurally defective\u201d under Rule 4-324, but iterated that an acquittal at any time prohibits an appeal by the State and a retrial. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 139 A.3d 1095 (Friedman, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The same dichotomy confronts us in our review: Is an acquittal, an acquittal, or did the trial judge\u2019s failure to adhere to the tenets of Rule 4-324, as well as his declaration of a mistrial and discharge of the jury end his authority to grant Johnson\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Johnson primarily claims that the trial court never lost \u201cfundamental jurisdiction\u201d to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal after the judge had reconsidered and rescinded his grant of a mistrial. Johnson contends that an acquittal is an acquittal, no matter how erroneous it was or at what juncture it was entered and that the acquittal bars his retrial under both the Fifth Amendment and Maryland common law\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The State maintains that more than subject matter and personal jurisdictions were required to acquit Johnson. Rather, the State asserts that the grant of Johnson\u2019s motion for mistrial initiated the beginning of new proceedings in the case and that legal insufficiency in the prior proceedings was no longer on the table.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>In Maryland, Rule 4-824 governs when a defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal during trial and the trial court\u2019s procedures in granting or dismissing a defendant\u2019s motion, as well as when a judge may acquit a defendant on her own motion<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">(a) Generally. A defendant may move for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts, or on one or more degrees of an offense which by law is divided into degrees, at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence. The defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. No objection to the motion for judgment of acquittal shall be necessary. A defendant does not waive the right to make the motion by introducing evidence during the presentation of the State\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">(b) Action by the court. If the court grants a motion for judgment of acquittal or determines on its own motion that a judgment of acquittal should be granted, it shall enter the judgment or direct the clerk to enter the judgment and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>note that it has been entered by direction of the court. The court shall specify each count or degree of an offense to which the judgment of acquittal applies,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">(c) Effect of denial. A defendant who moves for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence offered by the State may offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made. In so doing, the defendant withdraws the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Rule does not provide that a trial judge can reserve her ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made before submission of the case to the jury, nor does it provide for a post-judgment motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In contrast, Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the trial judge to reserve ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made before submission of the case to a jury. The Federal Rule also allows a defendant to move for judgment of acquittal within 14 days after a jury returns with a guilty verdict or after the jury is discharged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">(a) Before Submission to the Jury. After the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the defendant\u2019s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. The court may on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. If the court denies a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s evidence, the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">(b) Reserving Decision. The court may reserve decision on the motion, proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>(c) After Jury Verdict or Discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">(1) <em>Time for a Motion. </em>A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 14 days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">(2) <em>Ruling on the Motion. </em>If the jury has returned a guilty verdict, the court may set aside the verdict and enter an acquittal. If the jury has failed to return a verdict, the court may enter a judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">(3) <em>No Prior Motion Required. </em>A defendant is not required to move for a judgment of acquittal before the court submits the case to the jury as a prerequisite for making such a motion after jury discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">(d) Conditional Ruling on a Motion for a New Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">(1) <em>Motion for a New Trial. </em>If the court enters a judgment of acquittal after a guilty verdict, the court must also conditionally determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is later vacated or reversed. The court must specify the reasons for that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">(2) <em>Finality. </em>The court\u2019s order conditionally granting a motion for a new trial does not affect the finality of the judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">(3) <em>Appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">(A) <em>Grant of a Motion for a New Trial. </em>If the court conditionally grants a motion for a new trial and an appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal, the trial court must proceed with the new trial unless the appellate court orders otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">(B) <em>Denial of a Motion for a New Trial. </em>If the court conditionally denies a motion for a new trial, an appel-lee may assert that the denial was erroneous.

Sirbaugh, </em>27 Md.App. 290, 339 A.2d 697 (1975), and <em>Malarkey v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 126, 981 A.2d 675 (2009), in which the Court of Special Appeals rejected the trial court\u2019s ability to acquit. In <em>Sirbaugh, </em>Sirbaugh was charged with automobile manslaughter and other motor vehicle crimes. Sirbaugh\u2019s attorneys moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence and the trial judge reserved ruling on the motion, before submitting the case to the jury. The judge, thereafter, declared a mistrial due to a juror\u2019s illness, then granted the judgment of acquittal and dismissed the indictment. The State later reindicted Sirbaugh for manslaughter by automobile, and Sirbaugh moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. The trial judge granted Sir-baugh\u2019s motion, and the State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">On appeal, our intermediate appellate court determined that the trial judge could not reserve his ruling on the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>judgment of acquittal. By attempting to do so, the trial judge had effectively denied the motion, because he had been required to either grant or deny the motion before he submitted the case to the jury pursuant to Maryland Rule 755,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the predecessor to the current Rule 4-324:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">[I]n a criminal jury case, the trial judge has two options: (1) grant a motion for judgment of acquittal, or (2) deny the motion and submit the case to the jury. He has no authority to reserve his ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal and at the same time submit the case to the jury. If he follows such a course, it is tantamount to denying the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\"><em>Sirbaugh, </em>27 Md.App. at 294, 339 A.2d 697. In language prescient to the present case, the Court of Special Appeals further reasoned that, practically speaking, the declaration of the mistrial and discharge of the jury had served to divest the trial judge\u2019s authority to take any action in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">We think, however, the simple answer to the factual situation presented in this appeal is found in the action of the trial judge in declaring a mistrial and then endeavoring to make a ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>which ruling he had previously purported to reserve. It is clear that such action was a nullity since once he had declared a mistrial and dismissed the jury, he lost all authority to take any action in the case. The declaration of the mistrial and the dismissal of the jury ended the trial and ended the judge\u2019s participation therein. Thus, his purported ruling on the motion was completely ineffectual and meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In <em>Malarkey, </em>the Court of Special Appeals again had occasion to address whether the trial court could reserve ruling on the defendant\u2019s timely motion for judgment of acquittal prior to submission of the case to the jury. The judge had declared a mistrial after the jury was deadlocked. Months later, Malarkey filed a post-trial \u201cMotion for Judgment of Acquittal,\u201d which the trial court denied. On appeal, our intermediate appellate court emphasized that Rule 4-324 did not authorize a judge to be able to reserve his ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, as opposed to Rule 2-532 in the civil context<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Federal Rule 29:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>By its terms, Md. Rule 4-324 does not authorize a court to reserve its ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, in contrast to the civil context. <em>See </em>Rule 2-532. The Court of Appeals and the General Assembly are obviously aware of F. R. Crim. P. 29. Neither has seen fit to conform Rule 4-324 to F. R. Crim. P. 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><em>Malarkey, </em>188 Md.App. at 160, 981 A.2d 675. Like in <em>Sirbaugh, </em>the Court of Special Appeals determined that the trial judge\u2019s reservation of a ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal \u201cwas tantamount to a denial of the motions for acquittal when the court submitted the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 981 A.2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The implications of a trial court\u2019s acquittal of a defendant outside of the confines of the governing rule have also been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996), in which the Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of the grant of an untimely post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal outside of the purview of Federal Rule 29. The Supreme Court observed that the text of Federal Rule 29 was clear and unambiguous, and it did not permit the trial judge to grant an untimely post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal, nor did the Rule provide that the judge could render an acquittal, after the verdict, on his own motion. The Court further rejected the notion that the trial court had the inherent power to \u201ccircumvent or conflict\u201d with the Rules in order to enter the acquittal, <em>id. </em>at 426, 116 S.Ct. 1460; the Court noted that such an interpretation \u201cwould create an odd system in which defense counsel could move for judgment of acquittal for only seven days after the jury\u2019s discharge, but the court\u2019s power to enter such a judgment would linger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 116 S.Ct. 1460. The majority concluded that the provisions of the Rule were determinative of when the trial court\u2019s power to acquit came to an end:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">The dissent makes the sweeping assertion that \u201ca district court clearly has the inherent authority to ensure that a legally innocent defendant is not wrongfully convicted,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 442. Perhaps so. As the dissent itself recognizes, however, that power has come to an end once an appeal has been taken. <em>Post, </em>at 452-453. We are in accord, then, that there is <em>some </em>point at which the district court is rendered powerless to enter a judgment of acquittal, and the disagreement between us and the dissent comes down to nothing more cosmic than the question of timing\u2014which we find answered by the text of Rule 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 430-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Thus, the reasoned judgment is that when the trial judge acted outside of the strictures of Rule 4-324 in the instant case, he acted without authority. As the Supreme Court opined in <em>Carlisle, </em>the trial judge was \u201crendered powerless to enter a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 116 S.Ct. 1460.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Johnson argues, however, and the dissent in the Court of Special Appeals asserted, that an acquittal entered by a judge at any time, even though procedurally defective, engages double jeopardy protections. Johnson\u2019s counsel urged before us that a judge could enter an acquittal in a case <em>sua sponte </em>at any time after conviction, until the State would suffer prejudice. The following colloquy took place at oral argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">THE COURT: The jury was discharged. Under our facts, there\u2019s a subsequent motion filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY: Could he do it <em>sua, spontel</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aop-dedup-0\">THE COURT: Could he have done it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY: Absolutely. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">THE COURT: How long does that jurisdiction last forward in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY: Once again, it\u2019s a question with multiple answers, and I ask the Court\u2019s indulgence to answer it in a couple of different ways. First, the granting of the acquittal, in order to fend off what the judge views as an evident miscarriage of justice, can be done up until\u2014now again, case law says mistiming doesn\u2019t affect an acquittal, and we would certainly rest with that\u2014but we would say that it would last up until there was evident prejudice to the State. And the reason for that is that delay in the law takes on meaning only to the extent that it is prejudicial to a party. This Court has said that in various contexts, the Constitution\u2019s speedy trial context, the preindictment delay context, the doctrine of laches. In many contexts, a party says delay, delay, delay. That\u2019s our position. Well, delay only takes on meaning if it\u2019s prejudicial. It would be our view that whether <em>sua sponte </em>or in response to a request from a party, a judge\u2019s delay in making a ruling of that sort is not a problem so long as there has not been irremediable prejudice to the other party, in which case, honestly there would be a party. In the present case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">THE COURT: Mr. Braudes, would that include after sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY: That, of course, is not this case, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">THE COURT: I know. But when you\u2019re talking about the issue of how long in criminal cases, it could be sentencing, after appeals, after a person\u2019s been, say, imprisoned, or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">JOHNSON\u2019S ATTORNEY: If a judge, on reflection, on the basis of subsequent case law, on the basis of conscience, decides the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction of this individual, there has been a miscarriage of justice. ... In fairness, the judge should conduct a hearing on that. But does the judge retain jurisdiction to do it? Yes, absolutely. Again, absent prejudice to the State, which has not even been suggested in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Although Johnson\u2019s counsel\u2019s reasoning is open to question, he grounds it in double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">With respect to double jeopardy, this Court in <em>Kendall v. State, </em>429 Md. 476, 484-86, 56 A.3d 223 (2012), recently expounded on its jurisprudence under the federal Constitution and Maryland common law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">The federal Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d United States Constitution, Fifth Amendment. [] That protection is also a fundamental part of Maryland common law. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617, 629-30, 810 A.2d 964 (2002). In a nonjury trial, jeopardy ordinarily attaches when the first witness is sworn, <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 37 n.15, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978), although in some circumstances it may attach without the appearance of a witness if the defendant is \u201csubjected to the risk of conviction.\u201d <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 688-89, 566 A.2d 120 (1989) (acquittal following failure of prosecution witnesses to appear for trial). For each offense for which the defendant is thereafter acquitted, both the federal Constitution and State common law prohibit a second prosecution. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 796, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (federal Constitution); <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 342, 577 A.2d 795 (1990) (Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>common law). \u201cIf the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair,\u201d even if the acquittal was based on an \u201cegregiously erroneous foundation \u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); <em>see also Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962).[] Nor are double jeopardy protections vulnerable to judicial second thoughts. \u201c[Ojnce the trier of fact in a criminal case, whether it be the jury or the judge, intentionally renders a verdict of not guilty, the verdict is final and the defendant cannot later be retried on or found guilty of the same charge.\u201d <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 706, 319 A.2d 542 (1974) (even though trial judge changed mind after initially finding evidence insufficient on drug charge, further prosecution of defendant on that charge was barred); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>299 Md. 146, 153-54, 472 A.2d 981 (1984) (trial judge could not \u201creconsider\u201d and submit conspiracy charge to jury after first ruling that evidence was insufficient to establish that offense).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">It is also well established that, if a defendant seeks to have a prosecution terminated without any submission to a judge or jury as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charges and the court grants that motion, further prosecution is not barred. The critical question is \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977) (Brennan, J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Johnson urges that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617, 810 A.2d 964 (2002), in casting aside procedural improprieties and affirming the acquittals of the defendants entered by the trial courts outside of the strictures of Rule 4-324, supports his analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In <em>Taylor, </em>we consolidated the appeals in two cases in which the trial courts had pretrial motions to dismiss and in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the charges had been augmented by stipulations of facts outside the record. The primary issue was whether the charges could be resurrected or whether double jeopardy protections banned reprosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We determined that while both trial judges, in cases pending before them, had erred by exceeding the permissible scope of motions to dismiss by considering the sufficiency of the evidence, the dismissals had \u201csubstantively constituted judgments of acquittal and therefore must be given effect as such for jeopardy purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644, 810 A.2d 964. Without discussing any of the strictures of Rule 4-324, we observed that, although the trial judges had erred, their decisions had implicated double jeopardy; the courts\u2019 dismissals were not nullified by the error: \u201c \u2018[ Jurisdiction\u2019 for double jeopardy analysis means jurisdiction in a most basic sense. Merely because there was an error in the exercise of jurisdiction did not mean that the court proceedings were a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650, 810 A.2d 964 (citing <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 270, 407 A.2d 320 (1979)). Jurisdiction in a most basic sense, as referenced in <em>Taylor, </em>according to Judge Friedman in his dissent in the instant case is \u201csubject matter jurisdiction over the crime and personal jurisdiction over the defendant,\u201d which creates the context for even a procedurally defective acquittal to \u201ccreate[ ] a double jeopardy bar to repeat prosecution.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>228 Md.App. at 514, 139 A.3d 1095 (Friedman, J., dissenting); <em>see also Pulley v. State, </em>287 Md. 406, 412 A.2d 1244 (1980); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>229 Md.App. 86, 143 A.3d 177 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In relying on <em>Taylor, </em>however, as well as other cases in which acquittals were entered during the pendency of judicial proceedings, such as <em>Block, </em>286 Md. at 266, 407 A.2d 320, <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 566 A.2d 120 (1989), <em>Parojinog v. State, </em>282 Md. 256, 384 A.2d 86 (1978), and <em>Evans v. Michigan, </em>568 U.S. 313, 133 S.Ct. 1069, 185 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013), Johnson misses the mark, because only when the court has the authority to act does an acquittal implicate double jeopardy. In the present case, the judge was without authority to acquit after he failed to adhere to Rule 4-324, as well as after having declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Persuasive with respect to the judge\u2019s lack of authority to acquit when he violated the governing rule is the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>992 F.2d 635 (6th Cir. 1993). In <em>Davis, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the notion that the grant of an acquittal outside the purview of Federal Rule 29 was merely a procedural irregularity, even though the district court judge clearly had subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In reviewing the grant of an acquittal in <em>Davis, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of acquittal entered by a district court judge outside of the scope of Federal Rule 29. In so doing, the Court expressly rejected not only the ability of the judge to grant an acquittal on his own motion in a situation outside the contemplation of Rule 29 but also that the judge had the inherent power to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">As in <em>Smith, </em>it is argued here that because the literal language of the rule limits the time for making a post-verdict motion, the rule does not limit the power of the district court to act on its own motion. Acceptance of this position would indefinitely extend the power of the district courts to act, a result soundly rejected by the Court in <em>Smith </em>and <em>Robinson. </em>While the double jeopardy concerns present in <em>Smith </em>do not exist in this case, the other reasons advanced by the Court for its strict construction of Rules 33 and 45 apply equally here: the Court\u2019s reluctance to construe Rule 33 in a way that would deprive the district court of the power to act on a motion made by \u201cthe person most concerned,\u201d yet permit action by the court on its own initiative; the need to avoid subjecting judges to continuing private appeals regarding convictions; the availability of post-conviction relief to address the risk of miscarriage of justice; and the need to avoid the uncertainty and confusion that would necessarily result from delayed decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The Sixth Circuit rejected the notion that a federal district court judge has the authority to act outside the purview of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Federal Rules. In so doing, the court relied on the tenets of <em>United States v. Smith, </em>331 U.S. 469, 67 S.Ct. 1330, 91 L.Ed. 1610 (1947), in which the Supreme Court also rejected the authority of the district court judge to act outside the confines of the Federal Rules in granting a new trial, even where double jeopardy concerns could be implicated. In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court vacated the <em>sua sponte </em>grant of a new trial, outside the strictures of Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and opined about the consequences that would result in determining that judges have \u201ccontinuing power\u201d to act outside the boundaries of the Federal Rules when the time within which to act had terminated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">[W]e would be reluctant to hold that the court has a continuing power on his own initiative to grant what the defendant has not the right to go into open court and ask. To approve the practice followed in this case would almost certainly subject trial judges to private appeals or application by counsel or friends of one convicted. We think that expiration of the time within which relief can openly be asked of the judge, terminates the time within which it can properly be granted on the court\u2019s own initiative. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">* \u215c \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">... The trial judge is given power by the Rules to entertain motions for new trial within five days after verdict and may extend that time for so long as he thinks necessary for proper consideration of the course of the trial. But extension of that time indefinitely is no insurance of justice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>On the contrary, as time passes, the peculiar ability which the trial judge has to pass on the fairness of the trial is dissipated as the incidents and nuances of the trial leave his mind to give way to immediate business. It is in the interest of justice that a decision on the propriety of a trial be reached as soon after it has ended as is possible, and that decision be not deferred until the trial\u2019s story has taken on the uncertainty and dimness of things long past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 67 S.Ct. 1330. In shunning assertions prophetic of Johnson\u2019s argument before us in the present case, the Justices considered the implications of double jeopardy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">A majority of the Court of Appeals thought it a shocking suggestion that on mature reflection a District Judge may not correct an injustice because his first reaction was different. We doubt if many cases will occur in which very shocking injustices will survive after the trial court denies a motion based on detailed recital of grounds for new trial and a Court of Appeals affirms. This possibility seems too remote to induce us to hold that a trial court\u2019s denial of a new trial, affirmed on appeal, has no finality and that a trial judge may, even after service of a sentence has begun, set the whole proceedings aside and start over\u2014if indeed a new start would not also be forbidden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 476, 67 S.Ct. 1330; <em>see also McGraw v. State, </em>688 So.2d 764 (Miss. 1997) (determining that the acquittal did not bar retrial under double jeopardy principles because the motion for reconsideration of the denial of a directed verdict was not filed within ten days of the judgment as provided for in the governing rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Acting outside the applicable Federal Rules, then, divested the trial judges in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Smith </em>of the authority to act. The same holds true in the present case, because the trial judge acted outside of Rule 4-324, which is not a mere procedural irregularity but a dispossession of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Insofar as <em>Taylor </em>and the other cases upon which Johnson relies, Rule 4-324 was not in play, the matter in issue was still pending, and various rules, statutes, and precedent permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the judge\u2019s actions. <em>See Taylor, </em>371 Md. at 644-48, 810 A.2d 964 (determining that an acquittal on the merits erroneously rendered as a motion to dismiss under Maryland Rule 4-252 implicated double jeopardy principles); <em>Daff, </em>317 Md. at 689-90, 566 A.2d 120 (barring retrial under double jeopardy principles when the judge acquitted after the State failed to present evidence, because prior jurisprudence dictated that after the case was called, jeopardy attached); <em>Parojinog, </em>282 Md. at 262, 265, 384 A.2d 86 (explaining that under the statutory scheme, the juvenile court judge was required to consider waiver issue first and failed to do so prior to adjudication of guilt, implicating double jeopardy); <em>Evans, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1075 (holding that Evans was acquitted in reliance on a Michigan rule of criminal procedure, albeit in error).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The only case cited by Johnson that gives us pause in our analytical framework with respect to the effect of a judge acting outside of the scope of her authority in relation to an applicable rule is <em>Block, </em>286 Md. at 266, 407 A.2d 320, in which we reversed a determination that double jeopardy did not bar a second prosecution. In <em>Block, </em>the district court had rendered a guilty verdict but postponed sentencing. Before sentencing, Block had moved for reconsideration at which time the trial court had reconsidered and changed the verdict to not guilty, in derogation of Maryland District Rule 770<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which only permitted the judge to grant a new trial. We applied double jeopardy principles and barred the second prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>We pause only momentarily but soldier on in our analysis for two reasons: first, our decision in the recent case of <em>Kendall, </em>429 Md. at 487-93, 56 A.3d 223, did not reach the same result as in <em>Block, </em>although the district court judge in <em>Kendall </em>also had erred in entering a not guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Secondly, the procedural posture of <em>Block </em>is readily distinguishable from the instant case, because the trial judge here lost his authority to acquit Johnson once he declared the mistrial and discharged the jury, as the Court of Special Appeals opined.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">When a mistrial is granted upon a defendant\u2019s motion, reprosecution is ordinarily not prohibited, in the absence of prosecutorial misconduct or judicial \u201coverreaching,\u201d as the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality opinion), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">If that right to go to a particular tribunal is valued, it is because, independent of the threat of bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor, the defendant has a significant interest in the decision whether or not to take the case from the jury when circumstances occur which might be thought to warrant a declaration of mistrial. Thus, where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\"><em>See also United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 93, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">In the present case, the judge expressly found that prosecu-torial misconduct had not occurred, a finding about which clear error has not been alleged nor shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Once the judge granted the mistrial in the present case, he <em>terminated </em>the proceedings in Johnson\u2019s favor, \u201cbefore any determination of factual guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 94, 98 S.Ct. 2187. We have explored, the implications of the termination of proceedings by a mistrial in <em>Harrod v. State, </em>423 Md. 24, 31 A.3d 173 (2011), in which we explored the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>State\u2019s obligation to timely pretrial notice of a chemist\u2019s report to the defendant before a retrial, after a mistrial in the first trial had been declared. We declared \u201cblack letter\u201d law with respect to the ability to retry the defendant as well as the implications for the parties on retrial, who are restored to their original positions, as though the first trial had not occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">It is well-established in our jurisprudence that the grant of a mistrial upon a defendant\u2019s request or consent does not preclude a retrial. <em>Bell v. State, </em>286 Md. 193, 202, 406 A.2d 909, 913 (1979). We have noted, in <em>dicta, </em>that the grant of a mistrial is \u201ctantamount to a holding that there had been no trial at all,\u201d which does not \u201cdeny either the accused or the State the opportunity to litigate directly their rights on retrial.\u201d <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 670-671, 381 A.2d 671, 674 (1978); <em>see also Powers v. State, </em>285 Md. 269, 285, 401 A.2d 1031, 1040 (1979) (\u201ca mistrial is equivalent to no trial at all\u201d). Similarly, of the grant of a new trial, we have suggested, at least in the usual context, that the effect \u201cis to leave the cause in the same condition as if no previous trial had been held.\u201d <em>Cottman v. State, </em>395 Md. 729, 743, 912 A.2d 620, 628 (2006), quoting <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360, 367, 46 A.2d 607, 610 (1946); <em>see also State Use of Scruggs v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>177 Md. 451, 454, 9 A.2d 753, 754 (1939) (\u201c[T]he beneficial procedural incidence of the order is to reestablish the equality in law of the parties, which was lost, by restoring them to the position of the litigants at the beginning of the trial before a jury.\u201d); <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313, 965 A.2d 912, 923 (2009) (concluding that the grant of a new trial \u201cwiped the slate clean,\u201d and revived the State\u2019s obligation to provide notice of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty prior to sentencing), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 Md. 49, 972 A.2d 862 (2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 35, 31 A.3d 173. In <em>Harrod, </em>in reaching our conclusion that the State was obligated to provide the defendant notice of the chemist report, we were clear that \u201cit is not a leap of faith to acknowledge that the grant of a mistrial in a criminal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>does create a \u2018tabula rasa\u2019 \u201d which \u201crequires the litigants to observe pretrial procedures once again.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The closing bell, thus, rang when the trial judge in the present case granted the mistrial. Johnson asserts, however, that other state courts have permitted the revocation of the grant of a mistrial, which reflects that a trial judge continues to have the authority to act in a case after the declaration of a mistrial. Johnson does not cite to any Maryland authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that the judge can revoke the grant of a mistrial, although it is clear that other jurisdictions have entertained the trial court\u2019s ability to revoke the grant of a mistrial. In <em>Rodriguez v. </em>State, 852 S.W.2d 516, 520 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (en banc), the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals determined that the \u201ctrial court retained its authority to withdraw its order of mistrial\u201d because the jury had not been discharged nor even advised of the mistrial; in <em>People v. Dawkins, </em>82 N.Y.2d 226, 604 N.Y.S.2d 34, 624 N.E.2d 162, 164 (1993), New York\u2019s supreme court determined that the trial court had authority to revoke the grant of a mistrial based upon jury deadlock before the jury had been discharged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that this Court would adopt the same reasoning regarding the judge\u2019s authority to rescind her grant of a mistrial before the jury was discharged, it is a simple truth that in the present case the jury had been discharged weeks before the judge revoked his grant of a mistrial, which distinguishes this case from those cited by Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The import of discharging the jury has been explored in <em>Jones v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 430, 920 A.2d 1 (2007), in which the trial court had failed to poll or hearken the jury before the jurors had been discharged but had recalled the jurors and polled and hearkened them to the guilty verdict weeks later. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals demurred to this practice and stated, \u201cOnce a jury is dispersed, and beyond the presence of the court, it cannot later be reconstituted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 920 A.2d 1. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has gone further in elucidating the effect of a mistrial after a jury has been discharged and dispersed, in <em>Camden v. Circuit Court of Second Judicial Circuit, </em>892 F.2d 610, 616 n.7 (7th Cir. 1989), in which it stated, \u201cWhile the mistrial declaration alone was not a talismanic utterance, the discharge and dispersal of the jury rendered the mistrial a <em>fait accompli. </em>Once the jury is discharged and has dispersed, a trial court is unable to reconsider its intention to declare a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We do, moreover, find persuasive the discussion in <em>State v. Meyer, </em>953 S.W.2d 822 (Tex, App.-Corpus Christi 1997), of the effect of a mistrial and discharge of the jury when a trial judge, six months later, acquitted the defendant based on his previously filed motion. In <em>Meyer, </em>the Texas court acknowledged that the trial judge had continued to have subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction after he declared a mistrial but declared that the judge acted without authority, thereby exceeding \u201cthe boundaries of judicial propriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825. The court specifically determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">[W]e hold that withdrawing the mistrial order was not a viable option for the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">A court\u2019s authority to act is limited to those actions authorized by constitution, statute, or common law. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>821 S.W.2d 609, 613 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). In determining the nature of the trial court\u2019s actions, we look to the effect rather than the label applied to the matter by the court or parties. <em>State v. Evans, </em>843 S.W.2d 576, 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment is actually the dismissal of a prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">Generally, a trial court has no authority to dismiss a case unless so requested by the prosecutor. <em>Johnson, </em>821 S.W.2d at 613. There are, however, certain exceptions to that rule. A criminal case can be dismissed without the State\u2019s consent when (1) a speedy trial has been denied, (2) the charging instrument is defective, or (3) article 32.01 of the Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Criminal Procedure has been violated. <em>Id. </em>at 612 n.2. However, none of the exceptions apply in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s judgment is actually the dismissal of a prosecution, we hold that the State is entitled to appeal under Code of Criminal Procedure article 44.01(a). We hold that the trial court did not have the authority to dismiss the prosecution in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The trial judge in the present case, thus, acted without authority in acquitting Johnson, in contravention of Rule 4-324 and weeks after he had declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. The acquittal was granted, thus, not in the context of a mere procedural irregularity but in the circumstance in which the judge was totally without authority to act. As a result, the federal Constitution and Maryland common law double jeopardy principles are not implicated, and Johnson may be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. Maryland Rule 4-324 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-15\">(a) Generally.
