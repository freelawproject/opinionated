In the car with him were Manuel Rios, Marcos Rios, and Jesus Rios.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Verdin slowed down for a stop sign at the intersection of Ralston and Euclid Avenue, defendant Francisco Garcia (defendant) walked from the garage of a nearby house, down the driveway, and up to Verdin\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">Defendant pulled out a gun. He told Verdin and the others to get out of the car, but no one in the car moved. Defendant then shot out the left rear window of the car. Manuel Rios, who was sitting in the backseat next to the window, ducked; glass fell on his head, but he was not hurt. Defendant reached into the car, turned off the ignition, and took the keys. Now everyone got out of the car. As Verdin got out, defendant kicked him in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">Verdin and Manuel Rios were wearing neck chains; defendant pulled the chains off, breaking them. At this point, two to four other men came down the driveway and joined defendant. One of them had a knife. The one with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1763\">*1763</page-number>the knife asked Marcos Rios for money; when Marcos said he had none, he took Marcos\u2019s hat. Defendant continued to hold the gun on the victims while one of his accomplices searched the car. Defendant then told the victims to get back in the car. He gave the keys back to Verdin and said, \u201cLeave, get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">As the car started to pull away, defendant fired three or four shots at it. Several of these shots hit the car. Verdin stepped on the gas. He turned left onto Euclid, but the pavement was wet and he lost control of the car; it crashed into a light pole. The victims jumped out of the car and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">On August 11, 1992, a petition concerning defendant was filed in juvenile court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602. On September 3, 1992, the juvenile court found that defendant was not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. On September 9, 1992, the juvenile court dismissed the petition and ordered that criminal proceedings against defendant be commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">Accordingly, on September 8, 1992, a felony complaint was filed against defendant. On September 17, defendant was held to answer. On October 1, 1992, an information was filed charging defendant as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">Counts 1 through 3: second degree robbery (\u00a7 211) of Verdin, Manuel Rios, and Marcos Rios, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-11\">Count 4: attempted second degree robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 664) of Jesus Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-12\">Count 5: shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">Counts 6 through 9: assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) on Verdin, Manuel Rios, Marcos Rios, and Jesus Rios, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">In connection with every count except count 5, it was alleged for sentence enhancement purposes that defendant personally used a firearm (former \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a); amended by Stats. 1994, First Ex. Sess.1993-1994, ch. 31, \u00a7 3 [increasing upper term from five years to ten years]), and that defendant was armed with a firearm (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">On December 3, 1992, following trial, a jury found defendant guilty as charged and found all enhancement allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1764\">*1764</page-number>On December 29, 1992, the trial court sentenced defendant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">On count 1, robbery of Verdin: three years (the midterm), plus four years (the midterm) on the personal firearm use enhancement, to be served consecutively. Execution of sentence on the arming enhancement was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">On counts 2 and 3, robbery of Manuel Rios and Marcos Rios: one year (one-third the midterm of three years) on each, to be served consecutively. Execution of sentence on both enhancements was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">On count 4, attempted robbery of Jesus Rios: eight months (one-third the midterm of two years), to be served consecutively. Execution of sentence on both enhancements was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">On count 5, shooting at occupied motor vehicle: one year, eight months (one-third the midterm of five years), to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">On count 6, assault with a firearm on Verdin: one year (one-third the midterm of three years), to be served consecutively. Execution of sentence on both enhancements was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">On counts 7, 8, and 9, assault with a firearm on Manuel Rios, Marcos Rios, and Jesus Rios: three years (the midterm) on each, plus four years (the midterm) on the personal firearm use enhancement on each count, to be served concurrently. Execution of sentence on the arming enhancement on each count was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">The trial court imposed a total prison term of 12 years, 4 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">Half an hour later, however, counsel for defendant brought it to the trial court\u2019s attention that defendant had been under 18 when the crimes were committed. Accordingly, the trial court vacated the sentence it had imposed, suspended the criminal proceedings, and remanded defendant to the California Youth Authority (CYA) for an amenability report (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">The CYA found defendant not amenable to CYA treatment and training. Accordingly, on May 6, 1993, the trial court reinstated the criminal proceedings and resentenced defendant. On count 1 and the personal firearm use enhancement thereto, instead of imposing the midterms of three and four years, the trial court imposed the upper term of five years on each. Also, whereas the first time, the trial court ran defendant\u2019s sentences on counts 7, 8, and 9 concurrently with the sentence on count 1, the second time, it stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1765\">*1765</page-number>execution of sentence on counts 7, 8, and 9. Otherwise, the trial court imposed the same sentence it had before. The total prison sentence was 15 years, 4 months, less credit for time served. The trial court ordered defendant housed at CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">The Trial Court\u2019s Jurisdiction to Resentence Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to vacate its first sentence and to resentence him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">The leading case on jurisdiction to increase a prison sentence once it has been rendered is still <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 521 [342 P.2d 889]. There, the defendant was sentenced to six months in jail. The trial court issued a written order remanding the defendant to the custody of the sheriff \u201cpending such further disposition as the court may order,\u201d and the sheriff transported the defendant to jail. When the clerk went to prepare the minute order, however, he realized that a prior conviction allegation had not yet been tried. He notified the judge and both counsel, then phoned the sheriff and told him to return the defendant to court. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 536.) The trial court \u201crescinded\u201d its previous sentence, found the prior conviction allegation true, and sentenced the defendant to prison. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 526-527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">The Supreme Court began by noting that \u201c. . . the jurisdictional problem, as limited by the facts, is that of the trial court\u2019s power, after rendition of judgment, to change a valid sentence so as to increase the punishment.\u201d (52 Cal.2d at p. 529, fns. omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It held that the trial court lost such jurisdiction once the sentence was entered in the minutes of the court, or the defendant began serving the sentence. (52 Cal.2d at pp. 529-531.) It rejected, as dictum, statements in earlier cases to the effect that the trial court might also lose jurisdiction once the defendant was restrained by the sentence. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 533-534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1766\">*1766</page-number>The court further held that defendant Thomas had not yet begun serving his jail sentence. \u201cA California defendant sentenced to county jail does not mechanically pass from the control of the court to the control of the executive, for the sheriff is both a ministerial officer of the court for the purpose of keeping defendant until service of sentence begins [citations] and also the executive officer who executes the jail sentence [citations].\u201d (52 Cal.2d at pp. 531-532.) \u201cFurthermore, under California procedure, after pronouncement of a judgment of imprisonment the sheriff continues to detain the prisoner, whether or not such officer has a copy of a paper stating that the prisoner is to be held under such judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 532.) \u201cIn the circumstances here presented we think that the sheriff, in moving defendant about the county, and into and out of the jail, under an order which authorized him \u2018to hold said defendant pending such further disposition as the court may order,\u2019 continued to act as an officer of the court restraining defendant for the court and did not begin to act as an executive officer carrying out execution of a sentence which had not yet been entered in the minutes.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 533.) Thus, it concluded that the trial court properly resentenced the defendant. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 536.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">More recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 335, the Supreme Court dealt with a case in which the trial court modified its sentence so as to <em>lessen </em>the punishment. In <em>Karaman, </em>the defendant was sentenced to four years in prison, including two years for a personal firearm use enhancement. This sentence was entered in the minutes; however, execution of the sentence was stayed for one week so the defendant could help his family move. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 341.) When the week was up, however, the trial court, on its own motion, modified the sentence by striking the enhancement and sentencing the defendant to just two years in prison. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 341-342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">The People argued that once the first sentence was entered in the minutes, the trial court lost jurisdiction to modify it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 339, 343.) The Supreme Court disagreed. It accepted the holding of <em>Thomas </em>that the trial court loses jurisdiction to <em>increase </em>a prison sentence <em>either </em>upon entry of the sentence in the minutes, <em>or </em>upon execution of the sentence. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 350.) However, it held that the trial court does <em>not </em>lose jurisdiction to <em>decrease </em>a prison sentence upon entry in the minutes; it loses such jurisdiction <em>only </em>upon execution of the sentence. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 339, 350-352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">It therefore also discussed what constitutes \u201cexecution of sentence.\u201d It noted that the sentence itself is the oral pronouncement of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 344. in. 9.) Execution of sentence, by contrast, begins when a copy of either the minute order or the abstract of judgment is delivered to the sheriff:</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1767\">*1767</page-number>\u201cThe manner of executing a judgment sentencing a defendant to imprisonment is prescribed by the Penal Code. When a judgment other than death has been pronounced, and the judgment is for incarceration in a state prison, either a certified copy of the minute order or a certified abstract of the judgment \u2018shall be forthwith furnished to the officer whose duty it is to execute the . . . judgment, and no other warrant or authority is necessary to justify or require its execution\u2019; the certified abstract or minute order constitutes the commitment. (\u00a7 1213 . . . .) The commitment document is the order remanding the defendant to prison and is \u2018 \u201cthe process and authority for carrying the judgment and sentence into effect.\u201d [Citations].\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">\u201cIf the judgment is for imprisonment, \u2018the defendant must forthwith be committed to the custody of the proper officer and by him or her detained until the judgment is complied with.\u2019 (\u00a71215.) The sheriff, upon receipt of the certified abstract of judgment \u2018or minute order thereof,\u2019 is required to deliver the defendant to the warden of the state prison together with the certified abstract of judgment or minute order. (\u00a7 1216.) \u2018It is clear then that at least upon the receipt of the abstract of the judgment by the sheriff, the execution of the judgment is in progress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 344-345, fns. and citations omitted, quoting <em>In re Black </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 881, 890 [59 Cal.Rptr. 429, 428 P.2d 293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Here, the first sentence was never entered in the minutes. Thus, the question of whether the trial court lost jurisdiction to vacate the first sentence turns on whether execution of sentence had begun. Defendant points out that after the trial court imposed the first sentence, it remanded defendant into custody, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Anything further, before I remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense Counsel]?</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Remand to the custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">Under <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Karaman, </em>however, this oral pronouncement was ineffective to commence execution of the first sentence. It merely remanded defendant to the sheriff\u2019s temporary custody until such time as the court might issue a written minute order or abstract of the first sentence and deliver it to the sheriff. This, however, never happened. Defendant never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1768\">*1768</page-number>began serving the first sentence. Thus, the trial court retained jurisdiction to vacate the first sentence and to resentence him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">IV., V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">Failure to State Reasons for the Increased Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">When the trial court resentenced defendant, it noted that although it had previously sentenced him to 12 years and 4 months, it intended to sentence him to 15 years and 4 months. It explained: \u201cI have reviewed all my notes of trial, I have restudied the probation report, and I just look at it at a different angle at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">The trial court then explained that it was imposing the upper term on count 1 and the personal firearm use enhancement thereto because \u201cthese acts perpetrated by this defendant constitute^, at least in my mind, threats of great bodily injury and in my mind also viciousness on the part of this defendant.\u201d (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 421(a)(1) [\u201ccrime involved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness.\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">Finally, the trial court explained that it was imposing consecutive sentences because it found that defendant had engaged in violent conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1769\">*1769</page-number>indicating a serious danger to society, and had a prior sustained juvenile delinquency petition consisting of six counts of attempted murder. (See rules 421(b)(1) [\u201cThe defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger to society\u201d] and 421(b)(2) [\u201cThe defendant\u2019s . . . sustained petitions in juvenile delinquency proceedings are numerous or of increasing seriousness\u201d]; see also rule 425(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to explain its reasons for resentencing defendant to a longer prison term than in its first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">The trial court is required to state the reasons for any \u201csentence choice\u201d on the record at the time of sentencing. (\u00a7 1170, subd. (c).) \u201c \u2018Sentence choice\u2019 means the selection of any disposition of the case which does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.\u201d (Rule 405(f).) Typical sentence choices requiring a statement of reasons include imposing a prison term (and thereby denying probation) (rule 406(b)(2)), imposing the upper term rather than the midterm (rule 406(b)(4)), and imposing consecutive sentences (rule 406(b)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">Here, the trial court stated on the record its reasons for each of these sentence choices. Defendant, however, claims that the decision to increase the sentence was, in itself, a sentence choice. The trial court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing the second sentence, defendant would argue, did not adequately explain this choice, because the same reasons existed when it imposed the first sentence; the trial court should also have explained why those reasons justified imposing upper terms on count 1 and the related sentence enhancement the second time, even though they did not the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">We disagree. When the trial court resentenced defendant, it stated reasons for each of the sentence choices it made, including its choice to impose upper terms. It did not have to explain in any more detail why the resulting sentence was greater than the first sentence. The first sentence had been vacated \u2014 for good reason, as we indicated in part HI, <em>ante. </em>It was a nullity. The trial court properly resentenced defendant \u201cfrom scratch.\u201d The fact that the resulting sentence was greater than the vacated sentence was not a \u201csentence choice\u201d requiring a statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">When a trial court resentences a defendant after reversal on appeal, it clearly has discretion to increase or decrease elements of the sentence (although there may be limits on its ability to increase the aggregate sentence). (See generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Begnaud </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1548, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1770\">*1770</page-number>1556-1558 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 507].) In such resentencing \u2014 just as in sentencing \u2014 the trial court must state reasons. We have found no case, however, holding that it must explain why its second sentence differs from its first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Begnaud, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1548, the trial court originally selected an assault count as the principal term, leaving a burglary count as the subordinate term. It sentenced the defendant to the midterm for the assault, and to one-third the midterm, to be served consecutively, for the burglary. The defendant appealed; the assault conviction was reversed and thereafter dismissed. On remand, the trial court imposed the upper term for the burglary. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1550-1551.) The defendant again appealed, contending that the trial court failed to state adequate reasons for imposing the upper term. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1551, 1558.) We held that the trial court properly relied on premeditation and on the fact that the defendant had been on parole as aggravating factors. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1558-1559.) Notably, we did not require the trial court to explain why it had not used these factors to impose the upper term when it originally sentenced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">Defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 437 [229 Cal.Rptr. 131, 722 P.2d 905]. There, after the trial court had sentenced the defendant, the Board of Prison Terms concluded that the sentence was disparate. It moved for resentencing under former section 1170, subdivision (f) (repealed by Stats. 1992, ch. 695, \u00a7 10; see now, \u00a7 1170, subd. (d)). (42 Cal.3d at p. 444.) The trial court refused to adjust the sentence to eliminate the asserted disparity. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 445.) The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court had failed to give the board\u2019s findings sufficient weight. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 445-449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">The Supreme Court also held that on remand, the trial court should state reasons for its ruling on the motion. (42 Cal.3d at pp. 449-451.) It recognized that there was no statute requiring such a statement; thus, it exercised its own \u201cinherent power to require a statement of reasons.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 449.) It explained that a statement of reasons \u201cserves a number of interests: it is frequently essential to meaningful review; it acts as an inherent guard against careless decisions, insuring that the judge himself analyzes the problem and recognizes the grounds for his decision; and it aids in preserving public confidence in the decision-making process by helping to persuade the parties and the public that the decision-making is careful, reasoned and equitable.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 449-450.) Finally, it rejected an argument that the trial court\u2019s original statement of reasons for imposing the sentence was sufficient. \u201cWhen the trial judge originally imposed his sentence ... he was presumably unaware of its disparate character; in stating the reasons for the sentence he would perceive no need to explain why he was imposing one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1771\">*1771</page-number>substantially more severe than those imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>{Id,., </em>at p. 451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">We see no similar cause to require a statement of reasons here. When the trial court resentenced defendant, it necessarily <em>was </em>aware of its first sentence. Thus, it presumably felt that its statement of reasons was adequate to explain the sentence choices which resulted in a sentence longer than the first sentence. We can review these reasons to determine whether they in fact support the trial court\u2019s sentence choices. If they do, we, the parties, and the public can feel comfortable that the sentencing decision was \u201ccareful, reasoned and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">We cannot say that just because the trial court changed its mind the second sentence was somehow arbitrary or capricious. To say that sentencing decisions are discretionary is to say that different reasonable decision makers \u2014 or, as in this case, the same reasonable decision maker at different times \u2014 could arrive at different decisions, even on the same facts. So long as the decision ultimately made is supported by the reasons given for it, it is not so arbitrary and capricious as to constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not have to state reasons for imposing an increased sentence as compared to the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Failure to State \u201cUltimate Facts\u201d Constituting Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing upper terms failed to state \u201cultimate facts\u201d in violation of rule 420(e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He notes that one purpose for the requirement of a statement of reasons is to facilitate appellate review. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lock </em>(1981) 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1772\">*1772</page-number>Cal.3d 454, 459 [179 Cal.Rptr. 56, 637 P.2d 292]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1477, 1489 [267 Cal.Rptr. 865].) He asserts that here it is impossible to determine whether the trial court imposed upper terms based on appropriate facts, or inappropriate facts \u2014 for example, facts that would give rise to a prohibited dual use. (See \u00a7 1170, subd. (b); rules 420(c) and (d).) Thus, he claims the statement of reasons was so conclusory as to deprive him of \u201cmeaningful review of his sentence.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Although the People recognize that defendant is making this contention, they never expressly respond to it. Evidently they consider it sufficient to argue that the trial court\u2019s stated reasons were supported by the evidence. We find that defendant\u2019s contention is substantial and deserves \u2014 even requires \u2014 more extended consideration. Nevertheless, in the end we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Defendant cites no case holding a statement of reasons inadequate because the reasons stated were not \u201cultimate facts,\u201d and we have found no such case. To the contrary, we find numerous cases in which, as here, the trial court stated its reasons for imposing the upper term by finding one or more of the aggravating circumstances listed in rule 421, and did not cite facts in support of its finding. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 583, 638 [268 Cal.Rptr. 399, 789 P.2d 127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Webber </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1146, 1168-1169 [279 Cal.Rptr. 437]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 145, 155-156 [203 Cal.Rptr. 562].) One sentencing \u201cscript\" which is widely relied upon recommends stating reasons in this form. (Ryan, Superior Court Sentencing Script (1995) \u00a7\u00a7 5.2-5.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Huber </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 601 [227 Cal.Rptr. 113], the trial court identified the aggravating factors it was relying on in imposing consecutive sentences by quoting them from the applicable rules. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 627-628.) The defendant contended \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s recitation of ultimate facts without elaboration [was] inadequate because such an approach to sentencing fails to facilitate appellate review and fails to ensure careful decision making.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 628.) The appellate court disagreed, saying, \u201cwe have been cited no case which finds error when a trial court uses the language of the rules in reciting its reasons for the sentencing choice.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 628-629.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly in <em>People </em>v. <em>Golliver </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1612 [269 Cal.Rptr. 191], the trial court explained its decision to deny probation by paraphrasing factors from the applicable rule. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1773\">*1773</page-number>1616-1617.) We stated, citing <em>Huber, </em>that . . there is nothing wrong with giving reasons for a sentencing choice in this manner.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1617.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\"><em>Huber, </em>as we have mentioned, involved the imposition of consecutive sentences; <em>Golliver </em>involved the denial of probation. Under section 1170, subdivision (c), the trial court is required merely to \u201cstate the reasons\u201d for these sentencing choices. (Italics added.) This case, by contrast, involves the imposition of the upper term of imprisonment. Under section 1170, subdivision (b), the trial court must \u201cset forth on the record the <em>facts and reasons </em>for imposing the upper or lower term.\u201d (Italics added; see generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Prothro </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 166,170-171 [263 Cal.Rptr. 433].) In <em>Golliver, </em>we noted this distinction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Golliver, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1617), and we limited our holding to those sentence choices governed by section 1170, subdivision (c), for which only \u201creasons\u201d need be stated. (219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1617, 1620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">The only explanation we have been able to find for why section 1170, subdivision (b) requires \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d rather than just \u201creasons\u201d \u201cis that section 1170(b) is used for imposing an upper or lower term based on circumstances in mitigation and aggravation. The court\u2019s sentencing power is limited by the prohibition against the dual use of facts for aggravation and enhancement. [Citations.] Appellate review of alleged dual use of facts error would be far more difficult without requiring the sentencing court to explain which facts it was using for which sentencing purposes. This limitation does not apply to section 1170(c) choices.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prothro, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 171, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">This supposed explanation, however, does not hold up. For example, dual use limitations prohibit the imposition of consecutive sentences based on either an element of the crime (rule 425(b)(iii)), or the fact of an enhancement (rule 425(b)(ii)). Nevertheless, the choice to sentence consecutively is governed by section 1170, subdivision (c) and the trial court need only state \u201creasons,\u201d not \u201cfacts and reasons,\u201d for this choice. On the other hand, we know of no dual use limitations on the imposition of the <em>lower </em>term. Nevertheless, the choice to impose the lower term, as well as the upper term, is governed by section 1170, subdivision (b). The trial court must state both \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d for this choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1774\">*1774</page-number>We believe a statement of reasons for imposing an upper or lower term is not inadequate merely because it uses the language of the rules without further elaboration. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mathews </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 704 [162 Cal.Rptr. 615], the trial court had \u201csummarily listed circumstances in aggravation, as follows: \u2018The facts surrounding the commission of the instant offense indicate some degree of professionalism and premeditation. ([Cal. Rules of Court] Rule 421(a)(8).) Defendant\u2019s prior convictions, both as a juvenile and as an adult, are numerous and are of increasing seriousness. (Rule 421(b)(2).) Defendant was on parole when he committed the crime. (Rule 421(b)(4).) Defendant\u2019s past performance on probation and parole has been unsatisfactory. (Rule 421(b)(5)).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 709.) The appellate court noted that this \u201creferred] \u2014 at least in general terms \u2014 to proper matters in aggravation,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe statement of reasons for imposition of the upper term, while spare, was legally sufficient.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">A statement of reasons in this form states \u201cultimate facts.\u201d \u201cUltimate facts\u201d are \u201c[fjacts which are necessary to determine issues in [a] case, as distinguished from [the] evidentiary facts supporting them,\u201d hence the \u201c[fjacts necessary and essential for [a] decision by [a] court.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1522, col. a; see <em>Division of Labor Law Enforcement </em>v. <em>Transpacific Transportation Co. </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 268, 274 [137 Cal.Rptr. 855]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Santamaria </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 921-922 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81].) In the sentencing context, the factors listed in the rules, such as that \u201cthe crime involved ... [a] threat of great bodily harm,\u201d or \u201cviciousness\u201d (rule 421(a)(1)), are such \u201cultimate facts.\u201d We believe that if a statement of reasons includes such \u201cultimate facts,\u201d then it necessarily states \u201cfacts\u201d within the meaning of section 1170, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Finally, such a statement of reasons will ordinarily permit meaningful appellate review. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Enright </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 631 [183 Cal.Rptr. 249], the trial court denied probation; in its statement of reasons, it listed those factors favoring a grant of probation and those factors favoring denial of probation simply by citing the applicable portions of rule 414. Similarly, it stated its reasons for imposing the upper principal term and consecutive subordinate terms by citing the applicable rules. (132 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636.) The appellate court held the statement of reasons inadequate: <em>\u201cThough technically the number recitation procedure used here would permit meaningful review at a later date, </em>it effectively deprives the parties of the opportunity to correct any misconceptions or errors at that time because the ability to do so would require ability to correlate instantaneously and accurately the rule numbers and letters to the rule language.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 636, italics added.) Thus, <em>Enright </em>indicated that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1775\">*1775</page-number>the statement of reasons had used the wording of the applicable rules, rather than just their numbers, it would have adequately facilitated review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">We do not believe the statement of reasons must eliminate every conceivable possibility of error. The trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to a presumption of correctness. Although the statement of reasons is intended to facilitate \u201cmeaningful review,\u201d this means no more than that review to which defendant is entitled. For example, as we will discuss in more detail in part X, <em>post, </em>when an appellant claims the trial court made an impermissible dual use of a fact as both an enhancement and an aggravating factor (see \u00a7 1170, subd. (b)), the reviewing court looks at whether the trial court <em>could have </em>based the aggravating factor on evidence <em>other </em>than that which gave rise to the enhancement. If so, the sentence may stand. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 436, 445-446 [172 Cal.Rptr. 652].) If, on the other hand, the trial court could <em>only </em>have based the aggravating factor on the evidence giving rise to the enhancement, the sentence must be reversed. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarado </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 1003, 1028 [184 Cal.Rptr. 483].) If the trial court\u2019s sentencing scheme and its statement of reasons therefor are supported by available, appropriate, relevant evidence, the statement of reasons need not also demonstrate that the trial court did <em>not </em>rely on inappropriate or irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Applying these standards, we find that the trial court\u2019s statement of reasons was adequate to permit us to review defendant\u2019s dual usd claims and his other claims of sentencing error. We will discuss these claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">VIH.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Dual Use of \u201cForce or Fear\u201d Element of Robbery as an Aggravating Circumstance</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">\u201cRobbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) Defendant argues that if the trial court based its finding of \u201cthreats of great bodily injury\u201d on defendant\u2019s threatening conduct during the robbery (rather than on the shots he fired at Verdin\u2019s car as it sped away), then the \u201cforce or fear\u201d element of robbery was used to impose upper terms \u2014 a prohibited dual use of fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">This argument, however, has been repeatedly rejected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 354, 369 [184 Cal.Rptr. 186]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1776\">*1776</page-number>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 591, 601-602 [165 Cal.Rptr. 179], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353, 356-357, fn. 16 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 491, 496 [163 CaLRptr. 1].) \u201c[T]he elements of force and fear do not need to be extreme for purposes of constituting robbery. [Citations.] [H This means that the threat of bodily harm can frequently exceed the minimum requirement necessary for purposes of establishing robbery.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 602.)

In <em>In re Michael L. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 81 [216 Cal.Rptr. 140, 702 P.2d 222], the defendant was convicted of robbery, with an enhancement for personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd.

There, after the defendant shot his girlfriend, he pleaded guilty to assault with a firearm and admitted a personal firearm use enhancement allegation. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 77.) The trial court sentenced the defendant to the upper term on the enhancement, based on the fact that he had been on probation at the time of the offense (see rule 421(b)(4)). (13 Cal.App.4th at p. 78.) We began by noting that \u201cin respect to sentencing a defendant for the crime of which he was convicted, . . . rule 421 [] subdivides aggravating circumstances into two categories: facts relating to the crime and facts relating to the defendant. Aggravating circumstances arising from facts relating to the crime are found in rule 421(a) and aggravating facts relating to the defendant are found in rule 421(b). [1 We believe it is proper to analyze the meaning of \u2018circumstances in aggravation that relate directly to the fact giving rise to the enhancement\u2019 by applying this distinction that has been made in . . . rule 421 between facts relating to the crime and those relating to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 78-79, fn. omitted.) We concluded that an aggravating factor used to impose the upper term on an enhancement \u201cmust relate to the commission of the act constituting the alleged enhancement, not to the defendant personally.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1779\">*1779</page-number>Subsequently, however, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 950 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974], the Supreme Court overruled this aspect of <em>Edwards. </em>In <em>Hall, </em>the defendant was sentenced to a term which included the upper term on a personal firearm use enhancement, based on the fact that he had been on parole when the crime was committed (see rule 421(b)(4)). (8 Cal.4th at pp. 954-955.) The defendant argued that the fact that he was on parole did not relate to his use of a firearm, and therefore, under rule 428(b), could not be used as a basis for imposing the upper term. In response, the People argued that rule 428(b) was inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent. (8 Cal.4th at p. 955.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">The Supreme Court agreed with the People. It held rule 428(b) invalid to the extent that it \u201cpurports to afford a sentencing court less discretion in determining whether to impose an upper term for a <em>sentencing enhancement </em>than such a court traditionally has been permitted to exercise in deciding whether to impose an upper term for a <em>substantive </em>offense.\u201d (8 Cal.4th at p. 953.) It held that because \u201cthe traditional sentencing guidelines set forth in rules 421 and 423 . . . specifically permit the court to consider, as a circumstance in aggravation, whether the defendant was on parole at the time the offense was committed, we conclude that the trial court did not err in the present case in relying upon that circumstance in aggravation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 964.) The Supreme Court expressly disapproved our decision in <em>Edwards. (Id., </em>at p. 964, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Clearly, <em>Hall </em>permits the trial court to impose the upper term on an enhancement based on factors listed in rule 421(b), i.e., facts relating to the defendant, even if those factors do not otherwise relate to the enhancement. We do not believe, however, that <em>Hall </em>permits the trial court to impose the upper term on an enhancement based on factors listed in rule 421(a), i.e., facts relating to the <em>crime, </em>if those factors do not relate to the <em>enhancement. </em>The <em>Hall </em>court reasoned that the Legislature meant the selection of the base term for an enhancement to parallel the selection of the base term for a substantive offense. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 959-963.) In selecting the base term for a substantive offense, however, the trial court can use facts under rule 421(a) only if they relate to that offense. <em>Mutatis mutandis, </em>in selecting the base term for an enhancement, the trial court should use facts under rule 421(a) only if they relate to that enhancement. This limitation is necessary if the two sentencing schemes are to be kept parallel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Otherwise, the trial court would have <em>broader </em>discretion in sentencing on an enhancement than it has in sentencing on a substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">We therefore believe <em>Hall </em>invalidated rule 428(b), and disapproved of <em>Edwards, </em>only as applied to such facts as are listed in rule 421(b). Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1780\">*1780</page-number>428(b) and <em>Edwards </em>remain good law when applied to such facts as are listed in rule 421(a). These facts may be used to impose the upper term for an enhancement only if they relate directly to the fact giving rise to the enhancement. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Zamarron </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 865, 870-872 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 17] [invalidity of rule 428(b) means that in imposing upper term on personal firearm use enhancement, \u201c. . . trial courts . . . may consider any aggravating circumstances relating to <em>the firearm use </em>and to the defendant.\u201d], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">As we discussed in part X, <em>ante, </em>if the trial court found threats of great bodily injury based solely on defendant\u2019s gun use during the robbery, this would be an improper dual use of fact. We held that the trial court avoided this dual use because its finding of threats could have been based on the kick defendant delivered to Verdin\u2019s face. Now, however, we must determine whether the kick was related directly to the gun use that formed the basis of the enhancement. We believe it was. Defendant delivered the kick while holding the gun on the occupants of the car. The threat conveyed by the kick was meant to back up the threat conveyed by the gun. Similarly, we believe the \u201cviciousness\u201d the trial court found related directly to the firearm use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Multiple Punishment for Shooting at an Occupied Motor Vehicle and for Assault With a Firearm on an Occupant</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">Defendant contends that imposing unstayed sentences on both count 5 (shooting at an occupied motor vehicle) and count 6 (assault with a firearm on Verdin) violated the prohibition against multiple punishment of section 654.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">\u201cThe statute itself literally applies only where such punishment arises out of multiple statutory violations produced by the \u2018same act or omission.\u2019 [Citation.] However, because the statute is intended to ensure that defendant is punished \u2018commensurate with his culpability\u2019 [citation], its protection has been extended to cases in which there are several offenses committed during \u2018a course of conduct deemed to be indivisible in time.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">\u201c. . .

Under this exception, \u201ceven though a defendant entertains but a single principal objective during an indivisible course of conduct, he may be convicted and punished for each crime of violence committed against a different victim.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553, 587 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908], revd. on other grounds in <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 992 [77 L.Ed.2d 1171, 103 S.Ct. 3446]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 225 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McFarland </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 798, 803 [254 Cal.Rptr. 331, 765 P.2d 493]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552]; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 20-21 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].) The reason for the multiple victim exception is that \u201cwhen a defendant \u2018 \u201ccommits an act of violence with the intent to harm more than one person or by means likely to cause harm to several persons,\" his greater culpability precludes application of section 654.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McFarland, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 803, quoting <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 885, quoting <em>Neal, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">A number of cases have applied section 654 to convictions both for shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and for the resulting assault on one or more of the occupants. The first of these was <em>People </em>v. <em>Kane </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 480 [211 Cal.Rptr. 628], There, the defendant, a bar customer, quarreled with one Grigsby, the owner of the bar. Grigsby got in his car to go home, but as he drove away, the defendant shot at him. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 484.) The defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, and possession of a firearm by a felon <em>{id., </em>at p. 483), and the trial court imposed a separate and unstayed, albeit concurrent, sentence for each offense. The defendant contended that this violated section 654. The People conceded that it did, and the appellate court agreed. (165 Cal.App.3d at p. 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1782\">*1782</page-number>Next, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Masters </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1124 [241 Cal.Rptr. 511], the defendant had a grudge against a gang to which one Bobby Hooker belonged. When the defendant spotted Hooker driving a car, with Kimberly McLean and Derrick Ross as passengers, he fired four or five shots at Hooker\u2019s car; one shot struck Ross. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1127.) The defendant pleaded guilty to assault on Ross with a deadly weapon and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle <em>(id., </em>at p. 1126), and was given a separate, unstayed sentence for each. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">The appellate court upheld the sentencing, applying the multiple victim exception: \u201cMasters\u2019s violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2), and section 246, while in the same course of conduct, resulted in the commission of violent crimes against different victims. Manifestly, Derrick Ross was the unfortunate victim of Masters\u2019s assault with a deadly weapon and all three occupants of the Mustang were victims of his discharge of the firearm at the vehicle.\u201d (195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1128.) The court found <em>Kane </em>\u201cinapplicable\u201d because in <em>Kane, </em>\u201cthere was only one victim .... The same individual was the victim of both the assault with the deadly weapon and the discharge of the firearm into the occupied motor vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Later cases have consistently followed <em>Masters. (People </em>v. <em>Higareda </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1399, 1413 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 763] [defendant robbed two of three people in car, then fired at car; punishment for both grossly negligent discharge of firearm and robbery upheld: third person in car \u201cwas not a robbery victim and appellant may be separately punished for endangering her by his violent crime.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1729, 1736-1737 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 464] [defendant fired at car occupied by four people, striking one; punishment for both shooting at occupied motor vehicle and attempted murder upheld: \u201c. . . the defendant\u2019s act was likely to cause harm to all four persons in the vehicle and in fact seriously injured one.\u201d]; <em>In re Sergio R. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 588, 598 [279 Cal.Rptr. 149] [defendant fired at Blanca, Jasmine, and Melda Guevara, killing Jasmine and injuring Blanca; punishment for shooting from motor vehicle and assault with a deadly weapon upheld: \u201cBlanca was the only victim with regard to the assault\u201d; \u201c[t]he discharge of a firearm from a motor vehicle finding on the other hand . . . pertained to all the victims, Blanca and Jasmine, as well as Melda Guevara, who was present but not injured\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 331, 338-339 [270 Cal.Rptr. 516] [defendants shot up home, then entered it, taking property from victim Argostino, and assaulting victims Nelson and Rivera; punishment for shooting at inhabited dwelling, robbery, and assault upheld: \u201cThe victims of the shooting into an inhabited dwelling were the occupants of the residence: Argostino, Nelson, Rivera, and Pitzer. This offense, therefore, involved one victim (Pitzer) different from the victims involved in the other violent offenses.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1783\">*1783</page-number>Defendant urges us not to follow <em>Masters, </em>for two reasons. First, defendant claims <em>Masters </em>was wrongly decided. He begins with the premise that \u201csection 246 necessarily contemplates more than one victim being involved in a shooting [at] an occupied \u2018building\u2019 or \u2018motor vehicle,\u2019 or \u2018aircraft,\u2019 due to the very nature of the[se] vehicles or structures . . . .\u201d Thus, the punishment for a violation of section 246 adequately requites the greater culpability of a defendant who threatens multiple victims with violence. Defendant concludes that the rationale of the multiple victim exception does not apply. Quoting his major premise, however, exposes his error. Section 246 does <em>not </em>necessarily contemplate multiple victims. A building, motor vehicle, or aircraft can be \u201coccupied\u201d by a single person. Thus, the multiple victim exception may apply, and multiple punishment may be imposed on a defendant who shoots at a motor vehicle occupied by multiple persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Second, defendant appears to argue that the multiple victim exception should not apply when multiple punishment is based on the same act or omission, as opposed to an indivisible course of conduct such as in <em>Masters. </em>This is a distinction without a difference. Identical principles govern both classes of cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 784, 789 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 469, 863 P.2d 714]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 335.) The multiple victim exception was first announced in <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 11. There, the defendant threw gasoline into the bedroom of a husband and wife, then ignited it, severely burning both. Thus, in <em>Neal </em>itself, the multiple victims were threatened by the same acts, not by distinct acts which added up to an indivisible course of conduct. Plainly the multiple victim exception applies even in \u201csame act\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Although defendant does not so argue, we have also considered another potential distinction between this case and <em>Masters. </em>In <em>Masters </em>\u2014 and in every other case we have found holding that the multiple victim exception permitted unstayed sentences both for shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (or an analogous crime) and for one or more simultaneous assaults (or analogous crimes) \u2014 there was at least one victim of the former who was not also a victim of the latter. The \u201cleftover\u201d victim or victims formed the basis of the separate, unstayed sentence for shooting at an occupied motor vehicle. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Higareda, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1404, 1413; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1733, 1737; <em>In re Sergio R., supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at pp. 593-594, 598; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 334, 338-339; <em>People </em>v. <em>Masters, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1126, 1128.) Here, by contrast, defendant was convicted of assaulting <em>all </em>the occupants of the vehicle. If we found this distinction significant, then defendant could be given an unstayed sentence for shooting at an occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1784\">*1784</page-number>motor vehicle, or for each of the four assaults, but not both.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The multiple victim exception, simply stated, permits one unstayed sentence per victim of all the violent crimes the defendant commits incidental to a single criminal intent. Where one person is the victim of both a shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and a simultaneous assault, the trial court can impose an unstayed sentence for one or the other, but not for both. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Masters, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 1130; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kane, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 488.) We believe this is equally true where the same <em>persons </em>are the victims of a shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and of simultaneous <em>assaults', </em>the trial court can impose an unstayed sentence for the shooting, based on any given victim, or for the assault on that victim, but not for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">We find support for this view in the case on which the <em>Masters </em>court relied, <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552]. There, the defendant, with an accomplice, robbed a jewelry store. The defendant shot Charles Burk, the security guard; he then took jewelry while his accomplice held a gun on John Keating, a salesman. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 878-879.) After the defendant was convicted of burglary, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon <em>(id., </em>at p. 877), he contended that section 654 barred punishment for each of these crimes. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 878.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">The Supreme Court applied the multiple victim exception. (18 Cal.3d at p. 885.) It began by noting that Keating was the victim of the robbery. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 886.) Next, it held that the burglary was a violent crime for purposes of the multiple victim exception (because it had been alleged and found to be a burglary involving the infliction of great bodily injury), and that Burk was the victim of the burglary. <em>(Ibid., </em>see also <em>id., </em>at pp. 882-883.) It therefore held that the defendant could be punished for both the robbery and the burglary; however, he could not be punished for both the burglary and the assault, because Burk had been the victim of both. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">What is most important in the opinion for our purposes is the following footnote: \u201cOur conclusion that defendant may be punished for both the robbery and the burglary convictions does not depend on our earlier determination that Burk was not alleged as a victim of the robbery. Even had defendant been convicted of a robbery involving both Keating and Burk as victims, section 654 would not be applicable to preclude punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1785\">*1785</page-number>both that crime and the burglary involving Burk as a victim, as <em>each crime would involve at least one different </em>victim.\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 886, fn. 11, italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 674, 681 [244 Cal.Rptr. 17] [sentences upheld under multiple victim exception where \u201ceach count for which the court ordered service of sentence involved \u2018at least one different victim[]\u2019 of a violent crime.\u201d].) Applying this footnote here, defendant was properly punished both for the crime of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, the victims of which were Verdin and three others, and for the assault on Verdin, because each crime involved at least one different victim. No violation of section 654 appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">Ramirez, P. J., and Dabney, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 31, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">Manuel and Marcos Rios were brothers; Jesus Rios was their cousin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">A1I statutes cited herein are from the Penal Code, unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">The court framed the issue in terms of a \u201cvalid\u201d sentence because a trial court may modify a \u201cvoid\u201d sentence at any time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 335, 345, fn. 11 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 801, 842 P.2d 100]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d at p. 528; <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 764 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 583, fn. 1 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].) However, the question of whether a sentence is void in this sense, rather than merely erroneous, is difficult and highly technical. Moreover, even though here the first sentence was imposed in violation of the requirement of Welfare and Institutions Code section 707.2 that an amenability study be conducted, the People do not contend that it was void. For these reasons, we assume, without deciding, that the first sentence was valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">Defendant makes much of section 1170, subdivision (d). That subdivision provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a defendant ... has been sentenced to be imprisoned in the state prison and has been committed to the custody of the Director of Corrections, the court may, within 120 days of the date of commitment on its own motion . . . recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and resentence the defendant. . . <em>provided the new sentence, if any, is not greater than the initial sentence.\" </em>(Italics added.) Defendant contends that the trial court had power to resentence him solely pursuant to this subdivision. For the reasons stated above, we disagree. Indeed, defendant had not been \u201ccommitted to the custody of the Director of Corrections,\u201d and the trial court could not have resentenced him pursuant to this subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">Defendant also contends that section 1170, subdivision (d) reflects a broader public policy against <em>ever </em>increasing a sentence. <em>Karaman, </em>however, recognized that the trial court has jurisdiction to increase a sentence, at least until the sentence is entered in the minutes or execution of the sentence begins. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 350.) The court described section 1170, subdivision (d) as \u201ca statutory exception to the common law rule that the trial court loses jurisdiction to resentence a defendant upon commencement of execution of his or her sentence.\u201d (4 Cal.4th at pp. 351-352.) A public policy that a trial court should have more time to choose to decrease a sentence than to increase one does not imply that it can never increase a sentence at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1756.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1282-13\">A11 rules cited herein are from the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">AIthough the trial court was not required to explain its change of mind, it stated all along that upper terms were warranted.

[&lt;][] I have seen many cases where guns were used in robberies, and I don\u2019t think this is out of the ordinary. [&lt;f On that standpoint, clearly a serious crime. But I just choose not to use aggravated. In a sense, sufficient to do so, if[,] say[,] another judge was handling [the case], or myself for that matter.\u201d Even where a trial court finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, it has discretion to impose the midterm, without any explanation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 699, 704 [196 Cal.Rptr. 234].)

For instance, where the court cites the multiple victim provision, further elaboration is not needed to facilitate appellate review. But where the court uses a criterion such as that the victim was particularly vulnerable, further elaboration would be extremely helpful in facilitating review of the trial court\u2019s decision.

We do not feel the record warrants their concession, and we decline to accept it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Defendant does not contend that the trial court failed to state its reasons for imposing the upper term on the robbery separately from its reasons for imposing the upper term on the enhancement.
