Tyler, Jr., J., which denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand the action to the Supreme Court of the State of New York. There is no need to recount in detail the deplorable procedural maneuvers in this litigation to date, which include three complaints \u2014 one in a federal court, two in a state court\u2014 three appeals, various motions and failures to comply with orders of a court, Suffice it to say that plaintiff\u2019s counsel has indulged in much activity, but effeetive protection of the interests of the widow and children of decedent does not shine brightly through the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\"> Although neither party noticed we brought to their attention at oral argument the question of - appealability an orc*er denying a remand and gave bbem an opportunity for further brief - ing. As the Supreme Court said in Chicago, R. I. &amp; Pac. R. R. v. Stude, 346 U.S. 574, 578, 74 S.Ct. 290, 293, 98 L.Ed. 317 (1954), \u201cObviously, such an order is nof final and appealable if standing alone.\u201d See Lewis v. E. I. Du Pont, 183 F.2d 29, 21 A.L.R.2d 757 (5th Cir. 1950); 1A j Moore, Federal Practice 0.169 [2.-3.] (2d ed. 1965). At argument, when apprised of the appealability issue, plaintiff\u2019s counsel orally requested permission to treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus. But this case is a long way from presenting the \u201cexeeptional circumstances\u201d that will \u201cjustify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.\u201d Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 273, 19 L.Ed. 2d 305 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
