As to the second ground, we agree with the district court that the record conclusively establishes it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">We conclude, however, that the district court erred in rejecting the third and fourth grounds on the pleadings. The conflict between allegations made by appellant in his petition and the statements made by appellant\u2019s counsel in the affidavit filed by the State could not be resolved against appellant without an evi-dentiary hearing.

Dickson, 336 F.2d 878, 882-883 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
