There are no genuine issues of material fact and the case is before the court on cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Plaintiff, a Reserve officer in the Air Force since 1929, was serving on extended active duty when he was transferred to the Retired Reserve on July 1, 1960. By permission of the Secretary of the Air Force, he remained on active duty after that date as a temporary officer until he should become eligible to receive retired pay at age 60 under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. On May 20, 1964, while serving as a Major in this capacity (which is considered \u201cactive duty\u201d though' in the Retired Reserve), plaintiff was appointed a Lieutenant Colonel in the Reserves by purported authority of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8366 and 8380. This \u201cpromotion\u201d was not in his active duty capacity, and the \u201cpromotion\u201d order stated that he would \u201ccontinue to serve in his temporary appointment\u201d [i. e. the rank of Major] and \u201cnot perform duties in the ResAF Grade to which promoted, nor be entitled to pay and allowances in * * * [that] Grade, unless ordered to active duty in such grade by competent authority.\u201d Plaintiff never served on active duty as a Lieutenant Colonel. On April 7, 1967, plaintiff received notice that his Reserve appointment to Lieutenant Colonel was unauthorized and was, -therefore, revoked. On May 31, 1967, plaintiff left active duty for permanent retirement and began receiving his retired pay in the grade of Major. Plaintiff applied to the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records claiming his \u201cpromotion\u201d to Lieutenant Colonel was improperly revoked. The Board, without a hearing and without stating its reasons, denied plaintiff\u2019s application. Plaintiff appealed to this court maintaining that the Board\u2019s denial was arbitrary and capricious and that he is entitled to the retired rank and pay of a Reserve Lieutenant Colonel because he was properly promoted and the promotion was not properly revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">This is not a case like Field v. United States, 158 F.Supp. 580, 141 Ct.Cl. 312, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 926, 78 S.Ct. 1372, 2 L.Ed.2d 1371 (1958), where the plaintiff had retired, was called to active duty, promoted in his active duty capacity and then \u201cre-retired\u201d. The plaintiff here was not promoted in his active duty capacity and never served in the rank or received the pay and benefits of a Lieutenant Colonel while on active duty. The question in this case is whether the plaintiff was legally promoted and, if he was, whether his promotion was legally revoked. We hold that plaintiff was not legally promoted and the purported revocation merely reflected the situation that, in law, already existed. His motion for summary judgment should be denied and defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">Pertinent statutes are set forth in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s principal argument is that the exclusive authority to promote officers \u25a0 in the Armed Forces Reserve is vested in the President by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>593, which says \u201c[appointments of Reserves in commissioned grades below general officer * * * shall be made by the President alone.\u201d Plaintiff places great emphasis on the word \u201calone\u201d and reads this provision as giving the President the absolute authority to promote anyone, no matter how ineligible or unqualified. His position is that because of \u00a7 593 the promotion eligibility sections in Title 10 are not binding on the President. Because the President\u2019s power to promote is absolute, plaintiff reasons, only the President has the power to revoke promotions. Since his \u201cpromotion\u201d was \u201cby direction of the President,\u201d but the revocation was not, plaintiff argues that the revocation is invalid and the promotion, therefore, must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">If the plaintiff is correct that \u00a7 593 gives the President, regardless of other promotion provisions in Title 10, the authority to promote anyone no matter how unqualified, then his \u201cpromotion\u201d was valid. However, we think the President\u2019s power to promote is not absolute. The legislative history of \u00a7 593 confirms what the language indicates: that the word \u201calone\u201d was inserted in that section to make it clear that the President no longer needed Senate \u201cadvice and consent\u201d for appointments below general officer rank, 1952 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, p. 2025. There is nothing to indicate that \u201calone\u201d, means the President can establish his own criteria for appointments and appoint anyone regardless of his qualifications. This would render virtually meaningless other parts of Title 10 setting up various hurdles to be surmounted before a reserve officer can be promoted. Such interpretations are not favored. United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955); Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U.S. 112, 115-116, 25 L.Ed. 782 (1879); In re Perry, 157 F.Supp. 910, 914 (W.D.Mich.1958); 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 4705 (3d ed. 1943). We think that \u00a7 593 should be read together with the eligibility requirements of Title 10 and that those requirements must be met before a promotion is considered valid. The \u201cpromotion\u201d was stated to be \u201cBy direction of the President,\u201d language which does not purport to reflect the President\u2019s personal participation. The revocation, as the record shows, was simply a recognition that the \u201cpromotion\u201d was, as stated, \u201cwithout effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 8360(a) says \u201c[t]o be eligible under this chapter [ch. 837] for (1) consideration for promotion, * * * or (3) promotion, a reserve commissioned officer must be in an active status.\u201d \u201cActive status\u201d is defined as the \u201cstatus of a reserve commissioned officer * * * who is not * <em>* * </em>in the Retired Reserve.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (25). Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpromotion\u201d purported to be, as stated above, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8366 and 8380 which are both in chapter 837. Plaintiff, as he admits, had already been transferred to the Retired Reserve when he was \u201cpromoted\u201d and was not, by definition, in an \u201cactive status\u201d, therefore he was ineligible for consideration for or promotion under chapter 837, the chapter by which his \u201cpromotion\u201d was purportedly authorized. But \u00a7 8380, one of the sections under which plaintiff purportedly was \u201cpromoted\u201d, uses the term \u201cactive duty\u201d rather than \u201cactive status\u201d. Both sides agree that plaintiff was on active duty according to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(22) which is defined as \u201cfull-time duty in the active military service of the United States,\u201d and plaintiff urges that he was eligible for promotion under \u00a7 8380. That section relates to the period after one has been selected for promotion and indicates when it shall be effective. But before that phase in the process is reached, plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for promotion must be determined by looking at other sections including \u00a7 8360(a) supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Plaintiff finds the terms \u201cactive duty\u201d and \u201cactive status\u201d inconsistent and confusing and would use them synonymously. But the terms are not meant to be synonymous. Being in an active status has nothing to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>being on active duty, and being on active duty does not change a Reserve officer\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d in the Title 10 sense. Members of the \u201cReady Reserve\u201d are in an active status, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 267, but they need not be on active duty. They are \u201cliable for active duty,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 268, and may be ordered to active duty, 10 -U.S.C. \u00a7 673, but they are not necessarily on \u201cactive duty\u201d. On the other hand, a person in the Retired Reserve may serve on active duty, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 675 and 676, although by definition, a member of the Retired Reserve cannot be in an active status.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">\u201cActive duty\u201d and \u201cactive status\u201d are entirely different concepts as used in Title 10. \u201cActive duty\u201d is a concept which describes the day to day function a member of the Armed Forces performs. The term is used by both the Regular and Reserve Armed Forces. One on active duty has the Armed Forces as his full time job. \u201cActive status\u201d is a term used only by the Reserves. A Regular officer is either on active duty or retired. A Reserve officer, however, can be in an active status, an inactive status, or a retired status. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 267. \u201cActive status\u201d merely describes a category of Reserve officers who are eligible for promotion, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 8360(a). One need not be on active duty to receive a Reserve promotion under Title 10, chapter 837, but must be in an active status. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s urging we find no inconsistency in the use of the two phrases in the provisions we must construe in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Plaintiff also takes the position that his transfer to the Retired Reserve, while being retained on active duty, was improper. There is no indication in the parties' briefs by what statutory authority plaintiff was retained except that it was the policy of the Secretary of the Air Force to retain on active duty officers who had to be transferred to the Retired Reserve until they were eligible for retired pay, and plaintiff had to be retired as he had over 28 years of federal service, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 8848. There is statutory authority for retention on active duty of a person qualifying for retirement. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 676. However, this section does not indicate that such a person must be retained in an active status and cannot be transferred to the Retired Reserve. Plaintiff reads Grahl v. United States, 336 F.2d 199, 167 Ct.Cl. 80 (1964), as making \u00a7 676 an exception to the mandatory retirement provisions of Title 10 and as meaning that one retained on active duty by authority of \u00a7 676 must not be transferred to the Retired Reserve. While <em>Grahl </em>does indicate that \u00a7 676 is an exception to the mandatory retirement provisions, id. at 204, 167 Ct.Cl. at 89, there is no language in that opinion to the effect that a retained officer cannot be transferred to the Retired Reserve. The record reflects that the Air Force intended both to put plaintiff in the Retired Reserve and retain him on active duty if he applied for such treatment, and with his eyes open he did so apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">We have found nothing in Title 10 to prevent an officer\u2019s retention on active duty while being listed as a Retired Reserve officer and there are several provisions that deal with retired officers on active duty. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 675, 676, and 8503. Plaintiff elected to be transferred to the Retired Reserve and remain on active duty. His only other choice was to retire completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Had plaintiff been promoted in his active duty status this would be a different case. He never served in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel nor received any benefits of that rank. He was not demoted. Because he was ineligible for promotion he is not entitled to the retired rank of Lieutenant Colonel. We hold that his retention on active duty was proper but his \u201cpromotion\u201d was contrary to law and ineffective, thus it did not need to be revoked. It was an administrative action not supported by the facts or the law, and plaintiff is not entitled to benefit from what is, in fact, an administrative error. Bridgman v. United States, 399 F.2d 186, 185 Ct.Cl. - (July 17, 1968). The procedural regularity of the Air Force\u2019s attempts to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>voke the \u201cpromotion\u201d is therefore not a matter we need investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">It follows from what we have said that the action of the Board for the Correction of Military Records was not arbitrary and capricious. The Board\u2019s refusal to grant plaintiff\u2019s application was proper and will not be set aside. The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, the plaintiff\u2019s is denied, and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"Amk\">\u00a7 101.
