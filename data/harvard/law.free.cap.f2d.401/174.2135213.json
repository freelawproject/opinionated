Herrera was adjudicated a bankrupt on an involuntary petition filed March 20, 1964. In due course he was granted, over the trustee\u2019s objection, a discharge in bankruptcy. The district court affirmed the order and the trustee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-23\">Of the several grounds of objection asserted below, those urged in this court are that the bankrupt, within twelve months next preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, transferred and concealed assets with intent to hinder, delay and defraud creditors [11 U.S.C. 32(c) (4)]; that he failed to keep books of account and records [11 U.S.C. 32(c) (2)]; and that he failed to explain satisfactorily losses of assets [11 U.S.C. 32(c) (7)].</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The findings of the referee, consisting as they do of the iteration of each ground of objection prefaced by the phrase \u201cIt is not true \u2014 afford us no real insight to the referee\u2019s view of the material facts. However, to now require some degree of particularization would merely delay decision without serving any useful purpose, for the evidence relevant to at least one of the grounds of objection does not permit a factual determination favorable to the bankrupt and if one were made it would be clearly erroneous. We are referring specifically to the asserted transfer of assets. Until November 1963, Herrera had been the owner of a wholesale fertilizer business known as the U. S. Eagle Fertilizer Co. During that month he sold the assets of U. S. Eagle to Park Green Enterprises, Inc. The only real question was of Herrera\u2019s intent in the matter. The circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that the transfer was made pursuant to a deliberate scheme to defraud: Herrera\u2019s creditors were clamoring for payment; the transfer was to a corporation only recently organized by his sons who owned all its shares of stock; the sale was with a lease-back under which Herrera remained in possession and the lease was soon forfeited, together with his substantial cash deposit; in addition, Herrera\u2019s only explanations with respect to the greater portion of the $25,000 consideration that he received were the vague statements that he had paid unspecified creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Even so, if this was all the evidence touching the issue we would no doubt accept the referee\u2019s ultimate finding that Herrera did not intend to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors for, although a referee\u2019s factual determinations are not conclusive, a reviewing court is most reluctant to substitute its judgment for that of the referee who has observed the witnesses and heard their testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">However, the record before us also contains direct evidence in the form of Herrera\u2019s own testimony that the transfer was made to hinder his creditors. Thus, when examined at the first creditors' meeting by Mr. Potts, one of the trustee\u2019s attorneys, Herrera admitted that his \u201cpurpose was to just lease the equipment back so that I could keep operating and still somebody wouldn\u2019t go and take it over. I wanted to pay my obligations\u201d; that the assets were transferred in order to put them in another name to prevent their attachment; and that he cashed and kept on his person, rather than deposited and placed in his bank account, three of the checks amounting to $15,000 which he had received as part payment for the transfer, in order to avoid attachment of the money. He frankly stated: \u201cI couldn\u2019t take $25,000, and when I was trying to remedy a situation, and only go and have an attachment. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the matter is remanded with directions to enter an order denying the discharge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-5\">. It is not unlikely that the referee failed to apply the correct or any legal test to the evidence in reaching his conclusion for, when orally stating his decision to grant the discharge, he added this most remarkable comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThis bankruptcy has been pending about three years. We have had copious amounts of testimony. We have had Mr. Joe Potts in here who looked like he was going to make a veritable lifetime job <em>out </em>of this. Finally, we had to separate Mr. Potts and some of the witnesses and attorneys. So, we are all of the opinion that Mr. Herrera must have been one of the biggest crooks in the world; and, then the books and records are not in too good shape, but I don\u2019t think it will do the creditors a bit of good to deny his discharge; and from a practical standpoint, let\u2019s don\u2019t waste too much time and argument here despite all the evidence that Mr. MacDonald (the trustee\u2019s special auditor) clearly made in the exhibits that I struck. So I will allow his discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
