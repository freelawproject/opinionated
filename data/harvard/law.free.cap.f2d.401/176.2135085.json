Brandel, for his able and persuasive efforts in behalf of Geeter. He almost convinced me.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-27\">His work is an object lesson in what a lawyer can honorably and cogently put together where others of less determination give up. Geeter could have done no better with unlimited funds to hire his own lawyer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
