The husband brought an action against the railway company under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. Sec. 51 et seq. An adverse jury verdict and a judgment thereon denied recovery to the husband. Thereafter the appellant brought an action against the railway company, asserting that the husband\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of the railway company and seeking damages for loss of consortium. The district court granted the motion to dismiss of the railway company on the ground that \u201cwhere an injury falls within the scope of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, the relief granted by that act is exclusive as to the injured employee and all others.\u201d The appellant seeks a reversal of the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act not only provides the exclusive remedy for the recovery by an employee of damages sustained by him as the result of an injury to him, but also governs the recovery by others for damages resulting from such injury.
