He was of the view that the judgment order of the district court should be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b252-25\">CASTLE, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b252-26\">Plaintiff brought this action in the Circuit Court of Cook County for damages resulting from alleged slanderous statements made by defendant, a United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>States Secret Service agent, outside the scope of his official duties. The action was removed to the District Court, which granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant was acting within the scope of his official duties, thus compelling the conclusion that the statements were absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Defendant\u2019s statements were made during a normal question and answer period following an assigned lecture to police cadets regarding the operations of the Secret Service in protecting the President of the United States. The alleged statements \u2014 that plaintiff was a \u201cnut\u201d and that the Secret Service had dismantled a cannon plaintiff had pointed at O\u2019Hare Field the day President Johnson came to Chicago in 1964 \u2014 were made only in response to a question of one of the cadets and only for the purpose of using a pertinent local incident to demonstrate the functions of the Secret Service. The record indicates, as the District Court found, that since plaintiff possessed a \u201clarge collection of dangerous arms, including a 25 m.m. cannon,\u201d he was among those persons who might pose a danger to the President, concerning whose protection defendant was lecturing, and therefore defendant was acting' within the outer perimeter of his line of duty in answering the question regarding the Secret Service\u2019s action toward plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A federal official cannot be held personally liable for acts committed within the outer perimeter of the official\u2019s line of duty. Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959). To be within that perimeter, and therefore absolutely privileged, \u201c[I]t is only necessary that the action bear some reasonable relation to and connection with the duties and responsibilities of the official.\u201d Scherer v. Brennan, 379 F.2d 609, 611 (7th Cir. 1967). We hold that defendant\u2019s actions in the instant case were absolutely privileged as being within, the outer perimeter of his line of duty. The judgment below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
