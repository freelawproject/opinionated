He received a prison sentence of one year and fines to-talling $30,000 after a trial before a jury, Judge Irving Ben Cooper presiding. On appeal Marcus challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, numerous rulings on the admissibility of evidence, the refusal of the trial judge to grant a mistrial following certain remarks made by the prosecutor during summation, and the propriety of portions of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. Since we find no error in the trial judge\u2019s rulings and conduct of the trial we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">The first four counts of the indictment charged Marcus under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 with attempting to evade his personal income taxes by filing false and fraudulent returns for the years 1959 through 1962. The remaining counts charged Marcus under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) with making false statements in the tax returns of five corporations which he wholly owned and controlled: Ben Frank, Inc., for the fiscal years ending January 31, 1960 and 1961; the Casa Trading Corp. for the years ending January 31, 1960 and 1963; the Taca Trading Corp. for the years ending January 31, 1960 and 1961; the Aritor Corp. for the year ending August 31, 1962; and the Baritor Corp. for the year ending August 31, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">The evidence at trial showed that Marcus, a certified public accountant, had as his principal source of income the business of cashing checks for a fee through 43 checking accounts which he maintained at 10 banks. Most of these accounts were in the names of the five corporations named in the indictment, but some were in the names of friends, some in the names of fictitious individuals and companies, and five accounts were in Marcus\u2019 own name. Marcus also used the checking accounts of businesses for whom he did accounting, concealing this activity by using the cash of the businesses for his check cashing and depositing the checks he cashed in the business accounts. The evidence showed that Marcus charged fees ranging from y2% to 3% for cashing checks. Although Marcus cashed more than ten million dollars of checks during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>years 1959 through 1962 he claimed that he kept no books. Consequently the government established its case through the testimony of numerous witnesses from banks, persons for whom Marcus cashed checks, and persons whose accounts be used, and through the introduction of a large number of bank records.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Marcus told Special Agent Ferrise that he received a fee of % % for his check cashing services. In computing Marcus\u2019 income the government applied this fee to his total cheek deposits, with the exception that a higher fee of up to 3% was applied to transactions in which clients testified they had paid this higher amount. To this total was added Marcus\u2019 income from interest on savings bank accounts and from his accounting fees. The government\u2019s computations showed that Marcus had underreported his taxable income for the years in question by amounts ranging from $9,000 to $26,000, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">ear</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aau-dedup-0\">Taxable Income Reported</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atei\">Government\u2019s Computation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alt-dedup-0\">Deficiency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUM\">1959 $ 3,555.87 $12,618.81 $ 9,062.94</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adq-dedup-0\">1960 $ 5,784.50 $18,191.92 $12,407.42</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af_\">196\u00cd $ 3,729.55 $19,326.05 $15,596.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhB\">1962 $21,600.00 $48,136.43 $26,536.43</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Marcus underreported his income. A review of the record shows that there was an abundance of evidence to support the conviction. Appellant\u2019s argument to the contrary seems based on the mistaken premise that the government must establish the precise amount by which income was underreported. In fact the prosecution meets its burden when it shows that income was underreported by a substantial amount. Swallow v. United States, 307 F.2d 81, 83 (10th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 371 U.S. 950, 83 S.Ct. 504, 9 L.Ed.2d 499 (1963); Olender v. United States, 237 F.2d 859, 867 (9th Cir. 1956), cert. denied 352 U.S. 982, 77 S.Ct. 382, 1 L.Ed.2d 365 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">The testimony of Special Agent Ferrise concerning certain admissions made to him by Marcus was vital to the government's case. Ferrise testified he had been told by Marcus that Marcus received a fee of y2% on each of the cheeks he cashed, that he deducted this fee at the time he cashed the checks, that he paid to himself the fees received by his corporations, and that he suffered no losses from bad checks. It is settled that these admissions are not competent evidence unless they are corroborated by independent evidence tending to establish either that the admissions were reliable or that the crime charged was in fact committed. Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 152-156, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed, 192 (1948). The government\u2019s evidence, particularly the testimony of numerous clients of Marcus, amply met both of these alternative standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">Of course the government did not prove independently as appellant stresses, that Marcus charged a fee on each and every one of the thousands of checks he cashed or that he never sustained a loss on a check. But this was not the government\u2019s burden. The facts concerning the fees and the absence of losses were alleged to have been admitted by Marcus, and the prosecution needed only to provide the jury with a basis for concluding that the admissions had been made and were accurate. There was ample evidence in the record to support these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>There is no- merit in appellant\u2019s contention that his admissions to Agent Ferrise should have been excluded since he was not warned of his right to counsel. Marcus was not in custody and he was fully aware that his activities were the subject of a tax investigation. In these circumstances the holding of Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), does not apply. United States v. Mackiewicz, 2d Cir., July 10, 1968, 401 F.2d 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The trial judge properly refused to strike the testimony of witness Arthur Streit. Streit identified numerous checks which he said he had cashed with Marcus for a 2% fee. He claimed that he used Marcus\u2019 services in order to obtain cash with which to purchase goods from suppliers who would not accept checks. On these occasions Marcus would supply Streit with invoices in the name of fictitious companies for Streit\u2019s bookkeeping purposes. Streit testified that when he had been contacted by the Internal Revenue Service he informed Marcus of this fact, and that Marcus had told him to \u201cget rid of the books.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On cross-examination counsel for Marcus attempted to establish that Streit\u2019s purpose in cashing checks was to evade income taxes rather than to obtain cash for purchases. After responding to some questions relating to his claimed cash purchases Streit invoked his right against self-incrimination and refused to answer several additional questions. It is urged by appellant that Streit\u2019s refusals to answer unduly restricted Marcus\u2019 right of cross-examination, and that consequently Judge Cooper erred in denying a defense motion to strike all of Streit\u2019s testimony. However, all of the seven questions dealt with years which are not involved in this prosecution and went only to Streit\u2019s credibility. Since the questions involved only \u201ccollateral matters or cumulative testimony concerning credibility,\u201d United States v. Cardillo, 316 F.2d 606, 613 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 375 U.S. 822, 84 S.Ct. 60, 11 L.Ed.2d 55 (1963), the defense motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Defense counsel also sought to establish that the reason Streit called Marcus after being contacted by the Internal Revenue Service was fear concerning his own, and not Marcus\u2019 tax status. Streit refused to answer a question concerning whether he had called Marcus because of his own fear he would be sent to prison for failing to pay tax on the checks Marcus had cashed for him. But this refusal to answer resulted in no prejudice to defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination for Streit had answered two very similar questions previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Appellant also claims that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to declare a mistrial because of remarks made by the prosecution during summation, remarks which are said to have been improper reflections on Marcus\u2019 failure to testify at the trial and on his refusal to answer questions during the government\u2019s investigation. We do not agree that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks could have been taken by the jury as a comment on defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand at trial, and we hold that under the circumstances the comment on defendant\u2019s refusal to answer questions before the trial was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Special Agent Ferrise\u2019s testimony concerned admissions made by Marcus during an interview at which no stenographer was present. In an effort to attack Ferrise\u2019s credibility defense counsel in his summation laid heavy stress on the fact that at an interview with Ferrise five days after the alleged admissions were made, this time when a stenographer was present, Marcus had refused to discuss his check-cashing business. In addition it was pointed out that on two other occasions, when friends of his were present, Marcus had refused to talk with Ferrise. Thus the defense argument was that since Marcus had refused to answer questions with a stenographer present, and on the other two occasions, the jury should conclude, contrary to Ferrise\u2019s testimony, that Marcus also had not answered questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>at the earlier interview when a stenographer was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The prosecution responded to the defense argument in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cMr. Marcus is not a stupid man. Nobody who could have run this operation is a stupid man. Mr. Marcus, I submit to you, avoided every opportunity to testify under oath. He may have felt erroneously that Mr. Fer-rise could not take the stand to describe what happened, but he was unwilling, I submit to you, to submit himself to any question and answer statement under oath once it became clear to him that he was under investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Immediately following this statement the prosecutor went on to explain the two other instances in which Marcus had refused to talk to Ferrise as stemming from his anxiety that his friends not realize the size of his check-cashing activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Thus when viewed in context the prosecutor\u2019s comments are seen to have been directed at Marcus\u2019 conduct during the investigation \u2014 a rebuttal to the argument raised by the defense \u2014 rather than at his failure to testify at trial. And while the language of the prosecutor could have been more precise, this is not an instance where the jury, contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s intent, would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d construe his statement as a comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Morrison v. United States, 6 F.2d 809, 811 (8th Cir. 1925); cf. United States ex rel. D\u2019Ambrosio v. Fay, 349 F.2d 957, 958-961 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 382 U.S. 921, 86 S.Ct. 301, 15 L.Ed.2d 235 (1965). It should be noted that defense counsel did not attempt to secure an instruction from the trial judge which would have clarified any ambiguity present in the government\u2019s summation on this point. Indeed, counsel requested the judge to make no comment whatever on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify and his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">But appellant also advances as a ground for mistrial the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were directed at Marcus\u2019 refusal to answer questions before a stenographer during the investigation. While there is authority to support the contention that comment upon a defendant\u2019s refusal to answer questions before trial is ground for a mistrial, see United States v. Sprengel, 103 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1939); People v. Abel, 298 N.Y. 333, 83 N.E.2d 542 (1949), this cannot be the case when the subject was introduced to the jury by the defendant\u2019s own counsel. Once defense counsel had pointed to his client\u2019s refusal to answer questions in an attempt to undermine the credibility of a key government witness it was entirely proper for the prosecutor to respond by offering an alternative explanation for Marcus\u2019 prior silence. See United States v. Nasta, 2d Cir., July 17, 1968, 398 F.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Finally, it is argued that Judge Cooper erred in his instructions in several respects. First, appellant points to the statement in the charge that \u201cIn the final analysis\u201d the jury should acquit if from the evidence \u201cit is more likely that the defendant is innocent than guilty * * *.\u201d In United States v. Hughes, 389 F.2d 535 (2d Cir. 1968), we held that identical language used in a charge<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was error since it suggested to the jury that it apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. But Marcus\u2019 counsel made no objection to this language at trial, and Judge Cooper correctly instructed the jury concerning the government\u2019s burden of proof on numerous other occasions during his charge. (Record at 1592-95, 1599, 1600-01, 1605, 1623). The one incorrect reference does not constitute plain- error which we should recognize despite counsel\u2019s failure to object to it at trial. Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ed States v. Baratta, 2d Cir., June 21, 1968, 397 F.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Appellant also claims error in the following instruction concerning the element of wilfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cThe most burdensome, I would judge, issue with which you must wrestle is the one relating to wilfulness. I think this is the crux of the case; that is, whether the defendant knew that a substantial amount of additional tax was due, and that the failure of the defendant to report the additional income was wilful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2q-dedup-0\">Appellant argues that this charge effectively withdrew from the jury the issue of whether any income was unreported. We disagree. The jury had been fully instructed regarding the elements of the crime which it must find in order to return a guilty verdict. Judge Cooper\u2019s remarks could not have been taken to mean that his careful instructions on these elements were to be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The other claims of error in the charge do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"Arv\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-15\"> <em>Hughes </em>was decided after the charge in this case was given. .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
