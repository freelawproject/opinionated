ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b964-24\">From a parked position at the curb of a public street, appellant drove his automobile in a U-turn directly in front of another car, forcing the driver of the latter to apply his brakes abruptly to avoid a collision. A police officer, who had observed the maneuver, signaled appellant to a stop and asked for his operator\u2019s license. Appellant produced the license and the officer, after examining it, requested the registration card for the vehicle. Appellant, ostensibly in response, opened the glove compartment, and from it fell three envelopes. The officer recognized the envelopes as of a type used in numbers operations, and saw figures written on the outside of them. On inquiry as to what they were, appellant admitted that they contained numbers matter and money. Thereupon, the officer told appellant that he was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>arrest and ordered him to get out of the car. He was searched immediately, and numbers slips and money were found in a pocket of his trousers. A bag containing still more slips and money was then found under the front seat of the car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Now convicted by a jury of two violations of the lottery laws,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant presses three points on this appeal. One <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pertains to the denial, by District Judge Walsh, of his pre trial motion to suppress the numbers items and money,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> some of which were introduced into evidence at the trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The other two <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> emanate from events at the trial, before District Judge Corcoran, now to be related.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">On cross-examination of a Government witness, appellant\u2019s counsel had an exhibit marked for identification, whereupon the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-7\">\u201cQ. Now, sir, that document you have in front of you, that newspaper advertisement, that has on it a list of automobile tag numbers, does it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-8\">\u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-13\">\u201cQ. And it has the statement that if you come to the Buick automobile company and your car has the tag matching one of the numbers on that list, that you will win a prize; is that true? \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-14\">\u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-15\">\u201cQ. Now, that piece of paper, sir, that identifies the person who is going to be a winner, does it not? There can be no speculation or doubt about it, can there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-16\">\u201cA. It identifies them by tag number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-17\">\u201cQ. That is right. Everybody knows that whoever has one of those tag numbers is going to win something, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-18\">\u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-19\">\u201cQ. * * * Have you had any occasion to investigate that proposition ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-20\">\u201cA. This particular one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-21\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-22\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Defense counsel then proceeded to have another exhibit marked and, as he was apparently about to resume cross-examination, Judge Corcoran, at a bench conference, inquired as to his purpose. Counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-4\">\u201c * * * I want to introduce this in evidence. These represent chances on a lottery. On the basis of that, I am going to ask that this statute be declared unconstitutional. It doesn\u2019t afford equal protection of the law to my client. I am going to interpose that as a defense under the rules of procedure. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Then asked by the judge as to the materiality of the first exhibit, counsel explained that \u201c[i]t is a lottery and it exists. The law doesn\u2019t apply to those people the same way as it does to my client.\u201d Counsel then stated that he had</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">\u201c * * * 40 or 50 similar exhibits which I contend will prove the existence of other lotteries in this town which are not made subject to the provisions of the statute; therefore, we should have equal protection of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The judge refused, on the ground of irrelevance, to admit any of the exhibits into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Our review of appellant\u2019s contentions leads to the conclusion that neither affords an acceptable basis for reversal. We therefore affirm, but respond to a need for explication of our reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b966-18\">At the trial, appellant did not renew his motion to suppress,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Government was permitted to introduce into evidence the numbers items and money which appellant had secreted in his glove compartment and his pocket.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion, however, preserved for appellate review the objection to prosecutorial use of these materials,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> so we are brought to a consideration of a single aspect of Judge Walsh\u2019s pretrial determination which appellant focuses on here.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">At the core of Judge Walsh\u2019s ruling was his initial holding that appellant came under arrest for the traffic violation when his ear was stopped, although the officer did not proclaim an arrest until after he had seen the telltale envelopes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The officer\u2019s \u201cinspection\u201d of the glove compartment as it was opened<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>was treated as a search incidental to that arrest,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the subsequent searches of appellant\u2019s person and his automobile as reasonable concomitants of an arrest for the lottery offenses<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Appellant attacks the judge\u2019s legal conclusion that the halting of his automobile constituted the act of arrest, pointing to the officer\u2019s testimony, and the concordant finding, that no arrest was announced until after the envelopes appellant spilled from the glove compartment were recognized as numbers paraphernalia. He urges us to hold that as a matter of law an unlawful search of the compartment preceded the arrest which the officer effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Our appraisal of appellant\u2019s thesis begins with close scrutiny of the salient factual findings which Judge Walsh\u2019s opinion incorporates. After witnessing appellant\u2019s U-turn and his near-collision with the oncoming automobile, the officer \u201cflagged him to a stop, * * * stepped up to the defendant\u2019s car, identified himself as a police officer, advised defendant of the traffic violation, and asked for his driver\u2019s license.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After checking the license, the officer twice requested the registration card, and in response appellant entered the glove compartment from which the envelopes fell, exposed plainly to the officer\u2019s gaze.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">Save in one ill-founded respect,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> appellant does not challenge these findings, or suggest that the evidence before the judge was insufficient to support them. On the contrary, both the brief<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the oral argument<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> presented in appellant\u2019s behalf assure us that his claim of illegal arrest accepts the validity of the findings.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We do not, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>the facts found, reach the question whether appellant was actually under arrest at the time the condemnatory envelopes came to light or encounter the myriad difficulties that searches accompanying traffic arrests are apt to involve.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The events leading to discovery of the envelopes occurred after the officer had witnessed appellant\u2019s operation of his automobile in clear violation of law,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and we think that the officer was justified in detaining appellant temporarily for a purpose congenial to that occasion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In our view, the stopping of an observed traffic offender and an inspection of his credentials to operate the vehicle under his control is not only a commonplace but also a reasonable police procedure.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nothing in the record intimates that appellant\u2019s detention grew out of any other purpose, or that it was a subterfuge for a hunt for lottery material.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>It was during this investigative pause that appellant, having been asked to exhibit the registration card, opened the glove compartment to obtain it. The officer\u2019s observation of the envelopes that then fell from the compartment into his view did not, in our judgment involve a search.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Indeed, we are unable to distinguish this episode from that involving another appellant who, reaching into his pocket for his registration card, which in similar circumstances a police officer had requested, inadvertently uncovered a concealed weapon.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And with no search, it is quite immaterial that this unimpeachable detention of appellant did not amount to an arrest.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We conclude that the seizure of the numbers paraphernalia which had resided in the glove compartment is without constitutional implication. With that discovery, the officer had probable cause for the ensuing formally-announced arrest for the numbers offenses,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and the search of appellant\u2019s person immediately after that lawful arrest was itself lawful.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We hold that the Government was at liberty to utilize as evidence at the trial, the numbers items and money appellant had in the glove compartment and in the pocket of his trousers.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">We proceed now to a consideration of the ruling made by Judge Corcoran at the trial excluding appellant\u2019s exhibits from the evidence. In this connection, appellant presents two contentions, only one of which \u2014 his equal protection claim \u2014 merits elaboration.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>We are not entirely clear as to the approach by which appellant would endeavor to make this point. At trial it apparently was that the lottery statutes do not cover certain activities which amount to lotteries. On the other hand, his position here seems to also embrace the claim that other persons violate the statute but are not prosecuted.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Since we are uncertain in this regard, our discussion extends to both facets of the problem, which we considered in reaching our conclusions in this case.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Appellant\u2019s invocation of \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d is obviously a reference to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> which effects a prohibition only on the states.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> And while the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the Federal Government, exacts due process of law, as the Fourteenth demands of the states, the text of the Fifth omits an explicit guaranty of equal protection. \u201cBut the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and, while possibly they are not inexorably congruent,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u201cdiscrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We think that it may safely be decided that in the sober relationship of the citizenry to the criminal laws, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth contains the same \u201cpledge of the protection of equal laws\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> as is evident from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>the Fourteenth.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> At the same time, it is clear to us that dissimilar treatment which would withstand an assault predicated upon an alleged denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth would not offend due process under the Fifth.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Within constitutional limits, legislative power to define crime is absolute,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and even the command of equal protection leaves to the lawmaker much leeway to affect separate groups diver-gently<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201cEqual protection does not require identity of treatment. It only requires that classification rest on real and not feigned differences, that the distinction have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made, and that the different treatments be not so disparate, relative to the difference in classification, as to be wholly arbitrary.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">That a statute treats different persons contrastingly does not, without more, signify that equal protection is wanting<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>. Nor is the showing made by the additional circumstance that in actuality the law does not apply to all to whom it conceivably could.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> \u201cA statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did, or because it may not succeed in bringing about the result that it tends to produce.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> For \u201c[e]vils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions, requiring different remedies. * * * Or the reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.. * * * The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">Appellant\u2019s effort to demonstrate that the legislative classification complained of denied equal protection thus had to involve not only a difference in treatment, but a difference either based on a constitutionally suspect standard or lacking in rational justification.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> However, he offered only to show \u2014 and this documentarily <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> \u2014 that others were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>engaging with impunity in activities which he considered to be lotteries uncondemned by law.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This offer, though made good, would not have sufficed,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and Judge Corcoran was plainly right in refusing to admit into evidence proffered items too anemic to score the point legitimately.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">So we reach lastly the question whether appellant\u2019s exhibits possessed a capability to prove an unconstitutional distinction in the enforcement of the involved statutes against him. The Government takes the position, as we understand it, that the equal protection mandate affords no basis upon which one accused of crime may lay a claim of prosecutorial discrimination,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and indeed there are cases which seemingly so hold.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> We would otherwise have thought that, at least since Yick Wo v. Hopkins,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> prosecutors, like other governmental representatives, were constitutionally bound to refrain from administering the law \u201cwith an evil eye and an unequal hand.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This the Supreme Court seems clearly to have recognized,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and other courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>have held,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> but in this litigation it is unnecessary to debate the point. Appellant has not, in any event, undertaken enough of a showing to even raise the question, so we express no view as to how it should be resolved. It will be time enough to do so if and when, upon a record concretely and unavoidably presenting the issue for decision, the Government sees fit to resubmit the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">What we have said regarding appellant\u2019s charge that the lottery law is discriminatory on its face applies similarly to his complaint that it is unfairly enforced, and as to the latter we are led to the same conclusion. Whether or not the prosecutor\u2019s discretion in law enforcement is coextensive with the legislature\u2019s in law enactment, it is by its very nature exceedingly broad.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> And a deprivation of equal protection must inevitably be \u201cfound in the actual existence of an invidious discrimination\u201d and \u201cnot in the mere possibility that there will be like or similar eases which will be treated more leniently.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Here there was no claim of\u2014much less a professed ability to substantiate\u2014any intentional, purposeful differentiation.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> It will not do simply to show, as appellant would, that enforcement of the law is lax,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> or even that other offenders may go free.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aeb\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Circuit Judge TAMM concurs only in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\">.

Cross-examination of the arresting officer at trial revealed that the street on which appellant made the U-turn was barricaded at one end, with the result that entering vehicles had to make such a turn to exit. This circumstance, appellant says, shows that his U-turn was not a legal violation. The officer\u2019s testimony, however, makes it clear that the violation consisted in considerably more than the U-turn. He explained: \u201c[Appellant] was parked facing south on the west side of the 200 block of 11th Street. He pulled from that position directly east across the middle of the street in front of a ear. The driver had to apply his brakes very abruptly in order to avoid striking [appellant\u2019s] car.\u201d It was this sort of operation that Judge Walsh, as well as the officer, deemed a violation, United States v.

His other contention is that the ruling was erroneous because the excluded exhibits tended to prove that the materials found in his possession were not lottery paraphernalia within the meaning of the statutes.

See the cases cited in note 19, <em>supra, </em>particularly United States v. Vanegas, 216 F.2d at 658. Thus the exhibits are not before us for examination, and the evidentiary virtues appellant attributes to them cannot be left to more assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">Moreover, coupling appellant\u2019s asserted purpose with the description in his brief of the two exhibits marked for identification, which from all that appears are representative of the rest, it is plain that they lacked value. He urges that possession of documentary items not containing an express <em>guaranty </em>of a chance to win is innocuous and, on the premise that the papers taken from him did not in words assure, such a chance while the exhibits he tendered did, he says that he wanted the latter in evidence in order that the jury might compare them all. This position, however, overlooks critical statutory language. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1501 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>(1967 ed.), upon which the first count of the indictment was predicated, makes the possession of copies or records of certain things prima facie evidence of the promotion of a lottery, and these include \u201cany chance, right, or interest, * * * in any * * * lottery\u201d and \u201cany ticket, * * * token, or other device, <em>purporting or intended </em>to guarantee or assure to any person or entitle him to a chance of drawing or obtaining a prize to be drawn in any lottery. * * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) See note 2, <em>supra.. </em>D.
