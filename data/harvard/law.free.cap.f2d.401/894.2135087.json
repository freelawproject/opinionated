He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment under each count, the sentences to run concurrently. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">Appellant\u2019s sole specification of error is that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel. His defense was conducted by retained counsel of his own choosing. Although the record reveals counsel\u2019s inexperience as a trial lawyer and his unfamiharity with certain rules of evidence and trial procedure, we conclude that when measured by the applicable standard, appellant\u2019s representation was adequate. Where inadequacy of counsel is alleged, relief may be obtained only when representation is so inadequate as to make the trial a farce and a mockery of justice, United States v. Garguilo, 324 F.2d 795 (2d Cir. 1963), or when there has been a denial of fundamental fairness, Brubaker v. Dickson, 310 F.2d 30 (9th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 978, 83 S.Ct. 1110, 10 L.Ed.2d 143 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
