There was no error in the original denial of a severance, in admitting the testimony of those who cashed the checks, or in the instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Before the government completed the presentation of its case in chief Giles\u2019 co-defendant, his half brother, McArthur, withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty. The jury was not informed of this plea but was clearly advised that the co-defendant\u2019s case would be disposed of at another time and place. At this point, counsel who had been representing both, moved for a mistrial and for the appointment of new counsel on the ground that a conflict of interest would exist as to his continued representation of Giles after McArthur had pleaded guilty. Recognizing, as we do, the principles announced in Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 [see also Kaplan v. United States, 9 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 895] this guilty plea eliminated any conflict of interest, if any had theretofore existed. In fact, it allowed Giles to put all the blame on his former co-defendant and permitted counsel to concentrate solely on his defense, without the complication of having to carry along the additional client-defendant. The record shows that Giles was the beneficiary of most competent representation both at the trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
