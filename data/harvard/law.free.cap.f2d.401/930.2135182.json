Section 203(a) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act bans, in the absence of the Commission\u2019s authorizing order, the disposition by such a utility of \u201cthe whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $50,000,\u201d and the merger or consolidation of \u201csuch facilities or any part thereof with those of any other person.\u201d In the proceeding under review, the Commission, applying this section to undisputed facts, answered the question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">Duke Power Company, a utility subject to the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conducts some of its activities in South Carolina. With the approbation of that state,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it bought from Clemson University, an agency exempted from the operation of the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> facilities <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which Clemson had previously employed in off-campus distribution of electricity to customers in two South Carolina counties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Commission found, Duke thereby \u201cacquired only seven miles of distribution line and 418 service connections to be supplied from its system in the same way they had before the acquisition.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">The Commission learned of the transaction several months later when Duke submitted proposed journal entries to record it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Citing Section 203(a) and its own regulation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>then asked Duke to file an application for approval.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Duke\u2019s rejoinder was a request for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the purchased facilities. The Commission thereupon initiated a declaratory proceeding<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which culminated in its determination that \u201c[b]y acquiring the facilities of Clemson * * * Duke merged or consolidated its facilities with those of another person without having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so as required by Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and\u201d the Commission's regulation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Duke\u2019s timely petition for rehearing was denied,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the case is here for our review of the Commission\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">We hold that Section 203(a), properly construed, is inapplicable to the transaction in suit. We accordingly reverse the Commission\u2019s order and remand the proceeding for a declaration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Section 203(a) in pertinent part provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">\u201cNo public utility shall sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $50,000, or by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate such facilities or any part thereof with those of any other person, or purchase, acquire, or take any security of any other public utility, without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">We note, at the outset, that the prohibitions forged by this section are imposed only upon a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Duke freely admits that it is a public utility within the purview of the Act, and in this proceeding the Commission, adher-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>ently with an earlier determination,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> found that it was.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Not all of the activities of a public utility, however, are subjected to the regulatory authority of the Commission.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We mention now, and discuss later,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the historical fact that the Act is not an exertion of the full national power over interstate electric utilities, but a delineation, consciously and carefully made, of the operations Congress decided to-render amenable to federal control. Duke was obliged to honor the requirement the Commission invoked only if its acquisition from Clemson was a transaction to which that requirement applied.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Analysis of Section 203(a) reveals three activities that are forbidden unless authorized by the Commission, of which two quite obviously are not involved in this case. The first is a sale, lease or other disposition by a public utility \u201cof the whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $50,-000.\u201d No such disposition by Duke engages our attention and, as the Commission held,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Clemson was not a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The second inapplicable prohibition is the purchase, acquisition or</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">taking by one public utility of a security of another public utility. Nothing of that character occurred here. Our question relates to the remaining injunction \u2014\u201cNo public utility shall * * * by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate <em>such facilities </em>or any part thereof with <em>those of any other </em>person, * *. * without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Commission felt that, by taking over Clemson\u2019s distribution system, Duke \u201cmerged or consolidated\u201d its preexisting facilities with \u201cthose of another person.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">We accept the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause encompasses acquisitions <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of facilities,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and we share the parties\u2019 view that the words \u201csuch facilities,\u201d adverting to the facilities of the public utility with which the acquired facilities are incorporated, must be \u201cfacilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d The controversy here centers upon the reference properly supplied by the phrase \u201cthose of any other person,\u201d which points to the facilities procured for the incorporation. Duke argues that the antecedent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>\u201cthose\u201d is the phrase, \u201csuch facilities,\u201d language in turn referring to \u201cfacilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,\u201d and points out that Clemson\u2019s distribution system fell outside the latter category. The Commission, on the other hand, would have us ascribe to the phrase \u201cthose [facilities] of any other person\u201d sufficient breadth to include both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">By our estimate, we face a constructional problem of which the bare statutory words admit confidently of no single solution. They do not inexorably preclude Commission supervision of proposed combinations of interstate and intrastate facilities, but neither do they unambiguously endow the Commission with authority to do so. We feel that, without crystallization extrinsically, they can be read either way, with the result that we cannot safely confine the scope of our inquiry to their grammatical potentialities. Here, as in any similar context, we are impelled to resort instead \u201cto all the aids available in the process of construction, to history and analogy and practice as well as to the dictionary.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Until 1927, state commissions exercised ratemaking jurisdiction over sales by public utilities of electric energy, including energy transmitted over interstate lines.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In that year came the celebrated <em>Attleboro </em>decision <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to the effect that the states are constitutionally incapable of fixing the rates at which sales at wholesale in interstate commerce are to be made.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In the <em>laissez-faire </em>milieu thus created utility holding companies flourished, and behind the <em>Attleboro </em>shield abuses became flagrant.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It was to correct these abuses that, with the strong support of President Roosevelt,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Congress enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> to bring the holding companies under federal governance.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> And it was primarily to fill the \u201cAttleboro gap\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> that Congress concomitantly passed the Federal Power Act<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> as its first exertion of national authority over the operating electric utilities.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Congress did not, however, in formulating the proscriptive provisions of the Power Act, undertake to exhaust its constitutional prerogatives.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While by no means confined in its coverage to areas legally immune from state control,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the Act\u2019s major emphasis is upon federal regulation of those aspects of the industry which \u2014 for reasons either legal or practical \u2014 are beyond the pale of effective state supervision.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> A federal-state balance of authority, by which this general objective was to be achieved, was not only a characteristic solemnly declared when the legislation was proffered for enactment,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> but is also a feature evident from many sections of the Act,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> of which perhaps two contain the most vivid expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Section 201(a) declares the necessity in the public interest for federal regulation in the electric utility field, partially of \u201cmatters relating to generation\u201d and wholly \u201cof the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate' commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But with a congressional purpose to impose \u201cFederal regulation only over those matters which cannot effectively be controlled by the States,\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> that section further provides that \u201csuch Federal regulation, however, [is] to extend only to those matters which are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>subject to regulation by the States.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Thus emerging, said one of the Act\u2019s draftsmen,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> was the underlying legislative policy \u201cthat matters largely of a local nature, even though interstate in character, should be handled locally and should receive the consideration of local men familiar with the local conditions in the communities involved.\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Having found the need for federal regulation to be related mainly to interstate transmission and wholesaling of electricity,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Congress mandated in Section 201(b) that the provisions of the Act directed toward public electric utilities \u201cshall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce but shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy.\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> And once again observing the basic legislative plan for a federal-state division of regulatory power, Congress conferred upon the Commission jurisdiction \u201cover all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy,\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> but explicated several categories in which the Commission would be powerless to act.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">\u201cThe limitation on the Federal Power Commission\u2019s jurisdiction in this regard,\u201d reported the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, \u201chas been inserted in each section in an effort to prevent the expansion of Federal authority over State matters.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And the restriction which particularly concerns us is found in the provision of Section 201(b) that the Commission \u201cshall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided * * *, over facilities used * * * in local distribution * * * \u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">The bill that became the Federal Power Act was drafted by the Commission.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The Senate and House bills that proceeded to final passage as the Act contained, in identically its present language, what is now the Section 203(a) \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This is to say more than that the clause ran the legislative gamut from introduction to enactment without change of any sort. It is to suggest that its survival, in unmodified form, of scrutiny by both an agency and a legislature intent upon a division of regulatory authority between the national and state governments seriously inveighs against the likelihood that the question as to which was to control acquisitions of non jurisdictional facilities was intended to be left open to either administrative or judicial speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>The Commission committed the authorship of the bill to Commissioner Seavey and Solicitor DeVane,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and each testified in its support. Not only do we comb their statements in vain for any claim that the acquisition clause was intended to include non jurisdictional facilities but, to the extent that they referred to it, each stated the contrary. Commissioner Seavey had occasion to briefly but un-qualifiedly observe that \u201c[f] aridities for local distribution * * * are excluded\u201d from the Act<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Solicitor DeVane, who discussed Section 203(a) quite elaborately, explained that \u201cit has nothing to do with facilities that relate only to local distribution * * * \u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">The committee reports likewise reflect the view that the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause was confined to jurisdictional properties. The Senate Committee on Int\u00e9rstate Commerce stated that Section 203(a) \u201crequires Commission approval of the sale, lease, or other disposition of <em>facilities subject to the act </em>and of the consolidation of <em>such </em>facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It added that the section \u201csubjects to the requirement of Commission authorization any sale, lease, or other disposition of the <em>facilities </em>of a public utility <em>subject to the </em>act<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and any merger or consolidation of <em>such </em>facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce similarly reported that the proposed legislation \u201cgives control over * * * the consolidation, purchase, and sale of <em>interstate operating properties </em><footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and, specifically as to Section 203(a), that \u201capproval must be secured for the sale, lease, or other disposition by a public utility of all of its <em>facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, </em>or any part of the facilities in excess of a value of $100,000,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and for mergers or consolidations of <em>such </em>facilities.\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiQN\">From relevant legislative history, then, several far-reaching considerations emerge conspicuously. The congressional philosophy involved basically a definition of separate spheres for federal and state regulation. The lines of demarcation were carefully drawn, in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>operating facilities as well as operations, and the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause was an integral part of that effort. From all that was said by those who authored it, as well as by the committees which nurtured it, it appears that the clause was intended to affect acquisitions of jurisdictional facilities only. We now look, for further evidence of legislative intention, to the statutory language itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">111</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">We may readily place in proper perspective the provision in Section 201 (a) that federal regulation, as there broadly projected, is \u201cto extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Born simply a statement of aims, and later reworded without any discernible purpose to substantively change its character,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> it is not a limitation on the Commission\u2019s exercise of any authority Congress distinctly conferred upon it.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> This provision is \u201cmerely a policy declaration * * * of great generality. It cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction, even if the particular grant seems inconsistent with the broadly expressed purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> So, \u201conce a company is properly found to be a \u2018public utility\u2019 under the Act the fact that a local commission may also have regulatory power does not preclude exercise of the Commission\u2019s functions.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The circumstance that South Carolina held sway over the Duke-Clemson transaction does not oust the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over that transaction if Congress gave it any.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">This is not, however, to say that the Section 201(a) policy declaration may play no part in the jurisdictional determination we must make in this case. The \u201cdeclaration is relevant and entitled to respect as a guide in resolving any ambiguity or indefiniteness in the specific provisions which purport to carry out its intent. It cannot be wholly ignored.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> For that purpose, and to that extent, we give it consideration as we ponder the problem before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">Quite different in character, however, is the restriction incorporated in the provision of Section 201(b) that the Commission \u201cshall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided, * * * over facilities used * * * in local distribution.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The Act, as we have seen, effectuated federal control over the transmission and the sale at wholesale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>electric energy in interstate commerce,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and established the Commission\u2019s regulatory power over public utilities engaging in either of these pursuits.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> And, as the framers of the Act envisioned, \u201c [federal jurisdiction was to follow the flow of electric energy, an engineering and scientific, rather than a legalistic or governmental, test.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> But this test, if applied unlimitedly and exclusively, would obviously obliterate the federal-state allocations of regulatory power specified in the Act whenever, at any point between generation and consumption, the energy traversed a state boundary.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The Section 201(b) curtailments of Commission jurisdiction on the contingencies enumerated stand guard against any such consequence.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-4\">\u201c[Wjhatever reason or combination of reasons led Congress to put the provision in the Act, we think it meant what it said by the words \u2018but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this Part or in the Part next following * * * over facilities used in local distribution.\u2019 Congress by these terms plainly was trying to reconcile the claims of federal and of local authorities and to apportion federal and state jurisdiction over the industry. To define the scope of state controls, Congress employed terms of limitation perhaps less scientific, less precise, less definite than the terms of the grant of federal power. The expression \u2018facilities used in local distribution\u2019 is one of relative generality. But as used in this Act it is not a meaningless generality in the light of our history and the structure of our government. We hold the phrase to be a limitation on jurisdiction and a legal standard that must be given effect in this case in addition to the technological transmission test.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Thus we derive two canons, each emanating from the Act, by which our construction of the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause of Section 208(a) is to be guided. The Commission lacked jurisdiction over the local distribution facilities Duke acquired from Clemson unless that jurisdiction was \u201cspecifically\u201d granted in Section 208(a) or elsewhere in the Act. And in resolving any ambiguity as to whether it was granted, we must remain sensitive to the policy declaration in Section 201 (a). With these, and other criteria appropriate to the solution of problems of statutory interpretation, we focus upon particular provisions and purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">\u201cNo public utility,\u201d said Congress, \u201cshall * * * merge or consolidate such facilities * * * with those of any other person,\u201d <footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and both the Commission\u2019s decision under review <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and its argument here endeavor to support its position that this clause embraces non-jurisdictional facilities by concentrating on the use of the word \u201cperson.\u201d It is clear, and the Commission concedes, that the meaning of \u201csuch facilities\u201d is crystallized by their grammatical antecedent, \u2018facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> but the Commission disputes Duke\u2019s contention that the latter phrase also fixes the meaning of \u201cthose.\u201d Pointing to the fact that the Act gives \u201cperson\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> a broader definition than \u201cpublic utility,\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> the Commission insists that if \u201cthose\u201d referred only to jurisdictional facilities, \u201cperson,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cpublic utility,\u201d is inappropriately used, the theory being that the \u201cperson\u201d would in every case be a \u201cpublic utility\u201d by reason of its ownership of such jurisdictional facilities. To give proper range to \u201cperson,\u201d the argument runs, it is necessary to extend it to every utility disposing of operating facilities, although only non jurisdictional facilities, and to construe \u201cthose\u201d as including such facilities.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>We cannot accept the Commission\u2019s foundational premise that jurisdictional facilities can be acquired only from a company which is a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the Act. Governmental agencies and in-strumentalities,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> utilities carrying bn only intrastate business <footnotemark>87</footnotemark> and, as we recently held, electric cooperatives financed under the Rural Electrification Act,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> are not \u201cpublic utilities,\u201d but we have no doubt that any acquisition from either by a public utility of what would normally be a jurisdictional facility, such as a transmission line conducting interstate energy, would fall within the purview of the clause under consideration <footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Thus, we disagree with the Commission that the use of \u201cpublic utility\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d in Section 203(a) was an effort toward the contradistinction which it assumes, or that the use of \u201cperson\u201d is pivotal in the construction of that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">We may, for guidance in this connection, draw upon a precedent which United States v. Public Utilities Commission<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> affords. The Act defines a \u201csale of electric energy at wholesale,\u201d when within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, as \u201ca sale of electric energy to any person for resale.\u201d <footnotemark>91</footnotemark> At the same time, person is defined as meaning \u201can individual or a corporation,\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> but municipalities are excluded from the definition of \u201ccorporation.\u201d <footnotemark>93</footnotemark> On this basis, it was argued that sales of electric energy to a Nevada county had been put beyond the regulatory authority of the Commission. The Court disagreed, partly because an examination of legislative history led to the conclusion \u201cthat the Congress attached no significance of substance to the addition of the word \u2018person,\u2019 and in fact did not intend it as a .limitation on Commission jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">We find a quite similar situation here. Solicitor DeVane, a draftsman of the Act<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> who emphasized that the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause did not encompass local distribution facilities,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> explained to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce that \u201cwe also use the word \u2018person,\u2019 because in the drafting of the act, and particularly in the new part of the act, you could use the word \u2018person\u2019 with brevity and it made simplification for drafting.\u201d <footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The Senate and House committee reports ascribe no importance to the word \u201cperson\u201d in that clause and indicate plainly that it related only to jurisdictional facilities.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Nowhere in the Act\u2019s legislative history do we find a suggestion that the word is to be given the connotation urged by the Commission.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">We think, too, that a construction limiting the operation of the acquisition clause to jurisdictional facilities more nearly comports with its remaining lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>guage. The prohibition the clause effects can be violated only if one undertakes to \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d facilities intercepted by the word \u201cthose\u201d with \u201csuch facilities,\u201d and \u201csuch facilities,\u201d we have said and the parties have agreed, must be jurisdictional facilities which, in turn, are facilities engaged in the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce. The integration of acquired jurisdictional facilities and the acquirer\u2019s pre-existing jurisdictional facilities strikes us as the very kind of union Congress intended to bring under Commission control. But it is quite a strain to consider an acquisition and unaltered use of a local distribution system as a \u201cmerger\u201d or \u201cconsolidation\u201d with the jurisdictional facilities which make possible the acquirer\u2019s interstate operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Adverting briefly to a taproot, we are taken back once again to the explicit provision that the Commission \u201cshall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided * * * over facilities used * * * in local distribution.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s construction is palatable only if it can be said that by its choice of \u201cperson,\u201d Congress \u201cspecifically provided\u201d for jurisdiction over acquisitions of local distribution facilities.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the unsophisticated use of \u201cperson\u201d in the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause was so precise a formulation of Commission authority over local distribution systems as to warrant that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The Commission also directs our attention to the effect which an acquisition of facilities might possibly have upon the caliber of the service the acquiring utility can furnish, and upon the degree of coordination, both internally and externally, of its operating facilities it can achieve.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> It is pointed out that a prime purpose of the Federal Power Act in general and Section 203(a) in particular was \u201cto protect the public against an uneconomic realinement\u201d of utility companies expected to occur in the wake of the \u201cunscrambling of the holding company properties\u201d as a result of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> And the Commission argues that the linguistic vagaries of Section 203(a) should be interpreted broadly to effectuate this purpose.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">We acknowledge the general purpose thus stated as one of the underpinnings of the Power Act, but we cannot derive from it, in combination with the imprecise language of Section 203(a), a specific jurisdictional grant. On the contrary, in context, the manner in which the Act treated the problem of efficient realinement generally leads us to the conclusion that it was intended to exclude non jurisdictional facilities from its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">The Commission\u2019s power with reference to a public utility\u2019s service, we have said,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> is confined by the general jurisdictional grant to the utility\u2019s interstate operations. The Act more specially provides that the Commission, only \u201cupon complaint of a State commission\u201d and within fixed limitations, may correct inadequacies in the utility\u2019s \u201cinterstate service.\u201d <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> From this we would suppose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>that the Commission\u2019s legitimate concern as to the relationship between the utility\u2019s service and its operating properties would be restricted to jurisdictional facilities, by which the interstate service is provided. And this we find, from other provisions of the Act, the case very definitely to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">External coordination and interconnection of facilities are subjects to which the elaborate provisions of Section 202<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> are addressed. Subsection (a) directs the Commission, for purposes related to the maximum availability of electric service, \u201cto divide the country into regional districts for the <em>voluntary </em>interconnection and coordination of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy,\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> and provides that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the Commission to <em>promote </em>and <em>encourage </em>such interconnection and coordination within each such district and between such districts.\u201d <footnotemark>109</footnotemark> We find nothing in this language authorizing the Commission to <em>compel </em>any particular interconnection or technique of coordination.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>(b) empowers the Commission, \u201cupon application of any State commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy\u201d and subject to stated conditions, to \u201cdirect a public utility * * * to establish physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such persons.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> These provisions, while licensing the Commission to require a public utility to interconnect in the circumstances specified, do not touch the matter of its acquisition of operating properties.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The same observation is pertinent to subsections (c) and (d), which relate exclusively to temporary interconnections during national emergencies.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Also reflecting the concern for economic alinement of electric facilities in the wake of the Holding Company Act was that portion of Section 203(a) which provides that \u201c[n]o public utility shall * * * purchase, acquire, or take any security of any other public utility\u201d without Commission approval.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> This provision complements the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause by assuring that unapproved combinations which cannot be created directly by the purchase of assets also cannot be created indirectly by the purchase of securities, and both are designed to complement the Holding Company Act. But significantly, the Section 203(a) restrictions on stock purchases are specifically limited to purchases <em>by </em>public utilities \u2014 jurisdictional companies <em>\u2014of </em>public utility stock.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Subsection (a) of Section 203, of which the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause is a part, specifies the procedural steps preliminary to Commission action upon an application for approval of either of the three activities to which that subsection applies,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> and requires the Commission to approve the activity if it is \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Subsection (b) authorizes the Commission, upon granting such approval, to impose \u201csuch terms and conditions as it finds necessary or appropriate to secure the maintenance of adequate service and the coordination in the public interest of <em>facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d </em><footnotemark>118</footnotemark> It is evident from this provision that as to the quality of the utility\u2019s service and the internal coordination of its operating properties, Congress intended to forge the link with jurisdictional facilities only<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">This conclusion seems inevitable, not only from the language of the Act, but from logic as well. Acquisitions by pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>lie Utilities, it seems to us, have no greater influence upon service and coordination of facilities than dispositions, as to which the utilities enjoy a large measure of immunity from Commission control. Only dispositions of \u201cfacilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission\u201d may be regulated by the Commission,<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> and not even those when they do not exceed $50,000 in value.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> The anomalousness of the Commission\u2019s argument becomes the more apparent in light of the fact that jurisdictional facilities constitute but a small portion of the industry\u2019s investment in total electric utility plant.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> It is hard to believe that while Congress left Duke completely free to dispose of its vast holdings in non-jurisdictional properties, it intended to condition its purchase from Clemson of a small distribution plant upon the Commission\u2019s prior sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The Commission, both in its opinion and in argument to us, relies on language from the report of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce as demonstrating congressional disapproval of unregulated over-concentration in the power industry.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The cited language, however, relates to Title I and not Title II of the statute. Title I, the Holding Company Act, gave the Securities and Exchange Commission sweeping power to deal comprehensively with the whole problem of acquisitions affecting the structure of the power industry. With significant exceptions, SEC approval was required before any holding company or subsidiary could lawfully \u201cacquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or utility assets or any other interest in any business.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> And SEC approval was to be given only if the Commission was satisfied that explicitly enumerated public interest standards had been met.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Yet even Title I of the 1935 legislation\u2014 where one would expect to find far-reaching concern for acquisitions most strongly manifested \u2014 did not require federal approval of an acquisition when, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>here,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> the state authority expressly authorized it.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">We recognize, as the Commission asserts, that the increased load which the acquiring utility might be required to serve in consequence of an addition of nonjurisdictional facilities could conceivably depreciate the service it affords through its jurisdictional facilities. We also realize that an improvident purchase of nonjurisdictional facilities might to some extent hamper the optimum synchronization of its jurisdictional facilities. But to conclude from these possibilities that Section 203(a) is a broad jurisdictional grant is inconsistent with the pattern of the statute. A fair reading of the legislative history, in our view, fails to establish a careful, deliberate attempt to coordinate Titles I and II. Rather, these provisions were separately and independently authored to be enforced by different agencies, and it is our clear impression that close attention was never given to their harmonious functioning. Against this backdrop, what stands out and prevails in our view is the premise of the Power Act capsuled in the policy statement of Section 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">A mainstay in the Commission\u2019s argument for an interpretation of the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause which would cover purchases of nonjurisdictional facilities is the Commission's assertion of need for ways and means to prevent public utilities from inflating their property accounts through write-ups on new acquisitions.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> We do not gainsay the importance of tools adequate to forestall accounting abuses which ultimately and unfairly create higher charges for electricity, nor do we overlook the practical values which Commission control over all property augmentations could create. Other provisions of the Act, however, arm the Commission with formidable weapons with which to eradicate fictitious write-ups, and these, we think, serve to further militate against the adoption of the expanded construction of the acquisition clause which is urged upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">The Commission is statutorily empowered to investigate and ascertain the legitimate costs of public utility properties, the rates of depreciation thereon, and such other facts as a determination of fair value for ratemaking purposes might involve.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> To this end, the utilities are required to inventory their properties with the Commission,<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> to maintain their financial records conformably with the Commission\u2019s uniform accounting system,<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> and to supply the Commission with essential information.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> By exercise of its broad power to order appropriate accounting adjustments,<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> the Commission can require any excess in purchase price over net original cost of an acquired property to be disposed of<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> and any artificial write-up in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>capital accounts to be eliminated.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> As the Commission\u2019s experience in utilizing these provisions so vividly attests,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> they provide the wherewithal for keeping problems of this sort under control.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The relationship these provisions bear to our constructional problem is well illustrated by Pennsylvania Electric Company v. FPC,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> where they were held to substitute adequately for the expanded interpretation the Commission would have us adopt. A public utility, without the Commission\u2019s prior approval, bought three local distribution systems, and the Commission, asserting jurisdiction over the acquisition and finding that an inflated price had been paid, ordered an accounting adjustment to exclude the excess from the rate base.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Since this enabled complete rectification, the Third Circuit, on review, considered it unnecessary to decide whether the acquisition clause of Section 203(a) extended the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to the purchase in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The Commission argues that since the accounting provisions authorize action only after an acquisition has occurred, situations could arise wherein they might not suffice to enable suitable modification of transactions out of harmony with the Act.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> We suppose this is within the realm of possibility, but if there has actually been an occurrence of this sort, it has not been brought to our attention, and certainly none is claimed as to Duke.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Moreover, a similar problem of waste, with its ultimate adverse impact on the rate base, would arise in a variety of situations to which the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend. For example, a public utility may decide to sell at market value assets with low book value (but high economic value) and to use the funds to construct facilities of high book value. This may make good sense from the point of view of the utility\u2019s management, yet be improvident so far as the consumer is concerned, since there could be an increase in cost of utility service based on book value rate base that goes beyond the true value to the consumer of the substitution of facilities. Yet for distribution plant and other non jurisdictional facilities, and these preponderate by far over the jurisdictional transmission lines, there is no requirement of advance Commission approval of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">The point is that Congress did not pass a comprehensive regulatory measure giving the Commission regulatory jurisdiction broad enough to cover any and all possible evils. It may well be that Congress should plug all such possibilities.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> We say only that it has not yet done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">Much more fundamentally, the Commission\u2019s construction of the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause as permitting an exercise of control over a public utility\u2019s purchase of non jurisdictional facilities, because of an incidental effect it might have upon some aspect of the utility\u2019s interstate operations, would frustrate two major premises of the Act. Foremost is the deep-seated congressional policy by which regulatory authority in the public electric utility field was apportioned, in accordance with a precise formula, between the Commission and its counterparts in the states.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> To accept the Commission\u2019s theory would emasculate the restrictions Congress imposed upon the exercise of its power and expand it \u201cto the constitutional limit of congressional authority over commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The Commission\u2019s concept would also require, in order to decide whether jurisdiction over any particular acquisition exists, that the impact of local supervision be measured on a case-by-case basis. This \u201cflexible approach\u201d<footnotemark>143</footnotemark>- \u2014 involving as it does the consideration, <em>inter alia, </em>of \u201cthe effect of the regulation upon the national interest in the commerce\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> \u2014has been flatly rejected as a technique for resolving jurisdictional conflicts between the Commission and state bodies.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Congress might have adopted that approach, leaving its specific application to the courts, but instead it \u201cundertook to regulate * * * without the necessity, where Congress has not acted, of drawing the precise line between state and federal power by the litigation- of particular cases.\u201d <footnotemark>146</footnotemark> We think that like the line \u201c[i]t cut sharply and cleanly between sales for resale and direct sales for consumptive uses\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> to facilitate jurisdictional determinations in rate regulation, \u201cCongress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained, between state and federal jurisdiction, making unnecessary such case-by-case analysis,\u201d <footnotemark>148</footnotemark> in distributing regulatory power over the acquisition of facilities.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The primary grant of Commission authority is expressed congruently with the specification of national power which Congress saw fit to delimit in the Act.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> Thus \u201conly the facilities of a public utility used in the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce or the rates and charges for such energy are subjected * * * to regulation by the Federal Power Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>mission.\u201d <footnotemark>151</footnotemark> The Commission lacks jurisdiction over Duke\u2019s sales at retail in South Carolina<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> and, unless otherwise \u201cspecifically provided,\u201d<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> over Clemson\u2019s former local distribution system from which such sales are now made.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Various sections of the Act, including those to which the Commission refers, reflect congressional recognition of a relationship between property acquisitions and those aspects of the industry which it subjected to Commission control. They do not, however, imply \u2014 -much less \u201cspecifically\u201d provide for \u2014 a projection of power to intercept facilities which the Act\u2019s language and legislative background so clearly put beyond the Commission\u2019s reach.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In sum, Congress nowhere \u201cspecifically provided\u201d for Commission jurisdiction over an acquisition by a public utility of facilities utilized solely in local distribution of electric energy for retail sale. We do not find the provision of that jurisdiction either in the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause or in any other portion of the Act.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> We cannot impute to the Congress which so earnestly strove for precision and clarity in the formulation of its grant of federal authority an intention to confer the broad power the Commission assumed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">We have remained advertent to the fact that the decision under review is an interpretation of the Act by the agency to which its administration is entrusted.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Moreover, both protagonists solicited our examination of the Commission\u2019s past decisions construing the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause in its relation to acquisitions of non jurisdictional properties, and this we have carefully done. We customarily attach weight to the administrative construction of an authorizing statute,<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> and a consistent and clear-cut interpretation of the acquisition clause by the Commission might well have benefited this litigation. But we have derived little assistance from the vacillating policy the Commission has pursued over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">We found nothing of help one way or the other in the Commission\u2019s earliest adjudications, which for lack of finding or recital as to the character of the acquired facilities all too frequently left the decisional basis obscure.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> In 1940, however, the Commission clearly and squarely held that an acquisition of non-jurisdictional distributive facilities did not require the Commission\u2019s prior approval. Faced with a situation where \u201cthe electric facilities proposed to be sold and purchased consist principally of a seven-mile wood pole electric line and appurtenances, and are facilities used only for the sale of electric energy at retail in serving approximately 145 customers in a small rural or predominantly rural area,\u201d the Commission held that these were \u201cfacilities used only in local distribution, which are not subject to the requirements of Section 203 of the Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>eral Power Act.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, it reached the same result in two additional cases where the properties sought were local distribution systems.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that throughout this period Commissioner Seavey, who participated in the drafting of the Act, remained as a member of the Commission.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Between 1944 and 1962, however, the Commission no less than five times shifted its position as to the applicability of the \u201cmerge or consolidate\u201d clause to acquisitions of non jurisdictional facilities.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> It is evident that for many years the problem has vexed the Commission, as for some time it has troubled us, and we cannot rid ourselves of lingering doubts as to whether its interpretative conclusion is yet firm. In any event, it is apparent that its construction of the clause in this ease cannot command the respect we might otherwise be inclined to pay to it. \u201cThe court is not bound by an administrative construction, and if that construction is not uniform and consistent, it will be taken into account only to the extent that it is supported by valid reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> We are convinced that the considerations the Commission advanced at the administrative level, and reiterated here, cannot survive that test.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">We reverse the order of the Commission under review and remand the case to the Commission for the entry of an order declaratory of the inapplicability of Section 203 of the Act to Duke\u2019s acqusition from Clemson.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-5\">. <em>49 </em>Stat. 838 (1935), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a to 825r.

Federal jurisdiction was to follow the flow of electric energy, an engineering and scientific, rather than a legalistic or governmental, test. Technology of the business is such that if any part of a supply of electric energy comes from outside of a state it is, or may be, present in every connected distribution facility. Every facility from generator to the appliance for consumption may thus be called one for transmitting such interstate power. By this test the cord from a light plug to a toaster on the breakfast table is a facility for transmission of interstate energy if any part of the load is generated without the state. It has never been questioned that technologically generation, transmission, distribution and consumption are so fused and interdependent that the whole enterprise is within the reach of the commerce power of Congress, either on the basis that it is, or that it affects, interstate commerce, if at any point it crosses a state line. Such a broad and undivided base for jurisdiction of the Power Commission would be quite unobjectionable and perhaps highly salutary if the United States were a unitary government and the only conflicting interests to be considered were those of the regulated company.\u201d Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC, <em>supra </em>note 20, 324 U.S. at 529-530, 65 S.Ct. 749, 755, 89 L.Ed. 1150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b987-13\">. \u201cIt is hard for us to believe that Congress meant us to read \u2018shall have jurisdiction\u2019 where it had carefully written \u2018but shall not have jurisdiction.\u2019 The command \u2018thou shalt not\u2019 is usually rendered as to forbid and we think here it was employed without subtlety or contortion and in its usual sense. If otherwise in doubt this provision should be read in harmony with the policy provision. So read, its terms seem plainly to state circumstances under which the Commission shall not have jurisdiction. As such it is the provision which loomed importantly in the minds and speech of its sponsors, perhaps was necessary to get the bill passed, and is one which the Commission must observe and the courts must enforce.\u201d Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC, <em>supra </em>note 20, 324 U.S. at 528-529, 65 S.Ct. 749, 755, 89 L.Ed. 1150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b987-14\">. <em>Id. </em>at 530-531, 65 S.Ct. 749, 756.

The Commission argues contrarily that the clause directs a prohibition to a proposed acquisitional transaction by a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d and that the transaction \u2014 its terms and conditions \u2014 and not the nature of the facilities, is the subject to which it is addressed. We think this begs the question, which is whether the clause, properly construed, affects the acquisitional transaction only because of the nature of the facilities acquired.

For a short period commencing in 1944 the Commission exercised jurisdiction over the acquisition of facilities employed in local distribution. See, <em>e. g., </em>In re Southwestern Public Serv. Co., 4 F.P.C. 1123 (1945); In re Northern Virginia Power Co., 5 F.P.C. 458 (1946); In re Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co., 6 F.P.C. 1114 (1947). But in 1947, it reached a diametrically contrary conclusion, In re Northern States Power Go., 6 F.P.C. 743 (1947), only to be followed soon thereafter by another change in construction. See, e. <em>g., </em>In re Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., 12 F.P.C. 1168 (1953); In re Interstate Power Co., 16 F.P.C. 825 (1956).
