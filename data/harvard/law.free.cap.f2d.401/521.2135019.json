Appellant Nelson, in addition to being found guilty of the conspiracy charge, was also convicted of the substantive offense of attempting to sell the counterfeit notes in violation of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 472. Initially ten defendants were indicted and charged with participation in the conspiracy. However, prior to trial, four entered pleas of guilty, the indictment was dismissed as to one, and another could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">The central figure in the case, and, after his plea of guilty the government\u2019s star witness, was Richard Rutter. He had been contacted by an acquaintance from Toledo, Ohio, concerning the possibility of obtaining a substantial quantity of counterfeit notes. In response to the request, Rutter first attempted to acquire the currency through an arrangement with Jones and another man, but this attempt aborted because of Rutter\u2019s lack of funds. Rutter then approached a man named Barkett and asked him to print the counterfeit notes and share in any proceeds from their sale. Barkett agreed to this scheme, but the notes he printed were unacceptable to Rutter\u2019s acquaintance from Toledo and the transaction was never consummated. Following this, Rutter and Barkett decided to destroy most of the currency, and apparently Barkett believed this is what was done. Rutter, however, lied to Barkett and in fact retained a large portion of the notes, in the hope that he could dispose of them elsewhere. It was at this point that J ones reentered the picture and the other three defendants appeared for the first time. They had no knowledge of the source of the notes or of Rutter\u2019s previous dealings. They did, however, subsequently aid Rutter in his efforts to distribute the counterfeit notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">The government chose to characterize this series of events as one general conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and pass counterfeit notes, and charged all the defendants under one count of the indictment. A review of the record, however, convinces us that the \u201cjury could not possibly have found, upon the evidence, that there was only one conspiracy.\u201d Kot-teakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 768, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1249, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). To the contrary, there were at least three separate conspiracies, and only Rutter and Jones were involved in a conspiracy to <em>manufacture, </em>possess and pass counterfeit notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">Except as to Jones, this presents not only problems of variance between indictment and proof and failure of proof, but also a problem of proper joinder under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [formerly \u00a7 557 of the Judicial Code, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 557]. In speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>of the relationship between the harmless error rule, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) [formerly \u00a7 269 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 391], and joinder, the Supreme Court has warned that \u201c\u00a7 269 carries the threat of overriding the <em>requirement </em>of \u00a7 557 for substituting <em>separate counts </em>in the place of separate indictments, unless the application of \u00a7 269 is made with restraint. The two sections must be construed and applied so as to bring them into substantial harmony, not into square conflict.\u201d Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. at 775, 66 S.Ct. at 253 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We believe that the \u201cthreat\u201d has become reality in this case. Thus, \u201cwhile it would have been entirely permissible to have tried all these persons and all these conspiracies together in one indictment in several counts * * *, it was [except as to Jones] reversible error to send them all to the jury under an indictment in one count charging one general conspiracy\u201d to manufacture, possess and utter the counterfeit notes. Brooks v. United States, 164 F.2d 142, 143 (5th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Appellant Nelson was also convicted of attempting to sell the counterfeit notes. On appeal he contends that he was entrapped into the commission of this offense by a federal agent. In a ease involving facts strikingly similar to those present here, we held that merely affording an opportunity to engage in crime to one predisposed to committing an offense is not entrapment. United States v. Head, 353 F.2d 566, 568 (6th Cir. 1965). No more than that was involved here. Appellant Nelson\u2019s other assertions of error are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The view we take of the joinder issue makes it unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error contained in appellants\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The convictions of Jones on the conspiracy charge and Nelson on the charge of attempting to sell counterfeit notes are affirmed. The convictions of Soles, Cooper and Nelson on the conspiracy charge are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. Anomalously, \u00a7 557 applied \u201cto joinder and consolidation of offenses against a single defendant, and to consolidation of offenses against multi-defendants\u201d but not to joinder of offenses against multidefendants. However, joinder of offenses against multi-defendants can have the same effect as consolidation, and therefore the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition is still appropriate. See J. Moore, Federal Practice H 8.02 [2] (2d ed. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
