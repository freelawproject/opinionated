App. \u00a7 462. We have examined the record in respect to the errors he has assigned on this appeal to the judgment of conviction. None of these points warrant disturbance of the decision of the District Court. The evidence amply warrants the finding of guilt and no error of law is perceived in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
