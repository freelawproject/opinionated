As it appears from the briefs, it is undisputed that following the order of the trial court requiring the production of the records, and the appearance of the appellant-appellee, Evelyn Grathwohl appeared and complied with the summons, produced the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and testified. There is just no relief that she can obtain by this appeal. The case is moot. In Lawhon v. United States, 5th Cir., 390 F.2d 663, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201cIt appearing without dispute that the books and records of the Lawhon corporations, which were the subject of the order to produce entered by the trial court in this case, have long since been produced and have subsequently been returned to the corporation, there is nothing on this appeal for this court to decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
