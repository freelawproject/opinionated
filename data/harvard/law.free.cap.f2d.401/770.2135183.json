There is no need to recount in detail the events leading up to the union\u2019s charge that the company failed to bargain with it in good faith. The nub of it is that after a strike, an election, and certification of the union as the bargaining representative of the company\u2019s employees, the union and the company met only once, in August 1966. On that occasion the union presented its demands. A few days later, the company by letter rejected the demands as unrealistic. Agreeing to them, it claimed, would increase its labor costs in a two-year period about eighty per cent, or almost $50,000. The union\u2019s reply asked for counter-proposals and a meeting to discuss the claimed cost figure. However, the company refused to meet unless the union submitted more \u201creasonable\u201d proposals. The union thereafter reduced its demands slightly, asking for another meeting and counteroffers. The company again declined to meet until it received \u201cpracticable and reasonable\u201d demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">The trial examiner pointed out that a bargaining stage may be reached at which a union\u2019s bad faith in making demands is so obvious that an employer may refuse to bargain until there is a more reasonable approach. However, he found that the evidence before him was not sufficient to relieve the company of the obligation to meet with the union face to face. The examiner concluded that the company had to put its conviction of the union\u2019s intransigence to the test of meeting with it again and that if the company\u2019s evaluation was correct, an impasse would result, relieving the company of any need to bargain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">The question of good or bad faith, on the part of the union or the company, is primarily a factual issue. While there is evidence here pointing both ways, there is sufficient in the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the company had \u201cthe duty to take at least one more step\u201d and meet with the union again.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">The Board\u2019s petition to enforce its order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
