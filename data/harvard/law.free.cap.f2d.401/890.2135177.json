We find no such deprivations in the record, however, for, in general, there was a rational basis for what trial counsel did and refrained from doing. His performance was far from the low level, which, in the constitutional sense, is the equivalent of a denial of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
