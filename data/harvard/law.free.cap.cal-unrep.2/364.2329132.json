Defendant denied plaintiff\u2019s right to the same, claiming ownership in himself. The Empire G. &amp; S. M. Co., being allowed to intervene, claimed possession and ownership in itself, which was denied by both plaintiff and defendant. On the trial, no counsel appearing for the intervener, the defendant\u2019s counsel, in behalf of the intervener, moved for a continuance, which, being refused, he moved for a dismissal of the complaint in intervention without prejudice. This was refused, and thereafter judgment was rendered for plaintiff and against defendant. The intervener now appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-10\">W. H. Hart and Atwell &amp; Bradley for appellant; Edwards &amp; Dubrutz for respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-11\">By the COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"A_A\">We cannot say the court below abused its discretion in refusing a continuance of the trial of the cause. Nor, under the circumstances appearing, can we hold as error the refusal of the court to permit the dismissal of the complaint in intervention. There was no judgment against the intervener for costs, as seems to be supposed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Judgment and orders affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
