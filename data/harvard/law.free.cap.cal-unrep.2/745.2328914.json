In 1883 she made a demand for the same, when defendant discovered that all of the ware except one piece <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>had been surreptitiously abstracted and taken from his possession, by some unknown person, without his knowledge or consent, and against his will. The goods had been purchased of defendant, who was a dealer in silverware and jewelry, and presented to the plaintiff, who requested that they might be placed in showcases in the store, and in which defendant did place them, and keep them for more than four years. Afterward they were removed from the showcases, and placed in the storeroom of the defendant, at his own instance, for the purpose of making room in the case for his own goods, and without the consent or knowledge of the plaintiff. The chief question was whether the defendant exercised the care required of him under the circumstances for the preservation of the goods. 'The court decided in favor of the defendant, and afterward, on motion of plaintiff, granted a new trial. And from this order defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-4\">S. F.

The action was instituted to recover from Vanderslice, the defendant, the value of some silverware left with him for safekeeping. Judgment was rendered for the defendant. The plaintiff then moved for a new trial, which was granted, and from the order made therein this appeal is prosecuted. We perceive no such abuse of the discretion vested in the trial court as would warrant a reversal of the order made in the premises, and in our opinion it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We concur: Belcher, C.
