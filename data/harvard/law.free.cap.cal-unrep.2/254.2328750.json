The admission of such evidence would not violate the rule which forbids the introduction of parol evidence to contradict or vary a written contract. If the notes were given to secure the execution by Stratton of a promise to support and take care of Tyson, and that promise was fulfilled, the notes were discharged, and parol evidence is admissible to prove that a written agreement has been totally discharged. There is nothing in this which tends to contradict or vary a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">It does not appear that an exception was taken to the ruling of the court on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike out the testimony of John Treat, and we cannot, in the absence of an exception, review said ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Judgment and order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
