The motion to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was made May 29, 1884, based upon an affidavit of defendant that he had been at all times within reach of process; that the plaintiff had been wanting in due diligence, and did not begin the action in good faith. The plaintiff in his affidavits showed that certain persons, representing themselves to be. an executive committee of certain property holders, who intended to resist the assessments, represented that it was the desire of all that an action of plaintiff against Kirkham, one of said committee, should be a test case, by the result of which they would all abide, and that, by reason of such representations, plaintiff forbore to serve the summons and prosecute said actions. Defendant, by his counter-affidavits, showed that the agreement among the property holders was simply to combine together to resist the collection of the tax, and pay the expenses of the litigation, both in the Kirkham case, and in any other cases that might arise, pro rata. The action was dismissed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b752-4\">Vrooman &amp; Davis, J. C. Martin and D. M. Delmas for appellant; B. McFadden and H. C.
