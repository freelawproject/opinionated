There is nothing in the case to take it out of the general rule that a tenant cannot dispute his landlord\u2019s title. The estoppel, as said in Tewksbury v. Magraff, 33 Cal. 244, \u201ccontinues, not to the end of the term merely, but to the end of the tenant\u2019s occupation; or, where there has, been a repudiation of the tenancy, and a subsequent adverse holding by the tenant, until the statute of limitations has run in his favor. He cannot set up an adverse title which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>he may have acquired. Before he can avail himself of such a title he must surrender the possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">It is not necessary to determine other questions discussed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Judgment and orders affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We concur: McKee, J. ; McKinstry, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
