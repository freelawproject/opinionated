Codes 1883, p. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The petitioner\u2019s alleged appointment was made prior to the first day of January, 1885, and before any provision of the act of March 14, 1883, \u201ccreating a county office\u201d in Alameda county, had taken effect. Petitioner, however, insists that the act of February 10, 1874, which abolished the office of county assessor of Alameda county and created township assessors therein, was repealed by section 4109, Political Code, which went into effect March 7, 1881. The later act does not expressly repeal the former; and, as we are unable to discover any repugnancy between the two, we cannot hold that there is a repeal by implication. As the right of the petitioner depends (1) on there being such an office as that which he claims to have been appointed to fill, at the date of his alleged appointment; and (2) on there being a vacancy in the office at that date\u2014it follows from the foregoing that his application for a writ to compel the respondent to draw his warrant on the treasury for the payment of his (petitioner\u2019s) salary as \u201ccounty assessor\u201d must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
