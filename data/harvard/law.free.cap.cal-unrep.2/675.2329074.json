D.), 134 N. W. 207, where the plaintiff had offered no proof of the signature of the administrator attached to the rejection of the claim, relying on the clerk\u2019s testimony that the claim was \u201ca record of the probate court.\u201d The court isays that since the statute does not require a rejected claim to be filed, it follows that a rejected claim is not, and cannot be, such a record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b677-8\">By the COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"A3u\">The answer raised an issue as to the presentation of the claim to the executor. The decision is sustained Toy the evidence. There was no proof of the signature of the executor to the rejection of the claim, and therefore no proof of presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
