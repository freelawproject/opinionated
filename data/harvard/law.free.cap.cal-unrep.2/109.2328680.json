Cullman by writing a false and defamatory letter concerning her, and causing it to be placed in an open place on her premises. The defamatory matter was an attempt to connect her with one Chona Somora, a notorious character of Salinas city, who had been convicted of maintaining a public nuisance. The information set forth at great length and in a rambling manner all the eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>stances, even the most remote,' supposed to bear upon the charge, and contained copies of the indictment against, and sentence, of Chona Somora.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-5\">Charles W. Quilty for appellant; A. L. Hart, attorney general, for respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-6\">By the COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"ASH\">The defendant was charged, by information, with the crime of libel. He filed a demurrer to the information, which was overruled, whereupon he entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Subsequently he withdrew that plea and entered a plea of \u201cguilty,\u201d after which judgment was pronounced against him. From the judgment he brings this appeal on the ground that the facts stated in the information are insufficient to constitute a public offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We have considered the information, and while it is true that it is in artificially drawn, and that the facts constituting the defense might, and ought to, have been more concisely stated, we are nevertheless of the opinion that it is good in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
