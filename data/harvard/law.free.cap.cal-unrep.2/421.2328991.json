T. More was competent for the purpose of showing that Sprague was implicated in said murder, and that the court erred in excluding it for that purpose. The evidence introduced, together with that offered and erroneously excluded, was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the issues submitted to the jury, and the court erred in granting a nonsuit. Judgment and order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
