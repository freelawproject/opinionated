The defendant testified that it was understood by both parties that the money was to be used in the business. If that was true, the subsequent refusal to pay did not make the original obtaining the money larceny. The testimony of Radcliff was the reverse of that of Wood. The defendant was entitled to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
