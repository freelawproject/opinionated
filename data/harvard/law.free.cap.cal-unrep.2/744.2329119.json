The wife of the plaintiff was called as a witness for the defendant, and gave testimony against the plaintiff without his consent. Her testimony was material\u2014\u2022 in fact, covered nearly all the matters included in the findings of the court. The ruling admitting the testimony over plaintiff\u2019s objection was duly excepted to. We think the evidence in regard to the proceedings in insolvency was incompetent, and the objection on that ground should have been sustained. It is plain that the findings would not support a judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Judgment and order reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
