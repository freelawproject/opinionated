The usual instructions defining the crime, etc., were given. The defense then requested the court to instruct the jury that if defendant did not intend or attempt to have carnal intercourse with the child, but simply placed himself in close proximity to her for the purpose of satisfying his depraved taste, the offense did not constitute an assault with intent to commit rape. The instruction was refused. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-9\">T. H.

The evidence, in our opinion, entitled the defendant to have that instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
