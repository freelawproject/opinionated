The defendant offered in evidence a deed from one Ramon Vejar to Louis Lamori, as tending to prove that Louis Lamori\u2019s estate, of which he was so seised in fee simple on the said thirty-first day of May, 1881, was by a title other than that which was expected to accrue from the Rowan executory contract; and that, although Louis Lamori at that time assigned to his wife all the estate or interest which might accrue from that contract, still the estate or interest which he had prior to that time by another title remained to him, notwithstanding his assignment of that contract to his wife on the said 31st of May; and that he died seised of that prior estate in fee on the following eighth day of June, as alleged in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b775-6\">The court found that on May 31, 1881, \u201cLouis Lamori, by deed of conveyance, duly conveyed all of said tract of land to the defendant Francisca Urquidez de Lamori who thereafter, and prior to the commencement of this action, by deed of conveyance, duly conveyed all of said tract of land to the plaintiff, John Grant.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b775-7\">H.

The demurrer to it was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">As we construe the deed of Louis Lamori, it conveys all his interest in the land to his wife. The contract with the trustees of the Lick estate is clearly referred to in the deed for the purpose of describing more definitely the premises conveyed, and it makes no difference what its legal effect might be. No one connected with this action claims anything under it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>objection to its introduction in evidence was properly overruled. The deed of Louis Lamori to Vejar, of a date subsequent to that made to Mrs. Lamori, was wholly immaterial, and the objection to its introduction in evidence was properly sustained.
