The code provides for a discharge of a writ of attachment, by order of the court on motion of the defendant, on the ground that the same was improperly or irregularly issued. But there is nothing to indicate an intention to preclude an attaching creditor from voluntarily releasing property attached, or that such a release would not be valid until it received the sanction of the court. And we know of no way in which the plaintiff could have made a release more effectual than by directing the sheriff to release the property described from the attachment. The cases which hold that the sheriff could not do this with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>out the order of the court, or the consent or direction of the plaintiff, have no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">Judgment and order reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We concur: McKinstry, J.; Thornton, J.; Morrison, C. J.; My rick, J.; McKee, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
