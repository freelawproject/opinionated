Barham for respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-10\">By the COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AUp\">Appellant urges that the court found, against the evidence, that the executor was to be charged with seventeen and three-quarters acres of land, \u201ca little more or less\u201d; that the court finds, and \u201cthere is no dispute,\u201d that Pagels bought the two-acre piece; that one acre was washed away without the fault of the executor; and that \u201cthere was no dispute\u201d but the railroad purchased four and one-half acres. But the court found that Pagels bought the one-acre tract, \u201ca little more or less,\u201d and the executor swore: \u201cI received one hundred and eighty dollars from Pagels for the one acre, sold by order of the court. \u2019 \u2019 Take from the twenty-three acres, of which deceased was seised at his death, the one acre sold to Pagels, the one acre washed away, and the four and one-quarter acres sold to the railroad company, and there would remain sixteen and three-quarters acres. The .specification of insufficiency of evidence in the statement, on motion for a new trial, is to the effect that the executor should not be charged with a greater quantity of land than sixteen and three-quarters acres; and the statement for new trial avers that there was evidence \u201cshowing\u201d that there was left \u201cin the hands of the executor\u201d sixteen and three-quarters acres. It would seem, therefore, that the court should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>found sixteen and three-quarters instead of seventeen and one-half acres as being all the land remaining in possession of the executor. But while the court found that of the twenty-acre tract one acre had been washed away and four and one-half acres had been sold to the railroad in 1874\u2014leaving of that tract fourteen and one-half acres\u2014it charged the executor with the rental value of seventeen and three-quarters acres of the twenty-acre tract from June, 1871, and also charged him with the value of the use of the two-aere tract for a portion of the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">There is no finding as to the one hundred and seventy dollars alleged to have been stolen from the executor, nor as to the item of about twenty-five dollars contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The interests of justice demand a new trial of the issue. Order reversed and new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
