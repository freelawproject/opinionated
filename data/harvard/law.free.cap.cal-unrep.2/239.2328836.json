But the court found that he offered to deliver a band of sheep, and he refused to allow plaintiffs to reject one hundred of these so offered. And there was evidence to sustain the finding. The witness Collom testified: \u201cThe defendant had a band of sheep there that he alleged to be two thousand in number, which he offered to deliver to us, but refused to allow us to reject one hundred of the number,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">We concur: McKee, 'J.; Ross, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
