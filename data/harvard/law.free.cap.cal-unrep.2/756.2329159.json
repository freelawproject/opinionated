We have given a very careful examination to the record, and to briefs of counsel, and the authorities cited, but we have not been able to perceive anything therein which militates against our opinion that, the evidence being conflicting, the findings should be upheld and the order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">We concur: Belcher, C.
