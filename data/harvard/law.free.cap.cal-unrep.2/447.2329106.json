Portions of the charge may be subject to criticism, and are not to be commended as models of clear and accurate statements of propositions.of law; but other portions explain these, so that the charge, as a whole, fairly presents the law bearing on the evidence which may be assumed to have been before the jury. The instructions, therefore, are not materially erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
