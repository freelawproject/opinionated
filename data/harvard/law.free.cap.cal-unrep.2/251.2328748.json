The court found that the defendants, through an authorized agent, had entered into such agreement, and had consented to dismiss their attachment and suit on condition that plaintiff also dismiss his suit against said debtor; that plaintiff performed the conditions on his part, but that defendants fraudulently refused to dismiss their attachment or join in an assignment until their claim had become a lien preferred under the statute. Defendants appealed from an order refusing to grant a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-9\">Roche &amp; Desbeck for appellants; W. E.
