Freer, Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b854-8\">W. R. Felter, one of the creditors of G. H. Longnecker, an insolvent debtor, filed in the superior court an opposition to the insolvent\u2019s discharge, which opposition was demurred to. Felter\u2019s attorney confessed the demurrer, and fifteen days were allowed in which to amend the opposition, but no amended opposition was filed within the time granted, and a default was entered, and the insolvent discharged. The motion to set aside the default was based upon an alleged verbal understanding between the parties as to the filing of the amended opposition.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b854-9\">Albert M.

The motion was based upon the inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, etc., of the appellant. The disposition of motions of this kind rests largely in the discretion of the nisi prius court; and in this ease we see no such abuse of discretion as would warrant us in disturbing the ruling of the court below. Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
