De Haley, respondent, commenced suit in the superior court of Los Angeles county against her husband, Salisbury Haley, appellant, for divorce. The bill was based upon a charge of \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment, in that he had accused her of having committed adultery. \u2019 \u2019 This suit, which is known and referred to in this statement as No. 3449, resulted October 7, 1884, in a decree in favor of the wife of absolute divorce. A motion was made by the husband, December 16, 1884, for a new trial, which was overruled, and an appeal was thereupon taken to the supreme court which, May 14, 1885, reversed the superior court, and granted a new trial: Haley v. Haley, 7 Pac. 3. The motion for the new trial in the superior court was supported, in part, by the affidavit of the husband set out below. On May 8, 1885, the husband filed a bill for divorce against the wife. The substance of this bill is also set out below. This bill was dismissed, on advice of counsel, May 13, 1885, pending the appeal in No. 3449. When the remittitur in that case reached the superior court, the husband filed a cross-complaint containing the substance of the bill filed by him May 8, 1885, and subsequently dismissed. A supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>mental complaint was filed by the wife, June 17, 1885, setting out the affidavit used by the husband on his motion for a new trial, and the bill filed by him, May 8, 1885, and alleging statements by him to various persons that his wife was pregnant by some one other than himself, and that she had had a child by some other than himself. This bill was demurred to, and the demurrer was sustained. The court (Brunson, J.) found January 14, 1886, as a matter of fact, among other things, \"that defendant, during said marriage and before plaintiff left his house never accused her of being pregnant by some or any man other than himself, or desiring to have sexual intercourse with some or any man other than himself; nor did he taunt or accuse her of committing adultery, or of desiring to commit adultery with some or any man other than himself.\u201d As to the cross-complaint of the husband, the court found, among other things, \"that at the time of said marriage, June 7, 1884, plaintiff was not actually or at all pregnant with child by the paternity of any individual.\u201d The complaint and cross-complaint were thereupon dismissed, and the divorce refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b765-5\">The wife then filed this bill, alleging in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b765-6\">\"Fourth.

Plaintiff further alleges that on or about the eighth day of May, 1885, defendant caused to be prepared and filed in this court a complaint in a certain action entitled \u2018 Salisbury Haley v. Presentaci\u00f3n Ballestero De Haley, \u2019 in which said complaint he charges plaintiff, to wit: \u2018 That heretofore, to wit, on the seventh day of June, 1884, the plaintiff and defendant were intermarried as husband and wife. Now plaintiff shows to the court and avers that the defendant, by his inducement of this plaintiff to enter into marriage with her, perpetrated a grievous fraud upon this plaintiff, and that the defendant did willfully deceive and cheat this plaintiff as to the defendant\u2019s capacity to fulfill the duties, obligations, and ordinary incidents of marriage, in this: That at the time of the intermarriage of plaintiff and defendant, on the seventh day of June, 1884, as aforesaid, fhis defendant was in fact, unknown and unsuspected by this plaintiff, actually pregnant with child by some person other than this plaintiff, and that this plaintiff was entirely ignorant of the fact of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>defendant\u2019s pregnancy at the time of the intermarriage of plaintiff and defendant as aforesaid. And plaintiff avers that such pregnancy of this defendant was not by this plaintiff, and plaintiff avers that he never had sexual intercourse with defendant prior to the marriage of plaintiff and defendant on the seventh day of June, 1884, as aforesaid.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-5\">11 Sixth. That each and every of said allegations and statements were false, unfounded, and malicious, and were made by the said defendant for the sole purpose of grieving the said plaintiff, and that, before the commencement of this action, the same were made known to this plaintiff, and that thereby she was subjected to great shame, and to grievous mental anguish and suffering, and was made sick, and her life rendered miserable and wretched. Wherefore plaintiff prays judgment. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-6\">There was a demurrer to the complaint, which was overruled. The husband then filed a cross-complaint, alleging desertion. On May 3, 1886, the court passed a decree dissolving the marriage, allowing the wife to resume her maiden name, and awarding her fifteen hundred dollars and costs. The decree was based on the following findings of facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-7\">\u201c(1) That all the allegations of the complaint herein are true, and that the articles set forth in said complaint as cause of action are complete, are not misleading, nor are they mutilated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-8\">\u201c (2) The judgment made and entered in the action of P.

De Haley, the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, for and on account of her interest therein; that subsequent to said decree, and while the same was in full force, the said S.

She alleged and proved that, in a former action for divorce instituted by him against her, he had, in his pleading and affidavits filed in the cause, charged her falsely and maliciously, and for the purpose of grieving her, with having been pregnant at the time of their marriage by a man other than himself, and that she had concealed her condition from him, and by such concealment induced him to marry her. The averments of the complaint were found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We think that such a charge tends to cause \u201cgrievous mental suffering, \u2019 \u2019 and comes within the rule laid down in Powelson v. Powelson, 22 Cal. 358. The plaintiff testified that it did in fact cause her grievous mental suffering. It is contended, however, that, inasmuch as no other witness gave evidence as to what her feelings were, her testimony on' this point is uncorroborated. But the court finds that the charges were false, and there is nothing in the record to negative the fact that Mrs. Haley was a pure and virtuous woman. This being the case, we think the presumption is that the charge had its natural and usual consequence, and that it is no more necessary to prove that it induces suffering than to prove that bodily injury is followed by pain. The court was entirely justified in its finding on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The judgment made and entered in a former action between these same parties was not such an adjudication of the matters set up by the cross-complaint in the present action as would bar the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery; for, although Mr. Haley\u2019s charges against his wife of a want of chastity, etc., had been previously passed upon by the trial court in the former action, yet that court found adversely to him on the point, and repudiated the charge as being untrue. Therefore it would be a violation of Mrs. Haley\u2019s legal right to say that because her husband had in that first action made groundless and cruel charges against her, on which the court had fixed the seal of disbelief, that she, in this action, may not, by her complaint, make such charges so made the proper basis of present judicial inquiry, with a view to determine whether such conduct on his part did or not entitle her to seek for and obtain a divorce from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>We perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s assigning to her the judgment for fifteen hundred dollars, which her husband had formerly obtained against her; for to enforce that judgment would have been inequitable, since the money, which was the basis of the action wherein that judgment was recovered, had been voluntarily given to her by him on the settlement of a former suit, and he had no just right to recover it back.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Upon the whole record, we observe no prejudicial error, and the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We concur: Belcher, C. C.; Hayne, C.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">By the COURT.\u2014For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
