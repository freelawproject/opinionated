The defense was that the notes and mortgage did not correctly set forth the terms of the agreement made between plaintiff and defendant respecting the loan, and the terms of the agreement were that plaintiff would loan defendant two hundred and fifty dollars for five or six years, and defendant should pay interest therefor at four per cent per annum; that defendant, being wholly inexperienced in business, had never previously executed any promissory note or mortgage, and had no one to advise her except plaintiff; that she was short-sighted, and unable to read without the aid of her eye-glasses, and, having left them at home, did not read over the notes and mortgage before signing them; that, in preparation of the notes and mortgage, she relied entirely, on the plaintiff, and believed that they had been prepared in accordance with, and expressing therein the terms of, her previous agreement with plaintiff for the loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-5\">On the hearing judgment was given that plaintiff was entitled, on her said loan of two hundred dollars, to the total sum of seven hundred and forty-four dollars and thirty-one cents, and foreclosure sale was ordered, and, in case of the property proving insufficient, a judgment should be docketed for the balance against defendant, and execution issued thereon. The defendant appeals. Apparently there was an exception taken by defendant to the allowance of interest upon compound interest, which the appellate court overruled.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-6\">R.
