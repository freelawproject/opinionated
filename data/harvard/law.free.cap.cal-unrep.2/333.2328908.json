Defendant in the answer denied the validity of a portion of the claims, and set up the fact the plaintiff had already recovered one judgment against the defendant for a portion of such claims and that the action on the rest of such claims is therefore barred. .</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-9\">Archibald Yell for appellant; Thomas B.

In our opinion, the former judgment, which it is claimed constitutes a bar to this action, cannot be held to have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">We think each claim presented to and rejected by the board of supervisors constituted a distinct and separate cause of action, and that a judgment obtained on one would constitute no bar to an action for the recovery of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
