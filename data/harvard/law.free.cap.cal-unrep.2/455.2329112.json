Swineford the plaintiff recovered a judgment for the sum demanded in his complaint. The allegation must be deemed to be denied by the plaintiff in this action; and it is assigned as error that the finding is not justified by the evidence. We are unable to find any evidence of the recovery of a judgment by the plaintiff in the action of Brooks v. Swineford. The finding is upon a material issue, and as there is no evidence to sustain it, there must be a new trial. No other material error is specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Judgment and order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
