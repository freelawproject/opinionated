And as it does not appear by any allegations in the petition that either the superior court or the justice\u2019s court exceeded its jurisdiction in any part of the proceedings in the case, the application for a writ of review must be denied. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">We concur: Morrison, C. J.; Myrick, J.; McKinstry, J.; Ross, J.; Thornton, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
