Plaintiff alleged a lease by him to defendant, which lease had expired, and that since the expiration of the lease defendant refused, though duly notified, to deliver possession of the premises to plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-12\">F.

No such lease as that set forth in the complaint is found by the court; but, on the contrary, a contract for a lease is found essentially different from the terms of the lease which is declared on, and is the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There was also error in the ruling of the court found in the fourth bill of exceptions. The plaintiff testified that he was not in the city of Santa Cruz on the twenty-third day of January, 1879. This was material evidence in the case, and it was competent for the defendant to contradict him on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">For these errors the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
