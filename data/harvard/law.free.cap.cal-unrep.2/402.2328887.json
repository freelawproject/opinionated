Upon him it was not served; but the court, as to the parties upon whom it was served, settled and allowed the same, certified to its correctness, and upon it, as certified, the motion for a new trial was submitted and denied. It may be that the court denied the motion because the proposed statement had not been served upon all the parties. If that were so, or if it were not so, it is not cause for a dismissal of the appeal. An appeal is dismissible for some irregularities in taking it, or for failure to prosecute it, or for want of appearance, or for consent of parties; but where it has been perfected according to law, and the appellant appears, he is entitled to be heard upon any question or fact involved in the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We concur: Ross, J.; McKinstry, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
