Defendant failed to answer, and was defaulted. One Silvester intervened, claiming the wood against both plaintiff and defendant, and denying that plaintiff was the owner of the premises, or that he had any interest therein other than as a mortgagor for the sum of two hundred dollars, and also that the wood cut and carried away had been so cut and taken by persons who were in possession of the premises under a claim of title adverse to the plaintiff. Evidence was introduced on these matters, and the court held in accordance with the allegations made in intervener\u2019s pleading, and rendered judgment against plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to justify the findings and decision, and because of error at the trial in not compelling the intervener to open the case; but, instead, holding that the burden of proof was on plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-8\">J.

Under such circumstances, the alleged errors as to other matters are immaterial. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
