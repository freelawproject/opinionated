This being the case, no such fact is before us for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>If any such, matter appeared in evidence, we must hold, as the case is presented to us, that it was negatived by the court below. Under these circumstances we are of opinion the contention of the appellant cannot be maintained, and we cannot say that the court below was wrong in holding that plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We concur: Myrick, J.; Sharpstein, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
