From this judgment plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">As we understand the agreement set forth in the complaint it was agreed by Frederick G. Smyth that Joseph L.

The complaint alleges that \u201call claims against, debts owing and payable by, and costs and expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of every kind and character in any manner incurred in and about, the said estate of Peter S. McNeil, deceased, and in the administration thereof, were fully paid and discharged by the said administrator of said estate, out of the moneys alone belonging to said estate, and in the hands of said administrator, who thereupon filed his final account, \u2019 \u2019 etc. Further, that all the stipulations covenanted and agreed to be performed by Joseph L. Reed and Catherine C., his wife, in the agreement between them and Smyth were by them fully and completely performed. The complaint also avers that four hundred and twenty-five dollars, paid in conformity to said agreement, was less than one-third of a balance of the sum received by Smyth from the special administrator, Mayer. The complaint also shows that defendant had notice of. the agreement above referred to when he took his deed from Smyth. The subsequent deed from Joseph L. Reed to plaintiff transferred the equity of the former and gave the latter the right to demand a conveyance from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with direction to the court below to overrule the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
