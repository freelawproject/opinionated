It is not enough for him to prove that he has suffered loss by some event which happened, or by the act or omissions of the party charged; he must also prove that the party charged with negligence violated a duty resting upon him. He must prove facts from which it can be fairly inferred that the party\u2019s negligence caused the injury complained of. He is not bound to prove more than enough to raise a fair presumption of negligence on the part of the party charged, and resulting in injury to himself. Having done this he is entitled to recover, unless the party produced evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The instructions quoted are in,direct conflict upon an important question in the case, for which reason the judgment and order must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. In the one, the jury was told that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to account for the loss of the sheep; in the other, that the burden was upon the defendant to show that the loss occurred through the negligence of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">We concur: McKinstry, J.; McKee, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
