Petitioner then alleged that the facts as stated, that a speedy trial could not be had in Judge Cheney\u2019s court, are untrue, and the petitioner asked for a writ of prohibition to restrain Judge Williams from so holding court, or trying such cause.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b673-10\">Glassell, Smith &amp; Patton for petitioner; Stephen M. White for respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b673-11\">By the COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AiL\">We are of opinion that, from the facts stated in the petition, the petitioner is not entitled to a writ of prohibition. The request of the governor, as set forth in the petition, was sufficient authority for Judge Williams to hold a superior court in the county of Los Angeles. It is therefore unnecessary to consider any, issue raised by the answer of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">The application for a writ of prohibition is denied, and the alternative writ heretofore issued is annulled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
