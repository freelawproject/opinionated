That petition as filed has annexed thereto, and made a part thereof, as an exhibit, a writing containing the evidence, rulings, and exceptions taken on the hearing of the application for letters of guardianship of the minors in the court below. In the former opinion of this court the first petition was adjudged insufficient for the reason that it did not \u201cset forth the exceptions taken, and the evidence in support thereof, \u2019 \u2019 in the court below: 68 Cal. 413, 9 Pac. 456. The petition now under consideration appears to contain all that which this court has declared requisite, and due notice of the application has been given to the trial judge. Hence the demurrer herein filed should be overruled and the respondents given leave to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">We concur: Searls, C.; Belcher, C.
