Polack, 58 Cal. 553, United States v. Chapman, 5 Saw. 528, Fed. Cas. No. 14,785, and Polack v. Gurnee, No. 8229, 66 Cal. 266, 5 Pac. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We do not find any denial of the averment of the cross-complaint to the effect that the Geyser springs and hotel improvements are located on the N. E. % of section 13. It was therefore an admitted fact in the case, and being so, there was no impropriety in adding to the description of the property in the judgment the words \u201cthe same being known as the \u2018Geyser Hotel property.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We concur: McKee, J.; McKinstry, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
