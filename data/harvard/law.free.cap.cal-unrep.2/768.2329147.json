There is no evidence that at the time of the conveyance the property conveyed had a market value in excess of the amount paid by Busch. The evidence shows that, at the time of the location of the Young America claim, Deidesheimer\u2019s name was inserted in the notice of location by Busch as an act of friendship; and that as soon as Deidesheimer made an examination of the ground he declared his intention not to abide by the location, and offered to and did execute to Busch a deed of the property; and that not until some months after the delivery of the deed did the claim have any apparent or market value. We find no evidence of any fraud on the part of either of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>defendants; on the contrary, the facts displayed by the evidence show that their transactions were in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
