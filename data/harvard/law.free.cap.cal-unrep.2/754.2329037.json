The board adopted the plan of the plaintiff for a county jail, with certain provisos, among which was that the plans should not be considered adopted unless the board accepted a bid from a reliable party to the effect that such party would construct the buildings proposed for a sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars. After this order was entered the defendant submitted certain drawings, and the clerk was directed to give notice to all persons who desired to bid upon a jail building to be erected in accordance with plaintiff\u2019s plans and specifications. In this notice the hoard reserved the right to reject any and all bids. The notice was published, and the plaintiff claims that bids were made by reliable parties within the required figures. Before any plans or specifications were finally adopted, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>made an order rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s plans, on the ground that he had been party to certain improper acts in getting his plans conditionally accepted, and refused to open any of the bids received, based upon said plans.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b757-4\">Williams &amp; McKinley for appellant; Geo.

The plaintiff had no claim against the defendant, the county of Los Angeles, according to his own pleading, save and except one based upon the condition that the board of supervisors of that county should accept the bid of some \u201creliable party\u201d for the building of a jail. They refused, in the exercise of a proper discretion, as the complaint shows, to open or accept any of the bids tendered, on the ground that the plaintiff had been a party to certain improper acts in getting his plans conditionally accepted. Thus the condition upon which alone he had, or could have had, any claim for compensation for his alleged services never happened, not because of any fault of the board of supervisors, but for the reason that they, in the exercise of a rightful discretion, refused to entertain or accept bids which they believed were based upon plans tainted with fraud, with which the plaintiff appeared to them to be in collusion. As guardians of the best interests of their county, they could not have properly acted otherwise, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We concur: Belcher, C.
