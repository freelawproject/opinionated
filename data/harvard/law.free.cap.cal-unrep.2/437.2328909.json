The undertakings on appeal were filed more than a month before the notices of appeal were filed. This, in our view, is not the undertaking required by law. It is not the case of insufficiency in the undertaking, but it is no undertaking at all. The motions to dismiss must be granted; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
