The accusation was made in due form, and, being wholly denied, a reference was made under section 298 to William Craig, Esq. Mr. Craig has. filed his report, accompanied by the evidence taken by him in support of the accusation, as well as that produced by the defense. We have examined the evidence in the case, and do not find it sufficient to justify a removal or suspension of Mr. Lowenthal, and the charges are therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
