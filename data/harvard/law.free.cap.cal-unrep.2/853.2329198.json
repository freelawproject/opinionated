The superior court had jurisdiction to hear and determine this question, and, it would appear, did determine it adversely to the petitioner. If wrong in so doing, it is but error, and petitioner\u2019s remedy, if any, is by appeal. The application is denied, and petitioner remanded to the custody of the sheriff of the city and county of San Francisco.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
