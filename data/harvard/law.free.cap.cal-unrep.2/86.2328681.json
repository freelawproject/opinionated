That such be the effect of a possession, however, it must \"appear that the possession is open, visible, exclusive and unambiguous: 3 Washburn on Real Property, 284. Open and notorious possession is sufficient to put a purchaser on inquiry: Lestrade v. Barth, 19 Cal. 660, 676; Fair v. Stevenot, 29 Cal. 490. The sixth finding of the court below is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">\u201cThat the defendant Arpin had resided on the land in controversy several years prior to his deed to Levy, and has continued to reside thereon ever since, having a house on said land, and having cultivated the same every year, but not having the same inclosed; that he is an unmarried man, living alone, and frequently goes to the city of Los Angeles; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and it did not appear whether he was actually on the land at the time the mortgage was executed, or whether he was temporarily absent therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">We are not authorized to say that a finding of these facts necessarily determines the defendant\u2019s open and notorious possession, or conclusively determines that plaintiff was put upon inquiry, as against the positive finding (No. 7) that plaintiff, when he took and recorded his mortgage, had no notice of the claim of defendant Arpin. 1 Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We concur: McKee, J.; Morrison, C. J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
