The provisions of such trust were that the trustee should conduct certain litigation regarding the trust property, and when the same was settled sell the property and make certain dispositions of the proceeds. The lower court decreed that the trustee should hold the land till the litigation \u201cbe terminated as to the whole or any part of the premises, or when the litigation concerning the premises or any part thereof shall have been otherwise finally ended,\u201d the trustee might proceed to sell the same under the directions of the trust. The other facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-11\">Wm. L. Gill for appellant; C. D.

As to the compensation to which the court found plaintiff entitled, and decreed that he should be paid out of the proceeds of said sale, we are not prepared to say that the amount is unreasonable. The deed contained the agreement that Reynolds should hold the land until the litigation be finally ended; the decree authorizes a sale when the litigation be finally disposed of as to the whole or any part of said premises. The decree should be modified by striking out the words \u201cor any part\u201d and \u201cor any part thereof.\u201d The court below is directed to modify the decree in this particular, and in all other respects the\" judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
