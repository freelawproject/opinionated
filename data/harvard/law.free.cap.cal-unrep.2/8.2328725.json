But the court erred in giving to the jury the first instruction. The statute recited in that instruction has reference to the management of a train of cars in motion and approaching a street crossing, and provides that unless the required signal of its approach be sounded, as therein provided, the company shall be liable for all damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-11\">But the statute has no applicability to the management of cars in making up freight trains and loading them between street crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-12\">The failure to ring the bell or give the required signal under such circumstances is not, as in the other case, made negligence per se; but the question of negligence is to be determined by the application of general principles of law to the facts of the case. The instruction given had a tendency to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>mislead the jury in this respect, and we think that for this reason a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-4\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-5\">Rhodes, J., expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
