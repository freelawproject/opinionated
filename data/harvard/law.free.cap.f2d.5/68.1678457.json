The appeal was taken by one of the sureties, who complains of the judgment on the sole ground that there was no valid service of the citation to him in the proceeding. The appellant, without raising any question as to the service of process upon him, appeared in the cause and excepted to the libel therein on the ground that it sets forth no cause of action. By appearing and invoking the court\u2019s decision as to the merits of the claim asserted in the libel, the appellant waived any defect in the service of process upon him.
