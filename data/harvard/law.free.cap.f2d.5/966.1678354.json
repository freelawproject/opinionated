The question involved in this case is whether, when the order appealed from was made, a United States Circuit Judge had power<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and jurisdiction to grant a writ of habeas corpus and thereon to discharge a prisoner confined under sentence imposed in the District Court. He so did and the United States took this appeal. A motion is now made by the prisoner to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that no statute grants an appeal to this court from an order so made by a Circuit Judge. Neither the efforts of counsel nor our own have found such a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-33\">The appeal is therefore dismissed, and, being without jurisdiction to consider the question involved in this appeal, we express no opinion upon it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-34\"> Such power has since been expressly conferred by Act Feb. 13, 1925, \u00a7 6 (a) 43 Stat. 940, c. 229.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
