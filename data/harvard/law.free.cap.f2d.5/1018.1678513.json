We agree with the court\u2019s finding of fact that there was such an agreement and that it was legally enforceable. The second question is as to the construction and effect to be given such agreement. We agree with the court\u2019s holding in that regard. As no principles of law or matters of concern beyond this particular agreement are here involved, and as the entire matter has been fully and satisfactorily discussed in the lower court\u2019s opinion (2 F.[2d] 280), we now restrict ourselves to stating the decree below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
