No subpoena was issued. The defendant did not file an answer. A receiver having been, prior to the filing of the petition, appointed by, the state court, the receiver tendered an answer, but was denied. Thereupon two creditors appeared specially for the purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court over the alleged bankrupt and creditors, upon the ground that no subpoena had been issued or served. It is contended by the petitioners that the show .cause order is in effect a subpoena, and that the creditors, not having appeared within five days after the return day, may not now challenge the jurisdiction of the court over the bankrupt..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b776-12\">Lundin &amp; Bario and Louis E.

St. \u00a7 9602), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-17\">\u2019 \u201cUpon the filing of a petition * * * service thereof, with a writ of subpoena, shall be made * * * in the same manner * * * now had upon the commencement of a suit in equity in the courts of the United States. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-20\">\u201cAny creditor, may appear and plead * * * within five days after the return day. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">Equity rule 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-24\">\u201cWhenever a pleading is filed '* * * the clerk shall issue the process of subpoena * * * which shall contain the names of the parties and be returnable into the clerk\u2019s office. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-28\">It shall contain a memorandum that the \u201canswer or defense\u201d must be filed in the clerk\u2019s office within the time stated, or \u201cthe bill may be taken pro confesso.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-29\">The order contains the names of the parties, is issued by the clerk under the seal of the court, and requires the bankrupt to show cause why the prayer of the petitioner should not be granted, .a copy of which is served therewith, but no writ of subpoena is served \u25a0 or in fact issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-30\">A subpoena in chancery brings the party into court. Com. Bank of Rodney v. State, 4 Smedes &amp; M. (12 Miss.) 439. It is for the purpose of compelling the presence of a party in court. Dishaw v. Wadleigh, 15 App. Div. 205, 44 N. Y. S. 207. The etymology of \u201csubpoena\u201d signifies penalty for disobedience. Burns v. Superior Court, San Francisco, 140 Cal. 1, 73 P. 597. A subpoena is a writ or order, directed to a person, requiring his attendance at a particular time and place to give testimony.' Jones on Evidence, \u00a7 797. It is used for the same purpose as a citation in the courts of civil and canon law to compel the appearance of the defendant. Bouvier, 3165. The purpose of a subpoena is to- place a party under the order and censure of the court. 1 Thompson on Trials, \u00a7 160; 1 Greenl. on Evidence, \u00a7 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-31\">The order to show cause contains some essentials of a subpoena. It does not show, however, that it is a command of the United States. The Subpoena runs from the \u201cUnited States\u201d to the party, commanding him to answer within the given time, under the pains and penalties which may befall. The order is only a direction of the clerk under the seal of the court. No penalty .for nonappearance is provided and none can be invoked. A creditor, consulting the record, would justly assume that, no subpoena having issued, none was served, and that the eourt did not have jurisdiction of the alleged bankrupt. The voluntary appearance of the bankrupt and default for answer did not obviate the necessity of subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-32\">The motion on special appearance is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
