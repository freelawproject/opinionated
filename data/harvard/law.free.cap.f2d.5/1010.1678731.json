The Examiner disallowed all the claims then in the application. The Examiners in Chief, after considering the references, said: \u201cThe only thing which is not disclosed in the references is the idea of making the cap and the detachable element of the pothead interchangeable between the fixed element of the pothead and the dummy. If there is any invention in this, it is small; but we are disposed to give appellant the benefit of the doubt, in the absence of any reference.\u201d They therefore allowed one claim and disallowed the others. On appeal the Assistant Commissioner affirmed the Board, \u201cfor the reasons set out in the decisions below.\u201d Eor the same reasons, we affirm the decision of the Assistant Commissioner. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
