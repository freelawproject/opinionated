DUKE.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b849-15\">(District Court, W. D. Washington, N. D.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b849-16\">May 22, 1925.)</decisiondate>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b849-17\">No. 8353.</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b849-22\">The National Surety Company, on January 24, 1924, before United States Commissioner Bowman, made bond for George Duke to \u201cappear before the District Court of the United States * * * on the day of the -term to be begun and held at the city of Seattle, Washington, in said district, on the 1st day of February, 1924, and from time to time thereafter to which the cause may be continued, and then and there answer the charge of having on or about the 23d day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>January, A. D. 1924, within said district, in violation of * * * the National Prohibition Act, * * * unlawfully * * * possess and sell intoxicating liquor, and then and there abide the judgment of said court. * * * <em>})</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b850-6\">On the 5th of March, 1924, the United States attorney filed an information charging Duke with violating the National Prohibition Act by possessing and selling intoxicating liquor and maintaining a common nuisance. A bench warrant was issued, but the defendant was not apprehended. Thereafter on the 12th day of May, 1924, the defendant was called to answer to such information, and failing to appear, the bond was declared forfeited. The surety company seeks to have the forfeiture set aside because no term of court began on the 1st day of February, and that if the bond is not void, the defendant not being called to answer to the information during the November term, in which the bond was given, and that forfeiture not having been entered, if the bond be valid during the November term the surety was not required to produce the defendant at the next, or May, term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b850-7\">Robert H. Evans, and Walter Metzen-baum, both of Seattle, Wash., for National Surety Co., petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b850-8\">Thos. P. Revelle, U. S. Atty., of Seattle, Wash.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b850-9\">NETERER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"afq-dedup-0\">(after stating the facts as above). The surety company relies on Joelson v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 287 F. 106, and U. S. v. Mace (C. C. A.) 281 F. 635. I think neither of these eases are decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">In the Joelson Case there was no particular time and no particular place when and where the defendant was to appear, and the court said, at page 109:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-11\">\u201cUnder the terms of the contract, Rosen was under no obligations whatever to appear at any time or place before the court. This omission of the condition was a fatal defect, and the recognizance was a nullity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">In this case, the court, the place, and the time were designated and fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">Nor does the case of U. S. v. Mace, supra, help the situation. In the Mace Cas\u00e9 Circuit Judge Kenyon for the court said that it is uniformly held under federal statutes that United States commissioners have such powers as to procedure that may be conferred by the state statutes on examining magistrates of the state. See section 1014, R. S.; Comp. Stat. \u00a7 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">The Supreme Court, in U. S. v. Ewing, 140 U. S. 142, 11 S. Ct. 743, 35 L. Ed. 388, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-15\">\u201cIt is proper,\u201d under section 1014, supra, \u201cto look at the law of the state in which the services in such ease are rendered, to determine what is necessary and proper to be done.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Justice Brewer, in U. S. v. Patterson, 150 U. S. 67, 14 S. Ct. 21, 37 L. Ed. 999, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amt-dedup-0\">\u201cIt was held in the case of U. S. v. Ewing, 140 U. S. 142, that, in view of section 1014 of the Revised Statutes, the law of the state in which the services are rendered must be looked at, in order to determine what is necessary in the matter of procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">Section 1957, Rem. Comp. Stat. of Washington, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-18\">\u201cThe recognizance shall be conditioned in effect that the defendant will appear * * * to answer said charge whenever the same shall be prosecuted, and at all times until \u201cdischarged according to law, render himself amenable to ,the orders and process of the Superior Court, and if convicted, render himself in execution of the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atl-dedup-0\">The recognizance in this case is a contract between the government and the surety to produce the defendant, not at any term of the court, \u201cbut at all rimes until discharged according to law.\u201d The bond in effect so recites, and the statute enters into and becomes a part of the contract. The statute of Washington differs from the Nebraska statute under which the Mace, supra, recognizance was taken, in this: That the Nebraska statute provides, \u201cThat the accused appear forthwith before the District Court, if then in session, and if not in session, then on the first day of the. next jury term thereof\u201d (Comp. St. Neb. 1922, \u00a7 9981), and the court said at page 639:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-20\">\u201cIt will be noted in this bond that the time is not fixed as of the next term. But the language is used, \u2018on the first day of the 'term, to be begun and held on the 29th day of July, 1918/ \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">The court further said on the same page:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"add-dedup-1\">\u201cThe bond here under consideration called for the appearance of Chenoweth at the April term, 1918, of the United States- District Court, being the term in session at the time the bond was taken. * * * Forfeiture was entered at the September term. At that time the bond had no vitality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-22\">The Nebraska' statute required the accused to appear at a stated term, while the-Washington statute required the accused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>appear \u201cat all times until discharged according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The surety failed to produce the defendant, and must be held to the contract obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
