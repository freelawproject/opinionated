The first contract was made June 29, 1922, and provided for the purchase and sale of 300 cars (approximately 15,000 tons) of Elkhorn mine run coal at $3.30 per ton, to be delivered at the rate of 100 cars per month during June, July, and August. The other contract, made July 8, 1922, called for 150 cars (approximately 7,-500 tons) of Williamson coal at the same price, deliveries during substantially the same period, and to be completed October 5, 1922. Each contract provided for deposit by the buyer of $1 per ton, viz. $15,000 under the first contract and $7,500 under the \u201csecond, to be applied at the rate of,$l per ton of coal as delivered \u2014 the remaining $2.30 per ton to be paid thereafter. The deposits were duly made. There were delivered during the contract period 96 cars under the first contract and 54 cars under the second contract. Later 45 cars were delivered under the first contract and 8 under the second. Plaintiffs, who sue as assignees of the United Coal Mines, Inc., claim that these later deliveries, aggregating 53 ears, were made to apply, at $3.30 per ton) \u2022 upon plaintiffs\u2019 damages, reducing the net amount claimed to practically $48,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">Defendant denies liability for delays in delivery on the grounds, first, that the failures to deliver were caused by mining strikes and other contingencies not under their control and claimed to be covered by the contracts of purchase and sale;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, second, that nondelivery was justified by the failure of the United Coal Mines, Inc., to keep its deposits good, in that the last-named company, from time to time during the contract period, incurred indebtedness to defendant in the net amount of about $18,000 by way of trade accommodation acceptances. Defendant not only denied all liability to plaintiff, but sought recovery for the $18,000 plus, including interest, together with the unpaid balance on coal actually delivered, amounting in all to upwards of $28,000. It is conceded that defendant was entitled to that amount, if plaintiffs had no claim for damages for failure to make delivery. The verdict and judgment denied recovery by plaintiff, and awarded defendant its claim as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\"> 1. Plaintiffs\u2019 main complaint is that the court\u2019s charge permitted the jury to find against plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the ground that damages for a breach of the contract had been waived by plaintiffs by proceeding with the contract as if the breach had not occurred. The court, in summing up, said: \u201cIf a party does not rest upon an alleged breach by the other party, but continues the performance of the contract, and both sides go on as if there had been no such breach, such breach cannot be made the predicate of either recovery or defense, because, having been waived, it is as if it had never happened.\u201d This instruction was given in response to a request by the jury that previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ous instructions \"relative to waiver or violation of contract as to subsequent right of action for damages on said contract\u201d be again given. The speedy rendition of verdict following the instruction makes it fairly inferable that it was based upon the theory of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Passing the question whether the defense of wajver was precluded by failure to plead it, as well as the question whether plaintiffs' exception was broad enough to challenge the definition applied by the court, the correctness of which plaintiffs deny,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we think plaintiffs entitled to complain that the broad subject of plaintiffs\u2019 complete waiver of damages was submitted at all to the jury. We find nothing in the record which we think fairly suggests that the subject of waiver of plaintiffs\u2019 damages was raised by defendant on the trial; and a careful examination of the record fails, we think, to indicate any substantial evidence tending to show that the plaintiffs waived claim for damages for breach of the contract of sale as distinguished from waiver of the right to treat the breach as terminating the contract. On the contrary, the United Coal Mines, on August 23, 1922, in writing, notified defendant that \u201cwe propose to hold you responsible for the shortage, and to charge you back with the difference between our contract price and the ruling market price.\u201d Again, one of the plaintiffs testified that on October 10, 1922, at a meeting between him and representatives of the defendant and the Williamson Pond Creek Coal Company, for the purpose of trying to settle plaintiffs\u2019 damage claim against defendant for diversion of coal, and the latter\u2019s claim against the Williamson Company, arising out of the contracts, he notified defendant that plaintiffs proposed to hold it for whatever claims plaintiffs had, which seem to have covered not only coal diverted, but generally that not shipped under the contract, and that defendant\u2019s representative stated that defendant would get all the coal that the Williamson Company would ship defendant, turning it over to plaintiff, payment therefor to apply against plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages, \u201cto be deducted upon an amicable settlement which we were trying to arrive at.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u25a0 The witness also testified that on October 17, 1922 (the Williamson Company failing to appear), he again went over plaintiffs\u2019 account with the defendant, which was checked over by defendant\u2019s representative, and that the claim sued upon, viz. about $58,000, was the same as the statement cheeked and verified in that conference with defendant\u2019s representative. While that representative denied that any agreement was made that plaintiffs were damaged, and that coal was to be shipped on account thereof, we find nothing fairly indicating any suggestion of waiver of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. On the contrary, defendant\u2019s representative admits that, after a conversation with one of the plaintiffs, inferably after one of the alleged October interviews, he made claim against the Williamson Company that the market values were much in excess of the $3.30 per ton, and began suit against that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We are constrained to think that, upon this record, the 53 cars delivered to plaintiffs after October 10th<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> can be treated only as having been supplied and received by way of actual performance, pro tanto, of the contract here involved, and, in the absence of anything to the contrary, should be considered as allocable to the July shortage,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that their acceptance does not tend to show waiver of any damages for nondelivery of other ears, or to show that any new contract was made after October 7th for the later delivery of all the cars in default, especially as each party seems to have understood that the full shortage could not be made up; and in the absence of agreement for making up either the full shortage or any definite part thereof, there could have been no effective waiver of damages, except as to the number of cars actually so delivered. The instant case is thus not brought within Kalamazoo Fuel Co. v. Gerber, 4 F.(2d) 235, decided by this court December 8, 1924. These conclusions require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">2. Plaintiffs complain that verdict was not directed in their favor. We think there was sufficient evidence to justify submitting to the jury the defenses other than waiver, to which reference has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>3. After issue was joined, plaintiffs\u2019 receiver was substituted as party plaintiff. Error is alleged upon the rendition of verdict and judgment against plaintiffs personally under defendant\u2019s cross-petition. Without intimating whether or not we regard this complaint as substantial, we think we are not called upon now to consider it. It may never arise upon a new trial. It is even conceivable that defendant may seek to offset its claim against plaintiffs as against a'\u2019 possible judgment against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">For the error in submitting the question of plaintiffs\u2019 waiver, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-19\"> Defendant asserts in this connection that at the time of making the first contract, by telephone, it advised plaintiff that, on account of the small margin (10 cents per ton) on which it handled the coal, it was not to be held for any liability if the mines from which defendant was to get the coal failed to deliver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\"> Acceptance of performance after breach may operate as a .waiver of the right to treat the contract as terminated by the breach, but is not (per se) a waiver of the right of action to recover damages therefor.
