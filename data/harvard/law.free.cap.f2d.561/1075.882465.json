Burke, <em>Judge, </em>of willful failure to file timely federal income tax returns for the years 1965, 1966 and 1967, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. He appeals his conviction solely on the basis that he was deprived of a speedy trial. We affirm the conviction\u2019 for which appellant has been fined a total of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Appellant filed his 1965 and 1966 returns, due in May, 1966, and June, 1967, respectively, on October 29, 1968, one month after his first interview with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) special agent, and his 1967 return, due in May, 1968, on April 16, 1969. Between September, 1968, and May, 1970, the IRS special agent and appellant met twelve times to discuss his 1965-67 returns. In June, 1970, with counsel present, appellant was informed that criminal charges were being contemplated. Over the next year and one-half, appellant and his counsel attended several conferences with Government personnel, many of which were requested by appellant, culminating in a conference in Washington, D. C., in December, 1971. The indictment was returned on February 17, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-12\">Following appellant\u2019s arraignment on the day the indictment was returned, Buffalo\u2019s two federal district judges recused themselves, and the case was assigned to Judge Burke in Rochester. On March 22, 1972, the Government filed a motion \u201cto move action for trial,\u201d which was followed on May 5 by a Government motion to have the court set a trial date. On May 24, after a trial date had apparently been set, appellant\u2019s defense counsel requested a continuance until the end of June. Judge Burke then set a September trial date, but appellant\u2019s counsel requested a series of continuances, first to October, then to November, then to December, 1972, or January, 1973. At this point the United States Attorney wrote Judge Burke, expressing a desire to go to trial on January 2, 1973. For reasons that are not clear, no trial was set near that date; in October, 1973, the Government moved to fix a trial date, which was then set for November. At that time it appears that appellant\u2019s counsel sought and was granted an indefinite continuance based on the illness of appellant\u2019s wife, who was going to be a defense witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-14\">In May, 1974, the Government gave notice of its readiness for trial and again moved that a trial date be set. In early June, however, appellant\u2019s attorney became ill, and in August he died. In September the Government moved to discover who would be appellant\u2019s new counsel, and in October it moved to set a trial date. At a hearing, Judge Burke indicated that a mid-January, 1975, trial date was probable. For reasons not explained by any party, trial did not occur at that time and was later set for October, 1975. Appellant at that point moved to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute; Judge Burke denied the motion. At the same time appellant\u2019s counsel sought a continuance to the end of October; at the end of October he sought a continuance until late November. In December Judge Burke wrote the parties, scheduling a January, 1976, trial date. Again, the record is unclear as to why trial did not proceed on this date, although it may have been related to illness on the part of Judge Burke. In May, 1976, a hearing was held on the Government\u2019s motion to set a trial date, and a June date was fixed. Once again, the record does not disclose why trial did not proceed, but at some point Judge Burke clearly became ill, so that the Government in October moved to have a new judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>assigned to the case. No such judge was available, however, and by December Judge Burke had recovered. Following a motion by the Government to set a trial date, trial finally began on December 21, 1976, and two days later the jury returned its guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">\n<em>Pre-Indictment Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">In support of the speedy trial claim, appellant first argues that the delay of several years between the initiation of the IRS investigation in 1967 or 1968 and the filing of the indictment in 1972 is \u201crelevant\u201d to his claim of illegal post-indictment delay. <em>See United States v. Vispi, </em>545 F.2d 328, 333 (2d Cir. 1976). He does not contend that the pre-indictment delay itself violated any of his constitutional or other rights, nor could he in light of <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vispi, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 331-32, and <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed. 2d 752 (1977), at least in the absence of some showing both of prejudice from the delay and of a Government purpose for the delay that was otherwise than legitimate, <em>see United States v. Lovasco, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 788-796, 97 S.Ct. 2044, neither of which is alleged here. It appears here, moreover, as in <em>United States v. Vispi, supra, </em>that appellant\u2019s \u201cown activities in attempting to dissuade the authorities from prosecuting him [were] a major factor in the [pre-indictment] delay.\u201d 545 F.2d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Appellant does not explain how the pre-indictment delay is relevant to any alleged violation of his rights from the post-indictment delay. In <em>United States v. Vispi, supra, </em>the court held the former relevant to the latter because the Government, which had had several years to investigate prior to the filing of charges, nevertheless was not ready for an immediate trial and delayed the trial in the face of defense requests to proceed. <em>See id. </em>at 333-34. Here the situation is precisely the reverse of that in <em>Vispi. </em>The Government moved the action for trial just over a month after the indictment was filed and thereafter repeatedly stated its readiness to proceed. The defense, by contrast, moved repeatedly for continuances, particularly in the first year following filing of the indictment. In such circumstances, the length of pre-indictment delay has no relevance at all to the legal significance of events that occurred after the filing of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">\n<em>Post-Indictment Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">Appellant argues that the delay between his indictment in February, 1972, and his trial in December, 1976, violated his rights under rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, under Fed. R. Crim.P. 48(b), and under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We find that none of these provisions were violated by the delay here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-12\">In January, 1971, the Second Circuit adopted \u201cRules Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases,\u201d Rule 4 of which provided that \u201cthe government must be ready for trial within six months from the date of . the filing . . . of a formal charge . . <em>Quoted in Hilbert v. Dooling, </em>476 F.2d 355, 355 n. 1 (2d Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 878, 94 S. Ct. 56, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973). Rule 5 provided that the district court, in computing the six-month period under Rule 4, should exclude, <em>inter alia, </em>any period \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by the district court at the request of, or with the consent of, the defendant or his counsel.\u201d <em>Quoted in </em>476 F.2d at 356 n. 4. These rules were superseded in April 1973, by district court rules, which were in turn superseded in July, 1976, by new district court rules, currently in effect, conforming to the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-74 (Supp. V 1975). The relevant Western District rules between 1973 and 1976 were essentially the same as Second Circuit Rules 4 and 5, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">We do not believe that any of these rules have been violated here. The Government in this case gave notice of its readiness for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>trial in March and again in May, 1972, long before the expiration of six months after the filing of the indictment, and appellant cites absolutely no evidence to support his assertion that the Government\u2019s notices were \u201cmeaningless,\u201d <em>United States v. Pol-iak, </em>474 F.2d 828, 830 (2d Cir. 1973). Continuances requested by defense counsel were the principal reason for delay in the months following the indictment, with the Government repeatedly moving to set a trial date. Although there are long periods of unexplained delay, appellant makes no showing that the Government was not ready for trial during these periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">With regard to the period after the adoption of the new Western District speedy trial rules on July 1, 1976, the relevant inquiry is whether appellant was tried within 180 days of that date, pursuant to Western District Prompt Disposition Rule 5(a)(1) and the pertinent provisions of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161(c), (g), 3163(b)(2) (Supp. V 1975). Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on December 21, 1976, less than 180 days after July 1, 1976. Hence neither Second Circuit nor Western District rules, nor the Speedy Trial Act, were violated by the post-indictment delay in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the indictment should have been dismissed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(b), which states that, \u201cif there is unnecessary delay in bringing a defendant to trial, the court may dismiss the indictment.\u201d As this court noted en banc in <em>Hilbert v. Dooling, supra, </em>the power given the court by Rule 48 was \u201cfleshfed] out\u201d by the Second Circuit rules, 476 F.2d at 361, then later by the district court rules and ultimately by the Speedy Trial Act and rules issued under it. While the district court retains an \u201c \u2018inherent power ... to dismiss a case for want of prosecution,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 360, <em>quoting </em>Committee Note to Rule 48, a power that is not circumscribed by the Constitution, the statute, or the rules, <em>see </em>476 F.2d at 361, this power is a discretionary one, <em>id. </em>at 358, 361; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aberson, </em>419 F.2d 820, 821 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1066, 90 S.Ct. 1497, 25 L.Ed.2d 687 (1970), with review in this court limited to whether there has been an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Aberson, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 821; 3 C. Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 814, at 319 (1969). It may be conceivable, although perhaps not likely, that a delay not violative of any court rules or the Speedy Trial Act might nevertheless appear so \u201cunnecessary\u201d that the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the indictment would be considered an abuse of discretion. Here, however, appellant was responsible for much of the delay, and some of the balance can be explained by such institutional factors as the illness of a judge and the unavailability of a replacement. We find nothing in this record to suggest that Judge Burke\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Rule 48(b) motions was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">Appellant\u2019s final claim is that the delay violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), the Supreme Court adopted a \u201cbalancing test\u201d for evaluation of such claims, under which four factors are to be considered: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. These factors, the Court noted, \u201chave no talismanic qualities\u201d; none is \u201ceither a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. <em>See also United States v. Companion, </em>545 F.2d 308, 311 (2d Cir. 1976) (\u201cthe factors are interrelated and must be considered together\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">The delay here was quite lengthy \u2014 approximately 58 months or just under five years \u2014 but nevertheless was shorter than that in other cases in which no Sixth Amendment violation has been found, see e. <em>g., Barker v. Wingo, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. 2182 (\u201cwell over five years\u201d); <em>United States v. Saglimbene, </em>471 F.2d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 1972) (six years), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 966, 93 S.Ct. 2146, 36 L.Ed.2d 686 (1973). There were a number of reasons for the delay, but appellant and his counsel were responsible for much of it with their re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>peated requests for continuances; his first counsel\u2019s illness and death were also contributing factors. Some of the delay was caused by institutional factors, particularly the unavailability of another judge when Judge Burke became ill, and such factors, while weighing against the Government, do so less heavily than \u201cdeliberate delays or delays related to inexcusable inefficiency,\u201d <em>United States v. Companion, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 312 n. 3; see <em>Barker v. Wingo, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182; <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>515 F.2d 642, 646 (2d Cir. 1975). While the record here contains some rather long unexplained delays, there' is no indication that these are attributable either to deliberate procrastination or even negligent inaction on the part of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">The third factor mentioned by the Supreme Court, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to a speedy trial, weighs heavily against appellant. Rather than \u201crepeatedly and energetically asserting] his rights,\u201d as in <em>United States v. Vispi, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 334, appellant, like the defendant in <em>Barker v. Wingo, supra, </em>apparently \u201cdid not want a speedy trial,\u201d 407 U.S. at 534, 92 S.Ct. at 2194. He never filed a motion to set a trial date, while the Government filed several, and his many requests for continuances are hardly consistent with a concern for a speedy trial. His two motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute were both filed on the eve of scheduled trials and are indicative of an interest in having the indictment dismissed, rather than of an interest in expediting the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">Finally, with regard to the fourth <em>Barker </em>factor, appellant cites no specific prejudice to himself from the delay. He argues that delay of criminal proceedings is \u201cinherently prejudicial,\u201d particularly to an attorney, <em>see United States v. Vispi, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 334-35, but he has not attempted to prove, as had the appellant in <em>Vispi, </em>any adverse effect on his morale, his income, his reputation for integrity, or his ability to marshal a defense, <em>see id. </em>As a lawyer he should have been aware from his very omission to file returns and certainly from his first visit by an IRS special agent in September, 1968, that criminal proceedings were a distinct possibility; by June, 1970, he knew directly that they were a probability. Thus he should have readily been able to retain any and all files or documents relative to a defense. Unlike Vispi, whose defense was that he had lost records and as to whom over four years elapsed after conclusion of the IRS Intelligence Division investigation before indictment, appellant made no showing of prejudice. Taking all of the <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>factors into account along with the total context of this case, we find no violation of appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
