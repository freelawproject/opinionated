(Glamorgan) against it and the unions which represent Glamor-gan employees in collective bargaining. Plaintiffs\u2019 basic claim is that defendants practiced racial discrimination with respect to the compensation, terms, conditions and privileges of employment, promotion and transfer of black employees after the effective date of the Act (July 2, 1965). As set forth in two written opinions, <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Glamorgan Pipe and Foundry Company, </em>418 F.Supp. 743 (W.D.Va.1976), the district court made a number of basic findings. It found that blacks tend to predominate in Glamorgan\u2019s melting, Delavaud finishing and soil pipe finishing departments, and its labor pool. It concluded, however, that \u201c[pjlaintiffs failed to show why the situation exists or that the Company intended for it to exist [and] [d]efenda.nts, by the same token, failed to show why the situation exists or that it did not result from racially discriminatory practices, although unintentional.\u201d 418 F.Supp. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">The district court also found that until 1969 Glamorgan had a job-bidding promotion system which restricted bids for vacancies to employees already employed in the department in which a job opening arose. After 1969, anyone from any department could bid for a vacancy. Since 1965, Gla-morgan had company and departmental seniority, and the system is embodied in its collective bargaining agreements. Under the system, an employee accumulates company seniority after the first three months of employment and departmental seniority after the first thirty days of employment in the particular department. A permanent transfer to another department works a forfeiture of departmental seniority in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>department from which the transfer is made, and new departmental seniority, of course, does not begin to accumulate until after thirty days of employment in the new department.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Although the district court made no finding that defendants practiced racial discrimination in the initial hiring of black employees, it concluded that the class of black employees employed prior to January 1, 1969, in the labor pool or in the melting, Delavaud finishing, or soil pipe finishing departments was entitled to relief under Title VII because Glamorgan\u2019s seniority and job-bidding practices froze blacks into the departments in which they predominated until the inception of open bidding and thus discriminated against blacks because of their race. The district court granted in-junctive relief and awarded back pay to a number of employees and attorneys fees. Almost all of the parties appeal, raising myriad contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Since the district court\u2019s determination of liability, the Supreme Court has decided <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., </em>424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976), and <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). We think that the district court must reconsider its decision in the light of their holdings. To the extent that it relied on Glamorgan\u2019s seniority system as perpetuating pre-Act employment discrimination, the district court should give close attention to <em>Teamsters. </em>To the extent that it relied on Gla-morgan\u2019s seniority system as perpetuating post-Act employment discrimination, the district court should give close attention to <em>Bowman. </em>We call attention to the fact that <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Teamsters </em>both appear to require a finding of initial discrimination in hiring as the premise upon which the operation of a seniority system may be held to be in violation of Title VII. <em>Teamsters </em>also recognizes that such discrimination may be proved by statistical evidence alone, and <em>Teamsters </em>makes clear who has the burden of proof of a <em>prima facie </em>case, how one may be proved and how the burden of proof may shift thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
