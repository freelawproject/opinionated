Brieant, <em>J., </em>dismissing their second amended complaint on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">The principal issues on appeal concern the timeliness of the assertion of claims of unlawful employment practices under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>and unlawful discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. On an analysis which differs somewhat from that employed by the court below, we affirm the dismissal of the second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-16\">Appellants are qualified black flight crew personnel. Appellee Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), a domestic and international airline, is an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). Appellee Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), is a \u201clabor organization\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(d) and a \u201crepresentative\u201d within the meaning of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-17\">Appellants Cates and George both alleged that on February 28,1966 they first applied for flight positions with TWA and, although they were qualified for such employment, were rejected because of their race. Subsequent employment applications by both men were unsuccessful for the same reason, they claim, until 1969. On August 1, 1969, George was hired as a flight engineer, and on October 17, 1969, Cates was also hired in that capacity. On those dates, they became represented for collective bargaining purposes by ALPA and were assigned seniority according to actual date of hire pursuant to the TWA-ALPA seniority system which is the nub of the present controversy. That system, incorporated in the collective bargaining agreements between ALPA and TWA, governs each pilot\u2019s job assignments, compensation, eligibility for transfer or promotion, liability to furlough,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and order of recall throughout his employment with TWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-18\">Shortly after the hiring of Cates and George, unfavorable business conditions beset TWA. In January, 1970, all flight crew hirings were halted as an economy measure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Then the company began furloughing flight crew personnel who had already been hired. On September 1, 1970 and October 5, 1970, Cates and George, respectively, were furloughed in accordance with the terms of the \u201clast hired-first fired\u201d seniority system. They have not yet been recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">The allegations, of appellant Whitehead are somewhat different. From September, 1957 through May, 1967 he was employed as a pilot in the United States Air Force. Whitehead desired employment in a flight position with TWA from 1957 on, and was at all times fully qualified for such a position. He claims, however, that because of the known discriminatory hiring practices of TWA he was dissuaded from applying for employment at that time. He subsequently did apply, was accepted for employment with TWA in a flight position on March 28, 1966, and entered on duty on May 5, 1967. The seniority Whitehead had accumulated allowed him to withstand the furloughs in 1970, and he has remained in the regular employ of TWA since first entering on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">On March 24, 1972, all three men filed charges against TWA and ALP A with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On November 27, 1973, Cates received an amended notice of right to sue from the EEOC. George and Whitehead received similar notices the following day, November 28, 1973. On December 27, 1973 a complaint was filed in the Southern District of New York, which was first amended on March 4, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">The first amended complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief for the three plaintiffs and a class consisting of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Jl\">all other black persons who may be employed with the defendant TWA in the position of flight engineer, co-pilot, pilot, or captain or who may be presently on furlough from such positions, or who would be employed in such positions but for the defendant TWA\u2019s discriminatory employment policies and practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"au0-dedup-0\">The principal discriminatory practices specified were TWA\u2019s alleged consistent failure and refusal to hire qualified blacks as crew members because of their race, and TWA\u2019s and ALPA\u2019s maintenance of the date-of-hire seniority system, the effect of which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0T\">has been and continues to be [to] limit, segregate and classify and discriminate against black employees at TWA\u2019s facilities in ways which jeopardize the jobs of and tend to deprive the said black employees of employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees because of their race and color. The seniority system referred to above is not necessary to the operation of the defendant TWA\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">The first amended complaint also charged that TWA had retaliated against employees for filing charges with the EEOC, had failed to take affirmative steps to rectify the effects of its past discriminatory practices, and that both defendants had applied criteria for job advancement and retention which discriminated against black flight crew employees. These employment policies and practices were said to violate Title VII and \u00a7 1981. In addition, plaintiffs claimed that ALPA had violated its duty of fair representation with respect to them and the class as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-14\">The defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint on the ground that the claims under both Title VII and \u00a7 1981 were untimely. Specifically, they contended that the Title VII claim must fail because no charge had been filed with the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice had occurred as required by \u00a7 706(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the \u00a7 1981 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>claim was barred since it had not been asserted within the applicable three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Brieant denied the motions to dismiss the complaint. He ruled that the Title VII claims were timely since \u201cthe complaint, on its face, clearly alleges a pervasive pattern of racial discrimination which continues to date.\u201d He also concluded that the \u00a7 1981 claim was not barred, reasoning that the timely filing of charges with the EEOC tolled the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">After the denial of the motions to dismiss, counsel for both sides engaged in negotiations aimed at further distilling the legal issues presented by the case. The result was a \u201cstipulation and order\u201d and \u201cletter of agreement\u201d entered into by plaintiffs and TWA and filed on December 9, 1975. The substance of the agreement was that, in return for certain concessions by TWA which would resolve some ancillary disputes between the parties, the plaintiffs would move to file a second amended complaint which would omit all claims of current discrimination and retaliation against black flight crew members by TWA and would claim that the application to them of the seniority system \u201cperpetuates past alleged discrimination and constitutes a violation of Title VII.\u201d It was further agreed that TWA would move to dismiss such an amended complaint on the grounds that none of the claims alleged had been timely asserted and that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief since a \u201cbona fide seniority system operating on a \u2018last in, first out\u2019 basis does not violate Title VII. <em>9J</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Leave to file was granted, and the second amended complaint was filed on December 15, 1975. As agreed, it alleged basically that, since it began doing business until the cessation of all hiring in 1970, TWA had failed and refused to hire qualified blacks as flight crew personnel because of their race, and that the date-of-hire seniority system adversely affected present black flight crew members, many of whom had not been hired at the time of their initial application solely because of their race. Once again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>these policies were claimed to violate Title VII and \u00a7 1981. In addition, the second amended complaint alleged that by negotiating and entering into the collective bargaining agreements establishing the seniority system, and refusing to modify those agreements to lessen the adverse impact of the system upon black flight crew personnel, both ALPA and TWA had failed in their duty of fair representation of plaintiffs and their class imposed by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 181, and 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">As anticipated, motions to dismiss the complaint were again made. The defendants renewed their objections to the Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims as time-barred, and contended that the complaint failed to state a claim since the seniority system qualified as \u201cbona fide\u201d under \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This time Judge Brieant granted the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Addressing the Title VII claims first in his July 22, 1976 memorandum, Judge Brieant noted that it was undisputed that the plaintiffs had filed charges with the EEOC on March 24, 1972. To decide whether their Title VII claims were timely, he reasoned, it was only necessary to determine what unlawful employment practices were alleged in the second amended complaint, and whether those practices had occurred during the 180-day period prior to filing on March 24, 1972, as required by \u00a7 706(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). <em>See supra </em>n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">Judge Brieant concluded that plaintiffs were alleging two distinct unlawful employment practices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-7\">(1) a refusal to hire plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent because of race (\u201cthe refusal to hire claim\u201d) and (2) the application of a facially neutral, date-of-hire seniority system to all flight deck crew members, including plaintiffs and all other similarly situated Black flight deck crew members, which, by making Blacks more exposed to layoffs than whites, has the effect of carrying forward TWA\u2019s past discriminatory hiring practices, now abandoned, into the present (\u201cthe seniority claim\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">On the refusal to hire claim, Judge Brieant ruled that the latest date on which any of the named plaintiffs could have been wrongfully refused employment was the day before they were actually hired \u2014 March 27, 1966 for Whitehead, July 31, 1969 for George, and October 16,1969 for Cates. As for the class plaintiffs sought to represent, he found that no member could have been denied a job on account of his race after January, 1970, when TWA halted all hiring for flight crew positions for economic reasons. Since no claims had been filed with the EEOC within 180 days of these dates, Judge Brieant held that the refusal to hire claims must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">Citing <em>Acha </em>v. <em>Beame, </em>531 F.2d 648 (2d Cir. 1976), and <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., </em>424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976), the district court began its analysis of what it termed the seniority claim on the premise that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-13\">Layoffs pursuant to a reduction in force even when carried out according to a facially neutral, date-of-hire seniority system may be an unlawful employment practice as defined by Section 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), if an individual can show that but for past discrimination he or she would have been hired early enough to accumulate sufficient seniority to withstand the layoffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>Judge Brieant observed that both Cates and George had stated such \u201clast-hired, first fired\u201d claims, while Whitehead, who was never laid off, alleged that the discriminatory policies of TWA which originally dissuaded him from applying still cost him an earlier chance at promotion and preferable flight routes, equipment flown, and scheduling priorities by reason of the existing seniority system. The key questions, as framed by the court, were \u201cat what point in time these alleged violations occurred and whether or not the violations continued up until 180 days before the filing of charges with the EEOC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Relying on <em>Collins </em>v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 594 (9th Cir. 1975), the court concluded that the 180-day period for filing charges raising \u201clast-hired, first fired\u201d claims such as those of Cates and George begins to run on the date of layoff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Looking to their respective dates of layoff, September 1, 1970 for Cates and October 5, 1970 for George, Judge Brieant found that the jurisdictional requisite of filing within 180 days had not been met by the March 24, 1972 filing, and concluded that the seniority claims in their complaint must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">The court below then ruled that since Whitehead had never been furloughed, he had no valid claim under <em>Acha </em>v. <em>Beame, supra. </em>It held that his real grievance was failure to be hired as soon as he might have been, and that he had failed to challenge this in timely fashion. The monthly allocation of a lower level of seniority benefits pursuant to a facially neutral date-of-hire seniority system was not an unlawful employment practice which would trigger the 180-day period \u2014 as would a lay-off. Any such disadvantages- Whitehead experienced were not fresh acts of discrimination, but only the \u201cderivative effects of the prior policies as carried forward by the seniority system.\u201d Since Whitehead had not challenged the unlawful act or practice itself, he could not now challenge its derivative effects. Accordingly, his seniority claim was also dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-10\">Turning to the \u00a7 1981 claims, Judge Brieant noted that in <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), decided after his ruling on the initial motions to dismiss, the Supreme Court had ruled that the filing of a charge with the EEOC does not toll the running of the statute of limitations on a \u00a7 1981 claim based on the same facts. Consequently, he reversed his previous position and dismissed the \u00a7 1981 claims as time barred since the original complaint was not filed until more than three years after the \u00a7 1981 cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">Finally, Judge Brieant dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims that TWA and ALPA had violated the duty of fair representation. He held that \u201cTWA does not owe any such duty in the first instance to its employees,\u201d and that ALPA had \u201cacted entirely within the permissible range of reasonableness\u201d by merely continuing in effect the date-of-hire seniority system. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-13\">On appeal, the rejection of the \u201crefusal to hire\u201d claims as untimely asserted has not been seriously challenged. Appellants argue again, however, relying on <em>United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>446 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1971), and <em>Acha v. Beame, supra, </em>that the operation of the TWAALPA seniority system, which allegedly perpetuates the effects of past discriminatory practices, constitutes a continuing vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>lation of Title VII. They are joined in this contention by the EEOC, which urges in an <em>amicus </em>brief that under Title VII an employee may challenge a neutral seniority system which perpetuates prior discrimination at any time as long as he remains subject to that system and can prove that it preserves past discrimination against him. <em>See also </em>the EEOC\u2019s memorandum interpreting <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, supra, </em>431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), issued subsequent to the submission of its <em>amicus </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">It cannot be denied that certain language contained in <em>Bethlehem Steel </em>and <em>Acha, </em>might be read as supporting appellants\u2019 position that a facially neutral date-of-hire seniority system violates Title VII insofar as it adversely affects identifiable victims of past discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The main emphasis of those cases, however, was on the question of remedy, and the language on which appellants rely can perhaps be attributed to the absence in those cases of separate discussions of \u201cviolation issues\u201d and \u201cremedy issues.\u201d <em>See Chance v. Board of Examiners, </em>534 F.2d 993, 1004 (Oakes, <em>J. </em>dissenting), <em>modified on rehearing, </em>534 F.2d 1007 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>45 U.S.L.W. 3263 (U.S. Sept. 7,1976); <em>compare United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, supra, </em>97 S.Ct. at 1889. In any event, <em>Bethlehem Steel </em>and <em>Acha </em>did not present the type of limitations problem with which we are confronted here. We find this narrow question controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decisions in <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., supra, </em>and <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">The issue posed by <em>Franks </em>was whether identifiable job applicants who were denied employment because of their race after the effective date and in violation of Title VII could be awarded seniority status retroactive to the dates of their employment applications, 424 U.S. at 750, 96 S.Ct. 1251. Before answering that question in the affirmative, the Court had to reject the argument that such seniority adjusting relief was barred by \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h). <em>See supra </em>n. 5. Its discussion is instructive in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">The <em>Franks </em>Court first observed that the underlying legal wrong affecting petitioners in that case was \u201cnot the alleged operation of a racially discriminatory seniority system but of a racially discriminatory hiring system.\u201d 424 U.S. at 758, 96 S.Ct. at 1261. Petitioners there, like appellants here, did not seek modification or elimination of the existing seniority system but rather an award of the seniority status they would have enjoyed under that system had it not been for the discriminatory refusal to hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">The Court then described \u00a7 703(h) as \u201conly a definitional provision\u201d, <em>id., </em>the thrust of which is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-9\">directed toward defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination occurring prior to the effective date of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">424 U.S. at 761, 96 S.Ct. at 1263. <em>See also </em>Powell, <em>J., </em>concurring in part and dissenting in part, 424 U.S. at 781, 96 S.Ct. at 1272. (\u201cI also agree with Part II of the opinion insofar as it determines the \u2018thrust\u2019 of \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII to be the insulation of an otherwise bona fide seniority system from a challenge that it amounts to a discriminatory practice because it perpetuates the effects of a pre-Act discrimination.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"A7u\">After analyzing the text and legislative history of \u00a7 703(h), Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, concluded that the subsection did not bar seniority adjusting relief otherwise appropriate under the remedial provisions of Title VII \u201conce an illegal discriminatory practice occurring after the effective date of the Act is proved. . . .\u201d 424 U.S. at 762, 96 S.Ct. at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-12\">In <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, supra, </em>decided after oral argument in this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>Court clarified its <em>Franks </em>holding in a case which is largely dispositive of the question at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Evans was employed by United as a flight attendant from November, 1966 to February, 1968 at which time she was forced to resign pursuant to a United policy \u2014 later found discriminatory \u2014 which refused to permit female flight attendants to be married. She was not a party to the suit which challenged such forced resignations as violative of Title VII, and she did not initiate any proceedings of her own by filing a charge with the EEOC within 90 days after her separation, as was then required by \u00a7 706(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">On February 16, 1972, Evans was again hired as a new employee. When her requests for credit for her pre-1972 seniority were denied by United, she commenced an action. The district court dismissed her complaint, finding it time barred for failure to file a charge within 90 days of her separation in 1968. A divided panel of the Seventh Circuit initially affirmed; then, after granting rehearing, unanimously reversed on the supposed authority of <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., supra. </em>The Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit and held that the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">While Evans acknowledged that it was too late to obtain relief based on a 1968 unlawful employment practice, she argued, like appellants here, that United was guilty of a \u201cpresent, continuing violation of Title VII\u201d and that therefore her claim was timely. She claimed that United illegally discriminates against her since \u201cthe seniority system gives present effect to the past illegal act and therefore perpetuates the consequences of forbidden discrimination.\u201d 97 S.Ct. at 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, first acknowledged that the seniority system gives present effect to a past act of discrimination. He then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-9\">But United was entitled to treat that past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a charge of discrimination within the 90 days then allowed by \u00a7 706(d). A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge is the legal equivalent of a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was passed. It may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at issue, but separately considered, it is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-10\">Respondent emphasizes the fact that she has alleged a <em>continuing </em>violation. United\u2019s seniority system does indeed have a continuing impact on her pay and fringe benefits. But the emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity; the critical question is whether any present <em>violation </em>exists. She has not alleged that the system discriminates against former female employees or that it treats former employees who were discharged for a discriminatory reason any differently than former employees who resigned or were discharged for a non-discriminatory reason. In short, the system is neutral in its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">97 S.Ct. at 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">The Court did not view its decision the previous term in <em>Franks </em>as controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arp-dedup-0\">When that case reached this Court, the issues relating to the timeliness of the charge and the violation of Title VII had already been decided; we dealt only with a question of remedy. In contrast, in the case now before us we do not reach any remedy issue because respondent did not file a timely charge based on her 1968 separation and she has not alleged facts establishing a violation since she was rehired in 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-15\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-16\">Finally, Justice Stevens noted that since Evans did not challenge the bona fides of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>United\u2019s seniority system, and did not allege that the system was intentionally designed to discriminate because of race, col- or, religion, sex, or national origin, \u00a7 703(h) is an additional ground for rejecting her claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-4\">The statute does not foreclose attacks on the current operation of seniority systems which are subject to challenge as discriminatory. But such a challenge to a neutral system may not be predicated on the mere fact that a past event which has no present legal significance has affected the calculation of seniority credit, even if the past event might at one time have justified a valid claim against the employer. A contrary view would substitute a claim for seniority credit for almost every claim which is barred by limitations. Such a result would contravene the mandate of \u00a7 703(h).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">97 S.Ct. at 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">It is plain, in the light of <em>Evans </em>and <em>Franks, </em>that the Title VII claims of Cates, George, and Whitehead were not timely asserted. Those decisions sharply distinguished the issues whether there has been a violation of Title VII and what the appropriate remedy is for such a violation, while earlier lower court decisions tended to mix the two questions together. Unless there is a timely charge which is proven to be a violation of Title VII, the question of remedy is never reached. <em>See also International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1858-65, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">After <em>Evans </em>and <em>Franks, </em>the second amended complaint cannot be construed as alleging \u201ctwo distinct unlawful employment practices.\u201d In fact, only one unlawful employment practice was alleged \u2014 discriminatory refusal to hire \u2014 and that was long since time barred. What was characterized as a second independent violation of Title VII, the seniority claim, was nothing more than the residual effect of a prior discriminatory refusal to hire, which could have been remedied had that past unlawful employment practice been timely asserted and proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">As in <em>Franks, </em>the underlying wrong which appellants challenge is not a racially discriminatory seniority system but an allegedly racially discriminatory hiring system which has not functioned since at least 1970. They make no charges of current discrimination or that the seniority system is not bona fide or ever operated in other than a neutral fashion. Their only claim is that appellants occupy a lower spot on the seniority list than they rightfully should because of the perpetuation of prior discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">Under <em>Evans, </em>this does not charge a present violation of Title VII. Nor does the fact that present disadvantages arising from past discrimination crystallized in layoffs for Cates and George trigger a new period within which charges may be filed, as the district court believed. Cates and George stand in the same position as Whitehead, and, since the neutral seniority system here was insulated from attack by \u00a7 703(h), can only point to the initial refusal to hire as a violation of Title VII. Because such a claim was not asserted in timely fashion by any of the appellants, as held by the court below, <em>see supra </em>at 1068,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it has no present legal significance. We therefore affirm the dismissal of appellants\u2019 Title VII allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">In <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the timely filing of a charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC under Title VII does not toll the running of the statute of limitations applicable to an action based on the same facts but institut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>ed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellants in effect concede that if <em>Johnson </em>is applied in the typical retroactive fashion to this case, as it was in the court below, their \u00a7 1981 claims are also time barred. They argue, however, that consideration of the factors enunciated in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as well as a line of lower court cases from the Fifth Circuit,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> warrants limiting <em>Johnson </em>to prospective application only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">We are unconvinced. As <em>Chevron </em>indicates,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Supreme Court is well aware of how to avoid the effects of applying one of its rulings retroactively to the case at bar. Yet in <em>Johnson, </em>the Court chose to apply its ruling that \u00a7 1981 statutes of limitations are not tolled by timely filed EEOC charges to the facts at hand, despite its awareness that this would preclude petitioner there from obtaining any relief since his Title VII claims were also time-barred. 421 U.S. at 466, 95 S.Ct. 1716.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">If anything, the instant case is a less attractive one than <em>Johnson </em>for prospective application only of the \u201cnontolling\u201d rule. In <em>Johnson, </em>the plaintiff had filed his Title VII charges in a timely manner and would have had a timely \u00a7 1981 claim if the EEOC filing had tolled the applicable <em>one year </em>statute of limitations. In contrast, appellants here failed to file Title VII charges within the required time, and took no steps with respect to their \u00a7 1981 claims within the much longer three-year statute of limitations applicable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-15\">The cases from the Fifth Circuit which appellants cite, <em>see supra </em>n. 13, the reasoning of which was rejected by that Circuit in <em>Dupree v. Hutchins Brothers, </em>521 F.2d 236 (5th Cir. 1975), all based their decisions that <em>Johnson </em>should not be applied retroactively on the fact that the tolling effect of EEOC charges was settled law in the Fifth Circuit. <em>See Boudreaux v. Baton Rouge Marine Contracting Co., </em>437 F.2d 1011, at 1017 n. 16 (5th Cir. 1971). Appellants have no similar claim. Moreover, the fact that their Title VII claims were not timely asserted suggests that the failure to file a \u00a7 1981 complaint was attributable to tardiness in general rather than reliance on the tolling ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>feet of EEOC charges. We conclude that the same considerations which compelled the Court to apply the non-tolling rule of <em>Johnson </em>in that case <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> make it reasonably certain that its application was contemplated in situations like this where appellants, to a greater extent than petitioner in <em>Johnson, </em>have \u201cslept on [their] \u00a7 1981 rights.\u201d 421 U.S. at 466. <em>See Patterson v. American Tobacco Co., </em>535 F.2d 257, 275 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 314-15, 50 L.Ed.2d 286 (1976); <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Carter Carburetor Co., </em>532 F.2d 125, 127 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">In light of the foregoing rulings, appellants\u2019 remaining claims that ALPA and TWA violated the duty of fair representation by negotiating and maintaining the neutral date-of-hire seniority system merit little discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\"><em>Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R., </em>323 U.S. 192, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944), which first established the duty of fair representation of exclusive bargaining representatives under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq., </em>applicable here by virtue of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181, also recognized that this duty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-7\">does not mean that the statutory representative of a craft is barred from making contracts which may have unfavorable effects on some of the members of the craft represented. Variations in the terms of the contract based on differences relevant to the authorized purposes of the contract in conditions to which they are to be applied, such as differences in seniority, the type of work performed, the competence and skill with which it is performed, are within the scope of the bargaining representation of a craft, all of whose members are not identical in their interest or merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">323 U.S. at 203, 65 S.Ct. at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">Since the operation of the seniority system at issue here does not constitute an independent violation of Title VII or \u00a7 1981, and admittedly was not instituted for discriminatory reasons and has not been applied in other than a neutral manner, we perceive no way in which ALPA violated its duty as exclusive representative by bargaining for such a system. See <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, supra, </em>97 S.Ct. at 1863-65; Vaca v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Jackson v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>457 F.2d 202 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Jones v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 790 (2d Cir. 1974). Moreover, while there is authority for holding an employer liable for its participation in a union\u2019s breach of its duty as exclusive bargaining agent, <em>see, e. g., O\u2019Mar a v. Erie Lackawan-na R.R., </em>407 F.2d 674, 679 (2d Cir. 1969), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Czosek v. O\u2019Mara, </em>397 U.S. 25, 90 S.Ct. 770, 25 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970); <em>Jones v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>at 798; <em>Richardson v. Texas and New Orleans R.R., </em>242 F.2d 230, 235-36 (5th Cir. 1957), this is not an appropriate case for application of such a rule. ALPA did not violate its duty so it is plain that TWA did not aid it in any such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1123-19\">.
