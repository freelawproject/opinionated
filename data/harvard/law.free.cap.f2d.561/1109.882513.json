After this transaction was repeated at another store with a second $100 bill, Henry Weil was informed, either by Philip or in his presence, that the bills were counterfeit. He was offered $10 for each additional bill that he passed, and proceeded to pass two more at the same shopping center. Philip admitted that he was present in the car during these transactions, but denied knowledge that the bills were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-22\">The defendant first claims that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence-of a pri- or, consistent statement of the government\u2019s principal witness, Henry Weil, without the witness\u2019 testimony having been impeached. On two occasions during the trial, the government asked Henry Weil if the testimony he had given was substantially the same as the story he related in a signed statement given to investigating officers after his arrest. The question was first asked and affirmatively answered bn direct examination, without objection. It was then repeated, and permitted to be answered over objection, on redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-23\">The' defendant\u2019s objection on redirect examination should have been sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>tained. Corroborative testimony consisting of prior, consistent statements is ordinarily inadmissible unless the testimony sought to be bolstered has first been impeached.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Coltrane v. United States, </em>135 U.S.App.D.C. 295, 418 F.2d 1131 (1969); <em>Schoppel v. United States, </em>270 F.2d 413, 417 (4th Cir. 1959); 4 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1124 (Chadbourn rev. 1972). While the defense did attempt to show on cross-examination that Henry Weil was promised leniency if he implicated his brother, it does not appear that the signed statement was given prior to that time, which would have established its materiality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Felice v. L.I.R.R. Co., </em>426 F.2d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 1970); 4 Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 1128. This applies with equal force, <em>a fortiori, </em>to the objectionable evidence elicited by the government on direct examination, before any impeachment occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\">The defendant, however, failed to object to the government\u2019s question on direct examination. Whatever prejudice may have resulted from the admission of the testimony occurred at least at that time, and reversible error was not committed because no objection was made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the same testimony was repeated shortly thereafter on redirect over a meritorious objection, no substantial rights of the accused were further impaired. In other words, the error on redirect examination was so slight to be harmless. Had the prior, written statement itself been introduced over objection on redirect examination, we would be confronted with a more serious hearsay problem, see <em>United States v. Morlang, </em>531 F.2d 183, 190 (4th Cir. 1975), notwithstanding that the jury had previously been informed of the fact that the statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">Next, the defendant assigns error to the district court\u2019s refusal to give a limiting instruction, contemporaneously with his cross-examination, on the effect to be given to a previous conviction of the defendant. Such an instruction was given at the close of the evidence and argument, as part of the overall jury charge. We see no merit in the contention that a limiting instruction was required contemporaneously with the admission of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The court\u2019s charge clearly delimited the sole purpose for which the prior conviction could be considered \u2014 as going to the credibility of the defendant as a witness. The jury was unequivocally apprised, prior to its deliberations, that the evidence could not be considered on the question of guilt or innocence. Thus, the limiting instruction given at the close of the trial adequately protected the rights of the accused. Accord <em>United States v. Campanale, </em>518 F.2d 352 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>468 F.2d 612 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Annoreno, </em>460 F.2d 1303 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-10\">Third, Philip contends that a question directed to him on cross-examination, inquiring whether he had his former employer in court, had the effect of impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>defense. The object of the question was to ascertain where Weil had gotten $130 found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The defendant asserted that he had earned this money at a service station job that terminated about a week prior to the offense. The government contended that Philip had obtained it by passing counterfeit currency. In these circumstances, the question was entirely proper. When a defendant chooses to testify, he is subject to cross-examination to the same extent as any other witness. It was well within the permissible bounds of cross-examination for the government to inquire whether a witness who could possibly have corroborated the defendant\u2019s story had been summoned to court by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Finally, the court\u2019s charge to the jury on aiding and abetting is challenged. The defendant requested an instruction that mere presence and knowledge of the crime by the defendant was insufficient to prove aiding and-abetting on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">While the requested instruction was not given verbatim, examining the court\u2019s charge we find that the substance of the defendant\u2019s instruction was conveyed to the jury with emphasis, that is to say that some active participation on the part of the defendant was required. Thus, the jury was instructed, \u201cIn order to aid and abet another to commit an offense, it is necessary that the accused willfully associate himself in some way with the criminal venture and willfully participate in it as he would in something he wishes to bring about, that is to say he willfully seeks by some act or omission of his to make the criminal venture succeed.\u201d The court further charged that the defendant must have \u201cactively participated in the passing of these counterfeit bills,\u201d and that he must have \u201ccommitted some sort of overt act helping to bring about the violation of the law alleged here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">This charge makes abundantly clear that mere presence and knowledge of the crime on the part of Philip Weil would not constitute aiding and abetting, but, on the contrary, that his active participation was required. Accord <em>Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-8\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">. The question also was repetitious, having already been asked on direct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">. While a prior, consistent statement introduced in the absence of certain kinds of impeaching testimony may lack probative value, in that repetition of a lie does not enhance its truthfulness, the primary objection to such a statement is that it constitutes hearsay. <em>United States v. Sherman, </em>171 F.2d 619, 622 (2d Cir. 1948); see <em>United States v. Morlang, </em>531 F.2d 183, 190 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Rule 801(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that a prior consistent statement of a witness is not hearsay if it \u201cis offered to rebut an express or implied charge against him of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">While the record is not absolutely clear, we assume the prior consistent statement, as the defense contends, was not made prior to a bargain between Henry Weil and the government as to Henry\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1169-12\">. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>248 F.2d 196 (8th Cir. 1957), aff\u2019d 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597 (1959). It is conceivable that, as in <em>Harris, </em>Philip intentionally waived his objection to the testimony concerning Henry\u2019s statement to the police, in order to bolster the foundation for impeachment on cross-examination, on the basis of alleged promises of leniency made to Henry Weil if he implicated Philip. In any event, errors not objected to at trial cannot ordinarily be raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
