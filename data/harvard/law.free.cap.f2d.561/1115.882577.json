About two months later, the IRS assessed income tax against the plaintiffs in the total amount of $21,462.50.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, plaintiffs having paid only about $3,000 of their assessed income tax for 1973, the IRS filed notices of tax lien and levied upon various bank accounts belonging to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">The Kochs filed an amended tax return for 1973 in December 1975. This amended return, by virtue of changing the treatment of the sale of a partnership interest to an installment basis, disclosed zero tax liability for 1973. The IRS has made no assessment on the basis of the amended return, nor has it taken that return into account by making a supplemental assessment upon the original return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">Plaintiffs contend that, since the amended return admitted no tax liability, it placed the Commissioner\u2019s entire original tax assessment in dispute, and the entire amount sought to be collected is a deficiency. If this assertion were correct, plaintiffs should have been entitled to a statutory notice of deficiency under IRC \u00a7 6213(a), and an opportunity to litigate the deficiency in the Tax Court prior to its collection. Thus, the contention goes, the Commissioner\u2019s failure to provide such notice would make applicable \u00a7 6213(a)\u2019s exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">As noted by the district court, the correctness of plaintiffs\u2019 position depends upon whether the IRS is required to accept the amended tax return in place of the original return previously filed. We agree with the district court that the Internal Revenue Code and regulations provide no basis for such a requirement, and affirm the judgment below dismissing the suit under the Anti-Injunction Act. We express no opinion as to the actual extent of plaintiffs\u2019 1973 tax liability, currently under consideration in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">There is simply no statutory provision authorizing the filing of amended tax returns, and while the IRS has, as a matter of internal administration, recognized and accepted such returns for limited purposes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> their treatment has not been elevated beyond a matter of internal agency discretion. <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>A'Hearn, </em>210 F.Supp. 10 (S.D.N. Y.1961), aff\u2019d per curiam on the opinion of the district court in 309 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>Klinghamer v. Brodrick, </em>242 F.2d 563 (10th Cir. 1957); see <em>Miskovsky v. United States, </em>414 F.2d 954 (3rd Cir. 1969). That discretion has not been abused in the present case. As the Third Circuit has recognized, \u201c[I]t would be utterly disruptive of the administration of the tax laws if a taxpayer could disregard his return and automatically change an assessment based thereon by making an amended return in his favor long after the expiration of the time for filing the original return.\u201d 414 F.2d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6211(a) defines a deficiency, for our purposes, as the amount by which the tax assessed by the IRS exceeds the amount shown by the taxpayer on his return. Because the Commissioner is not obligated to take cognizance of the amended return for the purpose of collecting his original assessment, it is clear that the $20,-558 presently sought is not a deficiency, for it does not exceed the amount shown by plaintiffs on their original return. Plaintiffs were therefore not entitled to a notice of deficiency, and the statutory exception of \u00a7 6213 to the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">We have considered the other points raised in taxpayers\u2019 brief and are of opinion they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">.
