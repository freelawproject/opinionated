Since no plaintiff is an individual who has presented a claim challenging his coverage to the Secretary or his delegate, we conclude there is no jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g). Since the State of Maryland has not officially challenged the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the policemen are not a separate coverage group, there is no jurisdiction under 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 418. Hence, we conclude that there is no subject matter jurisdiction of this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">In 1971, the policemen of Montgomery County voted to terminate their social security coverage. The Montgomery County Council adopted a resolution notifying the Chief of the Social Security Division of Maryland\u2019s Employment Retirement System that the policemen wished to discontinue their social security coverage on June 30, 1973. The resolution, however, disclaimed any approval or disapproval by the County Council of the policemen\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">The state administrative office sought the advice of the Regional Commissioner of Social Security who expressed the opinion that while all of the employees of Montgomery County could withdraw from the program, the policemen, alone, could not. After further informal meetings, the County Personnel Director sent a letter denominated an \u201cappeal\u201d to the state Social Security Administrator, who forwarded it to the Social Security Administration. The Commissioner of Social Security sent the state Social Security Administrator a report containing a ruling, in agreement with the earlier opinion of the Regional Commissioner, that the Montgomery County policemen alone could not withdraw from the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">Thereafter, plaintiff Lowther, individually and as President of the Montgomery County Police Association, and Montgomery County filed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">Though subsequently holding against the plaintiffs on the merits, the district court found jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331. Resting jurisdiction upon \u00a7 1331, it concluded, was not precluded by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(h), since it found no provision in the Social Security Act for a hearing and administrative review of a group\u2019s claim of a right of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">After the district court\u2019s ruling on jurisdiction, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) and <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) were announced. <em>Salfi </em>was a class action attacking certain duration-of-relationship social security eligibility requirements as unconstitutional. The district court in <em>Saifi </em>had looked upon \u00a7 405(h) as only a codification of the exhaustion requirement presenting no barrier to the exercise of federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(h) was an absolute bar to the exercise of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 of any claim arising under Title II of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">Because of the intervening decisions in the Supreme Court, at oral argument the plaintiffs conceded that jurisdiction could not be founded upon \u00a7 1331. Instead, they assert jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g) which provides that \u201cany individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>al, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, * * * \u201d may obtain review of the Secretary\u2019s decision by a civil action timely filed. They look to language in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>supra in which it was said that the requirement of a final decision by the Secretary in \u00a7 405(g) consisted of two elements. One of the elements is that administrative remedies be exhausted, a requirement that could be waived by the Secretary. The other element, however, is strictly jurisdictional. It is that a claim shall have been presented to the Secretary, for in the absence of a claim properly presented, there could be no \u201cdecision.\u201d Thus there can be no judicial review under \u00a7 405(g) by a plaintiff who has filed no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The plaintiffs would avoid the jurisdictional claim requirement of \u00a7 405(g), since in this case the Commissioner has actually ruled upon the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they constitute a separate coverage group. It is true that there has been, at least, an informal ruling by the Commissioner, but that does not avoid the jurisdictional problem because \u00a7 405(g) authorizes judicial review only when sought by an \u201cindividual\u201d after a final decision by the Secretary made after a hearing to which the individual was a party. Montgomery County, one of the plaintiffs, is not such an individual, and Lowther, the only individual plaintiff, filed no claim and has not been a party to any hearing. Nor is his position enhanced by representation of the Police Association, for the Association is not an individual entitled to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Lowther may present his contention by seeking a review of his social security wage records under \u00a7 405(c), and any adverse determination by the Secretary would be open to judicial review under \u00a7 405(g). There is no indication that he has done that or, by any other means, presented his claim or contention to the Secretary or his delegate. Officials of the county and state have presented the policemen\u2019s desire to withdraw from the social security system to officials of the Social Security Administration, but <em>Salfi, supra, </em>and <em>Eldridge, supra, </em>make it quite clear that only individuals who themselves have presented their claims to the Secretary are entitled to judicial review under \u00a7 405(g). <em>Salfi </em>was a purported class action. The named plaintiffs had presented their claims to the Secretary and the Secretary had denied them, but the Supreme Court held there was no jurisdiction to consider the class claims, for there was no allegation that the unnamed members of the class had ever filed applications with the Secretary for the benefits they sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">There may be a degree of futility in a requirement that judicial consideration be postponed to a final decision by the Secretary after a hearing upon a claim asserted by an individual policeman. If further administrative proceedings were futile beyond all question, exercise of judicial jurisdiction would still be foreclosed. There was such a suggestion in <em>Salfi, </em>but the Supreme Court said that the \u201cfinal decision \u201d requirement of \u00a7 405(g) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-9\">something more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion, and may not be dispensed with merely by a judicial conclusion of futility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">In this instance, however, futility may not be obvious. The question has not been presented to the Secretary in an adversary proceeding. In an informal way, representatives of the Social Security Administration have been informed of the wishes of the policemen, but there has been no hearing; ho evidence has been presented and no advocate for the policemen has argued their case before a hearing officer. Nor has there been any presentation of their position by an advocate in their behalf to any reviewing authority. Perhaps, when administrative remedies are pursued, the Secretary will come to the same conclusion, but that will remain uncertain until the necessary administrative proceedings are completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 418(t) Maryland itself may prosecute the claim of the policemen through the claim and review procedures of the Social Security Administration and may seek judicial review of an adverse decision under \u00a7 418(s). Maryland, however, has prosecuted no such administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>proceedings and is not a party to this judicial proceeding. Hence, we have no jurisdiction under \u00a7 418(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Finally, jurisdiction cannot be rested upon \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701, <em>et seq. </em>because the Supreme Court has recently held that the Administrative Procedure Act is not an independent grant of subject matter jurisdiction. Cal<em>ifano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Since there is no subject matter jurisdiction, we will vacate the judgment of the district court on the merits, and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
