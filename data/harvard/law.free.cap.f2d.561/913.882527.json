The challenged order found GAF in violation of a regulation requiring em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ployers to provide medical examinations to workers exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos. GAF employees are exposed to asbestos dust during the manufacture of floor coverings and fiber building products. GAF contends that the Commission misinterpreted the regulation and that in any event the regulation is void. We conclude that neither of these contentions is correct and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">This dispute began in 1973 when the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) issued citations charging GAF with violations of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(j) (subsequently renumbered to \u00a7 mO.lOOlCj)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cited regulation requires employers to provide certain pre-employment, annual, and separation medical examinations to all workers \u201cin an occupation exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">GAF does not provide the specified examinations, but argues that the regulation does not require them, given the low levels of airborne asbestos at GAF\u2019s plants. At the time of the citation, which involved two of GAF\u2019s plants, the level at both plants was below the maximum permissible level. (The maximum permissible level at that time was 5 fibers, of more than 5 micrometers in length, per cubic centimeter of air. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(b).) GAF contends that the regulations require medical examinations only if the concentration of airborne asbestos exceeds this maximum level or some other level higher than that found in GAF\u2019s plants. The Secretary argues that the presence of any airborne asbestos at all triggers the requirement for medical examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">GAF challenged the citations throughout the levels of administrative review provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 (1970). In due course the Commission upheld the citations. <em>Secretary of Labor v. GAF Corp., </em>75 OSAHRC Rep. 3/A2 (microfiche). GAF then petitioned this court seeking review of the Commission\u2019s order as provided by the Act. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">GAF contends that the Commission erred in interpreting the regulation to require medical examinations for employees exposed to the relatively low concentrations of airborne asbestos found in GAF\u2019s plants. GAF also contends that the regulation is void because it was improperly promulgated, is inconsistent with the Act, and is arbitrary, irrational, and unsupported by the evidence. We shall consider each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">A. <em>Interpretation of the Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">We turn first to GAF\u2019s contention that the Commission erred in upholding the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the disputed regulation. GAF is supported by neither the language nor the history of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">We note at the outset that the Secretary is charged by law with administering the Act and the regulations supporting it. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 655 et <em>seq. </em>(1970). Hence, his interpretation of the regulation \u201cbecomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). The Secretary\u2019s interpretation remains controlling \u201ceven though the chosen exegesis may not appear quite as reasonable as some other construction.\u201d [citation omitted] <em>Budd Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>513 F.2d 201, 205 (3rd Cir. 1975); <em>accord, Clarkson Const\u2019n Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>531 F.2d 451, 457 (10th Cir. 1976). Furthermore, the standards must be construed, as they were construed by the Secretary, to protect the employees. <em>See Brennan v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>491 F.2d 1340, 1344 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulations not only satisfies the standards discussed above; it is far more reasonable than the interpretation urged by GAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">GAF bases its argument upon the language of the regulation, which requires medical examinations for those \u201cin an occupation exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers . . . .\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(j). The Secretary interprets this language as requiring examinations for those in occupations exposed to any level of asbestos. GAF, in contrast, argues that the word \u201cconcentration\u201d implies a quantitative amount. Because the disputed section does not specify any quantity of asbestos, GAF reasons that the section should be read to include the 5-fiber limit of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(b), or at least some other quantitative limit greater than the level found in GAF\u2019s plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">GAF\u2019s argument flies in the face of the language of the regulation. It would be a unique regulation indeed which managed to impose a quantitative limitation by not mentioning any quantity at all. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the regulation reveals that the omission of the quantitative limit was deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">As originally proposed, the requirement of examinations <em>was </em>triggered by the presence of a specific quantity of asbestos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACnH\"><em>Medical Examinations. </em>The employer shall provide, or make available at his cost, appropriate medical examinations on a periodic basis to any employee who is exposed to asbestos dust in excess of the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section [5 fibers per cubic centimeter].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"awq-dedup-0\">37 Fed.Reg. 468 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The final standard, however, deletes the reference to a specific concentration. The preamble to the final standard notes that several changes have been made to the proposed regulation, and then states that medical examinations are now required for <em>\u201cevery </em>employee exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos.\u201d [emphasis supplied] 37 Fed.Reg. 11319 (1972). The preamble makes no mention of any specific quantity of asbestos. Nor does the final regulation itself. Instead, the final regulation requires examinations for those \u201cin occupations exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers . . . .\u201d The regulation states this requirement not once, but three times, in almost identical language: once each in the paragraphs requiring preplacement, annual, and termination examinations. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.93a(j)(2)-(4). In contrast, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(g)(l)(i) requires posting of caution signs <em>\u201cwhere airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers may be in excess of the exposure limits prescribed </em>in paragraph (b) of this section.\u201d [emphasis added]</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">We think these considerations leave room for only one conclusion: the disputed regulations require medical examinations for all those in occupations exposed to airborne asbestos in any measurable concentration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">B. <em>Validity of the Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"arf-dedup-0\">GAF contends that, even if the Secretary correctly interpreted the regulation, it is void on a number of grounds. We find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">Although we have carefully considered all GAF\u2019s arguments concerning the validity of the regulation, only four merit discussion here. These are GAF\u2019s contentions that the regulation is arbitrary and unsupported by evidence; that the regulation is inconsistent with the Act; that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with his approval of a California occupational safety plan; and that the federal regulation was improperly promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">GAF argues first that the regulation is arbitrary and unsupported by evidence. GAF bases this argument partly upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>recommendation of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH was created by the Act for the purpose of developing health and safety standards and recommending them to the Secretary. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 671 (1970). NIOSH recommended to the Secretary that medical examinations be required where airborne asbestos concentrations exceed 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air. <em>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, criteria for a recommended standard . . Occupational Exposure to Asbestos </em>at 1-3 (1972) [cited hereafter as \u201cNIOSH criteria\u201d]. The Secretary rejected this recommendation and instead required medical examinations for those exposed to any concentration of airborne asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">GAP contends that this rejection by the Secretary was arbitrary and unsupported by the evidence, and especially arbitrary because NIOSH stated that its recommended standard included a \u201cSafety factor\u201d. NIOSH criteria at II \u2014 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">We have previously held that the Secretary is not bound by NIOSH recommendations. <em>Industrial Union Department </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 340-41, 499 F.2d 467, 476-77 (1974). And in this case the Secretary\u2019s departure from the NIOSH recommendation is reasonable. NIOSH noted that concentrations as low as 1.2 fibers per cubic centimeter have been known to cause serious diseases. Furthermore, NIOSH noted, the state of knowledge concerning asbestos-related diseases is such that no exposure standard other than zero would assure freedom from such diseases. NIOSH criteria at III \u2014 23, III \u2014 9. Hence the Secretary acted reasonably and on substantial evidence in requiring medical examinations for those exposed to any concentration of airborne asbestos rather than limiting examinations to those exposed to more than 1 fiber per cubic centimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">GAF argues next that even if the challenged regulation is supported by evidence, the regulation is invalid because it is inconsistent with the Act. GAF contends that the examinations are in effect being used as a form of medical research, because some useful knowledge will probably be gained from them. Under the Act, GAF continues, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) must pay for medical examinations used as research. Hence the challenged regulation, by requiring GAF to supply medical examinations at its own expense, contravenes the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">GAF misconstrues the Act and its effect upon the challenged regulation. The Act does not require the Secretary of HEW to pay for medical examinations used as research; it merely <em>permits </em>him to do so. The Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-11\">In the event such medical examinations are in the nature of research, <em>as determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, </em>such examinations <em>may </em>be furnished at the expense of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. [emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(7) (1970). Thus, the Act clearly vests the Secretary of HEW with discretion to determine whether the examinations are in the nature of medical research and if so, whether to pay for them. His determination in this regard may be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">We note initially that no decision of the Secretary of HEW in this matter is before the court. In any event, a review of the challenged regulation convinces us that the examinations in issue are not \u201cin the nature of medical research\u201d and are thus properly chargeable to GAF. GAF cannot seriously contend that the examinations are primarily designed to further medical research rather than to protect employees exposed to asbestos dust. As we have noted above, NIOSH found that non-zero exposure limits alone could not guarantee the prevention of asbestos-induced disease. NIOSH criteria at III \u2014 9. Consequently, NIOSH recommended periodic medical examinations for the protection of the workers, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-15\">The major objective of such surveillance will be to ensure proper medical management of individuals who show evidence of reaction to past dust exposures, either due to excessive exposures or unusual susceptibility. Medical management may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>range from recommendations as to job placement, improved work practices, cessation of smoking, to specific therapy for asbestos-related disease or its complications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">NIOSH criteria at 1-3. And in promulgating the final regulation, the Secretary of Labor noted the hazards connected with long-term exposure to asbestos dust and concluded, \u201cthe conflict in the medical evidence is resolved in favor of the health of employees.\u201d 37 Fed.Reg. 11318 (1972). Finally, the Secretary specified in the regulation that records of the medical examinations in question would be kept by the employer, whereas the Act requires that records of examinations used as medical research be forwarded to the Secretary of HEW. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.93a(j)(6); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(7) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">These factors considered together clearly indicate that the examinations at issue are to be provided primarily for the protection of GAF\u2019s employees rather than for the purposes of medical research. Consequently, the challenged regulation does not contravene the section of the Act permitting the Secretary of HEW to pay for medical examinations conducted as medical research.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">GAF argues that even if the challenged regulation is supported by evidence and consistent with the Act, the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is inconsistent with his approval of a California occupational health and safety plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The alleged inconsistency arises because the California plan, like the NIOSH recommendation for a federal standard, requires medical examinations only if the employees may be exposed to concentrations of asbestos greater than 1 fiber per cubic centimeter. General Industry Safety Orders 8 Cal. Admin. Code Ch. 4, Subch. 7 \u00a7 52080')- The Secretary may approve of a state plan and permit the state to take over some enforcement functions of the federal government, but only if the state plan \u201cprovides for the development and enforcement of safety and health standards . . which standards (and the enforcement of which standards) . . <em>will be at least as effective </em>in providing safe and healthful employment <em>... as the standards promulgated under section 655 </em>of this title . . .\u201d [emphasis supplied] 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(c) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The Secretary has approved the California plan. 38 Fed.Reg. 10717-20 (1973); 41 Fed.Reg. 1904-06 (1976). This approval, GAF argues, indicates that the California plan is \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the federal scheme. Consequently, GAF contends, the Secretary\u2019s approval of the California plan is a tacit admission that the federal regulation does not require medical examinations when asbestos concentrations are less than 1 fiber per cubic centimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">We cannot agree with GAF\u2019s reasoning. In approving the California plan, the Secretary clearly evaluated the plan as a whole, discussing not only limits for various toxins, but enforcement, notice, record-keeping, and sanction requirements as well. 38 Fed. Reg. 10717-20 (1973); 41 Fed.Reg. 1904-06 (1976). The Secretary noted that California would provide more enforcement personnel than the federal program. 38 Fed.Reg. 10718 (1973). Hence, it was reasonable for the Secretary to conclude that the California standards <em>as enforced </em>would be \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the federal standards despite differences in the triggering concentrations of asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">GAF argues finally that, even if the Secretary correctly interpreted the federal regulation, and even if the regulation is consistent with the Act, supported by the evidence and consistent with the California plan, the federal regulation is void because it was improperly promulgated. GAF\u2019s argument is as follows: the Act requires that each proposed regulation be published in the Federal Register to permit public comment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b) (1970). In this case the Secretary published a proposed regulation but then made changes in it before publishing it in final form. GAF argues that the amended rule should first have been published as a new proposed rule, with opportunity for public comment before being promulgated as a final regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>The short answer to this contention is that GAF never raised this objection before the Commission and is therefore precluded from raising it here. The judicial review provision of the Act provides that \u201cno objection that has not been urged before the Commission shall be considered by the court . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (1970). Furthermore, as this court has previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-6\">The requirement of submission of a proposed rule for comment does not automatically generate a new opportunity for comment merely because the rule promulgated by the agency differs from the rule it proposed, partly at least in response to submissions.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-8\"><em>International Harvester Co. v.

We think the same principle governs GAF\u2019s contention in this case, and accordingly we reject GAF\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">In conclusion, we hold that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the disputed regulation is reasonable, and that the regulation is supported by the evidence, consistent with the California plan, and was properly promulgated.

I believe, however, that the Secretary of Labor should clarify the regulation governing medical examinations so as to give other persons subject to the regulation reasonable notice of some <em>measurable quantity </em>of airborne asbestos the Commission intends to trigger the medical examination requirement. Merely to state that all employers must provide medical examinations whenever their employees are exposed to \u201cconcentrations\u201d of asbestos fibers does not provide an ascertainable standard for those who wish to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">The regulation provides that employers must provide medical examinations to each employee \u201cin an occupation exposed to airborne <em>concentrations </em>of asbestos fibers,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1001(j)(2) and (3) (1976) (emphasis added). No person can discern from this language what degree of \u201cconeentration[ ]\u201d must exist before medical examinations are required. Other asbestos exposure regulations which do set ascertainable exposure limits provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">(b) <em>Permissible exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers. </em>(1) <em>Standard effective July 7, 1972. </em>The 8-hour time-weighted average airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers to which any employee may be exposed shall not exceed five fibers, longer than 5 micrometers, per cubic centimeter of air, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">(2) <em>Standard effective July 1, 1976. </em>The 8-hour time-weighted average airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers to which any employee may be exposed shall not exceed two fibers, longer than 5 micrometers, per cubic centimeter of air, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1001(b)(1) and (2) (1976). The prescribed standards in these regulations were: \u201cfive fibers, longer than 5 micrometers, per cubic centimeter of air,\u201d and after July 7, 1976, \u201ctwo fibers.\u201d These standards inform the nation\u2019s employers <em>precisely </em>what degree of exposure is permitted and what exposure is excessive, but the regulation requiring medical examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>tions is almost completely deficient in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">What number of fibers, of what length, per what volume of air will constitute a \u201cconcentration\u201d is nowhere stated or even hinted at \u2014 and like the regulation, the court\u2019s opinion leaves the matter completely to conjecture. This is particularly unsettling to law abiding citizens when the agency is dealing with tremendously minute quantities of infinitesimally small particles. It makes compulsory law enforcement difficult and it lessens the likelihood of voluntary compliance with the law, a result devoutly to be wished. The first requirement for uniform and voluntary compliance with the law is a clear understandable statement of what conduct is required and this regulation falls woefully short of that minimal requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Regulations that have the great importance that this regulation has to human life should be written in more precise .terms \u2014 so people of ordinary understanding can determine what course of conduct is being required of them. What one person might consider to constitute a \u201cconcentration\u201d will differ greatly from the interpretation that another would give to that term; and what one person today might regard <em>not </em>to constitute a concentration\u201d might be considered tomorrow, on the basis of hindsight as medical knowledge increases, to come within that term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The statute requires the Secretary to \u201cset [a] standard\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">(5) The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, <em>shall set the standard </em>which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be J appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated <em>shall </em>be expressed in terms of <em>objective criteria and of the performance desired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5) (1970) (emphasis added). The agency has promulgated standards that state \u201cobjective criteria and . the performance desired\u201d for employee exposure on the job but it has not done as much for medical examinations. It is practical to state \u201cobjective criteria\u201d for medical examinations and I believe the agency should do so. Merely requiring medical examinations whenever there is some indefinite, ambiguous, nonspecific degree of \u201cconcentration\u201d does not meet the requirement for a feasible standard with <em>objective </em>criteria that Congress imposed on the agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is a serious dereliction because, if in the future medical knowledge progresses to the point where more minute quantities of asbestos fibers are found to be harmful than are presently so considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>then employers in the distant future may be held liable to the extent of millions of dollars in tort suits based on their alleged failure to provide the required medical examinations that would have prevented, or discovered at a preventable stage, what eventually turned out to be a fatal disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">In such lawsuits for damages the present ambiguous regulation would have the status of a statute and failure to conform to some more strict <em>post hoc </em>interpretation of its provisions might constitute negligence per se. As Professor Prosser states the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">Once the statute is determined to be applicable \u2014 which is to say, once it is interpreted as designed to protect the class of persons in which the plaintiff is included, against the risk of the type of harm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation \u2014 the great majority of the courts hold that an unexcused violation is conclusive on the issue of negligence, and that the court must so direct the jury. The standard of conduct is taken over by the court from that fixed by the legislature, and \u201cjurors have no dispensing power by which to relax it,\u201d except in so far as the court may recognize the possibility of a valid excuse for disobedience of the law. This usually is expressed by saying that the unexcused violation is negligence \u201cper se,\u201d or in itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">W. Prosser, Torts 200 (4th ed. 1971). When it can be avoided, a statute or regulation should not by its mere indefiniteness expose employers to such great hazards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agency should state in clear, understandable objective terms specifically what degree of \u201cconcentration\u201d triggers the requirement for medical examinations \u2014 be it one fiber per cubic foot of air or one fiber per 100 cubic feet of air, or some other unambiguous, quantitative standard. Imposing a non-specific ambiguous standard is completely unsatisfactory. \u201cConcentration\u201d is a noun, the meaning of which varies greatly depending upon the context in which it is used. Concentration can be high, low, medium, dangerous, hazardous, insignificant, \u201cnegligible,\u201d etc. \u2014 standing alone its meaning is highly indefinite. It would not be difficult to state a standard with precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">A recent case before the Connecticut Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, <em>Tuttle &amp; Bailey Div. of Allied Thermal Corp., </em>No. 76-315 (Conn. OS-AHRC, Dec. 3,1976), involved a state medical examination requirement in language practically identical to that present here, and a similar factual situation. In that case the State Commission decided that the word \u201cconcentration\u201d in the standard must have been intended to have some meaning, because if no threshold of exposure were intended, the word \u201cconcentration\u201d could be omitted without changing the meaning of the section. It would then address itself to \u201cairborne asbestos fibers.\u201d The State Commission reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-10\">If this Commission were to adopt the interpretation as proposed by the Labor Commissioner, the effect would be to establish a requirement \u201c. . . that whenever employees are exposed to any trace of asbestos \u2014 no matter how temporary or insignificant \u2014 their employer must furnish (and employees must undergo) \u2014 annual physical examination and tests as prescribed in [the regulation].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-12\">This Review Commission cannot conclude that the intent of this regulation is to require such examination for the occasional \u201cmessenger\u201d or \u201cvisitor\u201d entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>the exposure area, nor the employee far removed from the source whose exposure is in fact minimis concentration of airborne asbestos fibers. The Review Commission concludes that the word \u201cconcentration\u201d has a meaning as used within the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The Commission also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-6\">One can conceive of very different circumstances wherein employees would be exposed to airborne concentration of asbestos fiber, to varying degrees and for varying periods of time. For an employer to try to determine whether or not medical examination[s] as required by [the regulation] should be provided or not provided under a \u201creasonable man\u201d theory would be most difficult. To attempt to apply a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard in recognizing a hazard of microscopic concentration of asbestos fiber in the air, is not in itself reasonable. <em>Reasonable laymen cannot conceive a rule of conduct in an area where reasonable experts cannot agree.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 6-7 (emphasis added). The Commission therefore concluded that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzP\">unable to determine what [the] threshold [of concentration] is or should be, nor does this Commission accept that a reasonable employer could so determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 7. Finally, it held that until the regulation was redrafted to state its intended meaning in clear understandable terms, the Commission would assume that the 5 fiber standard applied as well to the physical examination provision. The State Commission appeared to recognize that this interpretation was not directly supported by the language of the regulation, but based its holding on the necessity for some understandable meaning. If the instant case were disposed of on a similar rationale, the two-fiber limit presently in force in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1001(b)(2) would also govern the medical examination requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Recently, the Federal Commissioners attempted to distinguish their decision presently under review on the ground that <em>\u201cGAF </em>did not involve the situation . where the concentration of the air contaminant is <em>negligible </em>compared to the <em>limit </em>established by the <em>standard.\u201d Western Electric, Inc., </em>No. 8902, at 7 (OSHRC, Jan. 24, 1977) (emphasis added). What \u201cstandard\u201d the Commission had in contemplation was not disclosed, nor was there any reference to what \u201climit\u201d they were applying. But the reference of the Commission to a <em>\u201cnegligible\u201d </em>amount indicates <em>some quantitative standard </em>was intended. It would be helpful if the Secretary would state what that \u201cstandard\u201d is. That is not a difficult task if he has one in mind. If he does not have one in mind he should have. Maybe the Secretary does not have substantial evidence to prove that the \u201cstandard\u201d of \u201cconcentration\u201d the Commission applying constitutes a \u201chazard,\u201d and that may be the reason the Secretary chose to leave it in an ambiguous state. As it is now, both the Secretary and the Commission are home free leaving the public in the dark as to what degree of \u201cconcentration\u201d is more than \u201cnegligible\u201d according to some unstated \u201cstandard\u201d of \u201cconcentration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Such imprecision should not be countenanced in such an important matter. Nothing would be lost by requiring the agency to state a specific objective standard \u2014 and everybody would benefit. It could be done quickly and there would not be any delay in enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">It is also my opinion that permitting the entire state of California to have a specific standard that is different, and more liberal, from that applied to appellants in this case, and throughout the rest of the nation, is highly questionable. The mere availability of more investigators in California is <em>not </em>a permissible basis for allowing employees to be exposed to more asbestos fibers before a medical examination is required. <em>The number of investigators is not germane to the hazard produced by the added contamination of more asbestos fibers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">The evidentiary record in this case does not in my opinion present a case of sufficient strength to justify setting aside the regulation, but there is every indication that a proper case can be made to achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>such result. I accordingly strongly suggest that the Secretary should amend the regulation to establish the definite workable and understandable \u201cstandard\u201d with \u201cobjective criteria\u201d that the statute requires.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-8\">. A current textbook tells us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-9\">The toxic concentration of asbestos in the air has not been established. However, the threshold limit values for its concentration in air with eight hours\u2019 exposure daily has been accepted as 5 million particles per cubic foot of air, based on impinger samples counted by the light-field technique.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">4 R.

The potential problem of tort liability is particularly serious because of a high background level of asbestos fibers in many geographic areas.
