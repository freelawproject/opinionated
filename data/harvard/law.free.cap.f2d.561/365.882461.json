SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">This is a petition to review two orders of the Federal Communications Commission, each of which requires petitioner MCI Telecommunications Corporation to cease and desist from offering and operating its \u201cEx-ecunet\u201d telephone service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that the Commission has not taken the steps required by the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1970), to restrict the services MCI may offer over its <em>existing </em>facilities, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">MCI Telecommunications Corporation, Microwave Communications, Inc., and N-Triple-C Inc. (hereinafter, collectively, MCI) are affiliated communications common carriers which operate a transcontinental point-to-point microwave system catering to business and data communications markets. In the vernacular of the trade MCI is a \u201cspecialized common carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">The present dispute has its roots in MCI\u2019s September 1974 filing of revisions to its tariffs F.C.C. No. 1 \u2014 the tariff under which MCI furnishes all its interstate services. Those revisions, which became effective October 10, 1974, established rates for a class of \u201cmetered use\u201d services, among which was Execunet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With Execunet a subscriber using any push-button telephone (or rotary dial phone and tone generator) can reach any telephone in a distant city served by MCI simply by dialing a local MCI number followed by an access code and the number in the distant city. Execunet customers are billed for each call on a time and distance basis, subject to a monthly minimum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In the spring of 1975 intervenor AT&amp;T, after subscribing to Execunet and procuring Execunet marketing brochures, complained orally to the Commission that MCI was offering interstate long distance message telephone service (MTS) under the guise of Execunet and that no such service could properly be tariffed by MCI. Apparently AT&amp;T representatives approached individual commissioners and various Commission staff personnel with this complaint and even held a demonstration of Execunet in the Commission\u2019s offices. Subsequent to the <em>ex parte </em>complaints, AT&amp;T filed with the Commission a letter which repeated the allegations previously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The Commission forwarded AT&amp;T\u2019s letter to MCI and indicated that MCI\u2019s \u201ccomments on this matter would be appreciated.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCI wrote a series of letters in return. In the first it took the position that AT&amp;T\u2019s complaint was untimely and should be rejected, but that in any case Execunet was a \u201cprivate line\u201d service which MCI was authorized to offer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By a further letter MCI complained of AT&amp;T\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>\u201clobbying\u201d and asked for an opportunity to present its side of the dispute to the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a third letter MCI pointed out that its licenses were not limited by anything in Section 21.705 of the Commission\u2019s rules<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> pursuant to which point-to-point microwave radio licenses are issued to communications common carriers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It also called the Commission\u2019s attention to AT&amp;T\u2019s comments in Rulemaking Docket 19117,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in which AT&amp;T had taken the position that the Commission had no statutory authority to require prior approval of new services that were to be offered over existing facilities of a domestic carrier, but instead could regulate such services, if at all, only under the tariff provisions of the Communications Act. In MCI\u2019s view, AT&amp;T\u2019s position in Docket 19117<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> denies the authority asserted by the Commission in the instant proceeding on AT&amp;T\u2019s behalf. MCI also pointed out that the report in Docket 19117 states that new service offerings could be proposed by merely filing a tariff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">Without holding a hearing or even disclosing the details of AT&amp;T\u2019s arguments concerning the unlawfulness of Execunet, the Commission on July 2, 1975 wrote a letter to MCI which stated: \u201c[Y]our tariff F.C.C. No. 1 is hereby rejected insofar as it purports to offer Execunet service, but without prejudice to MCI\u2019s offering any other service which you are authorized to provide.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The rationale for this order was explained in the body of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>First, the Commission concluded that MCI could offer only \u201cprivate line\u201d communications services over its existing facilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An0\">In the various Commission orders granting the Section 214 applications of the MCI carriers to construct and operate facilities (e. g., 32 F.C.C.2d 36 (1971), FCC 72-456 (May 26, 1972), FCC 72-832 (September 22,1972), FCC 72-852 (September 29, 1972)), appears language similar to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">The service proposed is essentially private line for the transmission of data, facsimile, control, remote metering, voice and other communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Each grant refers to the paragraph which incorporates the above language as conditioning the grant of construction and operating authority. As a result, MCI is only permitted to operate its facilities for private line services.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Further, in our <em>Second Report </em>on domestic satellites, which followed the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision, we pointed out (35 F.C.C.2d 844, 853 (1972)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9f\">In encouraging multiple entry and the development of competition in the supply of domestic communications, we have maintained a distinction between the so-called monopoly switched telephone services now being furnished by AT&amp;T and all other classes of existing and potential specialized services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">It is thus clear that MCI sought authorization to offer only private line services, and that it was granted authority to offer only such services.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The Commission then rejected MCI\u2019s arguments that Execunet was a private line service like AT&amp;T\u2019s \u201cforeign exchange\u201d (FX) service, deciding instead that \u201cthe combination of * * * similarities\u201d between Execunet and AT&amp;T\u2019s MTS made Execunet \u201cessentially a switched public message telephone service * * <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">MCI immediately filed a petition for review in this court and sought a stay of the Commission\u2019s order, arguing that the Commission had failed to comply with Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> its own rules governing informal complaints,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> its own rules governing <em>ex parte </em>contacts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Sections 204 and 205 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 204-205 (1970), and the Due Process clause. The request for a stay was granted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Subsequently the Commission, which had previously refused to allow MCI any kind of hearing, moved to have the proceedings remanded so that it could consider matters more fully than it had previously. This motion was granted, although jurisdiction was retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">In December 1975 the Commission issued an order commencing the proceedings on remand. <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>57 FCC2d 271 (1975), SA 49.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It announced that comments and reply comments would be accepted and that oral argument or an evidentiary hearing might be held if warranted by the written submissions. The issue to be resolved was said to be \u201cwhether or not Execunet is a service which MCI is authorized to offer pursuant to its facility authorizations and policies set forth by this Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On March 26, 1976 the Commission announced that it would hold oral argument and designated the issues to be addressed at that time. The issues the Commission identified as having been raised by the comments and reply comments were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>a. What class or classes of service is MCI permitted to offer pursuant to its facility authorizations and Commission policies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">b. What changes, if any, were made to the permitted classes of service by our Report and Order in Docket 19117, 39 FCC2d 131 (1973)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">c. Is Execunet service, as presently offered, a private line service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">d. Were any communications between parties to this proceeding and the Commission, as developed by filings herein, in violation of any applicable statute or regulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">e. If any prohibited contacts occurred, what effect have they had on the substance of this proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">f. Whether any further proceedings are required to comport with the requirements of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\"><em>MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>58 FCC2d 962, 963 (1976), SA 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Prior to oral argument the Commission issued yet a third order responding to procedural motions made by MCI at various points during the comment period. <em>MCI Telecommunications </em>Corp.,-FCC2d-(FCC 76-441, May 17, 1976), SA 892. In this order the Commission rephrased the primary issue before it as \u201cwhether MCI\u2019s facility authorizations and Commission policies restrict in any way the broad categories of service which MCI may offer.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It also stated that the proceedings would not be expanded to include consideration of \u201cwhether it is in the public interest for MCI to offer Execunet regardless of whether it is within the class of services it may offer.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, the Commission for the first time mentioned the statutory authority for its actions: \u201cth[is] proceeding is an investigation into the lawfulness of MCI\u2019s Execunet service offering, conducted pursuant to Sections 4(i), 4(j), 201, 204, 205, 208 and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), 154(j), 201, 204, 205, 208 and 403.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">After oral argument the Commission issued an extensive opinion, again finding that MCI was not authorized to offer Exe-cunet. <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>60 FCC2d 25 (1976). The approach taken in that opinion is materially different from that taken in the July 1975 letter order, however. Whereas the letter order had relied on express restrictions written into MCI\u2019s facilities authorizations (the certificates of public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to Section 214(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214(a) (1970)),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the opinion on remand stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acs\">As MCI points out, however, not all of its authorizations contain similar language [/. <em>e., </em>restrictions], some contain no such restrictions, and thus it is necessary to look further, to our expressed policies and to judicial statements, to ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>limits on [specialized common carrier] services.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Commission\u2019s \u201cfurther look\u201d began with a review of the seminal <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> pursuant to which most specialized carrier facilities authorizations have been issued. The purpose of that decision was to facilitate the Commission\u2019s handling of Section 214 applications by determining by rulemaking \u201c[w]hether as a general policy the public interest would be served by permitting the entry of new carriers in the specialized communications field * * * \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While the Commission apparently concedes that it did not define the boundaries of the \u201cspecialized communications field,\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it asserts that the services to be offered over the facilities covered in some 1,700 Section 214 applications before it provided a touchstone for its analysis and that all such services were \u201cprivate line.\u201d Accordingly, it is the Commission\u2019s position that it did not consider services other than private line services in determining the public interest ramifications of competition.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As an example of this the Commission points to its analysis of \u201ccream-skimming,\u201d the argument that specialized carriers will upset the established rates of general carriers (such as AT&amp;T) by siphoning off high-profit business.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s interpretation here of its discussion of cream-skimming in <em>Specialized Carriers </em>is that it found allegations of cream-skimming to be unfounded only because the specialized carriers were not proposing to compete \u201cto any substantial degree\u201d with AT&amp;T\u2019s monopoly service offerings, MTS and WATS<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">Having concluded that the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision makes no reference to competition in other than private line areas, the Commission turned next to MCI\u2019s allegations concerning the meaning of the Commission\u2019s Rule 21.705, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.705 (1976), and its orders in Docket 19117.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Rule 21.705 governs the scope of licenses granted carriers in the point-to-point microwave service. Its operative language is that a carrier may offer any service \u201cprovided for in the <em>legally applicable tariffs </em>of the carrier, unless otherwise directed in the applicable instrument of authorization * * * \u201d (emphasis added). MCI, focusing on the second phrase, had argued that the absence of any directions in its instruments of authorization indicated that it was free to offer by tariff <em>any </em>communications service that could physically be provided on its existing system. The Commission, on the other hand, took the position that the italicized language is the key and that tariffs exceeding the bounds of the <em>Specialized Carrier </em>decision can never become \u201clegally applicable.\u201d Thus in the Commission\u2019s view Rule 21.705 merely \u201cexpresses the truism that a carrier need not generally file an application [under Section 214] for each new service it wishes to offer, [and therefore] it cannot be used to reverse a clearly defined Commission policy.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aob-dedup-0\">The Commission takes a similarly narrow view of the effect of its <em>Report and Order </em>in Docket 19117. That docket was started to consider whether domestic carriers should be required to get Commission approval before filing tariffs proposing services not previously provided or set out in a Section 214 application.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The purpose of the proposed rules was threefold: to decide the public interest ramifications of a service before it was commenced, thereby protecting the public from service disruptions that might be caused if the service were allowed to go into effect and later enjoined; to put general domestic carriers (such as AT&amp;T and Western Union), which could theretofore start a new service simply by filing a tariff, on an equal footing with international' and domestic miscellaneous carriers whose facilities authorizations were always restricted so that new services required further Section 214(a) proceedings; and to protect entrants to the specialized carrier field who also needed prior approval of entry under Section 214(a) from unfair competition from the generalized carriers.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The proposed rules were never adopted, and restrictions in facilities authorizations which had worked a result similar to the proposed rules were expressly declared \u201cnull and void\u201d in the order terminating the docket.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">MCI argued before the Commission that the result of Docket 19117 was that any express restrictions in its facilities authorizations were lifted and that it should be free as a result of the order terminating the docket to propose new services simply by filing a tariff, even if it was not free before. The Commission\u2019s response was that Docket 19117 was not concerned with competition except in the specialized carrier field \u2014 the only field in which competition was allowed at the time of the <em>Report and Order </em>in that docket.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus the Commission\u2019s view apparently is that existing specialized carriers are allowed to offer private line services free of any prior approval requirement as a result of Docket 19117, but are required to proceed by Section 214 application with respect to all other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">In the remainder of the opinion below the Commission again concluded that Execunet was not a private line service.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It also concluded that no facts were in dispute which required an evidentiary hearing and denied MCI\u2019s motion for one.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Commission for a second time refused to consider whether Execunet should be permitted regardless of the scope of the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision, and further indicated that it had intended to confer on AT&amp;T a monopoly over MTS and WATS by its ruling in <em>Specialized Carriers, </em>a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that could not be changed absent a demonstration of changed circumstances.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Finally, the Commission refused to inquire further into the <em>ex parte </em>contact problem on the ground that all such contacts had occurred before commencement of formal proceedings and were, therefore, proper under both court and Commission rulings.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On this petition for review MCI has challenged virtually every ruling of the Commission in the proceeding on remand and has renewed its attack on the July 1975 letter order.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">II. ANALYSIS A.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The implicit restrictions argument advanced by the Commission in its opinion on remand represents a substantial departure from prior administrative practice. As the Commission\u2019s letter order suggests, the usual way in which a carrier becomes restricted in the services it may offer is for the Commission to write restrictions into the facilities authorizations that must be obtained pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act before any communications line may be built, operated, or extended.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Accordingly, a carrier can usually tell if it is subject to service restrictions simply by examining the instruments of authorization issued to it by the Commission. Section 21.705 of the Commission\u2019s rules, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.705 (1976), which governs the manner in which point-to-point microwave radio licenses can be used by specialized carriers such as MCI, similarly recognizes that the usual place to find restrictions on services is in the \u201capplicable instrument of authorization.\u201d <em>See also </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(h)(1) (1970) (which indicates that restrictions will usually be found in the license instrument); 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.903(b) (1976) (instrument of authorization controls in part services that may be offered on a multi-point distribution system).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">The Commission\u2019s discussion of its administrative practice in Docket 19117 is also instructive. There the Commission explained that in the absence of restrictions imposed under Section 214 in the facilities authorizations, carriers could offer any service which could physically be provided over their existing systems simply by filing a tariff.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This discussion clearly indicates that the Commission\u2019s understanding of Section 214 of the Act has until now been that explicit action is necessary to restrict a carrier to the service offerings it proposed when it sought authority to build, operate, or extend its communications lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Finally, as evidenced by the decision in <em>Press Wireless, Inc,, </em>25 FCC 1466 (1958), <em>aff\u2019d, sub nom, Press Wireless, Inc. v. FCC, </em>264 F.2d 372 (D.C. Cir. 1959) <em>(per curiam), </em>the Commission has from time to time exercised its express authority under Section 303(b) of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (1970), to \u201c[prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed stations and each station within any class\u201d by promulgating rules setting out limitations on services to be offered over radio facilities. <em>See, e. g., </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.509, 21.606, 21.903 (1976). In this regard it is instructive to note that the Commission has <em>not </em>enacted any comparable service restrictions for point-to-point microwave licensees and in particular it has <em>not </em>made the definition of \u201cprivate line service\u201d set out in 47 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u00a7 21.2 (1976) applicable to such licenses, although this would certainly seem to be the natural thing to have done had the Commission sought to restrict specialized carriers to private line service offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The fact that an administrative practice is novel does not, of course, mean that it is wrong. However, novelty is a warning signal that all may not be well, especially in the instant case in which the Commission has itself failed to discuss the statutory warrant for the new course it has adopted. When the Communications Act is considered in detail, it becomes apparent that novelty has led to error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"> To frame our analysis, we sketch at the outset some principles which are either uncontested or uncontestable. First, it is settled that \u201ca tariff [may] be rejected if it is unlawful without prior agency approval and approval has not been obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\"><em>Associated Press v. FCC, </em>145 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 448 F.2d 1095, 1103 (1971); <em>accord, Press Wireless, Inc. v. FCC, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet the power to require prior agency approval is itself circumscribed, for it is well recognized that the tariff provisions of the Communications Act (Sections 203-205, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203-205),<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> like the cognate sections of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15(1), 15(7) (1970)),<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> embody a considered legislative judgment that carriers should in general be free to initiate and <em>implement </em>new rates or services over existing communications lines unless and until the Commission, after hearing, determines that such rates or practices are unlawful, subject only to a limited period of suspension set out in the statute. <em>AT&amp;T v. FCC, </em>487 F.2d 865, 870-881 (2d Cir. 1973); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 697, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973) (interpreting Interstate Commerce Act); <em>Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R.

A balance was achieved after a careful compromise. The Commission is not free to circumvent or ignore that balance. Nor may the Commission in effect rewrite this statutory scheme on the basis of its own conception of the equities ' of a particular situation.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The Second Circuit, moreover, rejected the Commission\u2019s argument that the general grants of procedural authority in Sections 4(i), 4(j), and 403 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), 154(j), 403 (1970), empowered the Commission to erect prior approval requirements like that imposed on AT&amp;T, although it recognized that the Commission would have the power to reject a tariff whenever a section of the Act expressly establishes or authorizes <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> a prior approval requirement.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Applying these principles to the instant case, the issues to be resolved are two: whether and to what extent Section 214 of the Communications Act expressly authorizes the Commission to impose prior approval requirements through the facilities authorization mechanism, and whether the Commission has properly exercised whatever authority it may have under Section 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Section 214 establishes the Commission\u2019s regulatory charter over entry into the common carrier communications field and states that no carrier shall construct, extend, or acquire a line unless the Commission has first affirmatively determined that such entry would be in the public interest,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The primary purpose of Section 214(a) is prevention of unnecessary duplication of <em>facilities, </em>not regulation of services.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Because of this, Section 214 would appear to have a limited office with respect to regulation of service offerings on existing lines. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>We have held as much,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and this view is confirmed by the final proviso to Section 214(a) which states expressly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGt\">nothing in this section [214] shall be construed to require a certificate or other authorization from the Commission for any * * * changes in plant, <em>operation, </em>or equipment, <em>other than new construction, </em>which will not impair the adequacy or quality of service provided!<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Moreover, we do not agree with the suggestion of Commission counsel in brief<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> that Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion in <em>Hawaiian Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 498 F.2d 771 (1974), somehow transmogrifies Section 214(a) so that carriers must now obtain Commission approval before they implement new services.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In <em>Hawaiian Telephone </em>this court reversed a grant of Section 214 authority to RCA Global Communications, Inc. on the ground that the Commission was allowing competition merely for competition\u2019s sake in direct violation of the teaching of the Supreme Court in <em>FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., </em>346 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953). In stating the proper standard to be applied under Section 214(a) Judge Wilkey wrote: \u201cWhen the FCC considers an application for certification of a new line, it must start from the situation as it then exists, and must * * * determine whether indeed the public convenience and necessity requires more or better <em>service.\u201d </em>498 F.2d at 776 (emphasis added). We do not read this statement to suggest that every time a carrier seeks to start a new service over existing facilities it must petition the Commission under Section 214(a), but rather it is merely a matter of fact observation that it is analytically impossible to determine the need for a new facility without considering the services to be provided over it. In addition, the reading suggested by the Commission would nullify the final proviso of Section 214(a) by requiring a \u201ccertificate [and] other authorization from the Commission\u201d prior to changes in carriers\u2019 operations even if such changes did not affect the \u201cadequacy or quality\u201d of the carriers\u2019 preexisting services. There is no indication that the <em>Hawaiian Telephone </em>court contemplated such a remarkable result. Nor, indeed, can such a result be justified by reference to the primary purpose of Section 214 because, so long as the \u201cadequacy or quality\u201d of the service proposed in a Section 214(a) application is not impaired by provision of other services, the public need that justified construction of facilities will still be met and there is no sense in which those facilities would have become needlessly du-plicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Notwithstanding the proviso to Section 214(a), Section 214(c) gives the Commission authority to<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>issue such certificate [facility authorization] as applied for * * * or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions <em>as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. * </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avr\">(Emphasis added.) Used to condition the services an individual carrier may offer, Section 214(c) would provide a power over individual carriers in all respects identical to its power over classes of carriers under Section 303(b), which was held in <em>Press Wireless, Inc. v. FCC, supra, </em>to give the Commission authority to create a prior approval requirement. For this reason Section 214(c) does, in our judgment, authorize the Commission to restrict the services that may be offered over a communication line once it is built, acquired, or extended. <em>Cf. Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>541 F.2d 346, 355 (3d Cir. 1976). However, since any prior approval requirement is in derogation of the legislative compromise embodied in Sections 203-205, the Commission must strictly follow the terms of Section 214(c) and it cannot impose any such restriction unless it has affirmatively determined that \u201cthe public convenience and necessity [so] require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">With the framework of our inquiry in mind, we turn next to the question whether the Commission was correct in concluding that the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision was a lawful exercise of Section 214(c) authority. As we understand the Commission\u2019s opinion on remand, there are two considerations supporting its view that the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision restricted the services specialized carriers can offer \u2014 first, the fact that only private line services were before the Commission in Section 214 applications<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and, second, that the Commission\u2019s analysis of cream-skimming assumed that specialized carriers would be restricted to private line services.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We consider these in turn.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>We ca-n assume, without deciding, that a service like Execunet was not within the contemplation of the Commission when it made the <em>Specialized Carrier </em>decision. Nonetheless, it is readily apparent that failure to consider the public interest ramifications of a service \u2014 either pro or con \u2014 during resolution of a Section 214(a) application is simply not the same thing as an affirmative determination that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity may require\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> a restriction on a facility authorization limiting a carrier to provision solely of those services proposed in its Section 214(a) application.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The Commission\u2019s analysis of cream-skimming in the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision similarly gives no evidence that the Commission made an affirmative finding that revenue diversion would be a problem if specialized carriers were allowed to compete on the fringes of the message telephone service market as MCI allegedly proposes to do. No such issue was before the Commission in that proceeding. As it has repeatedly asserted here, all it had to consider was whether the competition proposed in the Section 214 applications before it raised serious revenue diversion problems threatening the public interest. This is all it apparently did decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">[W]e do not see how there could be any diversion of revenues of a magnitude to have the impact claimed by AT&amp;T, in view of the very small percentage of AT&amp;T\u2019s existing total market that is vulnerable to competition of the kind proposed here, the growth rate of Bell\u2019s basic services, and the likelihood that AT&amp;T would obtain a very substantial share of the potential market for specialized services.l<footnotemark>61</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Moreover, the Commission\u2019s staff report, which formed the basis for the <em>Specialized Carrier </em>decision, ruminated more broadly on the issues posed by revenue diversion and it appeared highly skeptical of the validity of AT&amp;T\u2019s overall argument.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Thus there is simply nothing in <em>Specialized Carriers </em>that would support a conclusion that revenue diversion required restrictions on MCI\u2019s facility authorizations.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Finally, it should also be noted that the Commission staff, in its report adopted by the Commission,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> dealt explicitly with the question of how the Commission ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>deal with possible adverse impacts of service offerings other than those which were before the Commission in the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">In the event that adverse consequences to the public should develop, the Commission can take such action <em>on the relevant tariff filings </em>as may be necessary to protect the public. We think that in the context of the matters now before the Commission involving proposed new and different services, <em>a question of this nature is more appropriately considered in connection with the tariffs rather than upon authorization of the </em>facilities.[<footnotemark>65</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">And, again, the staff wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">The results of any authorizations would be the object of close and continuous scrutiny by the Commission. Should adverse consequences develop or appear imminent, the Commission can take such remedial action or precautionary measures as may be necessary to protect the public. <em>As indicated, appropriate action can be taken in connection with the tariffs. </em>In addition, any renewal of license for the proposed facilities would require a public interest finding and could be subject to any needed conditions. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s broad rule making powers are always available. * * *[<footnotemark>66</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The undeniable import of the staff\u2019s analysis is that questions related to the future impact of specialized carrier service offerings other than those immediately at hand in the <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>case should be resolved in other proceedings \u2014 in tariff proceedings, upon license renewal, or by further rulemaking. Strikingly absent from this list is a mention of further Section 214 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">For the reasons stated above the Commission\u2019s <em>Specialized Common Carrier </em>decision cannot reasonably be read to have made an affirmative determination that the public convenience and necessity required \u201cprivate line\u201d restrictions on the facilities authorizations of specialized common carriers.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Instead, it appears that the Commission saw benefits accruing to the public from the services which were before it. In granting the facilities authorizations on the basis of that public interest finding, the Commission did not perhaps intend to open the field of common carrier communications generally, but its constant stress on the fact that specialized carriers would provide new, innovative, and hitherto unheard-of communications services clearly indicates that it had no very clear idea of precisely how far or to what services the field should be opened.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> As indicated in the staff report, a decision was apparently made to consider the consequences of future developments in appropriate future proceedings. There being no affirmative determination of public interest need for restrictions, MCI\u2019s facility authorizations are not restricted and therefore its tariff applications could not properly be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">As a final and somewhat collateral point, we are concerned with a thread running through the Commission\u2019s analysis\u2014 that the <em>Specialized Carrier </em>decision granted AT&amp;T a <em>de jure </em>monopoly over MTS and WATS service which would be undermined were MCI allowed to provide Execunet\u2014 because any such assertion is plainly incorrect and may have influenced the Commission\u2019s disposition of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>As the Commission staff explained in <em>Specialized Carriers, </em>absence of competition in the \u201cgeneral domestic common carrier service field * * * is due primarily to the fact that until the filing of [MCI\u2019s first Section 214 applications] the Commission had no occasion to consider applications for competitive service in this area.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The question whether AT&amp;T should be granted a <em>de jure </em>monopoly was not among those proposed to be decided in <em>Specialized Carriers, </em>and nowhere in that decision can justification be found for continuing or propagating a monopoly that, according to the staff, had theretofore just grown like Topsy. Of course, there may be very good reasons for according AT&amp;T <em>de jure </em>freedom from competition in certain fields; however, one such reason is not simply that AT&amp;T got there first. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s attempt here to imbue AT&amp;T\u2019s existence with public interest significance represents a retrenchment from the position it took in passing on a proposal to enter the MTS field via domestic communications satellites: \u201c[W]e should not reject any proposal that might prove feasible and beneficial to the public simply because it represents some departure from the established scheme.\u201d <em>Domestic Communications-Satellite Facilities, </em>35 FCC2d 844, 854 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Because the Commission has not so far determined that the public interest would be served by creating an AT&amp;T monopoly in the interstate MTS field, it may not properly draw any inferences about the public interest from the bare fact that another carrier\u2019s proposed services would compete in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">We have today decided that the Commission erred in rejecting MCI\u2019s Execunet tariff as unauthorized. The Commission has no general authority to insist that carriers receive its approval before filing tariffs proposing new services or rates. Only if the Commission has determined that the public convenience and necessity may require that new services receive advance approval can it then reject a tariff as unauthorized. In so holding we have not had to consider, and have not considered, whether competition like that posed by Execunet is in the public interest. That will be the question for the Commission to decide should it elect to continue these proceedings. In that eventuality the Commission must be ever mindful that, just as it is not free to create competition for competition\u2019s sake,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> it is not free to propagate monopoly for monopoly\u2019s sake. The ultimate test of industry structure in the communications common carrier field must be the public interest, not the private financial interests of those who have until now enjoyed the fruits of <em>de facto </em>monopoly<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\">.

Putting these modular services together in a particular way results in the Execunet service package. The term \u201cmetered use\u201d refers to the fact that charges for some services are set on a usage basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-16\">. Execunet\u2019s characteristics are summarized as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-17\">A customer in the calling city calls the local MCI office via local exchange telephone service from any push-button telephone in the local exchange area. A rotary-dial telephone can also be used if the caller has a touch-tone pad (tone generator). This device can be purchased in the open market from numerous sources. He then pulses his customer code and the area code and calling number of any telephone in one of a number of distant cities. Connection at the distant end may again be accomplished via the local exchange telephone service in that area. Upon connection, the customer is charged a per-minute toll, based upon the mileage to the city called, subject to a connection charge and a monthly minimum charge. Any MCI Execu-net customer in the calling city can access the system at any time to place a call, and presumably many such customers may utilize the intercity facilities simultaneously. In other words, none of the MCI plant, or indeed any of the plant used in completing the call, is dedicated to the use of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>customer during any specified time; rather it is available upon demand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>MCI Telecommunications Corp., supra </em>note 1, 60 FCC2d at 26 n.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">.

We need not decide whether this is so since, as this case comes to us after remand, no facts material to the issues thus far decided by the Commission are in dispute and, accordingly, the Commission could, as it apparently did, issue a cease and desist order pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 (1970) without more of a hearing than has already been afforded MCI. Thus, even if the Commission was without power to reject a tariff as that phrase is used as a term of art, it was empowered to reject the Execunet tariff in a practical sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. Under the Communications Act the practices of <em>existing </em>carriers using <em>existing </em>facilities are regulated primarily through the tariff mechanism established in \u00a7\u00a7 203-205 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203-205 (1970). Section 203 obliges carriers to file tariff schedules with the Commission and to make such schedules available to the public. Section 203(b) expressly recognizes that changes in the services a carrier may offer will be commenced with a tariff filing. Operation except in strict compliance with applicable tariffs is prohibited, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(c), as are discriminations and preferences, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 202. Prior to the effective date of a tariff \u2014 a date certain that must be set out in the tariff, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 203(d) \u2014 the Commission may suspend the tariff and hold a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 204. If the hearing has not been completed within three months (five months as of 1976, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 204 (1977 pocket part)) after the effective date of the suspended tariff, that tariff by law goes into effect. <em>Id. </em>After the effective date, and without regard to whether a tariff has previously been suspended, the Commission may hold a hearing on the lawfulness of the tariff, although the tariff must be allowed to remain in effect pending the outcome of such a hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 205; <em>see AT&amp;T v.

Since the most likely objection to MCI\u2019s provision of Execunet service is its potential effect on AT&amp;T\u2019s MTS, it is useful to note that the Supreme Court, in <em>Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R. Co., </em>372 U.S. 658, 669, 83 S.Ct. 984, 990, 10 L.Ed.2d 52 (1963), rejected the claim that a court should have the power to extend the statutory suspension period to protect competitors of a carrier and their customers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">It must be admitted that Congress dealt with the problem as it affected the relations between shippers and carriers, making no express reference to the interests of competing carriers and their customers such as are involved in this case.

The Commission offered two other considerations in support of its interpretation of <em>Specialized Common Carrier Services, supra </em>note 26. First, it concluded that specialized carriers would not duplicate services already being offered, whereas in the Commission\u2019s view Exe-cunet would duplicate MTS. We fail to see the relevance of this assertion in light of <em>AT&amp;T v. FCC, supra </em>note 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">The Commission also pointed to statements made by the Ninth and Third Circuits in, respectively, <em>Washington Utilities &amp; Transportation Comm\u2019n v. FCC, supra </em>note 26, and <em>Bell Telephone Co. v. FCC, supra </em>note 26. In <em>Washington Utilities, </em>however, the scope of the services authorized in <em>Specialized Carriers </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>not at issue; the reference is simply a general description of the services proposed in the applications before the Commission. The <em>Bell Telephone </em>case involved a very different issue, namely, whether- the Commission had affirmatively determined that it would be in the public interest to require AT&amp;T to interconnect with MCI for the purpose of allowing MCI to offer FX and CCSA service. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a) (1970). The Commission\u2019s view was that <em>Specialized Carriers </em>had settled the point, whereas AT&amp;T argued that, since MCI had never mentioned FX and CCSA services in its \u00a7 214(a) applications, MCI\u2019s provision of those services had not been approved even if some other carriers\u2019 might have been. The Third Circuit held that the Commission in <em>Specialized Carriers </em>had made an affirmative determination that interconnection for provision of private line services was a general matter in the public interest and that MCI was covered by this general determination. <em>Bell Telephone </em>therefore stands for the proposition that the Commission in <em>Specialized Carriers </em>decided at least that specialized carriers could provide all private line services. However, one cannot reason from this proposition to its converse \u2014 that specialized carriers may offer only private line services \u2014 yet the converse is the issue relevant under \u00a7 214(c) as we explain in text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214(c) (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b436-12\">. <em>Specialized Common Carrier Services, supra </em>note 26, 29 FCC2d at 910.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\">. <em>See id. </em>at 883-884.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b436-14\">.
