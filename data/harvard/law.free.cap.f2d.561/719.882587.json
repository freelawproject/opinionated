App. \u00a7 462(a) by hindering or interfering with the administration of the Selective Service System.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was tried, convicted by a jury and sentenced to five years in prison. On appeal to this Court, his conviction was upheld. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Turchick, </em>451 F.2d 333 (8th Cir. 1971). Turchick began serving his sentence on November 30, 1971, and was released on parole in July, 1973. In May, 1976, Turchick filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He argued that \u00a7 462(a) is unconstitutional on its face and was unconstitutionally applied in obtaining his conviction. By order filed on June 11, 1976, the District Court denied relief on the ground that the jury could not have based its verdict upon any statements or actions protected by the Constitution. Turchick now appeals the denial of his claim that the challenged section is unconstitutional on its face. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The principal issue raised by Turchick\u2019s petition is whether \u00a7 462(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad in its proscription of expressive activity. A statute is overbroad in constitutional terms if it comprehends a substantial range of applications to activity protected by the First Amendment, in addition to the unprotected activities it legitimately prohibits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The aim of facial over-breadth analysis<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is to eliminate the deterrent or \u201cchilling\u201d effect an overbroad law may have on those contemplating conduct protected by the First Amendment. Removing this disincentive to expressive activity is undertaken primarily for the benefit of persons not before the court. For this reason, courts applying the facial over-breadth doctrine have traditionally been unconcerned with whether the activities of the overbreadth claimant fall within the statute\u2019s lawful scope.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">I. The Impact of <em>Broadrick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Before addressing the substance of Turchick\u2019s overbreadth claim, we must consider the issue of standing and its relationship to the merits of his case. Viewed conceptually, Turchick\u2019s petition raises a standing issue in addition to his over-breadth claim. Recent Supreme Court decisions suggest that it is difficult to consider the two issues separately because the standing of an overbreadth claimant cannot be determined without some reference to the merits of the case. <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). <em>See also Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974); <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972) (Burger, J., dissenting); Note, <em>Overbreadth Review and The Burger Court, </em>49 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 532, 533-543 (1974) [hereinafter cited as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Burger], </em>In <em>Broadrick, </em>the Court held that an overbreadth claimant will be denied standing unless he can show that the provision which he challenges is \u201csubstantially overbroad.\u201d <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908. <em>See Burger, supra </em>at 539; Note, <em>The Supreme Court, 1972 Term, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 150 (1973). To comply with the dictates of <em>Broadrick, </em>we must consider the extent of a challenged statute\u2019s overbreadth during our standing analysis. Although all questions of standing inevitably require some prejudgment of the merits, <em>Barlow v. Collins, </em>397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970) (Brennan and White, JJ., concurring in the result and dissenting); <em>see also Data Processing Service v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), it is clear that the <em>Broa-drick </em>Court fully considered the merits of the overbreadth contention. <em>See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra </em>413 U.S. at 615-618, 93 S.Ct. 2908.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">While some characterize <em>Broadrick </em>as a standing case, Note, <em>The Supreme Court, 1972 Term, supra, </em>others regard it as focusing on the merits of the overbreadth claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Burger, supra </em>at 540-550. In our view, characterization is unimportant. The standing and merit issues are so interrelated under the <em>Broadrick </em>test that no real purpose is served by attempting to analyze them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">II. The Overbreadth Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The <em>Broadrick </em>decision implies that a finding of <em>substantial </em>overbreadth is necessary only when the challenged statute regulates conduct and not speech.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the statute challenged by Turchick clearly regulates conduct, the <em>Broadrick </em>test of substantial overbreadth is appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Before considering the extent of the statute\u2019s overbreadth, we must review a decision of the Seventh Circuit addressing the same issue. In <em>United States v. Baranski, </em>484 F.2d 556 (7th Cir. 1973), the Court declared the challenged clause of \u00a7 462(a) unconstitutional on its face. <em>Id. </em>at 570. It construed the statute as proscribing \u201cthe use of <em>any means whatsoever </em>to accomplish the hindrance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 (emphasis included). We question this holding for several reasons: First, although the case was decided after <em>Broadrick, </em>there is no reference to the \u201csubstantiality\u201d standard and no express finding that \u00a7 462(a) was substantially overbroad. Second, the legislative history on which the <em>Baranski </em>decision depends is, in our view, inconclusive at best. There is only one line of committee testimony dealing with the language in \u00a7 462(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>which <em>Baranski </em>found unconstitutional. That sentence reads, \u201cCertain changes of language have been made to <em>incorporate </em>judicial <em>determinations </em>made pursuant to the predecessor act.\u201d [Emphasis added.] <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1268, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1948), U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1948, pp. 1989, 2008. Between the date of the statute\u2019s enactment in 1940 and its subsequent amendment in 1948, only two cases applied the challenged provision of \u00a7 462(a). One of them, <em>Bagley v. United States, </em>136 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1943), protected a draft resister\u2019s right to speak out against the war. The other, <em>Helton v. United States, </em>143 F.2d 933 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 U.S. 765, 65 S.Ct. 118, 89 L.Ed. 612 (1944), upheld the conviction of a draftee who assaulted an examining physician at a time and location distant from the place where the examination was held. The <em>Baranski </em>Court concluded that because the <em>Helton </em>decision involved \u201cforce or violence,\u201d Congress did not intend to incorporate it. Rather, Judge Pell held that the amended language was aimed at the <em>Bagley </em>decision and that the quoted legislative history established that Congress intended to reverse that decision to prohibit such speech. This interpretation of the legislative history ignores several facts. The quoted sentence speaks of incorporating certain judicial determinations. In our view, the term \u201cincorporate\u201d connotes approval of a particular ease, not an intent to reverse or reject its holding. We doubt that Congress would indicate its rejection of the <em>Bagley </em>decision by claiming to incorporate it. Moreover, the legislative history refers to judicial \u201cdeterminations,\u201d but the <em>Baranski </em>Court concluded that Congress was referring to only one determination. Finally, it is quite possible that the statutory language was amended to incorporate the <em>Helton </em>decision and that Congress also approved of the <em>Bagley </em>case, but felt it unnecessary to amend the statute to register this approval. Since <em>Bagley </em>upheld the speech rights of a registrant, Congress might well have concluded that \u00a7 462(a) was never intended to cover speech and that no amendment was needed. Rather, use of the term \u201cincorporate\u201d in the legislative history would adequately convey Congress\u2019s approval of the <em>Bagley </em>decision. In this interpretation, the amended language was added to reflect the <em>Helton </em>case. The assault in <em>Helton </em>occurred some distance from the Selective Service headquarters and did not take place during a formal physical examination. It related to the draft system only in that the dispute causing the assault arose over the results of a preinduction examination. The <em>Helton </em>decision strained the language of \u00a7 462(a) to find an interference with the administration of the draft system. By appending the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language, Congress might have been both registering its approval of <em>Helton </em>and broadening the statutory language to clearly include such situations. This interpretation of congressional intent is more consistent with the terms used in the quoted legislative history because it does, in fact, incorporate or approve both determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">We do not, however, regard our interpretation of the pertinent legislative history as dispositive of the overbreadth claim. Either interpretation is plausible, but both are based on scant evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and rather fine distinctions in word choice and meaning. The importance of the issue presented and the potential impact of our determination cautions against relying on ambiguous legislative history to support a finding of constitutional invalidity. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine: A Comparison of Dellinger and Baranski, </em>65 J.Crim.L. 194, 198 (1974). We are aware of the general principle that courts should construe statutes to avoid a finding of unconstitutionality, <em>Scales v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 203, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961); <em>United States v. Har-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>riss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), and that this principle presumes a legislative intent to act only within constitutional bounds. <em>United States v. C.I.O., </em>335 U.S. 106, 120, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948); cf. Note, <em>Supreme Court Interpretation of Statutes to Avoid Constitutional Decisions, </em>53 Colum.L.Rev. 633 (1953). However, the preferred position of the First Amendment greatly weakens this presumption, <em>United States v. Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340, 356 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973); McKay, <em>The Preference for Freedom, </em>N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1182 (1959); Cahn, <em>The Firstness of the First Amendment, </em>65 Yale L.J. 464 (1956), and, in any case, we need not rely on it or a saving construction because we believe the language of the statute is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">For analytical purposes, the challenged provision is separable into two component parts: The first describes the effect prohibited by the statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the second sets forth the prohibited means for accomplishing the unlawful objective.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Viewed individually, the parts restrict activity and not the written word, oral expression or other inactive forms of communication protected by the First Amendment. Turning first to the prohibited effect portion, since the statute provides no definition, we look to the word\u2019s common or ordinary meaning. Webster\u2019s 3rd International Dictionary defines the verb to hinder as \u201cto make slow or difficult the course or progress of: to keep from occurring, starting, or continuing: hold back, prevent, check.\u201d To interfere is defined as \u201cto come in collision: to be in opposition: to run at cross purposes: to run into another or each other.\u201d In general, the connotation of both definitions is that the obstruction will be accomplished by an action of some sort. Taken ip context, they imply an active hindering or physical interference with the administration of the Selective Service System. <em>Cf. United States v. Mechanic, </em>454 F.2d 849 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 929, 92 S.Ct. 1765, 32 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972). The focus is on action and not pure speech or other inactive forms of expression. In our view, the use of these words is strong evidence that Congress did not intend to proscribe the oral or written word.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Our conclusion that the words \u201chinder\u201d or \u201cinterfere\u201d imply action does not end the inquiry. Many actions involve expressive and nonexpressive elements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Forms of conduct that express ideas without significantly interfering with legitimate state interests are privileged under the First Amendment. We must still consider whether the provision comprehends a substantial number of applications to privileged conduct. Taken alone, the words \u201chinder\u201d or \u201cinterfere\u201d might reach forms of conduct traditionally protected by the First Amendment, such as the distribution of handbills, <em>Jamison v. Texas, </em>318 U.S. 413, 63 S.Ct. 669, 87 L.Ed. 869 (1943); <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Irvington, </em>308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939); <em>Hague v. C.I.O., </em>307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939); <em>Lovell v. City of Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938), picketing, <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); <em>Amalgamated Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, </em>391 U.S. 308, 88 S.Ct. 1601, 20 L.Ed.2d 603 (1968); <em>A.F.L. v. Swing, </em>312 U.S. 321, 61 S.Ct. 568, 85 L.Ed. 855 (1941); <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940), the use of loudspeakers, <em>Saia v. New York, </em>334 U.S. 558, 68 S.Ct. 1148, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948), and peaceful assembly and petition, <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>471 (1965); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963); <em>Taylor v. Louisiana, </em>370 U.S. 154, 82 S.Ct. 1188, 8 L.Ed.2d 395 (1962); <em>Garner v. Louisiana, </em>368 U.S. 157, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961). Without more, we would be forced to hold the challenged provision substantially overbroad. But these words must be read in conjunction with the prohibited means portion of the section. When so read, it is clear that Congress did not intend to restrict privileged forms of expressive conduct. In the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 885, the provision that was amended to form the present \u00a7 462(a) read \u201c[to] hinder or interfere * * by force or violence * * * The phrase \u201cby force or violence\u201d limits the type of hindrances or interferences which the statute proscribes. We think this phrase is restrictive and evidences a congressional intent to proscribe a particular type of harm or threat to the draft system: e. <em>g., </em>forcible entry into draft offices, the destruction of draft files or equipment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The \u201cor otherwise\u201d language was added to the statute in 1948; the purpose of the amendment is not altogether clear. We doubt, however, that Congress intended to alter the focus of the proscription as radically as the <em>Baranski </em>decision suggests. It is unlikely that a provision narrowly aimed at a particular type of threatening conduct was expanded, by merely adding the phrase \u201cor otherwise,\u201d to include speech or expressive conduct. In our view, such an interpretation ascribes an illogical aim to Congress and ignores the narrow aim of the original section. We believe \u00a7 462(a) was amended for a more limited purpose \u2014 to relieve the government from having to prove the use of aggressive force or violence to sustain a conviction, <em>see United States v. Eberhardt, supra </em>at 1013, and to provide some flexibility in the statute for prosecuting conduct which clearly hinders the administration of the draft but was not covered by the original section. <em>E. g., Hel-ton </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The aim of the original provision was limited; the language added in 1948 did not significantly expand the scope of intended applications. Although the amendment adds some ambiguity to the statute, we do not believe that it renders \u00a7 462(a) unconstitutionally overbroad. The number of impermissible applications which the statute may comprehend are few and, no doubt, insubstantial when judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep. <em>Broa-drick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-14\">. Section 462(a) contains many clauses, but only one was read to the jury as part of the trial court\u2019s instructions and is pertinent to the present case. That portion of Section 462(a) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-15\">[A]ny person or persons who shall knowingly hinder or interfere or attempt to do so in any way, by force or violence or otherwise, with the administration of this title or the rules or regulations made pursuant thereto, or who conspires to commit any one or more of such offenses, shall, upon conviction in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-25\">A description of the acts for which Turchick was indicted can be found in <em>United States v. Turchick, </em>451 F.2d 333 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-5\">. Although courts and commentators alike agree on the essence of the facial overbreadth doctrine, there is some disagreement over the factors which give rise to a finding of facial invalidity. Thus, in <em>United States v. Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), the Court includes among the prerequisites to an overbreadth finding that \u201cthere is * * * [no] valid construction which avoids abridgement of first amendment interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. The method of analysis followed in <em>Dellinger </em>involves a threshold question, whether the challenged law involves First Amendment interests, and a removal question, whether the expressive conduct is so related to action that the expression is carved away from First Amendment protection. Others suggest that a facial overbreadth test should translate into interest-balancing terms. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Overbreadth Review and the Burger Court, </em>49 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 532, 540-541 (1974) [hereinafter cited as <em>Burger </em>]. These differences over the proper method of analysis do not detract from the essential agreement over the nature and purposes of the doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">. \u201cFacial\u201d overbreadth analysis should be distinguished from overbreadth \u201cas applied\u201d to a particular claimant. The latter involves a judgment as to the constitutionality of a challenged statute based on the harm caused to the litigating party. The \u201cas applied\u201d method vindicates a claimant whose conduct is within the First Amendment but invalidates the challenged statute only to the extent of the impermissible application. \u201cFacial\u201d review proceeds without regard to the constitutional status of the litigant\u2019s conduct. Under this approach, a statute prohibiting substantial activity protected by the First Amendment is voided entirely. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, </em>83 Harv.L.Rev. 844, 844-845 (1970) [hereinafter cited as <em>Overbreadth].</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">. <em>Kunz v.

Oklahoma, supra </em>413 U.S. at 616-618, 93 S.Ct. at 2919, and its concluding sentence contribute to this impression. The decision ends with the conclusion that \u201cSection 818 is not substantially overbroad and is not, therefore, unconstitutional on its face.\u201d This certainly suggests that the Court did reach the merits of the overbreadth claim and that its \u201csubstantial overbreadth\u201d test for determining standing applies to the merits as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">. Quoting from the <em>Broadrick </em>decision, \u201c[P]ar-ticularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2918. From this, it is apparent that a challenge to a statute regulating pure speech would succeed on a lesser showing of facial overbreadth. The distinction between <em>speech </em>and <em>conduct </em>is somewhat ambiguous, <em>see </em>Henkin, <em>Foreword: On Drawing Lines, </em>82 Harv.L.Rev. 63, 76-82 (1968); Note, <em>Of Shadows and Substance: Freedom of Speech, Expression and Action, </em>1971 Wis.L.Rev. 1209, but has some utility when the concept of <em>speech </em>encompasses both words and action primarily aimed at the communication of ideas. <em>See generally, Tinker v. Des Moines Community School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b780-13\">.
