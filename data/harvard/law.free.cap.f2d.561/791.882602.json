HOFFMAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The principal issue before us is whether the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction of No. 74-2261, appellant\u2019s back pay claim. It was concluded at the time of argument that No. 75-1223 is moot, and we need not discuss the government\u2019s contention that the anti-injunction statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, would be violated by the requested injunctive relief. No. 75-1133 is also moot, in that there is no further need to enforce the summonses involved in that case, because the records requested in the summonses have, since argument, been produced by the appellant, Sherar, in pending Tax Court litigation. The District Court in its order of March 25, 1974 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ruled that it had no jurisdiction of a back pay claim greater than $10,000. We affirm and remand with directions to transfer No. 74-2261 to the Court of Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">The background of these consolidated cases reflects a rather lengthy procedural history. On July 3, 1973, this Court ruled that the appellant, Sherar, had been improperly dismissed from his employment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <em>She-rar v. Cullen, </em>481 F.2d 945 (9th Cir. 1973). This Court held that the appellant should be reinstated, and remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of back pay due the appellant but without discussing the extent of the possible claim. On January 18, 1974, the District Court ordered the IRS to calculate the amount of back pay due.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellant brought an action for contempt and motion for judgment against those parties named as defendants in No. 74-2261. The District Court in its order of March 25, 1974, denied the appellant\u2019s requested relief, holding <em>inter alia </em>that it was without jurisdiction to enter a judgment of $156,301.16, the appellant\u2019s requested back pay award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">The appellant contends that the District Court had jurisdiction to award this claim, citing as authority <em>The Federalist Papers, </em>No. 78, Hamilton, to the effect that a dollar judgment is not required, in that the Court need merely determine the facts and law, because the purely judicial function of ascertaining the facts and pronouncing the law thereon is separable and independent from the function of carrying out the decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">We are not persuaded by this argument. We find controlling <em>Mathis v. Laird, </em>483 F.2d 943 (9th Cir. 1973), wherein it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-17\">Mathis is seeking back pay and allowances from the date of his allegedly defective discharge to the present. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>seeks promotion to the grade he would have achieved had he suffered no adverse personnel action. Although his complaint is cast in terms of an action for mandamus and a declaratory judgment, the case is essentially one for a money judgment. 483 F.2d at 943.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">This Court then ruled that neither it nor the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the complaint, because the Court of Claims has been given exclusive jurisdiction of such money claims against the United States when they exceed $10,000. <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To permit this action in the District Court would be to undermine the Court of Claims\u2019 jurisdiction by permitting the District Court, in effect, to grant relief in excess of the Tucker Act limit of $10,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Without deciding the issue, we feel that the appellant\u2019s claim was not barred by the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, which reads, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u00a7 2501. <em>Time for filing suit </em>Every claim of which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition is filed within six years after such claim first accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Appellant had a duty to exhaust his administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s claim did not accrue until he had exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, </em>386 U.S. 503, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1967). The appellant\u2019s claim did not accrue in light of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 until May 30, 1969, which was the date of the last administrative decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant filed his complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on December 30, 1969.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We feel this filing tolled the applicable statute of limitations, in light of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\">\u00a7 1406. <em>Cure or waiver of defects</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4e\">(c) If a case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims is filed in a district court, the district court shall, if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to the Court of Claims, where the case shall proceed as if it had been filed in the Court of Claims on the date it was filed in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">In determining whether to transfer a case to the Court of Claims, the district court must determine whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d dictate such a transfer. Factors to be considered are whether the statute of limitations would otherwise run, the convenience of parties and witnesses, and whether efficient and expeditious administration of justice would be furthered. <em>Eccles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 F.Supp. 792 (D.N.D.1975); see <em>also, Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, </em>369 U.S. 463, 466, 467, 82 S.Ct. 913, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962). In light of these factors, we feel that the case should have been transferred to the Court of Claims, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>the statute of limitations should have been considered tolled as of December 30, 1969.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Accordingly, we remand to the District Court with instructions that it transfer the case to the Court of Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c). <em>See Myers v. United States, </em>323 F.2d 580, 583 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In addition to his accumulated back pay, appellant contends that he is entitled to 1,534 hours of annual leave. This is an issue which should be handled by the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Appellant claims to be entitled to health benefits as of January 18, 1974. The law on this issue is clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">No amount should be deducted from said gross amount (of back pay) for crediting to Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefits because pursuant to the Federal Personnel Manual, subchapter S8-5, Supp. 890-1, he elects not to have prior enrollment reinstated retroactively. <em>Ainsworth v. United States, </em>399 F.2d 176, 179, 185 Ct.Cl. 110 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">We hold that appellant is not entitled to health benefits as of the above date, because he elected not to be reinstated retroactively, and health benefits were not therefore deducted from the gross back pay entitlement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would be illogical to pay appellant what would have been deducted, in addition to his gross entitlement, where no deduction was made. Such a result would amount to a double payment for that portion of appellant\u2019s pay used to purchase health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Finally, appellant contends his back pay award should be computed at rates of pay currently in effect, rather than at rates appellant would have earned. We reject this contention. The Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596, clearly limits the government\u2019s liability to what appellant would have earned. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-11\">(b) An employee .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">(1) is entitled on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable, that the employee normally would have earned during that period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by him through other employment during that period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">AS TO NO. 75-1223, APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">AS TO NO. 75-1133, APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">' AS TO NO. 74-2261, AFFIRMED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO TRANSFER TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-12\">.

We have also given consideration to the question of whether appellant\u2019s claim is barred by the six-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. However, this issue was neither briefed nor argued, and any part of this opinion dealing with this issue should be considered dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-18\">.
