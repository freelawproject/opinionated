ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b997-26\">The pivotal question confronting us is whether the six-year limitation imposed generally by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on litigation brought against the United States is applicable to the suit of a discharged federal employee for restoration to his job as well as to his claim therein for damages. We hold that the effort in each respect was an action against the United States within the contemplation of that section and consequently is barred in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b997-28\">On November 26, 1965, the Department of the Navy terminated appellant\u2019s employment as a civilian aircraft engine mechanic.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Administrative remedies by which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>challenged his dismissal were exhausted on April 26, 1966, when the Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission upheld the Navy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 4, 1975\u2014 more than eight years and nine months later \u2014 appellant filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia the lawsuit in which this appeal is taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant sought a judgment setting aside his removal from federal service, reinstating him in his job, and awarding damages, including backpay and other employment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Appellees, mainly the Department of the Navy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that relief was barred by Section 2401(a) and the conventional doctrine of laches. The District Court granted the motion, concluding that monetary recovery was foreclosed by the statute and that job-restoration was precluded by undue prejudicial delay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant argues that during the lengthy interval between the final administrative decision and institution of suit, extensive efforts on his part to obtain remediation tolled the limitation period and negated the defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">That appellant actively engaged in other endeavors to rectify his situation seems to be conceded. He wrote many letters and made numerous visits to members of the business, governmental and political communities, complaining of his dismissal and soliciting assistance. He also contacted more than a dozen attorneys in efforts to maintain legal representation, often without success.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In November, 1967, he brought in the District Court for the District of Rhode Island a suit under the Freedom of Information Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for access to records pertaining to his discharge,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and eventually obtained an order that all available data be turned over to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant states that subsequently he tendered a second complaint, <em>pro se, </em>to that court but that it was \u201crejected by the clerk, who suggested [that he] file the suit in\u201d this circuit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">On November 24, 1971, appellant applied <em>pro se </em>to the District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to the Secretary of Labor and others, but suffered a dismissal without prejudice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On February 22, 1972, he asked leave to amend his complaint but was refused;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> continuing <em>pro se, </em>he then opted for summary reversal by this court. That, on June 2, 1972, the court denied, and instead granted the Navy\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we have stated, the instant litigation was commenced on February 4, 1975, and the appeal contests the District Court\u2019s rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>ing that appellant\u2019s claims were time-barred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Congress has not seen fit to enact a comprehensive array of time limitations on the enforcement of federally-created rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For relatively few, Congress has prescribed limitation periods, and when it has done so its mandate, of course, must be obeyed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When, however, Congress has not spoken, the applicable limitation traditionally has depended upon the nature of the litigation,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a treatment inherited from the days when the common law and equity jurisprudence flourished as separate doctrinal systems. For actions at law, congressional silence was accepted as a reflection of federal policy to abide nonfederal statutes of limitation applicable in analogous situations;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> when, however, the relief sought was purely equitable in character, the doctrine of laches \u2014 peculiarly a creature of equity<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 measured timeliness of the suit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This distinction has survived four decades of merger of common law and equity procedure in the federal courts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Suits against the United States \u2014 -at least some of them \u2014 however, comprise one of the special categories of litigation for which Congress has erected a time barrier. Section 2401(a) specifies that \u201c[e]very civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless a complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This mandate is but an exertion of the undoubted congressional power to impose restrictions upon the institution of litigation authorized against the Federal Government.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The critical inquiry, then, relates to the extent to which Section 2401(a) impacts either or both of appellant\u2019s prayers for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">Dismissal, on the basis of Section 2401(a), of appellant\u2019s claim for a monetary judgment, we are satisfied, was eminently correct. On this branch of the case appellant sought damages, including salary and other financial benefits lost by reason of the termination of his employment. Relief of that character would have been possible only by resort to the federal fisc, and the effort in court to obtain it, nominally against named federal officials, was in every sense a \u201ccivil action commenced against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> By the terms of the statute, the six-year limitation period began to run from the time the \u201cright of action first accruefd]\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u2014 certainly no later than final administrative disposition of appellant\u2019s claim on April 26, 1966<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u2014 and the record does not support an argument that compliance with Section 2401(a) was frustrated by obstructionism on the part of the Navy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The filing of the complaint in the instant litigation on February 4, 1975, came too late for a money award.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Appellant\u2019s endeavors to secure reinstatement to his job, however, generates somewhat more difficulty, which the parties\u2019 argumentative approach has accentuated. In this court, the briefs on both sides, while postulating monetary recovery as a matter implicating Section 2401(a), have treated reinstatement solely as a problem of laches. Accordingly, the litigants, like the District Court, have focused exclusively on disputes over the reasonableness of the delay in instituting the case before us and resulting prejudice to the Navy. Despite the relevance of those considerations on an issue of laches had appellant\u2019s action been brought within the six-year period,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> no one has satisfactorily explained why Section 2401(a) does not itself bar reinstatement as well as the monetary demand. Our own research-\u2014 which is now to follow<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u2014 has demonstrated that the parties\u2019 analysis is faulty; that appellant\u2019s reinstatement bid, notwithstanding its equitable nature, is intercepted by Section 2401(a), and consequently also is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">Even prior to unification of district-court proceedings in one form of action,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> it had become well settled that whenever the courts of law and equity possessed concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the claimant\u2019s right, statutes of limitation were to be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number><footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A forcefully applied in equity as at law. sufficient \u2014 though perhaps not the sole\u2014 reason was that, in all such instances, the statute imposed its restraint on the claim in suit, and not merely on the court in which it was asserted.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> For obviously greater reason, the concurrency rule continues in full vigor after the procedural wedding of law and equity.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">We have no doubt but that the rule, independently of any other consideration, governs the case at bar. The one right that appellant presses in this litigation is to freedom from legally unjustified molestation in the job he held as an employee of the Navy. On the premise that the right has been infringed by an unlawful discharge, appellant demands redress in the form of both restoration and damages. While the former undoubtedly partakes of an equitable hue, the latter undeniably is legal relief in an ancient role; and while these complementary remedies are capable of that sort of distinction, \u201c[tjhere is in fact but a single right and single default involved ....<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">This, we find, is the kind of parallelism that demonstrates applicability of the concurrency rule. As we read the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements on the subject, only when a court is importuned \u201cto enforce rights cognizable only in equity [are] statute[s] barring legal causes of action . not controlling.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Put another way, \u201c[t]he decisive feature . which gives jurisdiction the flavor of concurrency, is not the narrow question of whether formal relief requested in a particular action is equitable or legal, primary or incidental, but the broader determination of whether the federal right in issue may be judicially enforced in any action by means both legal and equitable.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Additionally to the binding effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s expositions of federal law, this view is thoroughly consistent with our own rather numerous holdings in the area<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> as well as those of other courts.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>One decision we may note with particular profit.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In an action charging violation of federal civil rights legislation by the plaintiff\u2019s alleged improper suspension from a state educational institution,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the Second Circuit took pains to consider \u201cwhether, because his complaint seeks not damages but rather declaratory and injunctive relief, it should be considered solely \u2018equitable\u2019, and hence as governed not by a statute of limitations but rather by the doctrine of lach-es.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The court \u201cconcluded that since plaintiff could also have sought Civil Rights Act relief by way of damages, he is not here asserting \u2018a federal right for which the sole remedy is in equity,\u2019 . and hence the situation is one of \u2018concurrent\u2019 legal and equitable jurisdiction, in which case the statute of limitations does apply.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Surely the same result follows where, as here, legal as well as equitable relief is an object of the suit.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The all-important factor from our viewpoint is that despite the historical dissimilarity of the remedies pursued, the right they purportedly would vindicate is single and indivisible. Where that is so, and remediation does not lie exclusive-Iy within the domain of equity, the availability of legal relief to enforce the underlying right summons the statute of limitations into play as to the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">The case before us calls for an application of the concurrency doctrine even more peculiarly and strongly than the coexistence of legal and equitable remedies ordinarily would. Section 2401(a) is part of the Tucker Act \u2014 century-old legislation by which district courts share with the Court of Claims jurisdiction over suits against the United States.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Save only for a district-court ceiling in terms of amount involved,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> jurisdiction is the same,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and the six-year limitation on district-court suits coincides exactly with the limitation statutorily imposed upon litigation instituted in the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Equally importantly, the construction of the Tucker Act over the years has consistently been that district courts derive from it no greater power than the Court of Claims possesses under its own enabling legislation.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> A factor prominently underpinning this interpretation, the Supreme Court has declared, is \u201cthe embar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>rassments which would attend the defense of suits brought against the Government if the jurisdiction of district courts were not deemed to be as restricted as that of the Court of Claims.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Until recently, the Court of Claims had \u201cspecific jurisdiction only to award damages, [and] not specific relief,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and district courts acting under the Tucker Act were similarly confined.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> This restraint has endured notwithstanding that the district courts have historically entertained suits for restoration to federal employment, couched in terms of mandamus.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And in 1964 the Tucker Act jurisdiction of district courts was broadened to comprehend actions for money judgments in federal employee actions.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus the district courts might hear, under these jurisdictional heads, suits seeking job-restoration, monetary awards, or both, while the Court of Claims was then restricted to money judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">In 1972, the Court of Claims\u2019 remedial authority was enlarged to include job-reinstatement<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> in order \u201c[t]o provide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the [monetary] judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Thus, at long last, the powers of district courts and the Court of Claims in the federal-employment area were ostensibly congruent. The fact is, however, the six-year limitation for litigation in that court blocks reinstatement whenever it would bar a judgment for money.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Unless, then, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>trict-court reinstatement proceedings are similarly time-restricted, the symmetry between the two courts which Congress has endeavored to promote in employee cases is to that extent completely destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">To tolerate a job-restoration effort through mandamus sought after expiration of Section 2401(a)\u2019s six-year period is itself to wage war with the established requirement that the remedy be invoked with dispatch.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Even more alarmingly, it would allow the claimant to pursue in a district court an objective he could not aspire to in the Court of Claims, and thereby upset the congruity for which Congress ever so recently has striven. In determining the propriety of an application of the concurrency rule, we are not at liberty to ignore congressional policy, or more egregiously to frustrate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">We reject, then, the notion that Section 2401(a) does not extend to the equitable as well as common law features of appellant\u2019s claim. We hold that his suit is barred in its entirety.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> It follows that the Navy\u2019s motion to dismiss was well taken,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and that the District Court\u2019s grant must be</p>\n<p id=\"AV5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-16\">.

Appellant\u2019s suit under the Freedom of Information Act got under way on November 27, 1967, and ended on October 27, 1969, a period of one year, eleven months. His first <em>pro se </em>complaint was filed on October 16, 1971, and the proceeding initiated by his <em>pro se </em>mandamus complaint terminated June 2, 1972 \u2014 a period of seven months, seventeen days, assuming that there was no time gap between them. The aggregate of the three previous suits, then, is two years, six months and seventeen days, which when subtracted from the eight years, nine months and eight days elapsing from exhaustion of remedies to inception of the instant case, leaves six years, two months and twenty-one days \u2014 more, of course, than the six-year limitation period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">.

If so, that court rules, an applicable statute of limitations bars the legal remedy but the propriety of equitable relief is a matter of laches. <em>Churma v. United States Steel Corp., </em>514 F.2d 589, 590 n. 2 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Gruca v. United States Steel Corp., </em>495 F.2d 1252, 1256 (3d Cir. 1974). In our view, however, the vital inquiry is not the type of relief demanded but the nature of the right at stake, and it is the availability rather than the adequacy of legal redress that harmonizes with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of concurrency. See text <em>supra </em>at note 35. Moreover, since equitable relief may be granted only when the remedy at law is inadequate, the test of adequacy can hardly be expected to ever summon the applicability of the statute.

Then, too, the adequacy approach necessitates a close analysis of the pleadings to ascertain whether legal relief is calculated to suffice, a kind of formalism at odds with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The shift to the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d was obviously intended to reflect the merger of law and equity which had been a central objective of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by the Supreme Court a decade earlier. When, in the wake of that significant simplification of legal doctrine, Congress in 1948 commanded that \u201c[ejvery civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues,\u201d there can be no mistaking its purpose to lay to rest the ancient distinctions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
