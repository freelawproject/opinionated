The appeals are brought for and on behalf of the Secretary of Labor and two disabled coal miners who had been awarded benefits after administrative hearings under the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-41 (Supp. V, 1975), <em>amending </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-36 (1970). The Benefits are currently being paid by the Department of Labor, but the Department contends that respondent coal companies are liable for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The three questions of substance, as we see them, posed by these appeals are:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">1) Did the Benefits Review Board and does this court have jurisdiction to hear these appeals?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">2) Does the Director of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs of the United States Department of Labor have standing to prosecute these appeals?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">3) Was the Benefits Review Board correct in dismissing the appeals before it because, in spite of objections, each case had been heard by a hearing officer who was not a qualified Administrative Law Judge under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105 (1970)?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">We hold that the Benefits Review Board had and this court has jurisdiction of the appeals, that the Director does have standing to prosecute these appeals, and that the Board erred in vacating the awards for want of hearings before Administrative Law Judges because Congress specifically authorized the use of non-Administrative Law Judge hearing officers in the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-17\">THE CASES AT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b691-18\">Although the two cases are not before us upon the merits, their nature has a bearing upon the proper interpretation of the legislative and regulatory enactments which are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-19\">The James Large Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b691-20\">James Large had worked almost fifty years in the coal mines when he quit his employment with Eastern Coal Corporation in 1965. After passage of the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, he filed a claim for black lung disability benefits on September 17, 1973. On notice of the claim, Eastern Coal denied liability and the case was heard, over Eastern\u2019s objection, by a Department of Labor hearing officer who was not an Administrative Law Judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105. The hearing officer found Large was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of his coal mine employment and that Eastern Coal was liable for benefits to Large under the Black Lung Benefits Act. Eastern Coal appealed and the Benefits Review Board vacated the award and remanded the case for hearing because the hearing officer had not been a qualified Administrative Law Judge under \u00a7 3105.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-21\">The Mossie Graham Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b691-22\">Mossie Graham had worked nearly forty years in the coal mines when he quit his job with Marlowe Coal Company in 1949. When the Black Lung legislation was passed, he too filed a claim under the Act on July 11, 1973. The Elkhorn-Jellico Coal Company (into which Marlowe Coal Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ny had merged) was notified of possible liability and refused to accept same, whereupon a hearing was held. Over Elkhorn\u2019s objection, the claim was heard before a Department of Labor hearing officer who was not an Administrative Law Judge qualified under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105. The hearing officer found that Graham was entitled to benefits and that Elkhorn-Jellico was liable under the Act. Elkhorn-Jellico appealed this decision to the Benefits Review Board which vacated the decision and remanded for rehearing because the claim had not been held before an ALJ qualified under \u00a7 3105.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The Director determined under the Act that the Department of Labor should pay both claims pending review and brought these appeals to resolve the third stated legal question as predicate for determination of liability. Respondents, coal companies, raise the first and second stated questions as alternative grounds for dismissing the appeal or affirming the Board\u2019s vacation of the awards of benefits to claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">THE STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Before turning to the legal disputes which we must resolve in these cases, we note the history and purposes of this legislation. From the founding of the republic until recent years, coal was the main source of energy for this nation\u2019s homes and work places. It may well be again. For most of that history underground mining was required to produce the coal. The miners who daily descended hundreds, sometimes thousands, of feet into the shafts and tunnels of the deep mines, first became objects of public and Congressional concern because of the recurring tragedies caused by explosions of coal gas which over the years killed thousands of miners. An American public and the United States Congress, which repeatedly saw the pithead pictures of surviving miners with coal blackened faces and hands, reacted to explosion shattered bodies and lives with mine safety legislation. Federal Coal Mine Safety Act Amendments of 1965, Pub.L. No. 89-376, 80 Stat. 85; Act of July 16, 1952, ch. 877, 66 Stat. 692; Act of May 7, 1941, ch. 87, 55 Stat. 177;' Act of March 3, 1915, ch. 95, 38 Stat. 959; Act of Feb. 25, 1913, ch. 72, 37 Stat. 681; Act of May 13, 1910, ch. 240, 36 Stat. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">For many years, however, little was known about the physical damage which underground miners suffered from breathing coal dust. Finally, pneumoconiosis was recognized as a disabling and deadly disease. In 1969 the United States Congress provided the first remedial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">This Circuit, which encompasses extensive mining areas in Eastern Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee, and Southern Ohio has already had occasion to note Congressional concerns and purposes in regard to the Black Lung Acts of 1969 and 1972:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201cThe present black lung (pneumoconio-sis) law is a combination of two statutes. The Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, Pub.L. No. 91-173, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>(1970), was adopted in 1969. Its stated purpose included these sentences: \u2018[Cjountless thousands [of coal miners] have suffered and died or presently suffer from the ravages of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis \u2014 the dread miners disease caused by the inhalation of excessive amounts of coal dust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u2018It is the purpose of the bill H.R. 13950 to protect the health and safety of coal miners, and to combat the steady toll of life, limb, and lung, which terrorizes so many unfortunate families.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 91-563, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, p. 2503. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">\u201cBy 1972, however, the record of the Social Security Agency of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in processing and disposing of pneumoconiosis claims was anything but satisfactory to Congress. In passing the Black Lung Act of 1972, Congress recorded these findings and purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">\u2018\u00a7 901. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWDn\">Congress finds and declares that there are a significant number of coal miners living today who are totally disabled due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in one or more of the Nation\u2019s coal mines; that there are a number of survivors of coal miners whose deaths were due to this disease or who were totally disabled by this disease at the time of their deaths; and that few States provide benefits for death or disability due to this disease to coal miners or their surviving dependents. It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to provide benefits, in cooperation with the States, to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneu-moconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease or who were totally disabled by this disease at the time of their deaths; and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 (Supp.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cThe Senate Report on the bill was more explicit as to, at least, Congressional intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acq-dedup-0\"><em>\u2018Accordingly, the Committee expects the Secretary to adopt such interim evi-dentiary rules and disability evaluation criteria as will permit prompt and vigorous processing of the large backlog of claims consistent with the language and intent of these amendments. </em>Such interim rules and criteria shall give full consideration to the combined employment handicap of disease and age and provide for the adjudication of claim on the basis of medical evidence other than breathing tests when it is not feasible or practicable to provide physical performance tests of the type described in the above cited section from the Secretary\u2019s annual report. For example, an older miner who has developed pneumoconiosis, or another respiratory or pulmonary disease which is presumed to be pneumoconiosis, and who is no longer working as a miner, would be prevented from returning to or continuing in his usual work as a miner due to the combined employment handicaps of advancing age and respiratory or pulmonary disease, even though the disease may have produced relatively little functional loss.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">S.Rep. No. 92-743, 92d Cong. 2d Sess. (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 2322-23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\"><em>Begley v. Mathews, </em>544 F.2d 1345, 1347-48 (6th Cir. 1976). (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">In the <em>Begley </em>case this circuit defined its standard for interpretation of the Black Lung Benefits Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">\u201cWe believe remedial legislation such as the Black Lung Benefits Act should be given a liberal interpretation; and moreover Congress clearly stated its desires for the Secretary to do just that in relation to this specific Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-14\"><em>Begley </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra </em>at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the highly technical issues of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">DID THE BENEFITS REVIEW BOARD AND DOES THIS COURT HAVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR THESE TWO APPEALS?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">Respondents claim that the hearing officers, the Benefits Review Board, and this court are without jurisdiction in these black lung cases. They argue that the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902-948a (Supp. V, 1975), <em>amending </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(1970), which created the Benefits Review Board and the adjudication procedures used in these cases, do not apply to the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972. The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 adopted the adjudication procedures of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cas amended\u201d but it was enacted a few months before the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments were passed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The Benefits Review Board has held that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments do \u2019 apply to black lung cases and that it did have jurisdiction. <em>Fields </em>v. <em>A.K.P. Coal Co., </em>3 Benefits Rev.Bd.Serv. 269 (1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>4 Benefits Rev.Bd.Serv.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In the <em>Fields </em>case, the Benefits Review Board\u2019s opinion began by pointing out that the Black Lung Benefits Act adopted the review provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cSection 422, [30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932 (Supp. V, 1975)] of the Act [Black Lung Benefits Act] was initially enacted on December 30, 1969. It was subsequently amended on May 19, 1972. The provision with which we are initially concerned in this case is Section 422(a), which reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u2018During any period after December 31, 1973, in which a State workmen\u2019s compensation law is not included on the list published by the Secretary under section 421(b) of this part, <em>the provisions of Public Law 803, 69th Congress (44 Stat. 1424, approved March 4, 1927),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> as amended (other than the provisions contained in sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 29, 30, 31, 33, 37, 38, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51 thereof) shall (except as otherwise provided in this subsection and except as the Secretary shall by regulation otherwise provide), be applicable to each operator of a coal mine in such State with respect to death or total disability due to pneu-moconiosis arising out of employment in such mine. </em>In administering this part, the Secretary is authorized to prescribe in the Federal Register such additional provisions, not inconsistent with those specifically excluded by this subsection, as he deems necessary to provide for the payment of benefits by such operator to persons entitled thereto as provided in this part and thereafter those provisions shall be applicable to such operator.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">This provision incorporates by reference numerous substantive and procedural provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (hereafter referred to as the Longshoremen\u2019s Act) into the Black'Lung Benefits Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">\u201cAlthough Section 422(a) appeared in the Act in 1969, it was amended in 1972. Among the sections of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act which were excluded from the Act in 1969 was Section 7, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 907, which provides for the furnishing of medical services and supplies to claimants by employers who are responsible for payment of benefits. By amendment in 1972, this section was removed from the list of excluded provisions, thus placing on a responsible operator the substantial additional burden of providing medical care to those victims of pneumoconio-sis to whom he must pay compensation under the Act. This significant change in Section 422(a) has the effect of reenacting the incorporation by reference of Longshoremen\u2019s Act provisions which are not on the list of excluded sections. Therefore, the incorporation by reference of sections of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the Act dates from May 1972 and not from December 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\u201cAmong the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act which were incorporated by the Act is Section 19, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919, concerning procedure in respect of claims, including the conduct of formal hearings. In May of 1972, hearings under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act were conducted by deputy commissioners, who are not hearing examiners [administrative law judges] qualified under Section 3105 of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105. However, at the same session of Congress during which the Act was amended (92d Congress, 2d Session), the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was also amended. In amending the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, Congress provided that hearings be conducted by qualified hearing examiners [administrative law judges], effective as of the date of enactment of the amendments, October 26, 1972. The question then arises whether this amendment to the Longshoremen\u2019s Act affects the conduct of formal hearings under the Act. To answer this question, we look to comparable provisions of other statutes which are included in the Federal workmen\u2019s compensation scheme and also incorporate substantial portions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, including its procedural provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201cThe statutes which are comparable to the Act, and are commonly recognized as extensions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, are the Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651 <em>et seq., </em>the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 <em>et seq., </em>and the Nonappropriated Fund In-strumentalities Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8171 <em>et seq. </em>The provisions of these statutes which incorporate provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act by reference are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u2018Except as herein modified, the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as <em>amended, </em>shall apply in respect to the injury or death of any employee engaged in any employment [Defense Base Act]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">With respect to disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations described in subsection (b) of this section, compensation shall be payable under the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . . [Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act shall apply with respect to the disability or death resulting from injury, as defined in section 2(2) of such Act, occurring to a civilian employee of any nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in section 1 of this Act, subject to the following provisions of this section: .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">[Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">\u201cThese incorporating provisions are similar to that of Section 422(a) of the Act. Although the quoted provisions do not specifically provide that amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s Act also apply to the other statutes, such amendments have uniformly been construed to be applicable in both substantive and procedural matters. It is only reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act amendments also apply to the Act. It would be incongruous to hold that significant amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, having substantial impact on both adjudication procedures and benefits, do not apply to the Act, particularly where both enactments were adopted at the same session of Congress under sponsorship of the same Congressional Committees and where the Longshoremen\u2019s Act amendments became effective at least eight months before any proceedings under the Act to which the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is applicable could be instituted. Considering the present issue before the Board, the amendment to Section 19(d) of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act must logically apply to proceedings held under the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-13\"><em>Fields v. A.K.P. Coal Co., supra </em>at 274-77. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Although the Benefits Review Board and the Department of Labor have taken this position consistently, we do not find this issue a simple one. It is clear that Congress in adopting the review sections of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act as a part of the Black Lung Benefits Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did so five months <em>before </em>it adopted the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These amendments created the Benefits Review Board and provided for direct review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decisions by this court. Such a sequence of events would not generally mean that the later amendments applied to the earlier ones, absent clear indication of Congressional intent to have them do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Respondent\u2019s brief in this regard relies upon the following statement of the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201cA statute of specific reference incorporates the provisions referred to from the statute as of the time of adoption without subsequent amendments, unless the legislature has expressly or by strong implication shown its intention to incorporate subsequent amendments with the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">2A Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.08 (4th ed. C. Sands 1973). (Footnotes omitted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\"><em>See Hasset v. Welch, </em>303 U.S. 303, 314, 58 S.Ct. 559, 82 L.Ed. 858 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Accepting the above as an authoritative statement of the applicable rule, we believe this record does disclose by the strongest implication Congressional intent to make the later adopted 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>supra, </em>applicable to the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972. We also believe that Congress\u2019 intent in this regard is indicated in sufficient ways and in clear enough statement to satisfy the \u201cexpress intent\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The two bills were under consideration in both houses at the same time. Both Acts became effective in the same session of the Congress and in the same year. The effective dates of the two Acts were only five months apart. Congress may not have known in advance which Act would actually be adopted first.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">Of significance also is the fact that the portion of the black lung program with which we deal here did not become effective until July 1, 1973 \u2014 eight months after the effective date of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">Of greater significance, however, is the fact that beyond dispute Congress regarded the new adjudicatory provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 as replacement for outmoded and unsatisfactory past methods of review (writs of mandamus in the United States District Courts and subsequent appeals to the United States Courts of Appeals).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, Congress clearly intended to employ the new adjudicatory provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 as the method of review of a considerable number of workmen\u2019s compensation acts other than the Black Lung Benefits Act. We thus deal here with one of a number of enactments which are <em>in pari materia </em>and, hence, should, if there is doubt as to proper construction, be construed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">The earliest statement of this doctrine in the United States is found in an opinion of Chief Justice John Marshall which says succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cWithout deciding this question, as depending merely on the original law, it is to be observed, that acts <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together as forming one act. If, in a subsequent clause of the same act, provisions are introduced, which show the sense in which the legislature employed doubtful phrases previously used, that sense is to be adopted in construing those phrases. Consequently, if a subsequent act on the same subject affords complete demonstration of the legislative sense of its own language, the rule which has been stated, requiring that the subsequent should be incorporated into the foregoing act, is a direction to courts in expounding the provisions of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Alexander v. Alexandria, </em>9 U.S. (5 Cranch) *1, *7-8, 3 L.Ed. 19 (1809).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The same principles have much more recently been discussed by Justice Thurgood Marshall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe rule of <em>in pari materia </em>\u2014 like any canon of statutory construction \u2014 is a reflection of practical experience in the interpretation of statutes: a legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context. Thus, for example, a \u201clater act can ... be regarded as a legislative interpretation of [an] earlier act . in the sense that it aids in ascertaining the meaning of the words as used in their contemporary setting,\u201d and \u201cis therefore entitled to great weight in resolving any ambiguities and doubts.\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>[311 U.S. 60 (1940)], at 64-65, [61 S.Ct. 102, at 105, 85 L.Ed. 40], See also e. <em>g. Hunter v. Erickson, </em>393 U.S. 385, 388, [89 S.Ct. 557, 559, 21 L.Ed.2d 616] (1969); <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>[44 U.S. (3 How.) 556 (1845)], at 565, [11 L.Ed. 724]. The rule is but a logical extension of the principle that individual sections of a single statute should be construed together, for it necessarily assumes that whenever Congress passes a new statute, it acts aware of all previous statutes on the same subject, cf. <em>Allen v.

Given this underlying assumption, the rule\u2019s application certainly makes the most sense when the statutes were enacted by the same legislative body at the same time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6CN\"><em>Erlenbaugh v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 239, 243-44, 93 S.Ct. 477, 480, 34 L.Ed.2d 446 (1972). (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Here the relevant statutes were all adopted by the Congress of the United States and all deal with the same general subject \u2014 the provision of workmen\u2019s compensation in employment areas where Congress has assumed particular concern and responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The statutes we deem relevant to our present problem include: 1) The Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act Amendments of 1972, <em>supra; </em>2) The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, <em>supra; </em>3) The Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651\u2014 54 (1970); 4) The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(c) (1970); and 5) The Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumen-talities Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8171-73 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">What we deduce from these statutes is that Congress has decided to employ the Longshoremen\u2019s Act as the basic procedural vehicle for workmen\u2019s compensation claims. In the debate concerning adoption of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972, Congressman Steiger inserted the following question and answer in the Congressional Record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EMPLOYEE COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-13\">\n<em>Q. What is the impact of this bill on the District of Columbia?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-14\">A. District of Columbia employees have been covered under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act since 1928. At the time this was done as a matter of convenience, but <em>the Longshoremen\u2019s Act has become a sort of catch-all for Federal compensation coverage for other special areas. </em>For example, the bill also covers compensation in overseas defense facilities and off-shore oil drilling rigs on the Continental Shelf. 118 Cong.Rec. 36386 (1972). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>In this same connection, Senator Williams noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">The present Longshoremen Act, passed by Congress in 1927, generally provides a Federal compensation program for injuries or death arising from employment on the navigable waters of the United States. Because this legislation was the only Federal control over private employment in workmen compensation matters <em>[sic].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">The statute over the years has been extended to cover employees of the District of Columbia and other areas of Federal interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">More than 200,000 longshoremen and ship repairmen are covered by the statute. In addition another 300,000 employees of private employers within the District of Columbia are protected by the law as well as an additional 200,000 workers in defense bases, in nonappropriated fund agencies such as post exchanges, and in work on the Outer Continental Shelf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">118 Cong.Rec. 36270 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">After adoption of the amendments, Senator Eagleton commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">The bill . . provides for important administrative changes respecting both the worker\u2019s rights and the operations of the Department of Labor in administering this system of compensation for the over 800,000 employees who depend upon its protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGOp\">118 Cong.Rec. 37283 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">While the Congressmen did not make specific reference to the Black Lung Benefits Act the intention to construct a scheme of workmen\u2019s compensation acts with hearing and review procedures and benefits, all to be established within the framework of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, appears unmistakable.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Of significance, likewise, is the fact that the Black Lung legislation had never had any separate provisions for judicial review but had from the passage of this legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">in 1969 contained provisions incorporating the adjudicatory measures of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. If the words \u201cas amended\u201d in the 1972 Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments are not construed as incorporating the review mechanism of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972, then, contrary to expressed Congressional intent, decisions on black lung claims would initially be made by Deputy Commissioners who are direct administrative officers of the Department of Labor, and review would have to follow the route of District Court mandamus proceedings and subsequent review by the United States Courts of Appeals. The review standards provided by petitions for writs of mandamus are utterly inconsistent with the Congressional intentions which we have quoted at the beginning of this opinion pertaining to the Black Lung Act Amendments of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">The Third, Seventh and Fourth Circuits have upheld the Benefits Review Board\u2019s view of this issue in similar cases. <em>Krolick Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>Benefits Review Board, </em>558 F.2d 685, 688 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>Director v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>554 F.2d 310, 317-331 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Director v. National Mines Corp., </em>554 F.2d 1267, 1271-1273 (4th Cir. 1977). <em>See Appalachian Power Co. v. Dunlop, </em>399 F.Supp. 972 (S.D.W.Va.1975), which assumed that the 1972 Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 did apply to black lung cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">Support for the Benefits Review Board\u2019s position may also be found in Circuits which have interpreted similar laws. Several other federal worker compensation statutes adopt by reference portions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act employing language similar to that found in the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972. Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651-54 (1970); Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(c) (1970); Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8171-73 (1970).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two Circuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>have entertained petitions for review of awards under those statutes which have been processed under the new procedures. <em>Presley v.

McMullen, </em>500 F.2d 1291 (2d Cir. 1974) (Defense Base Act cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Like the Benefits Review Board and the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits, we hold that the Benefits Review Board and this Court do have jurisdiction over these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Respondent coal companies contend that the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs has no standing to prosecute these appeals. Our consideration of this issue begins with Rule 15(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (particularly those sentences italicized which require the agency to be a party and give general authority to the \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cdesignated officer\u201d to act as a party in the Courts of Appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Rule 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Review or Enforcement of Agency Orders \u2014 How Obtained; Intervention</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">(a) Petition for Review of Order; Joint Petition. <em>Review of an order of an administrative agency, board, commission or officer (hereinafter, the term \u201cagency\u201d shall include agency, board, commission or officer) shall be obtained by filing with the clerk of a court of appeals which is authorized to review such order, within the time prescribed by law, a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify or otherwise review, </em>or a notice of appeal, whichever form is indicated by the applicable statute (hereinafter, the term \u201cpetition for review\u201d shall include a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify or otherwise review, or a notice of appeal).

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">We recognize that this rule does not precisely anticipate the form of this appeal. It does, however, for purposes of this litigation clearly define an \u201cofficer\u201d as a proper party to litigate. It requires the presence of the agency (or \u201cofficer\u201d thereof) as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>spondent or as cross-petitioner.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court, to the Board, and to the other parties, and thereupon the Board shall file in the court the record in the proceedings as provided in section 2112 of Title 28. Upon such filing, the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have the power to give a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Board and enforcing same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified. The orders, writs, and processes'of the court in such proceedings may run, be served, and be returnable anywhere in the United States. The payment of the amounts required by an award shall not be stayed pending final decision in any such proceeding unless ordered by the court. No stay shall be issued unless irreparable injury would otherwise ensue to the employer or carrier. The order of the court allowing any stay shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the court and identified by reference thereto, that irreparable damage would result to the employer, and specifying the nature of the damage. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (Supp. V, 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Also relevant to Congressional intent with respect to the standing of the Secretary, or his delegated representative, to litigate (although not relevant to this proceeding) is 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(d) (Supp. V, 1975):</p>\n<p id=\"AaO\">\u00a7 921.

If the court determines that the order was made and served in accordance with law, and that such employer or his officers or agents have failed to comply therewith, the court shall enforce obedience to the order by writ of injunction or by other proper process, mandatory or otherwise, to enjoin upon such person and his officers and agents compliance with the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">It thus appears that Congress has given the Labor Department the responsibility for enforcement of the Black Lung Benefits Act (incorporating the adjudicatory provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act) in at least three different respects which are relevant to this appeal. First, the Department is charged with administration of the Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>and the Secretary is charged with promulgating regulations implementing these Acts. Second, the Department has responsibility for defending the federal fisc by defending against invalid claims and, where appropriate, by seeing to it that coal companies bear their proper burden for valid claims. Third, the Department also clearly has responsibility for assisting miner claimants in both Department hearings and the courts. The legislative history explains this last provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">ASSISTANCE TO CLAIMANTS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ado-dedup-0\">Section 39 of the Act [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 939] is amended to substantially increase the Secretary\u2019s responsibility for administering this program so far as providing services to employees. The bill will require the Secretary upon request to provide assistance to persons covered under this act to understand the benefits and other matters relating to the operations of the statute and also to provide assistance in processing a claim. It is intended that this assistance be all inclusive and enable the employee to receive the maximum benefits due to him without having to rely on outside assistance other than that provided by the Secretary. The bill also makes legal assistance in processing the claim for benefits under this Act available in needy cases upon request subject to the Secretary\u2019s discretion. It is the committee\u2019s desire that the Secretary construe this provision as liberally as possible so as to provide any worker in need of legal assistance such counsel, especially where the employee is either indigent or of minimal means. It would also be appropriate for the Secretary to provide legal assistance in similar types of death cases as well as to provide as much assistance in other cases of hardship or unusual types of proceedings or difficult cases.

The Director appears here not as a private individual in any sense, but as the authorized representative of the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Recognizing these facts, it appears to us that <em>United States ex rel. Chapman v. Federal Power Commission, </em>345 U.S. 153, 73 S.Ct. 609, 97 L.Ed. 918 (1953), is much closer in point than the cases relied upon by the Third Circuit, both of which dealt with the standing of private parties rather than government departments or officers. <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). In <em>Chapman </em>the Fourth Circuit had determined that the Secretary of the Interior was not \u201ca person aggrieved\u201d by an order of the Federal Power Commission granting the rights to a private party to construct a hydroelectric dam. The Fourth Circuit held that the Secretary of the Interior had no standing. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the majority of the Court, responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cIn these two cases, the Secretary of the Interior and an association of nonprofit rural electric cooperatives have challenged the authority of the Federal Power Commission to grant to the respondent power company, VEPCO, a license to construct a hydroelectric generating station at Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. They claim that Congress, by approving a comprehensive plan set out in the Flood Control Act of 1944 for improvement of the Roanoke River Basin, has withdrawn all eleven sites proposed for development in the plan, including Roanoke Rapids, from the licensing jurisdiction of the Commission and has reserved them for public construction. The underlying premise, that the plan approved by Congress presupposed federal development of all sites included in the plan, also underlies petitioners\u2019 other main contention here, that the Commission\u2019s concurrence in the plan constituted a determination by the Commission that the development of these water resources should be undertaken by the United States itself. Such a determination, they say, requires the Commission under \u00a7 7(b) of the Federal Power Act, 41 Stat. 1067, as amended, 49 Stat. 842, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 800(b), to make investigations and submit its findings together with appropriate recommendations to Congress and in any event bars the Commission from approving applications for private construction of the project. Petitioners unsuccessfully raised these contentions, along with attacks on the Commission\u2019s findings not pressed here, before the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which denied their petitions to set aside the Commission\u2019s order granting a license to VEPCO. <em>United States v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>191 F.2d 796. We granted certiorari, 343 U.S. 941, 72 S.Ct. 1034, 96 L.Ed. 1346. The cases present questions of importance in that they involve a conflict of view between two agencies of the Government having duties in relation to the development of national water resources. Determination of the issues may affect a substantial number of important potential sites for the development of hydroelectric power. Cf. Rules Sup.Ct. 38(5)(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cBoth here and in the court below, petitioners\u2019 standing to raise these issues has been questioned. The Secretary of the Interior points to his statutory duty to act as sole marketing agent of power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>developed at public hydroelectric projects and not required for the operation of the project; \u00a7 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 directs him to transmit and dispose of such power in a manner calculated to \u2018encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.\u2019 58 Stat. 890, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825s. This provision, it is said, announces a congressional policy for the guidance of the Secretary that would be disturbed by the respondent company\u2019s plan; thus a specific interest of the Secretary, in addition to his more general duties relating to the conservation and utilization of the Nation\u2019s water resources, is said to be adversely affected by the Commission\u2019s order. The REA Association, an association of cooperatives, asserts that, as an organization of consumers entitled, along with \u2018public bodies,\u2019 to a preference in sales by the Secretary under \u00a7 5, it has a substantial interest in the development of low-cost power at the Roanoke Rapids site and consequently in the kind of instrumentality, public or private, to which power development at this site is committed. Respondents say, however, that decisions of policy in the construction of power projects have been entrusted to the Commission, or at most also to the Secretary of the Army, under whom the Corps of Engineers performs its statutory functions of making surveys and constructing public works, and that the interests of petitioners arise only after a public project has been constructed and the Secretary of the Army has determined that there is excess power to be distributed and sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201cWe hold that petitioners have standing. Differences of view, however, preclude a single opinion of the Court as to both petitioners. It would not further clarification of this complicated specialty of federal jurisdiction, the solution of whose problems is in any event more or less determined by the specific circumstances of individual situations, to set out the divergent grounds in support of standing in these cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\"><em>United States ex rel. Chapman v. Federal Power Commission, supra </em>at 154-56, 73 S.Ct. at 611-612.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The Justices who dissented in the <em>Chapman </em>case went directly to the merits without discussion of the standing question, obviously agreeing that the Secretary of the Interi- or had standing to bring the action. While the facts of this case are remote from those of our instant litigation, the case does plainly stand for the proposition that a department of government may have judicial standing to challenge the decision of another department concerning the proper interpretation of legislative enactments under which both departments have been given responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The standing of the Director of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs to litigate in relation to Department of Labor Compensation Programs has been repeatedly recognized by the courts in recent years. Since the adoption of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 701.201 and 701.-202, the Director has appeared and been recognized by the United States courts involved in at least 35 cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The standing issue has been dealt with in seven cases in the Courts of Appeals. Four of these cases have directly upheld the Director\u2019s standing as a party before the Courts of Appeals. <em>Krolick Contracting Co. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>558 F.2d 685, 689 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Maritime Terminals </em>v.

Benefits Review Board, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 302, 514 F.2d 198 (1975), the court granted the Board\u2019s motion to be dismissed as a party respondent. The Director\u2019s status as petitioner in a companion case was unchallenged. See <em>id. </em>at 199 n.1; <em>McCord v. Cephas, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 302, 532 F.2d 1337 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In <em>I. T. O. Corp. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>542 F.2d 903 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Adkins v. I. T. O. </em>Corp.,- U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 2967, 53 L.Ed.2d 1088 (1977), the majority of the en banc court for the Fourth Circuit held that \u201cThe Director is not automatically a respondent in a review proceeding under \u00a7 921(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909. Having so decided, however, the majority then invited the Director to seek to intervene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">The Director unquestionably has a right to seek to intervene under Rule 24(b) Fed.R.Civ.P., and an application will ordinarily be granted. See 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice H 24.10[5]; 7A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1912. The Director has not, however, sought intervention in these cases. We assume that he has not done so because he does not wish to render moot his assertion that such a request on his part is unnecessary. Having decided that such a request is necessary, we will still consider such a request on his part should he be advised to make it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 909. (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">It appears that the Fourth Circuit was deciding whether the Director should automatically be substituted for the Benefits Review Board when a party which had lost before that body sought Courts of Appeals review. Our case is distinguishable in that the Benefits Review Board has not sought to appear and the Director is the sole representative of the Department of Labor before this court and has initiated the appeal. We believe that it is the responsibility of the Secretary of Labor to determine the proper representative of his department before this court \u2014 and that, as outlined above, he has done so. (A panel of the Fourth Circuit has just issued an opinion holding that the Director does have standing to bring an action to review a decision of the Benefits Review Board in a black lung benefits case. <em>Director v. National Mines Corp., supra, </em>at 1271-72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Finally, we respectfully disagree with the per curiam opinion (discussed above) recently issued by a panel of the Third Circuit in <em>Director v. Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>(3d Cir. Jan. 17, 1977). (This per curiam opinion has been overruled by another panel of the Third Circuit, characterized it as inconsistent with that Court\u2019s prior published opinions. <em>Krolick Contracting Go. v. Benefits Review Board, supra, </em>at 689.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the reasons outlined above, we hold that there is ample adversity present in our instant litigation to make the Director \u201can adverse party litigant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Since the Benefits Review Board has not appeared or sought to appear in our present case, we find no need to decide more than that it is not a necessary party. <em>See generally I.T.O. Corp. </em>v. <em>Benefits Review Board, 542 </em>F.2d 903 (4th Cir. 1976) (en banc), <em>vacated on other grounds sub. nom. Adkins v.

Dellaventura, </em>544 F.2d 35, 42-43 n.5 (2d Cir. 1976) (dicta). The Congressional scheme in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act Amendments of 1972 appears to us to have intended the substitution of an agency review board for the preceding review of the United States District Courts. Technically, the Benefits Review Board is a part of the Department of Labor, but actually it is independent of it as far as policy and decision making are concerned. We do not find in the Act any Congressional intention to allow the Secretary of Labor to dictate Benefits Review Board decisions or any intention to_ compel the Secretary or his duly designated representative to accept them without recourse to the courts when he conscientiously disagrees. Just as a District Court is not a necessary party in this court for review of its decision, we hold the Benefits Review Board is likewise not a necessary party to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">WERE THE HEARINGS IN THESE CASES BEFORE HEARING OFFICERS WHO WERE NOT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105 PROPERLY AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND REGULATION?</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Since in Part I of this opinion we have held that the review procedures of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act as amended in 1972 were made applicable to the Black Lung Act by Congress, we begin our consideration of the third question in this case by quoting the provision of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 which squarely provided for hearings before Administrative Law Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">In 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(d) (Supp. V, 1975), Congress provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">\u00a7 919. Procedure in respect of claims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-16\">(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any hearing held under this chapter shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 554 of Title 5. Any such hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner qualified under section 3105 of that Title. All powers, duties, and responsibilities vested by this chapter, on October 27, 1972, in the deputy commissioners with respect to such hearings shall be vested in such hearing examiners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">In turn, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105 (1970) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">\u00a7 3105. Appointment of hearing examiners.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-18\">Each agency shall appoint as many hearings examiners as are necessary for proceedings required to be conducted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>accordance with sections 556 and 557 of this title. Hearing examiners shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable, and may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as hearing examiners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The original intent of Congress to have Black Lung Act cases heard and adjudicated before Administrative Law Judges is clear. Subsequent history also clearly indicates that the Congressional intent in this regard was frustrated and that Congress specifically and repeatedly authorized the deviation from the Administrative Law Judge requirement which the Secretary authorized by regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">After passage of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 (which included 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(d) (Supp. V, 1975)), the Secretary of Labor sought to implement the statute by asking the Civil Service Commission to supply the needed Administrative Law Judges. The Civil Service Commission responded by asserting that Congress had failed properly to incorporate the Longshoremen\u2019s Act Amendments of 1972 into the Black Lung Act of 1972 because the latter was adopted before the former. This, of course, is the identical argument which we have dealt with and rejected in Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Faced by the probability of years of delay while this legal dispute wended its way through administrative channels to the Benefits Review Board and thence to the Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court, the Congress enacted amendments to appropriation acts in a series of years. These enactments expressly authorized the Secretary to employ qualified hearing officers who were <em>not </em>Administrative Law Judges chosen under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105 (1970). Typical of these amendments is the language of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare Appropriation Act, 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-192, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 87 Stat. 746, 758 (1973):</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">For carrying out title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, including the payment of travel expenses either on an actual cost or commuted basis, to an individual for travel incident to medical examinations, and to parties, their representatives and all reasonably necessary witnesses for travel within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, to reconsideration interviews and to proceedings before administrative law judges, $967,868,000: <em>Provided, </em>That such amounts as may be agreed upon by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Postal Service shall be used for payment, in such manner as said parties may jointly determine, of postage for the transmission of official mail matter by States in connection with the administration of said Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">Benefit payments after April 30: For making, after April 30 of the current fiscal year, payments to entitled beneficiaries under title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, for the last two months of the current fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary, the obligations and expenditures therefor to be charged to the appropriation for the succeeding fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">\n<em>Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds it will promote the achievement of the provisions of title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, qualified persons may be appointed to conduct hearings thereunder without meeting the requirements for administrative law judges appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105, but such appointments shall terminate not later than December 31, 1974: Provided, That no person shall hold a hearing in any case with which he has been concerned previously in the administration of such title.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-12\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\"><em>See also </em>Pub.L.

This, however, does not serve to warrant our invalidation of the enactments cited or quoted above. The United States Constitution conveys all legislative power to the Congress (U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 l).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The legislative power clearly encompasses Congress\u2019 right to make its own rules \u2014 to change them \u2014 and to ignore them if it sees fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Respondent\u2019s reliance upon <em>Wong Yang Sun v. McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616 (1950), for a contrary result is misplaced. Congress in that case had adopted no act authorizing deviation from the Administrative Law Judge requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 51-53, 70 S.Ct. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Faced with a case in which a purported amendment via an appropriation bill had finally been passed after being twice struck from a prior appropriation act on points of order founded on the very rules relied upon by the respondents <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>310 U.S. 554, 558-60, 60 S.Ct. 1034, 84 L.Ed. 1356 (1940)), the Supreme Court concluded that the appropriation act had suspended a section of substantive law, saying at one point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">There can be no doubt that Congress could suspend or repeal the authorization contained in \u00a7 9; and it could accomplish its purpose by an amendment to an appropriation bill, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Dickerson, supra </em>at 555, 60 S.Ct. at 1035.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">The Secretary of Labor adopted 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 715.101(a)(27) (1976) in pursuance of Congressional authorization cited above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">(27) \u201cHearing officer\u201d means a hearing officer appointed by the Secretary of Labor to conduct formal hearings in respect of claims for benefits under section 415 and Part C of the Act.

Hearing officers shall to the extent possible conduct all formal proceedings over which they preside in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 554, et seq. as such provisions are interpreted by Parts 720 and 725 of this chapter. Hearing officers shall be organizationally placed in the Office of Administrative Law Judges and shall be under the direct supervision of the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">We hold that this regulation is entirely consistent with the language of the applicable appropriation acts and within the Secretary\u2019s rulemaking power.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We note, of course, respondents\u2019 argument that the appropriation act amendments should be construed to apply only to hearings pertaining to federal liability for black lung benefits and that a higher standard of hearing officer should or must be employed to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>cases potentially involving the liability of coal operators. We find, however, nothing in the language of the statutes concerned to support this view. We also find no legislative history or common sense to support the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In dealing with this same issue, the Seventh Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">Because the respondents\u2019 narrow reading of the purposes of the appropriations acts cannot stand once their language is traced through all the labyrinthal statutory cross-references, we are constrained to agree with the Director that the authority contained in P.L. 93-192 and its successors amply supports the promulgation of the amended regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">Indeed, we note that the failure to promulgate a regulation such as 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 715.101(a)(27) would have brought the FCMHSA benefits program to a grinding halt and frustrated the Congressional intent that miners and their relatives receive benefits. Even if we regarded the respondents\u2019 reading of the appropriations acts as plausible, which we do not, we conclude that they have not overcome the presumptive validity of the contested regulation. <em>See generally Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v.
