The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">During 1969, Chris-Craft and Bangor Punta Corporation (Bangor Punta) were engaged in a battle for control of Piper. To induce Piper shareholders to surrender their stock, Chris-Craft made a number of cash tender and stock exchange offers, the last of which expired on August 4, 1969. On July 18,1969, Bangor Punta filed a prospectus and extended a competing exchange offer. On August 1, 1975, plaintiff commenced this suit against Bangor Punta and The First Boston Corporation, an investment adviser and underwriter, and named as additional defendants certain officers of these corporations and of Piper. His theory of action was that a series of misstatements and omissions by defendants between January and mid-July 1969 induced a number of Piper shareholders not to accept Chris-Craft\u2019s final exchange offer. The last wrongful act alleged in the complaint was the overevaluation of an asset in the July 18 Bangor Punta prospectus.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">The trial court held that plaintiff\u2019s action was governed by a six-year statute of limitation which ran from the last fraudulent act committed by defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because this had occurred on July 18, 1969 and plaintiff did not sue until August 1, 1975, the court found his action to be time-barred. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prescribes no period of limitation for actions brought thereunder. In such a situation, federal courts apply those statutes of limitation of the forum state which best effectuate the policies underlying the federal statute. <em>Arneil v. Ramsey, </em>550 F.2d 774, 779 (2d Cir. 1977). In actions alleging fraudulent violations of the federal securities law, this court has consistently adopted state statutes of limitation for actions based upon common law fraud. <em>See, e. g., Klein v. Shields &amp; Co., </em>470 F.2d 1344, 1346 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Klein v. Auchincloss, Parker &amp; Redpath, </em>436 F.2d 339, 341 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>Hoff Research &amp; Development Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Philippine National Bank, </em>426 F.2d 1023 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We look to federal law, however, to determine when the limitation period starts to run. <em>Arneil v. Ramsey, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 780. Under federal law, the statute commences to run when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the alleged fraud or knowledge of facts which in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have led to actual knowledge. <em>Berry Petroleum Co. v. Adams &amp; Peck, </em>518 F.2d 402, 410 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Shields &amp; Co., supra, </em>470 F.2d at 1346-47; <em>Azalea Meats, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muscat, </em>386 F.2d 5, 8-9 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The New York statute of limitation most closely analogous to this federal rule, C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(f), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">[W]here the time within which an action must be commenced is computed from the time when facts were discovered or from the time when facts could with reasonable diligence have been discovered, or from either of such times, the action must be commenced within two years after such actual or imputed discovery .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Because it is undisputed that plaintiff had actual knowledge of defendants\u2019 alleged violations of \u00a7 14 no later than May 10, 1971, this provision, standing alone, would be a clear bar to the present action. <em>Rickel v. Levy, </em>370 F.Supp. 751, 756-57 (E.D.N.Y. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">However, C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(f), read in conjunction with C.P.L.R. \u00a7 213, also permits an action based upon fraud to be brought within six years \u201cfrom the time the cause of action accrued\u201d if this is longer than the two-year period above provided for. \u201cThe result, in an actual fraud suit, is two separately-timed and alternative limitations periods in the case of a delayed discovery: six years from accrual or two years from discovery, whichever is longer.\u201d <em>Hoff Research &amp; Development Laboratories, Inc. v. Philippine National Bank, supra, </em>426 F.2d at 1026 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The alternative six-year period is not measured from the date of the defendant\u2019s last fraudulent act, but from when the plaintiff suffers a loss as a result thereof, <em>Sack v. Low, </em>478 F.2d 360, 365-66 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>i.e., </em>when a plaintiff with assumed knowledge of the fraudulent wrong may assert a claim for relief. <em>Barninger v. National Maritime Union, </em>372 F.Supp. 908, 913 (S.D.N.Y. 1974); Practice Commentary C203:12 7B McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws 125-127 (1976). In the instant case, the District Coprt correctly held that this right accrued promptly following defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The federally created right upon which plaintiff bases his claim is the right to full disclosure of accurate information which would haye helped him to decide whether to retain his stock or surrender it to the takeover bidder. <em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., </em>422 U.S. 49, 58, 95 S.Ct. 2069, 45 L.Ed.2d 12 (1975). Appellant was deprived of this right on July 18, 1969, when the pool of information accessible to Piper shareholders was muddied by Bangor Punta\u2019s allegedly misleading prospectus. Although \u00a7 14(e) does not specifically provide plaintiff a cause of action for this deprivation, such a right to sue has generally been inferred. <em>See, e. g., H.K. Porter Co. v. Nicholson File Co., </em>482 F.2d 421, 424 (1st Cir. 1973). Moreover, it has been extended to both tendering and nontendering shareholders. <em>Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., </em>489 F.2d 579, 596 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 134, 42 L.Ed.2d 113 (1974); <em>Electronic Specialty Co. v. International Controls Corp., </em>409 F.2d 937, 947 (2d Cir. 1969). Whatever uncertainty may attach to these holdings as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s caveat in <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977) need not concern us here. Assuming that plaintiff had a right to sue and, in addition, had immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>knowledge of defendants\u2019 misrepresentations as contemplated by New York\u2019s six year statute of limitation, his right to seek legal relief accrued when the misrepresentations were made. He was not precluded from suit, as he now contends, until Chris-Craft\u2019s tender offer expired unaccepted on August 4, 1969.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regardless of plaintiff\u2019s decision concerning tender of his stock, he might well have sustained damage because of the depressing effect which disclosure of the Bangor Punta overevaluation might have had on the market value of Piper stock. <em>See Electronic Specialty Co. v. International Controls Corp., supra, </em>409 F.2d at 946; cf. <em>Dann v. Studebaker-Packard Corp., </em>288 F.2d 201, 209 (6th Cir. 1961). Because plaintiff, with the knowledge presumed by New York\u2019s six year statute, did have a claim which he could promptly pursue, the District Court correctly rejected his contention that his cause of action did not accrue until Chris-Craft\u2019s tender offer expired on August 4, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Relying upon <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), appellant argues that the six year statute of limitation was tolled for a two year period during which a related class action was pending. In 1972, appellant\u2019s wife, with appellant acting as her attorney, commenced a class action on a complaint almost identical to the one herein. On April 30, 1974, the District Court refused to certify a class in that action, <em>see Stull v. Pool, </em>63 F.R.D. 702 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), and thereafter the case was settled. Appellant now contends that the statute of limitations was tolled from 1972 until 1974 when class action status was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>American Pipe, </em>the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">at least where class action status has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that \u2018the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\u2019 the commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">414 U.S. at 552-53, 94 S.Ct. at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument that this reprieve should be extended to class members who file separate suits after the class action has been terminated and the statute of limitation has expired is completely without merit. \u201c[T]he rule of <em>American Pipe </em>was intended for the benefit of purported members of the class who sought to <em>intervene </em>in the action after class status was denied.\u201d <em>Arneil v. Ramsey, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\">. The story of the attempted takeover is told in <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977). The history of the instant litigation is in the District Court\u2019s opinion reported at 424 F.Supp. 937 (S.D.N.Y.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\">. Although there is substantial support among . legal commentators for an outside cut-off period of limitation which starts to run on the date of the last act constituting the violation, see, e. <em>g., </em>A.L.I.Fed.Sec.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1422(b), (d) (Tent. Drafts Nos. 1-3, 1974); Martin, <em>Statutes of Limitation in 10b-5 Actions, </em>29 Bus.Law 443, 454-57 (1974); Bateman &amp; Keith, <em>Statutes of Limitations Applicable to Private Actions Under SEC Rule 10b-5: Complexity in Need of Reform, </em>39 Mo.L.Rev. 165, 178-80 (1974), we do not read the District Court\u2019s opinion as a literal adoption of this proposal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">. Limitation periods contained in state Blue Sky laws have been utilized by other circuits in a number of Rule 10b-5 cases. <em>See, e. g., LaRosa Building Corp. v. Equitable Life Assur-anee Society, </em>542 F.2d 990 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>518 F.2d 97 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Parrent v. Midwest Rug Mills, Inc., </em>455 F.2d 123 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-5\">. Assuming that plaintiff acquired knowledge of defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, he might have endangered his right of recovery if he sat idle until the Chris-Craft tender offer expired and avoidable damages accrued. \u201cThe purpose of the Securities Exchange Act is to protect the innocent investor, not one who loses his innocence and then waits to see how his investment turns out before he decides to invoke the provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Royal Air Properties, Inc. v. Smith, </em>312 F.2d 210, 213-14 (9th Cir. 1962); see <em>also Hughes v. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co., </em>534 F.2d 156, 175 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 896, 97 S.Ct. 259, 50 L.Ed.2d 180 (1976); <em>Pearlstein v. Scudder &amp; German, </em>527 F.2d 1141, 1145-46 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Lowenschuss v. Kane, </em>520 F.2d 255, 269 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
