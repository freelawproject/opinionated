One of the more recent block grant programs is that for \u201ccommunity developments grants,\u201d authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, \u00a7 103, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5303 (Supp. V 1975). This appeal, apparently the first of its kind to be decided under the 1974 Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires us' to decide whether the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) improperly approved certain applications for community development grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">The City of Hartford, Connecticut, and two of its low-income residents have sued to enjoin seven suburban communities from receiving or expending grants approved by HUD under the Act, principally on the ground that the grant applications either contained no estimate, or an arbitrary, wholly inaccurate estimate, of the number of lower income persons \u201cexpected to reside\u201d within the community, an apparent violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A) (Supp. V 1975). A permanent injunction was entered by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, M. Joseph Blumenfeld, Judge. <em>City of Hartford v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number><em>Hills, </em>408 F.Supp. 889 (D.Conn.1976). The towns of Glastonbury, West Hartford and East Hartford appeal; HUD does not appeal, nor do the other towns that were originally defendants and have been enjoined by the order below. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">A. <em>The Structure of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 established a new system of federal assistance for community development activities, to be administered by HUD, and consolidated and superseded previous categorical programs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each of which had specified purposes and particular statutory and administrative restrictions. Title I, in short, was intended to create a streamlined program dealing comprehensively with urban problems previously addressed in a piecemeal fashion. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 93-693, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2, 48-49, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 4273, 4273-74, 4318-19; H.R. Rep. No. 93-1114, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3 (1974). The community development grants authorized by the Act may be used by localities in a variety of ways related to improvement of the physical and economic environment, such as for the acquisition of blighted land and historic sites, the construction or improvement of street lights and playgrounds, the enforcement of housing codes in deteriorating areas, and the development of community and management planning capabilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5305 (Supp. V 1975); <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.200(a) (1976). The Title I funds may not be used, however, for the construction of housing or the payment of housing allowances, with minor exceptions not relevant here, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 570.201(f), (g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These matters are covered elsewhere in the Act, particularly in Title II, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">In terms of administrative review, Title I represents a compromise between the Administration\u2019s revenue sharing approach, under which communities would have automatically received funds on the basis of objective needs criteria, without any application or review process, and the approach favored by some members of Congress, which would have imposed substantial federal preconditions to grant awards and established elaborate application and review procedures. <em>See generally </em>Fishman, <em>Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974: New Federal and Local Dynamics in Community Development, </em>7 Urban Law. 189, 191-200 (1975). The Act requires that communities apply to HUD, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a) (Supp. V 1975), but limits HUD\u2019s review power in several ways. Cities and counties are declared \u201centitled\u201d to the grant funds, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5306(a), and an application is deemed approved 75 days after receipt by HUD unless the Secretary gives the applicant \u201cspecific reasons for disapproval,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(f). The Secretary must approve an application, moreover, unless she determines, <em>inter alia, </em>that the applicant\u2019s description of community \u201cneeds and objectives is plainly inconsistent with [generally available] facts or data,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, with regard to require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>ments that an applicant comply with certain civil rights laws and provide for citizen participation in the grant planning process, the Secretary may rely upon the \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d of the applicant, rather than make an independent investigation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(5), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">While community development grants may not be used for housing, Title I was designed in part to \u201c[foster] the undertaking of housing and community development activities in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5301(d)(4). Moreover, specific objectives of the Title include provision of \u201ca decent home,\u201d especially for those with low and moderate incomes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5301(c)(3), and \u201cthe spatial de-concentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5301(c)(6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In accordance with these goals, the grant application submitted to HUD must include a \u201chousing assistance plan\u201d (HAP) that \u201caccurately surveys the condition of the housing stock in the community and assesses the housing assistance needs of lower-income persons . . residing in or expected to reside in the community .,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A), with \u201ca realistic annual goal\u201d specified for housing assistance, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(4)(B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The housing needs de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>tailed in the HAP can then be met with funds available under Title II of the Act. Thus (and this is crucial to the case) the HAP serves as the vehicle tying together the community development and housing assistance portions of the Act, in furtherance of the Act\u2019s overall goal of coordination of federal urban efforts, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5301(d). The critical importance of the HAP in the overall scheme of the 1974 Act is underscored in the Act itself<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in the legislative history;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it has been recognized by HUD<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and was fully appreciated by the court below.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">B. <em>Appellants\u2019 Grant Applications</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abp2\">The three suburban towns here involved submitted applications for community development grants to HUD in the spring of 1975, after having first sent the applications \u201cfor review and comment\u201d to the Hartford region\u2019s areawide planning agency, the Capital Region Council of Governments (CRCOG), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(e) (Supp. V 1975). The CRCOG received adverse comments on the HAP and other aspects of the applications from the City of Hartford and a Hartford civil rights group, and it forwarded these comments to HUD. The HUD regional director in Boston, in a late April memorandum to the director of HUD\u2019s Hartford office, found the City\u2019s comments in particular to be \u201cwell documented and of a very serious nature.\u201d In addition, the area director of HUD\u2019s Equal Opportunity Division recommended disapproval of all three applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">While the Hartford office was in the process of reviewing the applications in light of these criticisms, it received a May, 1975, memorandum from HUD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. That memorandum recognized that both grant applicants and HUD were having difficulty estimating the number of low-income persons \u201cexpected to reside in the community,\u201d an estimate central to the HAP, <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra, </em>and suggested possible sources of data from which HUD might develop its own figures. It also gave applicants an option that eventually led to this case; instead of developing its own \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure or accepting HUD\u2019s, a locality could obtain approval of its application simply by \u201cindicat[ing]\u201d the steps it would take to \u201cidentify a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>appropriate needs figure by the time of its second year submission.\u201d The memorandum was quite explicit as to the meaning of this option: HUD would not require the adoption of <em>any </em>\u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure on first year grant applications such as those in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Appellants West Hartford and Glastonbury, along with several other towns, accepted the option offered by HUD and thus submitted- zero figures for the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d portion of the HAPs in the final applications approved by HUD.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The two towns were granted $999,000 and $910,000 respectively. East Hartford\u2019s application had been approved prior to receipt of HUD\u2019s May memorandum, and it contained an \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure of 131, derived exclusively from the waiting list of the town\u2019s public housing authority. East Hartford was granted $440,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">II. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Appellants challenge the standing of both the City of Hartford and the low-income plaintiffs to seek the injunction granted by the court below. The district court concluded that both had standing, 408 F.Supp. at 893-97, but it lacked the benefit of our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Evans v. Lynn, </em>537 F.2d 571, 589 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>45 U.S.L.W. 3346 (U.S. Oct. 29, 1976), which is primarily relevant to the claim of the low-income plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We find <em>Evans </em>to be distinguishable from the instant ease and affirm the district court\u2019s decision upholding the standing of all appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">A. <em>The City of Hartford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">The standing of the City here is dependent upon a showing both that the City has been injured \u201cin fact\u201d by HUD\u2019s approval of the challenged grants and that the interest the City seeks to protect is one \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected ... by the statute.\u201d <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 152-53, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); see <em>Evans v. Lynn, supra, </em>537 F.2d at 592. Since the injury in fact test must be met at the threshold, 537 F.2d at 592; <em>see </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies, </em>\u00a7 22.02-1, at 487 (1976), we turn first to its application to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">The district court found that Hartford had been injured by HUD\u2019s approval of the grants because, if the grants had been disapproved, the amounts allocated for them would have been reallocated, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5306(e) (Supp. V 1975), to other Connecticut \u201cmetropolitan areas\u201d (defined in <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5302(a)(3) to mean \u201cstandard metropolitan statistical areas [SMSAs] as established by the Office of Management and Budget\u201d), among which Hartford would have had a priority position. 408 F.Supp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>894-95. Appellants argue that, under the statute as modified by HUD regulations, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.409(f)(1) (1976), Hartford\u2019s position is no better than that of all other towns \u2014 we would add, except those with disapproved applications \u2014 in the Hartford SMSA. But this demonstrates at most that Hartford\u2019s financial stake may not be as large as the sum of all the grants involved in this litigation; it is a long way from proving that Hartford lacks a stake altogether. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (plaintiff showing \u201cdistinct and palpable injury to himself\u201d has standing, even if large group shares the injury); K. Davis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.02-10, at 507 (\u201cThe line is not between a substantial injury and an insubstantial injury. The line is between injury and no injury.\u201d). Appellant\u2019s argument, moreover, does not recognize that HUD is unlikely to reallocate funds to localities that did not apply originally for community development funds in 1975; with these localities and the seven towns enjoined below eliminated from the reallocation pool, only Hartford and two other towns in the SMSA would remain eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Appellants further argue that reallocation funds will be distributed only to applicants with \u201curgent needs,\u201d citing 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.401(b) (1976) (defining \u201curgent needs\u201d) and <em>id. </em>\u00a7 570.409(d), (f) (establishing criteria and priorities for reallocation), and that Hartford has shown no such needs. There is no indication, however, that Hartford \u2014 a city with a high concentration of lower income and unemployed persons and welfare recipients, <em>see </em>408 F.Supp. at 893-94 n.14, and thus likely to have some of the financial resources problems to which the \u201curgent needs\u201d definition is addressed, <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.401(b) (1976) \u2014 will not be able to make the requisite showing when it applies to HUD for reallocation funds, as it has indicated its intention to do, <em>see City of Hartford v. Hills, </em>408 F.Supp. 879, 885-86 (D.Conn.1975) (decision granting preliminary injunction). Appellants\u2019 argument essentially would require a city to present its reallocation application to the district court, rather than to HUD, before the court makes the decision that releases funds to be reallocated. Such a requirement would be at least wasteful of resources, since the court could decide that HUD had correctly approved challenged grants, and in any event would require a city to make a far more detailed showing of injury than any previous case has required, <em>see Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. at 2208 (plaintiffs need only \u201callege\u201d facts from which it can \u201creasonably ... be inferred that . . . there is a substantial probability\u201d of injury). The strong likelihood that Hartford will receive reallocated funds, while not an absolute certainty, is therefore sufficient to establish that Hartford will \u201cbenefit in a tangible way from the courts\u2019 intervention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 95 S.Ct. at 2210; <em>cf. Evans v. Lynn, supra, </em>537 F.2d at 595 (no injury in fact shown when plaintiffs \u201cclaim[ed] only that, had the grants not been approved, the monies <em>could conceivably </em>have gone to some other, as yet <em>totally imaginary </em>project . which <em>might </em>have\u201d benefited plaintiffs (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">There is a second, less quantifiable way in which the City has been injured by HUD\u2019s approval of the grants. The district court found that \u201c[t]he housing situation in Hartford is bleak,\u201d referring especially to the high concentration of subsidized, low-rent housing in the City relative to the greater Hartford region and to the overcrowding caused by a housing shortage in the City. 408 F.Supp. at 893-94 n.14. The elimination or amelioration of precisely these sorts of problems is an explicit goal of the Act: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c) (Supp. V 1975), quoted in full at note 5 <em>supra, </em>declares that the grants authorized are for the support of activities with such objectives as \u201cthe elimination of slums and blight\u201d and \u201cconditions . detrimental to health, safety, and public welfare,\u201d and, most importantly for present purposes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-8\">the reduction of the isolation of income groups within communities and geographical areas and the promotion of an increase in the diversity and vitality of neighborhoods through the spatial decon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>centration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\"><em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 5301(a)(1) (declaration of Congress that urban problems arise from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe concentration of persons of lower income in central cities\u201d). This spatial de-concentration objective, the district court found, cannot be met unless an estimate is made of the number of lower income persons \u201cexpected to reside\u201d in the community. 408 F.Supp. at 901-02. The Act\u2019s legislative history also suggests a close relationship between spatial deconcentration and the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 93-1114, <em>supra, </em>at 3, 6-7. It follows that, when the Secretary approved applications without these estimates, she was substantially lessening the probability that the towns would use the funds received to promote spatial deconcentration and related objectives. Since Hartford would have been the direct beneficiary of spatial deconcentration efforts by its suburbs \u2014 to take a concrete example, the City\u2019s welfare and housing subsidy outlays would be decreased if large numbers of lower income persons moved to the suburbs \u2014 the City was plainly injured by the Secretary\u2019s approval of grant applications lacking \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">In addition to establishing injury in fact, we take it that Hartford must show that the interest it seeks to protect is \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected ... by the statute.\u201d <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 153, 90 S.Ct. at 830.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute here, like the one in <em>Data Processing, </em>\u201cdo[es] not in terms protect a specified group. But [its] general policy is apparent. . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 90 S.Ct. at 832. The objectives quoted in the preceding paragraph indicate a concern about persons of low and moderate income, but, contrary to appellants\u2019 suggestion, these individuals as individuals are not the only concern of the Act. \u201cThe primary objective of [Title I] is the development of viable urban communities . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c) (Supp. V 1975). In the list of the purposes for which grants are to be awarded, one finds repeated references to this theme, expressed in terms of \u201cthe welfare of the community,\u201d \u201cimprovement of community services,\u201d \u201csound community development,\u201d and \u201cthe revitalization of . . . neighborhoods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5301(c)(1), (4), (6); <em>see </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>As the legal entity responsible for representation of the community as a community, Hartford plainly has an interest that falls within the zone of interests protected by the Act. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion: \u201c[T]here can be no doubt that the statute was intended to ameliorate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>problems facing the City of Hartford.\u201d 408 F.Supp. at 894. Thus, contrary to appellants\u2019 suggestion, Hartford is not suing on behalf of its citizens as <em>parens patriae, </em>but is instead seeking to vindicate interests of its own, which also happen to be, to some extent, congruent with the interests of individual city residents. <em>See California v. Automobile Manufacturers Association (In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31), </em>481 F.2d 122, 131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1045, 94 S.Ct. 551, 38 L.Ed.2d 336 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">B. <em>The Low-Income Plaintiffs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Like the City, the individual plaintiffs \u2014low-income Hartford residents living in substandard housing, according to affidavits accepted by the district court, 408 F.Supp. at 895 &amp; n.18 \u2014 must meet both the injury in fact and zone of interests tests in order to have standing to sue. The latter test is easily met here, since the 1974 Act was intended, and the grant funds must be used, to benefit principally \u201cpersons of low and moderate income,\u201d a phrase repeated throughout 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c) (Supp. V 1975), <em>see </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the specific statutory requirement at issue here, the HAP requirement, involves an assessment of, and planning for, \u201cthe needs of lower-income persons,\u201d both residing in and \u201cexpected to reside\u201d in the locality. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4) (Supp. V 1975); <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra. See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(b)(2) (Supp. V 1975) (grant applicant must certify that its program will \u201cgive maximum feasible priority to activities which will benefit low- or moderate-income families\u201d). It seems clear that Title I\u2019s \u201czone of interests\u201d encompasses the interests of low-income residents of a central city.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">The more difficult issue is whether the individual plaintiffs have been injured in fact by the Secretary\u2019s approval of appellants\u2019 grant applications. The absence of such injury led to findings that low-income plaintiffs lacked standing in <em>Warth v. Sel-din, supra, </em>and <em>Evans v. Lynn, supra. </em>Because the facts of both cases were quite different from the facts of the instant case, however, neither is controlling here. In <em>Warth </em>the low-income plaintiffs alleged that they had been excluded from a town\u2019s housing market by virtue of the town\u2019s \u201cexclusionary\u201d zoning ordinance, which they claimed was constitutionally defective. The Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they \u201cpersonally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts\u2019 intervention,\u201d 422 U.S. at 508, 95 S.Ct. 2197, in large part because \u201ctheir inability to reside in [the town] is the consequence of the economics of the area housing market, rather than of respondents\u2019 assert-edly illegal acts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 506, 95 S.Ct. at 2209. Plaintiffs here are asserting a specific violation of a statute, not a generalized claim that a law is unconstitutional, a factor of substantial importance in view of the <em>Warth </em>Court\u2019s recognition that \u201c[t]he actual or threatened injury required by Art. Ill may exist solely by virtue of \u2018statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing . . . <em>Id. </em>at 500, 95 S.Ct. at 2206, <em>quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617 n.3, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). As discussed above, the statute at issue here was designed to protect persons in the plaintiffs\u2019 situation, and the approval of applications lacking legitimate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures in the HAPs appears to have directly injured the plaintiffs, since the HAPs were intended to lead to greater low-income housing opportunities on a deconcentrated, regional basis, <em>see Hills </em>v. <em>Gautreaux, </em>425 U.S. 284, 304-307 n.21, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976). The district court\u2019s intervention, moreover, should be of tangible benefit to the plaintiffs, because it is likely to lead to a reallocation of funds to Hartford, <em>see supra, </em>which will be required to use the funds for the benefit of persons of low and moderate income, in accordance with the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\"><em>Evans v. Lynn </em>is also distinguishable. Although the case has some superficial similarity to the instant' case, in that it was an attempt to enjoin HUD\u2019s award of federal grant funds on statutory grounds, the en banc majority held that the plaintiffs there failed to demonstrate that they had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>injured by the grant awards or that court intervention would be of benefit to them. <em>See </em>537 F.2d at 595. Beyond that, as Judge Mansfield pointed out in his concurring opinion, if the awards to the New York town in <em>Evans </em>had been enjoined, \u201cHUD would presumably [have been] free to use the money to aid construction of sewers and parks in San Francisco.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. HUD does not have any such freedom in the instant case; the statute gives reallocation priority to \u201cmetropolitan area[s] in the same state,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5306(e) (Supp. V 1975), and HUD\u2019s own regulations give priority \u201cto the same metropolitan area,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.409(f)(l)(i) (1976). While \u201c[t]he most\u201d the <em>Evans </em>plaintiffs could expect was \u201cthe satisfaction that federal funds will not be misused,\u201d 537 F.2d at 598 (Mansfield, <em>J., </em>concurring), plaintiffs here can expect concrete benefits resulting from both reallocation of community development funds and increased attention to the low-income housing improvement and spatial deconcentration objectives of the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">III. THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">In considering the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the Housing and Community Development Act was violated by HUD\u2019s approval of the challenged grants, we will examine the claim as to East Hartford separately from that as to West Hartford and Glastonbury, because, as indicated <em>supra, </em>the latter two towns submitted \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures of zero on their HAPs, whereas East Hartford submitted an actual number (131).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">A. <em>West Hartford and Glastonbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjoJ\">In submitting grant applications with zero \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures, the two towns were following the option given to them by HUD in the May, 1975, memorandum. The district court held that this option constituted an invalid waiver of a crucial portion of the 1974 Act, so that the appellants in selecting the option, and HUD in approving the grants, all acted contrary to the Act. 408 F.Supp. at 902. HUD now appears to concur in this holding; its ami-cus brief explicitly declines even partially to contest the district court\u2019s conclusion in this regard and assures us that HUD has modified its regulations to bar zero figures submitted because of an alleged unavailability of data. Brief for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as Amicus Curiae at 16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">We agree with the district court and with the HUD amicus brief. The Act itself could not be more clear: no grant may be made unless the applicant submits an' application with six elements, one of which is the housing assistance plan, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a) (Supp. V 1975); the plan must \u201caccurately\u201d assess the housing needs of low-income persons, \u201cresiding in or expected to reside in the community,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(4XA). <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>Were this the only statutory statement relating to the grant application, it would probably enable us to find that HUD\u2019s memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>improperly authorized a waiver, for the simple reason that, absent some overriding exigency, an administrative agency may not waive an express statutory requirement. <em>Cf. Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 232, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (agency\u2019s decisions must be consistent with governing legislation); <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 967, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965) (courts must prevent \u201cthe unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress\u201d); <em>Marsano v. Laird, </em>412 F.2d 65, 69 (2d Cir. 1969) (\u201can express statutory right cannot be impaired by administrative action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">The Act does give further guidance, however. In the subsection following the application requirements, it allows the Secretary, in certain circumstances, to waive, or accept the applicant\u2019s certification as to five of the six requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(b)(3), (4) (Supp. V 1975). The only requirement not listed is that for the HAP. The conclusion is virtually inescapable that the Secretary lacked discretion to waive the HAP requirement. <em>See </em>408 F.Supp. at 901; text at and notes 7-10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">It is true that, as appellants argue, waiver of submission of the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure is not waiver of the entire HAP requirement. A reading of the whole statute, however, makes it evident that the HAP\u2019s value is substantially undermined by omission of this figure. If an applicant makes no effort to predict the number of lower income persons it expects to reside within its boundaries in the near future, it is difficult to see how the applicant can \u201cspecif[y] a realistic annual goal\u201d for assisted housing or indicate with any reliability where the proposed housing will be located, both of which it must do in order to complete the HAP. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4)(B), (C) (Supp. V 1975); <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>In the legislative history of the Act, Congress \u201cemphasize[dj\u201d the importance of communities, \u201cin assessing their housing needs, looking] beyond the needs of their residents to those who can be expected to reside in the community as well.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 93-1114, <em>supra, </em>at 7. <em>See also </em>408 F.Supp. at 901 (\u201cthe \u2018expected to reside\u2019 figure is the keystone to the <em>spatial decon-\u25a0centration objective </em>of the 1974 Act\u201d (emphasis in original)). Because of the central role of the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d estimate, we think eminently sound Judge Blumen-feld\u2019s conclusion that a waiver of this requirement is in effect a waiver of the entire HAP. <em>See id. </em>at 901-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">Appellants argue in the alternative that the zero figures can be considered legitimate, because the data necessary to make accurate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d estimates was not available. The Secretary was thus forced by practical exigencies, they contend, to \u201cdefer\u201d this requirement. We believe this argument entirely misunderstands the meaning of a statutory directive. When Congress directs that something be done, it should be done, even if the data base is far from perfect. <em>Cf. Adams v. Richardson, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 480 F.2d 1159, 1164 (1973) (en banc) (per curiam) (lack of agency experience in area does not \u201cjustif[y] a failure to comply with a Congressional mandate\u201d); <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>142 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 439 F.2d 584, 592-95 (1971) (agency must take action even if not convinced \u201cbeyond a doubt\u201d as to proper course); L. Tribe, <em>Channeling Technology Through Law </em>33 (1973) (technology assessment frequently amounts to nothing more than \u201creconciling highly imprecise professional hunches\u201d). Congress was presumably aware of the data collection problems localities might face, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 93-1114, <em>supra, </em>at 7, but it apparently preferred an administrative decision based on incomplete data to no decision at all. It is clear that a substantial amount of data was available to the towns; the very HUD memorandum that gave them the zero figure option also listed a variety of data sources from which a reasonable figure could be calculated. Educated guesses by the towns as to how many low-income persons might be expected to reside therein would surely have been better than the sham zero figures in promoting the rational community planning' with which Congress was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>B. <em>East Hartford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The Town of East Hartford did submit an \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure, but the district court concluded that HUD\u2019s review of this figure\u2019s validity was so seriously inadequate as to constitute an abuse of discretion. The figure submitted was based upon a projection of the waiting list of the East Hartford Housing Authority, and HUD failed' to verify in any way whether this figure was a valid one. While HUD sought to justify this failure by asserting an absence of data, HUD\u2019s own regulations, application instructions, and memoranda suggested sources of data that were \u201cgenerally available,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c)(1) (Supp. V 1975), and that should have been used by HUD to verify the accuracy of East Hartford\u2019s figure. Thus, the district court concluded, \u201cHUD was doubly at fault \u2014 it did not obtain the generally available information required for a proper review, and it acted upon the basis of inadequate information.\u201d 408 F.Supp. at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">As the district court recognized, <em>id. </em>at 903 &amp; n.57, the general proposition that review of agency discretion is narrowly circumscribed, <em>see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), is particularly compelling in the case of review of approval of community development grants, since the statute\u2019s application and approval procedures, as discussed <em>supra, </em>establish a \u201cpresumption of approval.\u201d <em>See also Ulster County Community Action Committee, Inc. v. Koenig, </em>402 F.Supp. 986, 990 (S.D.N.Y. 1975); Fishman, <em>supra, </em>7 Urban Law. at 211. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Over-ton Park, </em>however, such a presumption does not \u201cshield [the Secretary\u2019s] action from a thorough, probing, in-depth review.\u201d 401 U.S. at 415, 91 S.Ct. at 823, <em>see Schicke </em>v. <em>Romney, </em>474 F.2d 309, 315 (2d Cir. 1973). This court has plainly held, moreover, that \u201cit is \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 for an agency not to take into account all relevant factors in making its determination.\u201d <em>Hanly v. Mitchell, </em>460 F.2d 640, 648 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 313, 34 L.Ed.2d 256 (1972). At the very least, \u201cascertainable standards\u201d are required. <em>Holmes v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>398 F.2d 262, 265 (2d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">East Hartford argues on appeal that its \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure of 131 was not proven wrong by the district court. This argument misunderstands the role of the courts in reviewing agency action. The district court did not have an obligation, and perhaps lacked the authority, to assess the correctness of East Hartford\u2019s figure. Its role was both more limited and more vital to the proper functioning of the administrative process: to determine \u201cwhether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">It seems clear that HUD made a major \u201cerror of judgment\u201d in not independently investigating East Hartford\u2019s figure. A suburban town\u2019s attempt to ascertain the housing needs of future residents from a waiting list for a limited supply of public housing units is certainly sufficiently questionable to require some further verification. The Court below found that data was \u201cgenerally available\u201d from which such a verification could have been made. Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, 408 F.Supp. at 902-07, we conclude that the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving East Hartford\u2019s grant application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>IV. THE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">The injunction issued by the district court is challenged on the ground that it was directed against appellant towns, rather than against HUD. In view of the fact that HUD had sent letters of credit to the towns by the time the preliminary injunction was issued, so that they were free to obtain grant funds from the Treasury, see <em>City of Hartford v. Hills, supra, </em>408 F.Supp. at 882 (opinion on motion for preliminary injunction), the court\u2019s order restraining the towns (who were defendants) from drawing out or spending these funds appears to be the most direct means of preventing expenditure of unlawfully authorized monies. The injunction provided, moreover, that it could \u201cbe lifted upon the filing with the court of ... a new approval [of the towns\u2019 grant applications].\u201d 408 F.Supp. at 907. Such an injunction, combining a practical means to a desired end with a mechanism to take account of future developments, is consistent with the broad, flexible nature of the federal courts\u2019 equitable powers. <em>See Hills </em>v. <em>Gautreaux, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 296-297, 96 S.Ct. at 1545, 1546, and authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The suggestion is made that the case may be moot as to West Hartford and Glastonbury because they have filed new applications, the 75-day period has run, and they are entitled to funds under the new applications. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(f) (Supp. V 1975). But the injunction relates only to funds granted prior to the time of its entry and is not mooted by any later grants pursuant to later submissions. The injunction may be lifted by filing with the district court new HUD approvals of applications with adequate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">. <em>Hills v.

There was testimony before the district court, moreover, indicating that Hartford\u2019s zero figure was not necessarily a result of HUD\u2019s May memorandum, but was rather based upon consideration of current and projected population trends. Hartford\u2019s Director of Planning stated that Hartford\u2019s population was declining, so that, while its application listed a large number of low-income persons residing in the city, it was expected that any new low-income residents would be offset numerically by others leaving Hartford for the suburbs, where the population was increasing.

Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The taxpayers asserted that the exclusionary zoning policies of a suburb forced the city to provide more public housing, which in turn increased the tax burden on the taxpayer plaintiffs. The <em>Warth </em>Court held they lacked standing on alternative grounds: first, because their injury resulted, not from the challenged zoning policies, but from decisions to build public housing on the part of city officials; and, second, even assuming injury, because plaintiffs were not asserting any personal right to be free \u00f3f the suburb\u2019s adverse zoning policies, but were asserting rights of third parties. 422 U.S. at 508-10, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">By contrast, Hartford\u2019s injury here stems from a decision, not by its own officials, but by the Secretary of HUD, an injury over which Hartford had no control. <em>Cf.

However, before turning to the issue of standing, I should like to comment upon the unusual procedural posture in which East Hartford, West Hartford and Glastonbury (\u201cappellants\u201d) now find themselves. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint originally named HUD, its Secretary, its Regional Administrator and its District Director as the only defendants (the \u201cfederal defendants\u201d). The local defendants (Farm-ington, Windsor Locks, Vernon, Enfield and the appellants) were joined as parties by the federal defendants. At the district court level, the defense of this action, was dominated by the federal defendants, upon whom the local defendants relied to carry the burden of this litigation. This approach was encouraged by the district judge, who, in order to simplify the proceedings, asked the local defendants to \u201ctag along and support the federal defendant [sic] and take the same position.\u201d On January 28, 1976, the district court issued its decision enjoining the local defendants from spending the funds granted under the Block Grant Program. The federal defendants decided not to appeal from that decision because (1) HUD finds the <em>result </em>to be consistent with its present practices, (2) the district court\u2019s opinion can be read in a manner consistent with HUD\u2019s interpretation of its duties under the Act, and (3) the injunction only applies to the seven local defendants. Brief For The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Amicus Curiae at 3. With a few minor exceptions, the brief filed by HUD is in general agreement with the decision of the district court and the position taken by the plaintiffs. The issue of standing is not discussed, for it is outside the scope of the brief. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">Of the seven local defendants thus left holding the bag, three have appealed. All have now learned the hard way that it is not always a good idea to \u201ctag along\u201d with and \u201ctake the same position\u201d as a co-defendant. The three appellants are now represented by counsel who did not participate in any of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>It is relatively easy to see why all of this occurred. HUD of course, has a substantial interest in the manner in which the courts construe the 1974 Act, and so it would naturally want to play a dominant role in any proceeding concerning that Act. The local defendants who were joined as such by HUD would naturally want to rely heavily upon the latter\u2019s expertise. This is particularly true where, as here, the district court asks them to do so in order to simplify the proceedings. As a result of what has occurred, however, much has been lost in terms of the sharpening of the presentation of issues upon which the courts rely so heavily. It is not my intention to disparage counsel\u2019s presentation, for counsel have, in my judgment, done a fine job in that regard. I wish only to point out that it could have been improved if greater foresight had been shown at the district court level. District courts and private counsel can, and should, be alert to the potentially conflicting interests of private litigants and governmental agencies, but governmental agencies bear a special responsibility in this respect. Because of their expertise in their respective fields, and because of the frequency with which they are likely to encounter problems such as that which has arisen here, governmental agencies are in a superior position to foresee and avert those problems. It is to be hoped that in the future agencies such as HUD will make some effort to assure that their co-defendants are made aware of possible conflicts of interest so that other litigants will not find themselves in appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Turning now to the standing issues presented, I believe a brief restatement of the facts is in order. On April 15, 1976, the Hartford Area Office of the\u2019Department of Housing and Urban Development received an application for Community Development Block Grant Assistance filed by the City of Hartford pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. By \u25a0 letter dated June 24,1975, HUD approved a grant to Hartford in the amount of $10,-025,000. Hartford executed a Grant Agreement on July 30, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The towns of East Hartford, West Hartford and Glastonbury followed much the same procedure in applying for Block Grant Assistance, and they were granted $440,000, $999,000 and $910,000, respectively. Hartford and two of its low-income residents now challenge those grants on the ground that the applications submitted by the towns fail to satisfy one of the requirements of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority holds that the plaintiffs have standing to make such a challenge. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">The majority holds that Hartford has satisfied the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d test established in <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150,152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184,187 (1970), .because (1) if the grants to the towns are disapproved, there is a \u201cstrong likelihood,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 1038 that Hartford will receive reallocated funds under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5306(e) (Supp. V 1975),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) HUD\u2019s approval of applications that failed to comply with the statutory requirements \u201csubstantially less<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>en[ed] the probability,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 1039, that Hartford would benefit from the \u201cspatial deconcentration\u201d objective of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Assuming, arguendo, that a potential claim to a fund that will not even exist unless plaintiff is successful on the merits can ever satisfy the injury-in-fact test\u2014 which appears to require a present injury in addition to a prospective benefit \u2014 it is clear that in this case there is not the slightest chance that Hartford will ever receive reallocated funds as a result of this lawsuit. While it may be true that Hartford would have a priority position in applying for reallocated funds, that priority will mean little if there are no funds to reallocate. Despite the indications to the contrary in the majority opinion, Hartford, as the party who asks the Court to assume jurisdiction, bears the burden of proof on the issue of standing <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 44-45, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1927, 48 L.Ed.2d 450, 464 (1976), and although Hartford may have proved that it would have a priority position in applying for reallocated funds, it has failed to prove that the intervention of the federal courts will result in the availability of funds for reallocation. The wrong of which Hartford complains is HUD\u2019s approval of the defendant towns\u2019 allegedly defective applications. If Hartford is correct that the applications were defective, and that HUD abused its discretion in approving them, Hartford would not be entitled to relief preventing the defendant towns from ever receiving their grants. Hartford would be entitled only to an injunction pending the submission of acceptable applications \u2014 precisely what it sought, and precisely what the district court granted. Such an injunction would result in the availability of funds for reallocation only if the towns forfeited their grants by failing to submit acceptable applications. West Hartford and Glastonbury have already submitted new applications, thereby negating any possible inference that they intend to forfeit their grants \u2014 in addition to creating a substantial mootness problem \u2014 and there is not the slightest indi-' cation that East Hartford has any intention of forfeiting its $440,000 grant by failing to do likewise. It is sheer fantasy to suppose that Hartford will ever receive reallocated funds as a result of the intervention of the federal courts. In my view, Hartford\u2019s asserted interest in reallocated funds is even more speculative than the interest found to be not judicially cognizable in <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973), and, accordingly, I would hold that it is insufficient to confer standing upon Hartford.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">The majority also finds standing on the basis of \u201ca second, less quantifiable,\u201d injury suffered by Hartford, <em>ante, </em>at 1038. That injury is the \u201cbleak\u201d housing situation that exists in Hartford. That situation will be improved, we are told, if the suburbs are required to include accurate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures in their applications for Block Grants. This injury is insufficient to confer standing for three reasons. First, it cannot fairly be said that the housing situation in Hartford is a result of, or can be traced to, the challenged action of the defendants. <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, at 1926. Second, the possibility that the inclusion of accurate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures will result in the betterment of the housing condition in Hartford is at least as remote and speculative as the possibility in <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., supra, </em>that the prosecution of an unwed father for failing to support his child will result in the payment of support. Third, and more important, Hartford may not properly assert an interest in improving its bleak housing situation in an action against the federal government. The doctrine of <em>Massachusetts v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), places strict limits on the power of states to represent their citizens in actions against the federal government. <em>See, e.g., Com. of Pa., by Shapp v. Kleppe, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 441, 533 F.2d 668, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 977, 97 S.Ct. 485, 50 L.Ed.2d 584 (1976). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>power of a political subdivision of a state is even more rigidly circumscribed. As the majority recognizes, <em>ante, </em>at 1040, a city cannot sue as <em>parens patriae, </em>but is limited to the vindication of such of its own proprietary rights as might be congruent with the interests of its residents. <em>California v. Auto. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. (In Re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31), </em>481 F.2d 122, 131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1045, 94 S.Ct. 551, 38 L.Ed.2d 336 (1973). Hartford\u2019s assertion of an interest in improving its bleak housing situation is nothing more than an attempt to vindicate a general' interest in the social and economic well-being of the citizenry. Even a state would encounter serious difficulties in asserting such an interest against the federal government, and it can hardly be said that this is the sort of proprietary interest which Hartford may assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Merely because Hartford may not assert the rights of its citizenry in a representative capacity does not mean that individual citizens may not assert their own rights. Accordingly, I next turn to the claims of the low-income plaintiffs to determine whether they have alleged a stake in the outcome sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The individual plaintiffs in this case are low-income residents of Hartford who live in substandard housing and who have sought, unsuccessfully, to secure affordable housing in the suburbs. There is, of course, no question that an individual who is, effectively, trapped in a slum suffers a serious, present and continuing injury. Abstract injury alone, however, is insufficient to confer standing. <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., supra, </em>410 U.S. at 618, 93 S.Ct. at 1149. The injury alleged must fairly be traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and the desired exercise of the Court\u2019s remedial powers must in some perceptible way serve to remove the harm. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 40-46, 96 S.Ct. at 1925-1928. The majority is correct in holding that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those of <em>Warth </em>and Evans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the distinctions are not great enough in my judgment, to justify the conclusion reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">To begin with, the bleak housing situation in Hartford is not the product of HUD\u2019s failure to require the defendant towns to include \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures in their applications for Block Grants under the 1974 Act. The housing situation in Hartford was bleak long before 1974. Nor are the specific conditions of which the plaintiffs complain a product of HUD\u2019s alleged abuse of discretion. Plaintiff Jordan had been living at her present address for two years as of June 30,1975, and therefore her plight antedates the Act by roughly one year. Plaintiff Mauldin\u2019s position is no stronger. She moved to Hartford approximately one month before David Meeker wrote his memorandum \u201cwaiving\u201d the requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A) (Supp. V 1975). Of course, Mrs. Mauldin\u2019s plight has nothing to do with acts of Congress or HUD or David Meeker\u2019s memorandum. Her plight is the direct result of the fact that her husband became incapacitated. That incapacitation led to his unemployment, which, in turn, led to the loss, through foreclosure, of the family home in the suburban town of Bloomfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">As indicated above, the injury suffered by the individual plaintiffs is a continuing one. However, because the basic injury of which the plaintiffs complain antedated the action they challenge, they would have standing only if they can allege that their injury has been, or will in fact be perceptibly aggravated by the challenged action. The plaintiffs have not made, and, indeed, could not make, such an allegation. HUD\u2019s failure to require the defendant towns to include \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures in their applications for Block Grants did not make the plaintiffs\u2019 situation worse, but merely left it the same. The \u201cwaiver\u201d of the requirement by HUD did not have a negative effect. It merely failed to produce the hoped-for positive effect. Thus, the low-in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>come plaintiffs\u2019 claim of standing, like that of the City of Hartford, depends not upon a present injury that has been caused by HUD\u2019s allegedly unlawful action, but upon a prospective benefit that they hope will accrue if the federal courts intervene and require the inclusion of accurate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures. The standing <em>vel non </em>of plaintiffs with such claims depends upon whether there is a direct nexus between the vindication of their interests and the relief they seek, or whether the prospect that their lot will be improved by the desired exercise of the Court\u2019s remedial powers is merely speculative. <em>See Linda R. S. v. Richard D., supra, </em>410 U.S. at 618-19, 93 S.Ct. 1149. The most recent applications of these standards by the Supreme Court place formidable barriers in the way of actions such as the one now before this Court. <em>See, e.g., Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra. </em>The plaintiffs have not, in my view, successfully cleared those barriers. It is naive to imagine that plaintiffs\u2019 lot will be perceptibly improved merely by coercing the defendant towns into including accurate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figures in their Block Grant applications. The \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure lacks the magical power that would be required to produce such a result. The causes of the housing problems that plague the cities of this Nation are legion. Suggested cures for those problems are complex and equally numerous. The \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure is a new and relatively small part of the federal government\u2019s attack on urban housing problems. Its impact on those problems is unknown and unmeasurable. The prospect that it will have the desired impact or that its impact will be perceptible is gos-samery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the complaint does not demonstrate, and the plaintiffs could not possibly show, a substantial likelihood that victory in this suit would result in their securing the adequate, low-cost housing that they desire. <em>See, Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 44-46, 96 S.Ct. at 1927. Accordingly, I would hold that the low-income plaintiffs, like the City of Hartford, lack standing to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">The judgment of the district court should be vacated and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">ON REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">, \u2022 \u00abBefore KAUFMAN, Chief Judge, and SMITH, FEINBERG, MANSFIELD, MULLIGAN, OAKES, TIMBERS, GURFEIN, VAN GRAAFEILAND and MESKILL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, M.

Joseph Blumen-feld, Judge, held that the City of Hartford and two of its low-income residents have standing to challenge the propriety of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (\u201cHUD\u201d) approval of federal grants-in-aid to seven suburban communities in the Hartford area. On the merits, the District Court held that HUD had acted unlawfully in approving the grants. The communities were enjoined from drawing upon the Treasury or spending their funds pending the submission of lawful applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>tions. 408 F.Supp. 889 (D.Conn.1976). Three of the suburban communities appealed, and on December 23, 1976, a divided panel of this Court affirmed. The appellants petitioned for a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>It was urged that the jurisdictional issue was one of exceptional importance because it involves the standing of a municipality and its residents to challenge federal grants to a separate municipality. It was also urged that a rehearing <em>en banc </em>was necessary in order to secure uniformity of our decisions. A majority of the active judges agreed, and pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 35(a) a rehearing was ordered on February 8, 1977. The appeal was submitted without further oral argument. We reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The material facts of this dispute have been set forth in the opinions of the panel majority and dissent. Except for a further explanation of the nature of the so-called \u201cexpected to reside figure\u201d \u2014 which is essential to an understanding of the issue of standing \u2014 the facts of this case will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">In order to obtain assistance under the Community Development Block Grant program created by Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201c1974 Act\u201d), a town must submit an application to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. That application must include, among other things, a \u201chousing assistance plan.\u201d According to HUD\u2019s general instructions for the completion of the Housing Assistance Plan forms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-8\">The Housing Assistance Plan section of the Community Development Block Grant application consists of four forms and a map, with narrative explanations, showing, respectively: I. Survey of Housing Conditions; II. Housing Assistance Needs of Lower Income Households; III. Annual Goal for Housing Assistance; and IV. General Locations for Lower Income Housing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">Form II is designed to satisfy the community\u2019s obligation to \u201caccurately . . . [assess] the housing assistance needs of lower-income persons ... in the community.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A). That assessment must account for low-income persons who (1) actually reside in the community, (2) are displaced or are to be displaced, or (3) are expected to reside in the community. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cexpected to reside figure\u201d at issue in this case represents the number of persons in this third category. Put another way, the expected to reside figure is a relatively small part of a very large application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">The expected to reside figure is merely an educated guess at the number of people who are going to move into the community. HUD\u2019s regulations refer to it as an \u201cestimate.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.303(c)(2). During 1975, the first year in which the Act was in effect, it became clear that accurate predictions of the future would not be easy to make. The methodologies used by many communities were unsophisticated, and it was difficult to obtain reliable data. These difficulties eventually led HUD to waive the requirement of an expected to reside figure, on the condition that towns indicate on their applications what steps they planned to take in 1976 to arrive at acceptable estimates. The requirement was not waived in later years, and current regulations give applicants considerably more guidance than did those in effect in 1975. Nevertheless, the expected to reside figure remains a guess, albeit a better educated one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">A community\u2019s estimate of the number of low-income persons expected to reside within its borders has never been a self-fulfilling prophecy. The figure entered on a community\u2019s application does not alter its future population, but merely predicts it. It is theoretically possible for an expected to reside figure to influence the future availability of low-income housing in a given community, because federal housing as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>sistance subsidies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are allocated to communities based in part on the anticipated needs reflected in their housing assistance plans. <em>See </em>Title II of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, \u00a7 213(d)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1439(d)(1). In this case, however, the housing assistance plans submitted by the defendant towns fully utilized all available Title II funds. Therefore, even if the seven defendant communities had revised their expected to reside figures upward, no additional housing subsidies would have been obtained, because no additional funds were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">With this background, we turn to the issue of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The plaintiffs in this action challenged the legality of HUD\u2019s waiver of the expected to reside requirement. It is our task to determine whether they have standing to make such a challenge. The applicable standards are clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-7\">The essence of the standing question, in its constitutional dimension, \u201cis whether the plaintiff has \u2018alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\u2019 as to warrant <em>his </em>invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on his behalf.\u201d . . . The plaintiff must show that he himself is injured by the challenged action of the defendant. The injury may be indirect . . . but the complaint must indicate that the injury is indeed fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\"><em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 260, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (citations omitted). Furthermore, the plaintiff\u2019s injury must be one which is \u201clikely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). In other words, a \u00a1plaintiff must show injury; he must trace it to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful acts; and he must show that the remedy he seeks is likely to redress his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">Our analysis of this case begins with an examination of the injury alleged by the plaintiffs. The 1974 Act, it is claimed, was intended to benefit the plaintiffs in various ways. Specifically, it is designed to eliminate urban blight and create viable urban communities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c). It is also designed to reduce \u201cthe isolation of income groups within communities and geographical areas\u201d and to increase \u201cthe diversity and vitality of neighborhoods.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c)(6). These latter objectives are to be achieved by means of \u201cthe spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income\u201d and by means of \u201cattracting] persons of higher income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs allege that the Act is designed to encourage the wealthy to return to the cities and to facilitate the movement of the poor into the suburbs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">The plaintiffs claim that the defendants\u2019 unlawful acts \u2014 the submission and approval of applications without expected to reside figures \u2014 caused them injury because it made them less likely to benefit from the 1974 Act. This is said to injure both Hartford, which must bear the heavy burden of caring for its low-income residents, and the low-income residents themselves, who cannot find adequate housing in the suburbs. These claims will not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-16\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the plaintiffs have a legitimate, judicially cognizable expectancy interest in the benefits that should accrue to them under the Act, it is impossible to know whether the lack of expected to reside figures on the first year applications submitted by the defendant towns had, or will have, any detrimental effect on that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>If this were an appeal from a judgment granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of standing, we woiild be required to accept as true all of the material allegations of the complaint. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). However, we are reviewing a final judgment based on a fully developed record, and the issue of standing is one on which the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. <em>See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Wei fare Rights Organization, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 45, 96 S.Ct. at 1927. In this context, plaintiffs have either proved a \u201cspecific and perceptible harm,\u201d <em>United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 689, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973), or they have not. Here, they have not. It is theoretically possible that a failure to comply with <em>any </em>requirement in the Act will have a negative effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 expectancy interest. In order to have standing, however, the plaintiffs must show more than a theoretical possibly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-5\">A plaintiff must [prove] that he has been or will in fact be perceptibly harmed by the challenged agency action, not that he can imagine circumstances in which he could be affected by the agency\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOix\"><em>United States v. SCRAP, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 688-89, 93 S.Ct. at 2416. Here, it is probable that the lack of compliance with the Act did not affect plaintiffs at all. The defendant towns\u2019 housing assistance plans have fully utilized all of the funds available for low-income housing subsidies under Title II of the Act. Because the only effect of the expected to reside figure is indirect \u2014 via Title II subsidies \u2014 and because no additional Title II subsidies are available, it is unlikely that the lack of expected to reside figures had any effect on the interests of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Moreover, it is speculative whether the relief sought by the plaintiffs \u2014 an injunction against the use of Title I funds pending the submission of applications complying with the Act \u2014 will redress their alleged injury. The only evidence in the record indicating the probable effect of increased expected to reside figures is contained in an affidavit from Lawrence L. Thompson, the Area Director of the Hartford Area Office of HUD. According to his affidavit, an upward revision of the defendant towns\u2019 expected to reside figures could not make additional housing subsidies available. Consequently, the prospect that the submission of accurate expected to reside figures sought by the plaintiffs will have a positive effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 expectancy interest is at best speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">The expected to reside figure is not a goal for the future which communities are required to satisfy, but merely a prediction of what is going to happen. It is a device used to plan for future population changes, not a device for achieving them. A modification of the expected to reside figure would have no greater impact on the number of future residents than a modification of tomorrow\u2019s weather forecast would have on tomorrow\u2019s weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">Much has been made in this case of the fact that if the defendant communities fail, or refuse to comply with the Act, their grants will be reallocated. This, it is claimed, will lead to the possibility that the plaintiffs would benefit from the reallocation of funds. This theory also is inadequate to support standing in the instant case. The relief sought and obtained by the plaintiffs left the defendants two choices: they could revise their figures and receive their grants, or they could refuse to comply and forfeit their grants. Inasmuch as the first alternative would produce no benefit for plaintiffs, it is immaterial whether they might benefit from\u2019 the second \u2014 at least absent a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that the second alternative will in fact be chosen. <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. 2197. Here, there was not the slightest showing that any of the defendant towns would choose to forfeit their grants rather than modify their applications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to trace their alleged injury to the allegedly unlawful conduct of the defendants, and they have failed to demonstrate that the relief they seek would serve to redress that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the appellees lack standing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">. Of the eight municipal governments, including the City of Hartford, who were parties to this action, only one, East Hartford, made any attempt to satisfy the requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A) (Supp. V 1975). Thus, Hartford and six of the defendant towns entered zero as the number of low-income persons \u201cexpected to reside\u201d within their borders. East Hartford entered 135. HUD subsequently reduced this figure to 131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">. The complaint does not mention the possibility of obtaining reallocated funds as a prospective benefit of this lawsuit. To find that the plaintiffs have alleged a stake in the outcome sufficient to confer standing on the basis of a prospective benefit that is not even mentioned in the complaint is to grant far greater pleading latitude than prior cases indicate is appropriate. <em>See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 37-46, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924-28, 48 L.Ed.2d 450, 460-465 (1976) ; <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501-02, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>United States v.

It is true, of course, that Congress expects, or at least hopes, that the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure will have some impact. However, legislative expectations are not necessarily disposi-tive in determining whether those expectations are speculative. <em>See Linda R. S. v.

We learn from events which have occurred after the district court rendered its decision that five of the original seven defendant towns have already revised their expected to reside figures and their applications now meet the approval of both HUD and the plaintiffs. Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>the appellants, only East Hartford has not yet submitted a revised figure. East Hartford\u2019s failure to do so is consistent with its position that the figure of 131 included on its application was in fact correct. It has been suggested that East Hartford may be barred from revising its figure as a result of its failure to comply with a deadline for resubmission set by HUD after the district court\u2019s decree was entered. We need not consider what would happen if HUD, as one of the defendants in this action, sought, by means of such a deadline, to prevent East Hartford from following an order of the district court to comply with the 1974 Act. We have no doubt that HUD would be happy to permit East Hartford to correct its application, particularly if the Court held that the Act so required. In any event, the plaintiffs\u2019 standing must be judged as of the time this action was commenced. At that time, the prospect that East Hartford would forfeit its grant was even more remote than it is now. Events occurring after the filing of the complaint cannot operate so as to create standing where none previously existed. Any other rule would permit lawsuits to be maintained in the mere hope that the lawsuit itself would generate a constitutional \u201ccontroversy\u201d before the appellate process is complete.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1110-5\">IRVING R. KAUFMAN, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AHtR\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">I had occasion, earlier this Term, to compare some of the laws we are called upon to interpret to King Minos\u2019s labyrinth in ancient Crete, <em>Lok v. I.N.S., </em>548 F.2d 37, 38 (2d Cir. 1977). Surely this is another case in point. Judge Oakes in his opinion for the panel found the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d estimate the lynchpin of the statutory scheme, and the principal means by which the legislative objective of spatial deconcentration of low-income housing may be achieved. <em>Hartford v. Glastonbury, </em>561 F.2d 1032, 1035-1036 (2d Cir. 1976). The majority, in contrast, characterizes it as merely \u201ca relatively very small part of a very large application\u201d, <em>supra </em>at 1049. The facts before us do not require a choice between these two radically different views of the statutory pattern. Nor do I understand the majority\u2019s decision to be based on its evaluation of the importance of the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure. I would, therefore, reverse without intimating any view concerning the general legislative pattern. At best an eagerness to characterize the statute will be treated as <em>obiter dictum </em>in future cases; at worst, we risk prejudging situations yet unforeseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">The test we must apply to measure standing is a deceptively simple one: is there a substantial likelihood that the City of Hartford or the individual appellees will benefit personally from the injunction they seek? <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). The decree entered by the district court afforded the suburban towns two options: to submit a revised application for a community development grant, including a realistic \u201cexpected to reside estimate,\u201d or to forego HUD funds for FY 1975. I believe that where, as here, the relief sought permits the defendant two entirely practical options, <em>Simon </em>requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a substantial probability of benefit regardless of which course of action the defendant elects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">The appellees\u2019 principal objective in commencing this lawsuit was; of course, to compel the suburban towns to comply with the law. Hartford maintains that it will receive the very benefit Congress intended if the suburban towns successfully reapply for community development grants: relief from the burden flowing from concentration of low income people, all too often members of minorities, in the central city.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-12\">Considered abstractly, this argument has appeal. In our system of coordinate powers, the courts must ordinarily respect legislative judgments concerning the efficacy of statutes. <em>See Katzenbach v. Morgan, </em>384 U.S. 641, 652-56, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 16 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>828 (1966); Cox, <em>The Role of Congress in Constitutional Determinations, </em>40 U. Cincinnati L.Rev. 199 (1971). Any other policy would require the judiciary to indulge in an independent assessment of the wisdom of Congressional action. To declare a duty prescribed by Congress too \u201cspeculative\u201d to be enforced by an aggrieved litigant is tantamount to saying it shall not be enforced at all. Therefore, although there should not be blind deference to legislatures, see <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973) (involving \u201cspecial status of criminal prosecutions in our system\u201d), I would be exceedingly loathe to label \u201cspeculative\u201d a chain of causation that, on the appellees\u2019 interpretation of the applicable law, Congress must have considered plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Under the unusual circumstances presented here, however, it is not necessary to question congressional factfinding to conclude that neither Hartford nor the individual appellees would benefit from compelling the suburbs to comply with the Act in 1975. I must emphasize that the action of HUD challenged in this suit is extremely limited. HUD did not permanently waive the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d requirement, but rather approved <em>first year </em>applications without the needed figures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, general statements that the \u201cexpected to reside\u201d figure is critical to achieving the overall statutory purpose of promoting de-concentration of low-income housing are beside the point: the essential issue is whether Hartford will benefit from the desired revision of the suburbs\u2019 FY 1975 application for community development funds. It is impossible to show that <em>any </em>housing units are likely to be built as a result of the Towns\u2019 eventual compliance with the \u201cexpected to reside requirement\u201d in their FY 1975 application. Indeed, since the suburbs received the maximum available subsidies for low and moderate income housing that year, it is inconceivable that submitting an adequate \u201cexpected to reside\u201d estimate could have any effect on deconcentration of housing for the poor in the Hartford metropolitan area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">A great deal has been made of the possibility that the City of Hartford will be near the front of the queue for funds available for reallocation as a result of East Hartford\u2019s failure to reapply. But, as Judge Meskill points out, standing cannot be established by hindsight. It must be assessed at the outset of a lawsuit. <em>See, The Supreme Court, </em>1975 Term, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 56, 210 (1976). It would be absurd \u2014 and wasteful \u2014 to permit litigation to be maintained in the mere hope that \u201ca constitutional \u2018controversy\u2019 [will emerge] before the appellate process is complete.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 1051-1052, n. 3. Accordingly, I believe that a plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of benefit wholly apart from a defendant\u2019s response to the district court\u2019s decree. Where, as here, compliance with the conditions sought in the lower court\u2019s order would be of no tangible value to the plaintiffs, the possibility that the defendants will fail to comply does not justify proceeding with the lawsuit. Thus, I do not believe that the mere chance Hartford will receive a portion of the $440,000 available for reallocation as a result of East Hartford\u2019s refusal to reapply for a community development grant for FY 1975 \u2014 a chance that seems minimal in any event \u2014 would suffice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>to confer standing on Hartford or its low-income residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">OAKES, Circuit Judge (dissenting), with whom Judges SMITH, FEINBERG and GURFEIN concur:</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The anomalies in this case might cause a lay observer to question the rationality of the judicial process. Plaintiffs\u2019 principal purpose in bringing suit was to stop a federal agency (HUD) from violating the law (the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 or HCDA) in a manner adverse to plaintiffs\u2019 interests. Following a district court ruling that HUD had indeed violated the law, the agency did not appeal; instead, it revised its regulations (for fiscal years after 1975) to meet the plaintiffs\u2019 objections. Having achieved this goal by virtue of bringing suit, plaintiffs now are told by the en banc majority that they lacked a sufficient interest in the outcome at the time they filed the suit and hence that they lacked standing to sue. This holding becomes particularly anomalous when one considers that, as Judge Meskill\u2019s plurality opinion recognizes, at 1051 n. 3, it is more likely today than when the suit was initiated that Hartford, had it been successful on the standing issue, would have received reallocated fiscal year 1975 funds as the result of the suit it brought. In view of what has actually occurred as a result of the suit, the majority\u2019s conclusion that no cognizable interest existed at the suit\u2019s outset requires at the very least careful scrutiny-</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">I believe that both the plurality opinion and Chief Judge Kaufman\u2019s concurring opinion misconceive the nature of this suit. They also fail to appreciate the underlying purpose of the statute under which the suit was brought. But more important, perhaps, they read into the law of standing a test far more restrictive than any devised by the Supreme Court, a test that could threaten the viability of all litigation aimed at illegal agency action. In an area of the lav/ that many commentators have decried as confused, <em>see, e. g., </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Text </em>\u00a7 22.01 (3d ed. 1972); Albert, <em>Standing to Challenge Administrative Action: An Inadequate Surrogate for Claim for Relief, </em>83 Yale L.J. 425, 425 n. 1 (1974); Lewis, <em>Constitutional Rights and the Misuse of \u201cStanding,\u201d </em>14 Stan.L.Rev. 433, 434 (1962); Scott, <em>Standing in the Supreme Court </em>\u2014 A <em>Functional Analysis, </em>86 Harv.L. Rev. 645, 645 n. 1 (1973), and that Professor Paul Freund has called \u201camong the most amorphous in the entire domain of public law,\u201d <em>Hearings on S. 2097 Before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, </em>89th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 498 (1966), the two opinions of the en banc majority have succeeded only in further muddying the waters. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">\n<em>The Nature of the Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">The way in which a suit is characterized has much to do with whether plaintiffs are deemed to have standing. If the purpose of the suit is misperceived, the interest of the plaintiffs is likely to be misconceived, since the latter turns on the former and the former shapes the latter. Here the majority fails to examine the suit\u2019s principal purpose and, as a result, misunderstands the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">The majority views this suit as if its principal purpose were to prevent the defendant towns from receiving fiscal 1975 grants under the HCDA. They rely on the fact that the towns had an option under the injunction ultimately issued by the court below, an option of revising their Housing Assistant Plans (HAPs) with regard to the expected-to-reside (ETR) figures, thereby qualifying to seek dissolution of the injunction and release of the grant funds originally sought. On this basis the majority concludes that the plaintiffs could not have had a substantial probability of benefiting from the suit. But the suit was not brought to prevent the defendant towns from receiving grant monies, nor was it brought to obtain revision of one particular year\u2019s ETR figures for these towns. Rather, it was brought with the goal of halting the violation by HUD, a federal administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>agency, of the HCDA, an Act of Congress that the agency was charged with enforcing for the benefit of cities like Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"a4x-dedup-0\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A4p\">\n<em>The Statute and the City of Hartford</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">HUD officials were initially the only defendants named in the complaint, which alleged that they had failed to meet their obligations under the HCDA. Because, at the time the suit was filed, HUD had already issued letters of credit to the towns whose grants were being challenged, HUD and the towns moved to join the towns as defendants, and the district court granted the motions, see <em>City of Hartford v. Hills, </em>408 F.Supp. 879, 882 (D.Conn.1975) (opinion granting preliminary injunction). But the entry of the towns, while necessary to ensure an adequate remedy, did not change the nature of the suit as one aimed at violation of law by a federal agency. While the towns may have had the option on which the plurality and concurring opinions put such emphasis \u2014 that of revising their HAPs rather than forfeiting grant funds\u2014 HUD had no options; it had to enforce the statute as written. That it was not doing so at the time the suit was filed is clear from its failure to appeal and its adoption of explicit ETR regulations for post-1975 grants, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.303(c)(2)(i) and (ii) (1976); <em>see </em>41 Fed.Reg. 11128 (1976), as well as from Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s ruling below, upheld by the panel majority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Had the plaintiffs not filed suit, all indications are that 1975 grants would have been disbursed illegally to the towns; moreover, HUD might well have continued its 1975 policy for a period stretching into the indefinite future. It was these abuses that plaintiffs, particularly the City of Hartford, sought to prevent by filing suit, and it is with this purpose in mind that any analysis of plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the suit must proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Once it is accepted that the plaintiffs\u2019 principal objective in filing suit was to secure compliance by HUD with the law, analysis begins with the question why the plaintiffs cared about this objective. The panel majority opinion answers this question in some detail as to both the City and the low-income plaintiffs. I will not repeat that analysis here, but further examination of the interest of the City in particular is necessary in light of the en banc plurality and concurring opinions. To understand how Hartford would benefit from HUD insistence on adequate HAPs from Hartford\u2019s suburbs, one must first understand both the nature of the City of Hartford and the structure of the HCDA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">Based on uncontested affidavits and testimony, the district court found that \u201cHartford is one of the American central cities, suffering from a concentration of lower-income persons . . . .\u201d <em>City of Hartford v.

The court noted <em>inter alia </em>the large number (over 50%) of Hartford residents receiving government assistance, the high unemployment rate in the city (13.6%), and the high minority population (35.5% overall; 80% of the school population). <em>Id. </em>The court characterized \u201c[t]he housing situation in Hartford [as] bleak\u201d, basing this assessment on the large number of \u201csubstandard, deteriorating or dilapidated units\u201d and on the \u201ccritical housing shortage in the City, resulting in severe overcrowding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893-94 n. 14. Comparing the condition of Hartford in these respects to that of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>suburban towns, the court found a \u201cmarked contrast.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894 n. 14. Since these findings are not in any way challenged here, no more need be said about the characteristics and problems of the City of Hartford; one doubts if the staid prose of an appellate opinion could accurately portray them in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">The HCDA and its legislative history leave little doubt that the Act was designed to assist cities in the precise position in which Hartford finds itself. The Act begins with a congressional finding that urban problems arise from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe concentration of persons of lower income in central cities\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(a)(1) (Supp. V 1975). The \u201cprimary objective\u201d of the Act \u2014 not some collateral purpose \u2014 is declared to be \u201cthe development of viable urban communities,\u201d with \u201cspecific objectives\u201d including \u201cthe elimination of slums and blight\u201d and of \u201cconditions which are detrimental to health, safety, and public welfare\u201d and \u201cthe reduction of the isolation of income groups within communities and <em>geographical areas . . </em>. through the spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5301(c) (emphasis added). These declarations leave very little doubt about congressional intent, and the legislative history reinforces the conclusion that the design of the Act was to assist cities like Hartford. The Senate Report notes Congress\u2019s desire \u201cto insure that Federal funds ... be used with a priority to eliminate slums and blight and to upgrade and make the Nation\u2019s cities more livable, attractive and viable places in which to live.\u201d S.Rep. No. 93-693, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News pp. 4273, 4274. The Report also emphasizes the importance of \u201curban-suburban cooperation on housing and renewal\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 4320.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">There is thus little question that the HCDA in general was designed to assist cities like Hartford. Within the HCDA framework, moreover, the ETR estimate required in the HAP plays a crucial role. Community development grants cannot be made by HUD unless an application has been submitted, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(a) (Supp. V 1975), and the application <em>must </em>include a HAP that, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cassesses the housing assistance needs of lower-income persons . residing in or expected to reside in the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(4)(A). While certain other application requirements may be waived by HUD, the HAP requirement may not be waived. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5304(b)(3), (4); 408 F.Supp. at 898, 901. Both Congress and HUD have emphasized the importance of the HAP. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 93-1114, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1974), <em>quoted in </em>panel op., <em>ante, </em>at 1036 n. 8; HUD Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 41 Fed.Reg. 2348 (1976), <em>quoted in </em>panel op., <em>ante, </em>at 1036 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The significance of the ETR figure is apparent when the HCDA\u2019s \u201ccarrot and .stick\u201d approach is considered. All communities, wealthy as well as poor, are interested in obtaining community development funds, which may be used for such local needs as street lights, playgrounds, and senior citizen centers. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5305(a) (Supp. V 1975); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.200(a) (1976). In order to obtain these funds under the Act, however \u2014 and this is what is of critical importance \u2014 \u201ca locality must address its need for lower-income housing,\u201d United States Commission on Civil Rights, <em>Twenty Years After Brown: Equal Opportunity in Housing </em>32 (1975). This need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>simply cannot be addressed without an accurate estimate of the number of lower-income persons expected to reside in the locality. The ETR figure is tied directly to housing assistance by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1439(a) (Supp. V 1975), which allows either a locality or HUD to reject an application for federal housing aid on the ground that it is inconsistent with the locality\u2019s HAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Once the operation of the statute and the characteristics of Hartford are understood, the nature of Hartford\u2019s injury from the suburban towns\u2019 submission of zero or inadequate ETR figures becomes clear. As a central city, Hartford has been given by the HCDA \u201ca statutory right or entitlement,\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 514, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), to cooperation from its suburbs (at least those applying for community development grants) with regard to the deconcentration of lower-income persons and the elimination of slums and blight, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301 (Supp. V 1975). An alleged deprivation of such a right creates standing. <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 514, 95 S.Ct. 2197. By submitting zero ETR figures, the defendant towns significantly reduced the likelihood that any deconcentration beneficial to Hartford would occur.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, were a developer to apply for federal aid in building lower-income housing in one of the towns, the town could legitimately oppose the request \u2014 and thus effectively block construction of lower-income housing \u2014 simply by objecting under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1439(a)(2) (Supp. V 1975) that such housing is inconsistent with its'approved HAP, which indicates that no additional lower-income persons are expected to reside in the town. The Act was designed to prevent abuses of this sort, and it seems probable that no entity other than a city like Hartford would be interested in halting such violations of the letter and spirit of the law, at least when HUD is countenancing these violations. In short, I believe that Hartford stood to benefit from this suit both by forcing a change in overall HUD policy \u2014 a benefit that has been realized \u2014 and by forcing its suburbs to assist with the HCDA\u2019s spatial deconcentration objective in return for their receipt of community development funds \u2014 a benefit that, to the extent ETRs have been revised upward in the resubmitted applications, also has been realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">HL</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">\n<em>The Law of Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">The plurality and concurring opinions both adopt a standing test based on the fact that, under the district court\u2019s injunction, the defendant towns could either revise their ETR figures or forego community development grant funds. From this the plurality concludes, citing <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. 2197: \u201cInasmuch as the first alternative would produce no benefit for plaintiffs, it is immaterial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>whether they might benefit from the second . . . \u2022 <em>Ante, </em>at 1051. The concurring opinion\u2019s similar conclusion is said to be compelled by <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). Parts I and II of this dissent demonstrate how the factual premise of both opinions is erroneous. Here I point out that no legal analysis is offered in either opinion to explain how <em>Warth </em>and <em>Simon, </em>in which plaintiffs sought invalidation of legislative or executive rules, are relevant to a case involving a district court injunction that gives the defendants a choice of actions. Both cited cases do, of course, contain general language about the necessity for a plaintiff to show \u201ca substantial probability\u201d of benefit from judicial intervention, <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. 2197, or \u201can injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision\u201d, <em>Simon, </em>426 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. at 1924. But these unexceptionable propositions hardly help to resolve this case; they are simply the starting point of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Even assuming arguendo that the option given the localities is relevant to Hartford\u2019s standing to challenge HUD policy \u2014 as discussed in Part I <em>supra, </em>the suit\u2019s principal purpose was to force a change in a HUD policy that was adversely affecting the City of Hartford \u2014 I cannot accept the factual premise that upward revision of the defendant towns\u2019 ETR figures would produce no benefit for Hartford. I have discussed the way in which Hartford would benefit in Part II. It is true that the injury is indirect, but the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that such injury is sufficient for standing purposes if it is \u201cfairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions\u201d, <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 260, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Here the injury to Hartford is traceable to the towns\u2019 submissions and HUD\u2019s approvals of inadequate HAPs, as discussed in Part II. It may also be true that the injury to Hartford is not directly measurable in dollars and cents; \u201c[i]t has long been clear,\u201d however, that other kinds of injury than the purely monetary will support standing, <em>id. </em>Finally, the injury alleged plainly has \u201cthat \u2018essential dimension of specificity\u2019 that informs judicial decisionmaking.\u201d <em>Id., quoting Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 221, 94 S.Ct, 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Hartford did not seek an abstract change in HUD policy, but rather a specific remedy with regard to particular grant applications made by <em>its </em>suburbs whose applications did not conform to the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">I therefore restate that the factual premise of the majority\u2019s approach is unsupportable. But even if it is assumed ar-guendo that Hartford would not benefit from revision of the ETR figures, there nevertheless was a sufficient probability of Hartford\u2019s obtaining reallocated funds to support the City\u2019s standing here. The injunction blocked over four million dollars in grant funds to seven towns. A prediction made when the suit was filed would have to have acknowledged a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that at least some of those funds would be reallocated to Hartford as the result of a town choosing not to, or being unable to, submit an acceptable ETR figure, and indeed time has shown that monies would but for the instant decision en banc have become available for reallocation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hartford\u2019s eligibility therefor is discussed in the panel majority opinion. <em>Ante, </em>at 1037; <em>see </em>408 F.Supp. at 885-86. It matters not at all how small the predicted sum might be, as long as \u201ca distinct and palpable\u201d benefit were involved. <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197; <em>see </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies </em>\u00a7 22.-02-10, at 507 (1976) (\u201cThe line is not between a substantial injury and an insubstantial injury. The line is between injury and no injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">As in <em>Arlington Heights, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 261, 97 S.Ct. at 561, \u201c[a]n injunction would not, of course, guarantee\u201d that grant funds would be reallocated; \u201cuncertainties\u201d would remain. But the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number><em>Arlington Heights </em>made clear that such uncertainties do not defeat a standing claim. <em>Id. See also United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). The plurality and concurring opinions appear to demand more, something approaching a certainty that funds would be reallocated to Hartford. There is scarcely any lawsuit that involves a certainty of recovery, from administrative law to zoning. Such a standard has no support in <em>Warth </em>or <em>Simon, </em>much less in the more recent <em>Arlington </em>Heights; its adoption here significantly raises the barriers a litigant must cross in attempting to challenge illegal governmental action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Hartford has shown injury to itself and a probability of benefit from judicial inter-' vention. It should therefore be held to have standing. To deny Hartford standing means, in Chief Judge Kaufman\u2019s words, that \u201cit is unlikely that there could ever be a plaintiff who will be allowed access to the courts to challenge HUD\u2019s abdication of its congressionally-imposed duty.\u201d <em>Evans v. Lynn, </em>537 F.2d 571, 611 (2d Cir. 1976) (opinion dissenting from en banc decision), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 797, 50 L.Ed.2d 784 (1977). Today\u2019s holding, in short, \u201cgive[s] the Executive a silent veto not provided in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Gurfein, J., dissenting from en banc decision). I dissent.-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">. The dissent asserts surprisingly, \u201cHad the plaintiffs not filed suit, . HUD might well have continued its 1975 policy for a period stretching into the indefinite future.\u201d <em>Infra </em>at 1055. But HUD\u2019s policy in years subsequent to 1975 is not at issue in this lawsuit. No one until now has ever questioned HUD\u2019s determination to require the expected-to-reside estimate as soon as an appropriate method of calculation was devised, and there is no evidence before us that HUD even considered its suspension of the requirement past fiscal 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">In view of the insistence in the dissenting opinion on a precise formulation of the interest at stake in this lawsuit, I find Judge Oakes\u2019s broad formulation particularly troubling. It is impossible to avoid making standing doctrine more confusing than it already is if every case is seen as posing, in the most general terms, a mortal challenge to judicial review of administrative action. It is possible for standing cases to be of less than earthshaking importance. I believe the issues unnecessarily raised by both the plurality opinion and the dissent should be left for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">. The en banc majority does not, of course, reach the merits, as it finds a lack of standing. This opinion will not comment further on the merits, which are analyzed in the panel majority opinion, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">. I am puzzled by the concurring opinion\u2019s attempt to \u201creverse without intimating any view concerning the general legislative pattern.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 1052. The essence of Hartford\u2019s claim here is that it was deprived of legal rights that were created by the HCDA, as discussed <em>infra. </em>The allegation of such a deprivation confers standing on the injured party. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 514, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617 n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). One cannot determine what rights Hartford had under the HCDA without careful examination of \u201cthe general legislative pattern.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">. In light of this statement and the Act\u2019s reference to \u201cthe isolation of income groups within communities and geographical areas\u201d, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c)(6) (Supp. V 1975), it is little short of incredible that the plurality opinion expresses doubt whether the HCDA was intended to promote intercity spatial deconcen-tration, <em>ante </em>at 1050 n. 2. <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(a)(1) (Supp. V 1975) (congressional concern about \u201cthe concentration of persons of lower income in central cities\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(1) (development planning to be on \u201careawide\u201d basis); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5304(a)(4)(C) (lower-income housing to be located with objective of \u201cavoiding undue concentrations of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons\u201d). If nothing else were clear, it is at least clear that the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 was not just another simple form of revenue-sharing with suburbs walling out the cities\u2019 poor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">. The plurality and concurring opinions both mention that there were no more fiscal 1975 Title II funds available for the defendant towns, even if their ETR figures for that year were revised upward. The location and types of lower-income housing, however, might very well be affected by appropriate revision of the ETR figures; certainly Congress thought that there would be some impact when it required the ETR estimates. Moreover, the chronological relationship between the Title I Hap and the Title II housing grants is unclear on the record before us. It appears from the regulations that Title II funds for at least two fiscal years after 1975 may be based on the 1975 HAPs. The community development plan summary submitted with the application is a \u201cthree-year plan which specifies both short and long-term community development objectives which have been developed in accordance with areawide development planning and national urban growth policies.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.303(a) (1976). The ETR assessment required to be included in the HAP is a projection covering \u201cthe next three years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 570.303(c)(2)(i). The HAP must specify \u201ca realistic annual goal and also a three year goal for the number of dwelling units or persons to be assisted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 570.303(c)(3). And it is to be noted that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-13\">Where substantial housing needs are identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and housing assistance resources are available, the Secretary may determine that Housing Assistance Plans with only minimal housing goals are plainly inappropriate to meeting the needs pursuant to the standards of review in \u00a7 570.306(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 570.303(c)(3)(v).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">.
