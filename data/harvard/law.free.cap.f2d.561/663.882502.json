Appellant raises a number of issues on appeal, the most significant of which are the District Court\u2019s refusal to suppress the seized evidence, failure to consolidate the separate counts of the indictment, and failure to instruct the jury on an essential element of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Although the first two contentions are without merit, we conclude that the failure to instruct the jury on the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element of \u00a7 841(a)(1) requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">On August 19, 1976, Special Agents William P. Johnson and Frank J. Magoch, Jr., of the DEA were assigned to the Cleveland airport to monitor incoming and outgoing flights to cities known to be drug distribution centers. Agent Johnson observed Appellant among passengers disembarking from a Los Angeles flight. One month earlier, on July 21, Appellant and a companion had aroused Agent Johnson\u2019s suspicions as they boarded a flight to Los Angeles. On that occasion, Agent Johnson observed the two men purchase one-way tickets to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Los Angeles using cash taken from large rolls of bills which each was carrying. Appellant had a brown briefcase and his companion carried a brown paper sack from which he removed money to pay his fare. Agent Johnson learned from the ramp agent that the airline tickets were issued in the names of N. Pope and C. Saunders. Agent Johnson made inquiry and obtained a photograph of Saunders, Appellant\u2019s companion. DEA agents maintained surveillance on incoming Los Angeles flights for the next two days but they did not see either of the two men return.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">After Agent Johnson noticed Appellant disembark on August 19, he and Agent Magoch followed Appellant down the airport concourse. The evidence shows that the Appellant appeared nervous and looked about several times, glancing at either Agent Johnson or Agent Magoch who were following him. The agents separated, with Agent Magoch continuing to keep Appellant under surveillance while Agent Johnson preceded them outside the terminal and on to the street. Agent Johnson identified himself to a uniformed police officer who was on duty outside the terminal and requested assistance. After Appellant left the terminal, Agent Johnson approached him and displayed his credentials. Immediately, Appellant bolted past the agent and policeman and ran into a nearby construction site. Agent Johnson gave chase shouting after Appellant that he was a federal agent. As Agent Johnson drew closer, Appellant either swung or threw his briefcase at the pursuing agent who then drew his service revolver. Appellant ran toward a storm sewer and, within view of both agents, withdrew a white bag from his coat, dropped down to the sewer grating, and stuffed the bag into the sewer. He was taken into custody and Agent Magoch retrieved a white airsickness bag from the sewer. Inside the airsickness bag were two plastic bags filled with a brown substance which proved to be heroin. Appellant was placed under arrest. The agents opened the briefcase and found that it contained a soft drink bottle filled with a pink liquid which proved to be methadone, a mortar and pestle, an electric blender and a jar of lactose. Appellant had $528 in cash in his pants pockets. Two one-way airline ticket stubs, Los Angeles to Cleveland, in the' names of M. Johnson and J. Johnson, bearing a travel date of August 19, 1976, were in Appellant\u2019s coat pocket. In the briefcase, Agent Johnson found two additional ticket stubs, Los Angeles to Cleveland, in the names of A. Jones and E. Jones dated July 24, 1976.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Defense counsel moved to suppress the seized evidence and the motion was overruled. At trial, DEA chemist John Meyers testified that he had analyzed the evidence and found that the brown substance was 330.24 grams of heroin at 23% purity with manitol as dilutant; the surfaces of the mortar and pestle were coated with heroin and manitol; powder in the blender proved positive for heroin; and the pink substance in the bottle was 475 mililiters of liquid containing methadone.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Recently, this Court has reviewed a number of cases involving warrantless searches of airline passengers by DEA agents. See, e. <em>g., United States v. Lewis, </em>556 F.2d 385 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Gill, </em>555 F.2d 597 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Craemer, </em>555 F.2d 594 (6th Cir. 1977). A majority of these cases have concerned the DEA\u2019s use of a \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d, which is a loosely formulated list of characteristics believed to be common to persons using airports for narcotics traffic. <em>Compare, United States v. McCaleb, </em>552 F.2d 717, 719-20 (6th Cir. 1977), and <em>United States v. Craemer, supra </em>at 595.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>not admitted in the Government\u2019s brief, it is obvious that the agents in this case were acting pursuant to a drug courier profile in singling out Appellant for surveillance. Accordingly, analysis of the search and seizure in this case properly begins with a discussion of the growing body of case law in this Circuit on the DEA\u2019s use of drug courier profiles to spot possible narcotics traffickers.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As we stated in <em>United States v. McCaleb, </em>552 F.2d at 720, satisfaction of a drug courier profile, in itself, does not establish probable cause. See <em>also United States v. Craemer, supra </em>at 596. The agents must be able to point to additional articulable facts which indicate that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity. <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>550 F.2d 1066, 1069-70 (6th Cir. 1977). Although meeting the profile does not establish probable cause, facts known to the agents which correspond to characteristics in the profile may be considered along with information obtained from other sources in determining that the agents did have probable cause to believe that an offense is being or has been committed. <em>United States v. Gill, supra </em>at 599. <em>Compare, United States v. Prince, </em>548 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1977), and <em>United States v. Craemer, supra </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Even if the facts known to the agents do not amount to probable cause, the agents may be permitted to make a limited investigative stop of suspicious individuals under the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d doctrine announced in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In <em>Terry </em>the Supreme Court held that a law enforcement officer is entitled to stop an individual on the street to investigate suspicious behavior if the officer is \u201cable to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.\u201d 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. The officer may not rely on \u201cmere suspicion\u201d or a \u201chunch\u201d to justify the stop, but due consideration is afforded specific reasonable inferences the officer is entitled to draw in light of his law enforcement experience. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Later cases have dubbed the lesser standard of knowledge required for a <em>Terry </em>stop \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and have gauged the reasonableness of particular investigative stops by striking \u201ca balance between the public interest [behind the investigation] and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference from law officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Brignoni </em>\u2014 Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2579, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). Where the public interest served by the officer\u2019s investigation is great and the intrusion on individual privacy is small, investigative stops of limited duration and \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation\u201d have been upheld. <em>United States v. Brignoni </em>\u2014 Ponce, 422 U.S. at 881, 95 S.Ct. at 2580, <em>citing Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A threshold question we must address is whether the facts before us define an investigative stop within the meaning of <em>Terry. </em>Agent Johnson had just approached Appellant and flashed his credentials when Appellant fled. <em>Terry </em>states that the Fourth Amendment becomes relevant to an encounter between police and citizen only upon a \u201cseizure of the person\u201d. 392 U.S. at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877. In <em>Terry </em>the Supreme Court held that a \u201cseizure of the person\u201d occurs \u201cwhenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This does not require an actual physical seizure, so long as it is apparent from the circumstances that the individual was not free to ignore the officer and proceed on his way. <em>See, e. g., Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 148, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1962); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868. On the other hand, the Supreme Court noted in <em>Terry </em>that \u201cnot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons\u201d. 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879. Whether <em>Terry </em>considerations come into play in evaluating the officer\u2019s conduct depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Here, Agent Johnson was obviously intending to make a <em>Terry </em>stop when he approached Appellant to \u201ctalk\u201d with him. This intention was thwarted, however, by Appellant\u2019s flight at the moment the agent displayed his credentials. If the agent had actually succeeded in effecting an investigative stop by detaining Appellant for questioning at the time of the initial intrusion, the stop would have been invalid because the facts then known to the agent did not amount to \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that Appellant was involved in criminal activity. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Cupps, </em>503 F.2d 277, 281-82 (6th Cir. 1974). All that Agent Johnson knew of Appellant\u2019s activities on August 19 was that Appellant had disembarked from a Los Angeles flight and had proceeded down the airport concourse looking back nervously at the two plainclothes agents following him. This conduct was entirely consistent with innocent behavior. Agent Johnson also knew that on July 21 Appellant and his companion had purchased one-way tickets to Los Angeles using cash taken from a large roll of bills.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, satisfaction of a DEA drug courier profile does not necessarily satisfy the <em>Terry </em>requirement that the agent be able to point to \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d which warrant the intrusion. <em>See United States v. McCaleb, </em>552 F.2d at 720. If Agent Johnson had carried out his intentions and had stopped Appellant, any evidence obtained thereby would have had to be suppressed as the fruit of an invalid <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Manning v. Jarnigan, </em>501 F.2d 408 (6th Cir. 1974). But that is not what occurred. Instead, Appellant broke into a run at the moment that Agent Johnson identified himself as a DEA agent. From that point, Appellant no longer conducted himself as would an innocent passerby.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">We conclude that Appellant\u2019s flight in the face of a clear showing of lawful authority supplied the agent with grounds to reasonably suspect that Appellant was engaged in criminal activity. Flight invites pursuit and colors conduct which hitherto has appeared innocent. Under the circumstances, the agent acted reasonably in pursuing Appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We wish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>to emphasize the narrowness of this holding. We do not condone, nor do we wish to encourage, investigative stops of citizens on a public street on facts which do not meet the standards in <em>Terry. </em>All that we hold today is that flight from a clearly identified law enforcement officer may furnish sufficient ground for a limited investigative stop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>534 F.2d 1142, 1145 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>461 F.2d 860, 863-64 (3d Cir. 1972). <em>Accord, City of St. Paul v. Vaughn, </em>237 N.W.2d 365 (Minn.1975). <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>314 F.2d 795, 798 (6th Cir. 1963). However, flight from a law enforcement officer alone does not establish probable cause, although it is a relevant factor to consider. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>534 F.2d at 1145. Appellant\u2019s conduct after he fled gave the agents ample cause to arrest him. When he swung or threw his briefcase at the pursuing agent, the agent had probable cause to arrest him for assaulting a federal officer in the performance of his duty, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (1970). After the assault, the agents observed Appellant stuff a white bag into the storm sewer. When the bag was retrieved and found to contain heroin, Appellant was arrested. The arrest was supported by probable cause and the seized evidence was properly introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court should have consolidated the separate heroin and methadone counts into a single charge. He was convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(aXl) which makes it a crime \u201cfor any person knowingly or intentionally to possess with intent to . distribute ... a controlled substance.\u201d Both heroin and methadone are listed as controlled substances in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 \u2014 heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance and methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance. We conclude that the possession of heroin and methadone represent separate offenses under the provisions of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 <em>et seq., </em>and that the district court did not err in refusing to consolidate the two counts of the indictment into a single charge or in sentencing Appellant separately on each conviction. <em>Cf. United States v. Valot, </em>481 F.2d 22 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">A more serious problem is raised by Appellant\u2019s contention that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>court improperly instructed the jury on the elements required to prove a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant claims that the instructions failed to inform the jury that it must find that controlled substances were possessed \u201cwith the intent to distribute\u201d before an offense under \u00a7 841(a)(1) is proven. Since Appellant failed to make a specific objection before the jury retired, we review the adequacy of the instructions under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard of Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. LaRiche, </em>549 F.2d 1088, 1092 (6th Cir. 1977). The district court gave the following instruction on the essential elements of the offense:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Section 841(a)(1) of Title 21 of the United States Code provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cExcept as authorized by this subchap-ter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">I shall now instruct you on the elements of the crime charged in the indictment. The three essential elements of the charges in the indictment are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">1. The act or acts of possessing a narcotic drug controlled substance; to-wit, in this case, heroin, as charged in Count 1 of the indictment, and/or Methadone, as charged in Count 2 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">2. Possessing such narcotic drug-controlled substance knowingly and intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">3. Possessing such narcotic drug-controlled substances unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The offenses and each of them are complete when the three elements above-stated have been proved by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"AiO\">A review of this portion of the instruction reveals that the district court did not include \u201cintent to distribute\u201d among the \u201cthree essential elements\u201d that the Court said were required to prove a \u00a7 841(a)(1) violation. This was error. The \u201cintent to distribute\u201d is an essential element of \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>475 F.2d 240, 248-49 (2d Cir. 1973). The court\u2019s failure to instruct on \u201cintent to distribute\u201d was not cured by language in the instruction which stated that possession of a controlled substance must be with knowledge or intent. The \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cintentionally\u201d language in \u00a7 841(a) refers to the possessor\u2019s awareness that he is in possession of a controlled substance and not to his intention to distribute the substance sometime in the future. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) requires both general criminal intent and the specific \u201cintent to distribute\u201d before a violation is proven. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>475 F.2d at 248. As the Ninth Circuit correctly stated in <em>United States v. Jewell, </em>532 F.2d 697, 698 (9th Cir. 1976), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) \u201cis violated only if possession is accompanied both by knowledge of the nature of the act and also by the intent \u2018to manufacture, distribute, or dispense.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-e\">In determining the propriety of a jury instruction, the instruction must be viewed in its entirety, and a misstatement in one part of the charge does not require reversal if elsewhere in the instruction the correct information is conveyed to the jury in a clear and concise manner so that it is unlikely that an erroneous impression would remain in the minds of the jurors. <em>See generally United States v. Park, </em>421 U.S. 658, 674, 95 S.Ct. 1903, 44 L.Ed.2d 489 (1975); <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). After reviewing the instructions in their totality, we are compelled to find that the instructions failed to adequately inform the jury that \u201cintent to distribute\u201d is an essential element of \u00a7 841(a). Although the instructions define \u201cintent\u201d in general terms along with other statutory definitions, nowhere in the instructions is either \u201cdistribution\u201d, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11) (1970), or \u201cintent to distribute\u201d defined for the jury. At one point, the district court correctly instructed the jury that the intent or purpose to distribute could be inferred from certain evidence in the record. But this discussion was immediately followed by the court\u2019s reaffirmation that all that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Government need prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict Appellant are the three elements the court had previously listed. The court\u2019s reference to the three essential elements identified earlier in the instructions compounds the error of omitting to instruct on the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element and detracts from the correct statement immediately preceding it. As we stated in <em>Smith v. United States, </em>230 F.2d 935, 939 (6th Cir. 1956), \u201c[t]he fact that one instruction is correct does not cure the error in giving another which is inconsistent with it.\u201d The court\u2019s instructions would permit the jury to convict Appellant for mere possession of a controlled substance which is not an offense under \u00a7 841(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>390 F.2d 405, 407 (6th Cir. 1968). We believe that the instructions on intent were insufficient and created an erroneous impression in the minds of the jurors. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>475 F.2d at 248-49. Since \u201cintent to distribute\u201d is an essential element of \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government retains the burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt and on the basis of proper instructions. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>475 F.2d at 249. <em>See also United States v. Byrd, </em>352 F.2d 570 (2d Cir. 1965). <em>Compare, United States v. Montiell, </em>526 F.2d 1008, 1010-11 (2d Cir. 1975). <em>See generally Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). The failure to instruct on an essential element of an offense is \u201cfundamental error,\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>521 F.2d 61, 63 (10th Cir. 1975), which cannot be cured by reference to the indictment or by reading the unexplained language of the statute to the jury. <em>See United States v. Natale, </em>526 F.2d 1160, 1167 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bosch, </em>505 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir. 1974). We conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to instruct on \u201cintent to distribute\u201d, an essential element of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), was plain error and requires reversal of the convictions. The other issues raised by Appellant are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-16\">.

The Government in its brief notes that Appellant returned to Cleveland on July 24th. This date appears to be substantiated by ticket stubs found in Appellant\u2019s briefcase bearing the name \u201cJones\u201d. Since the agents were not aware of the July 25 flight date and also were not aware that Appellant had used aliases on flights other than on July 21, these facts may not be considered in evaluating the agents\u2019 conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\">. In <em>United States v. McCaleb, </em>552 F.2d at 719-20, we mentioned the profile used by Detroit DEA agents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d is a rather loosely formulated list of characteristics used by Detroit DEA agents to indicate \u201csuspicious\u201d persons. These characteristics include: (1) the use of small denomination currency for ticket purchases; (2) travel to and from major drug import centers, especially for short periods of time; (3) the absence of luggage or use of empty suitcases; (4) nervousness, and; (5) use of an alias. DEA agents testified that the presence of a number of these characteristics suggests that the person observed may be carrying contraband drugs. During the time period of the instant arrests, this profile was not written down, nor was it made clear to agents exactly how many or what combination of the characteristics needed to be present in order to justify an investigative stop or an arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The Cleveland DEA agents followed a similar profile in <em>United States v. Craemer, supra </em>at 595:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">The courier profile lists a number of characteristics believed to be common to persons using airports for narcotics traffic. Among the characteristics included in the profile are that the individual purchases a round trip ticket to various locations in the nation known as drug distribution centers, including Miami, Florida, New York, New York, Los Angeles, California, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, to return the same day or within a short period of time; the tickets are purchased with cash using bills of small or large denominations; the individuals either check no luggage or they check empty bags; they often use aliases; and they behave in a suspicious or nervous manner.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b726-5\">. The Government in its brief states that the agents discovered that Appellant\u2019s companion was a \u201cknown drug dealer\u201d and that this fact justified the agent\u2019s attempt to stop Appellant outside the terminal. There is nothing in the record to support this allegation. We also did not consider Appellant\u2019s probation report which was improperly inserted as an appendix to the Government\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. If the agents had apprehended Appellant without further incident, the stop and inquiry would have had to be \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation,\u201d in this case the flight from the agents. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. A brief detention for questioning would be a reasonable response to Appellant\u2019s flight from the agents, particularly in light of the serious public interest in stemming illegal drug traffic balanced against the minimal intrusion of a brief investigative stop. <em>See United States v. Brig-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>noni </em>\u2014 Ponce, 422 U.S. at 878-82, 95 S.Ct. 2574. Probable cause would of course be required before an arrest could be made. <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. In <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 482-84, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1962), the Supreme Court rejected a Government contention that a suspect\u2019s \u201cflight [from a narcotics agent] justified an inference of guilt sufficient to generate probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483 n. 10, 83 S.Ct. at 415. The Court stressed that the agent affirmatively misrepresented his reason for being on the premises, that the misimpression engendered by the agent\u2019s ruse was not adequately dispelled before the suspect fled, that the agent was not certain he had the correct man, and that the agent\u2019s uninvited entry into the suspect\u2019s living quarters was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 83 S.Ct. 407. Under these circumstances, the <em>Wong Sun </em>Court held that the suspect\u2019s flight and refusal to admit the agent into his bedroom was \u201cambiguous\u201d conduct which \u201csignified guilty knowledge no more clearly than did a natural desire to repel an apparently unauthorized intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 83 S.Ct. at 415. In this case, by contrast, Agent Johnson clearly identified himself as a federal agent as he approached Appellant on the street. He was accompanied by a uniformed officer. This is not a case, as in <em>Wong Sun, </em>where there could be any confusion about the agent\u2019s identity or the official nature of his mission. Flight under these circumstances was not ambiguous conduct. The agent was entitled to infer, in light of his law enforcement experience, that Appellant was engaged in some sort of furtive venture. In <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. at 66, 88 S.Ct. at 1904, the companion case to <em>Terry, </em>the Supreme Court expressed similar sentiments in discussing flight and other furtive gestures as they relate to probable cause to arrest: \u201c. deliberately furtive actions and flight at the approach of strangers or law officers are strong indicia of <em>mens rea, </em>and when coupled with specific knowledge on the part of the officer relating the suspect to evidence of a crime, they are proper factors to be considered in the decision to make an arrest.\u201d Flight from an identified law enforcement officer may also satisfy the lesser standard required for an investigative stop. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Rundle, </em>461 F.2d at 864.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">.
