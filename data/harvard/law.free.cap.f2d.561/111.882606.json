The gist of the charges rests on an alleged agreement among the appellants and one Ronald Waller, an unin-dicted coconspirator, to stage an automobile accident in order to enable the Blunks, posing as innocent accident victims, to make claims against various insurance carriers through the mails. Upon trial, a jury found appellants guilty on all counts. The district court sentenced Joseph Blunk to concurrent prison terms totaling five years, imposed a similar sentence upon Vernon Blunk, and sentenced Donna Blunk to concurrent terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>totaling three years imprisonment. These timely appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We affirm the convictions of Vernon and Joseph Blunk, but reverse Donna Blunk\u2019s conviction for insufficiency of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">I. <em>Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The Government\u2019s proof that the Blunks agreed to stage an automobile accident in order to collect benefits under various insurance policies consisted of testimony from the unindicted coconspirator, Ronald Waller, then a truck driver for the Poole Truck Lines, located in Evergreen, Alabama, and the supporting testimony of a woman known as Paula Waller. At all times material, although not married to Ronald Waller, she had been living with him and had borne him a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Waller testified that his close friend, Vernon Blunk (also called Steve), accompanied by Vernon\u2019s brother, Joe (Joseph), and Joe\u2019s wife, Donna, came to Brewton, Alabama, on or about May 12, 1974, and stayed at the home of Ronald Waller and Paula for three days. During that time, the Blunks allegedly solicited Ronald Waller to stage a collision between a truck which Waller would be driving for Poole Truck Lines and a pickup truck in which the Blunks would be riding. Vernon Blunk made the initial proposal to Waller. In the discussion, Vernon Blunk offered Waller $1,500 for his participation. Waller testified that Joe Blunk suggested to Vernon that $1,500 was too much to pay Waller, but Vernon disagreed. There is no evidence that Donna Blunk took part in the discussions, but Waller testified that Donna Blunk \u201cwas there also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The visit at Brewton, Alabama, ended when Waller obtained an assignment from the Poole Truck Lines to drive a tractor-trailer loaded with freight into Pennsylvania. The evidence indicates that Waller had sought such an assignment from his employer after Joe Blunk told him that Pennsylvania would be a good place in which to stage an accident, because insurance carriers usually pay off quickly in that state. All of the alleged conspirators thereafter proceeded on a trip from Alabama to Pennsylvania, driving more or less in convoy, with a pickup truck owned by Vernon Blunk sometimes being driven ahead of Waller\u2019s tractor-trailer and at other times driven behind. Vernon Blunk frequently rode in the tractor-trailer with Ronald Waller. On May 17, 1974, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Ronald Waller carried out the plan to collide intentionally with the Waller pickup. The pickup stopped at the intersection of Highways 10 and 41, and Ronald Waller drove his tractor-trailer rig directly into the rear of the Blunk pickup. Waller also testified that a few moments earlier, as the two vehicles approached the intersection, he had struck the pickup accidentally when the driver of that vehicle suddenly and without warning applied the brakes. Waller described the second impact as an intentional collision. The Blunks testified to only one impact, at the highway intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">The three Blunks sustained some injuries, and they were hospitalized for approximately twenty days. Each of them filed claims for medical expenses under various insurance policies, and in addition, all made claims against the liability insurance carrier for the Poole Truck Lines. An adjuster for that insurer made an advance payment of $1,000 to each of these defendants during the time of their hospitalization immediately following the accident. The Blunks also brought a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Poole Truck Lines to recover for injuries in an aggregate amount in excess of $300,000. That lawsuit was pending at the time the Government obtained this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The conspiracy came apart in about October of 1974. By this time, Ronald Waller and Paula had separated, leaving Paula in custody of their child. After the child became ill from accidentally eating a number of Tylenol pills, Ronald Waller took the child away from its mother without her permission, and he apparently left the state. The mother became distraught. In an effort to obtain help in recovering her child, Paula contacted Ronald\u2019s employer and \u201cspilled the beans,\u201d disclosing that Ronald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>had told her the \u201caccident\u201d with the Blunks\u2019 vehicle had been a planned collision. This disclosure led to an investigation by the liability insurance carrier, which obtained a confession from Ron Waller. Ronald and Paula both testified to the grand jury, which returned the indictment against the Blunks. The prosecutor, in response to an agreement to cooperate, agreed not to bring criminal charges against Waller.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Each appellant attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his or her conviction, and they raise several other claims of error relating to conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor and alleged errors by the district court in the reception of evidence and in instructing the jury. We find it necessary to discuss in some detail the sufficiency of the evidence to convict and certain evidentiary rulings. We deem the other claims made by the appellants to be without merit, bordering on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">II. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A review of the record indicates more than ample evidence to sustain the convictions of Vernon and Joseph. Vernon is implicated in the scheme through testimony of coconspirator Ronald Waller and also testimony of Paula Waller. Joseph Blunk is also implicated in the conspiracy through the testimony of Ronald Waller. In addition, Paula testified that during the time that the Blunks visited the Waller home in May of 1974, Ronald told her that Vernon and Joseph had asked that he, Waller, participate in staging of an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The defendants each testified. They did not dispute the details of the convoy-journey from Alabama into Pennsylvania to the place where the collision occurred. Vernon and Joseph Blunk, who were engaged in a cattle-raising venture on a farm in Missouri, testified that they drove to Pennsylvania for the purpose of possibly buying a Charo-l\u00e1is bull which a Pennsylvania farmer had advertised in a farmer\u2019s paper. Donna Blunk testified that she understood the trip was made for the purpose of buying such a bull. The only other conflict in the testimony relating to the trip to Pennsylvania was whether there were two impacts, as testified to by Waller, or only a single impact at the intersection of the highways, as testified to by the Blunks.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The jury obviously chose to believe Ronald Waller\u2019s testimony, and as we have noted, Paula Waller\u2019s evidence corroborated that of Ron Waller in important particulars. Moreover, the undisputed circumstances which induced her disclosure of the conspiracy to the Poole Truck Line add a substantial measure of veracity to her version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">We are satisfied from our review of the record that the prosecution presented substantial evidence that Joseph Blunk and Vernon Blunk entered into an illegal agreement with Ronald Waller for the purpose of obtaining monies by fraud from the several insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Donna Blunk\u2019s claim of insufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction presents a close question. Ronald Waller\u2019s description of Donna Blunk as being \u201cthere also\u201d while the plans for the accident were discussed does not establish with any degree of certainty that Donna Blunk knowingly participated in the agreement to stage an accident. We quote a portion of the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">Q (By Mr. Staples) [prosecutor] Ronnie [Waller], <em>after you had this first conversation with Steve </em>[Vernon] [relating to staging an accident], were you promised anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">A [Ronald Waller] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">Q What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-15\">A $1,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-16\">Q By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-17\">A Steve [Vernon].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-18\">Q Where was Joe Blunk when this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-19\">A I believe we were in the kitchen of my house. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-20\">Q So Joe was in the general vicinity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-21\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-22\">Q Did you hear Joe Blunk make any statement at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-23\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Q Who did he make it to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">A To Steve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Q What did he say to Steve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">A He said that was too much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Q Too much what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">A Too much money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Q And did Steve respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">A As well as I can remember, I believe ho said it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">Q Where was Donna Blunk at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">A She was there also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">The conversation testified to occurred after Vernon asked Ronald Waller to stage the accident. There is nothing in this testimony indicating that Donna was present when Joseph or Vernon suggested staging an accident, or that she knew why Waller was to be paid money.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">At another point in the trial, when counsel for Joseph and Donna Blunk cross-examined Ronald Waller about the conversation relating to staging the accident, Waller stated he had been questioned at various times by all three Blunks before the incident in the kitchen related in the testimony quoted above. That testimony reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-17\">Q * * * Now, I believe you testified here, Mr. Waller, that it was in the kitchen of your home, is that correct, that your words were, \u201cIt was in the kitchen of my house,\u201d when you were approached about this staging an accident, as you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-18\">A The second or third time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-19\">Q Oh, you were questioned several times before, were you, about it by one of the Blunks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-20\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-21\">Q By which Blunk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-22\">A Well, by all three at different occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-23\">Q Well, when was the first occasion that any of the Blunks mentioned anything to you about staging an accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-24\">A In the truck coming from Evergreen, Alabama to Brewton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-25\">Q Who was with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-26\">A Steve Blunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-27\">Q And about when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-28\">A I don\u2019t know approximately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-29\">Q Well, would you know what year it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-30\">A I believe it was \u201974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-31\">Q You believe it was \u201974?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-32\">A I\u2019m not positive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-33\">Waller never did specify the contents of any discussion between Donna Blunk and himself. Waller\u2019s statement that he was questioned by \u201call three at different occasions\u201d could, on the basis of this record, mean only that Donna was present during conversations about some aspects of the scheme which, by themselves, would not make Donna aware of the fraudulent agreement, such as the discussion of payments to Waller dealt with above.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-34\">The Government also introduced additional evidence bearing on Donna\u2019s knowledge of any agreement to create an accident. Paula testified that Ronald Waller asked her advice as to whether he should enter into an arrangement to make some money through an automobile accident. She expressed violent objections. On the next night, Waller told her that \u201cSteve and Joe * * * had asked him to go into this accident together * * * and that they weren\u2019t letting the women know * * *. He was just wanting my opinion.\u201d Under cross-examination, she added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-35\">Q Now, according to what you told us here, at no time did you ever hear Donna say anything at all about any kind of an accident before any accident happened. Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-36\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-37\">Q And you mentioned something about the kitchen. Now, I\u2019m going to use the word \u201cday three\u201d. I believe you said day three. I only use that because that\u2019s the word you used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-38\">A Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-39\">Q And you said something about some people being in your kitchen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-40\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-41\">Q Now, Donna was not in the kitchen when according to you there was a discussion about something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>A That\u2019s right. She was playing with my children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">Q She was taking care of your two children in the other room; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">A In the living room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Q So if, as you say, anything at all was said about an accident, she wasn\u2019t there. Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">A She wasn\u2019t ever in there when we were discussing it. I never heard her say a word about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Q You never \u2014 you don\u2019t even know if she even \u2014 if what you say is true, nevertheless, at no, you don\u2019t have any idea whether or not she knew anything at all about it. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">Q To your knowledge she knew nothing about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">A That\u2019s right. As far as I know of because Ronnie told me that Steve\u2019s wife didn\u2019t know anything and that Donna didn\u2019t know anything but, of course, that\u2019s him telling me. But I never heard her say it and she never discussed it with me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Before leaving their home at Brewton, Ron Waller stated that he did not know whether or not he would go through with the accident arrangement. Two or three days later he called his wife over the telephone and advised her of the \u201caccident\u201d and said that \u201cnobody was hurt * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">The Government also proved that Donna Blunk made claims for insurance benefits under several policies and indeed, collected from some of these companies. This evidence, however, does not prove any illegal conduct on her part unless the Government also proved that she knew that the collision had been staged. This is so because the prosecution concedes, and the evidence shows, that Donna did in fact sustain some injuries in the accident which, absent her participation in the conspiracy, would justify her collection of benefits from the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Undoubtedly the jury rejected the Blunks\u2019 alleged reason for travelling into Pennsylvania. However, that the reasons advanced by the Blunks for going into Pennsylvania may have been untrue does not establish that Mrs. Blunk knew the real reason for the trip into Pennsylvania. The Government produced no evidence establishing either that Donna Blunk expressly agreed to participate in the planned accident or that she actually overheard Vernon and her husband making arrangements with Ronald Waller to stage the accident. Waller\u2019s testimony that Donna \u201cwas there also\u201d when Waller was offered money for his participation in the scheme is reason to suspect Donna may have known about the illicit agreement, but is not sufficient to prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. To convict a criminal defendant, the evidence must do more than merely raise suspicion or the possibility of guilt. The evidence is simply insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Donna knowingly participated in the conspiracy. Accordingly, we reverse Donna\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>545 F.2d 1112, 1115-16 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1075, 97 S.Ct. 814, 50 L.Ed.2d 793 (1977); <em>United States v. Kelton, </em>446 F.2d 669 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">III. <em>Evidentiary Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">Appellants claim that the court erred in certain evidentiary rulings. We here address the claim that the district court committed prejudicial error in permitting the prosecutor to establish through cross-examination of Vernon Blunk that a Pennsylvania lawyer representing the Blunks in their $300,000 civil lawsuit had written Blunk\u2019s local counsel in Mississippi questioning the validity of the Blunks\u2019 claims against the Poole Truck Lines and suggesting that he would withdraw from the action unless all three Blunks submitted affidavits denying the allegations of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">Vernon Blunk stated on direct examination that to his knowledge, the lawsuit in Pennsylvania had never been withdrawn and that he had never authorized any of his lawyers to withdraw that lawsuit. On cross-examination the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Q Mr. Blunk, isn\u2019t it a fact that on August the 13th, 1976, Mr. David Forage, a member of the Pennsylvania Bar wrote Robert Mills, the attorney, you know, in Mississippi, and asked for a frank denial of the allegations [of fraud]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">After objection, the question was rephrased, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Q Mr. Blunk, did you receive a carbon copy of a letter sent to you by certified mail from Mr. Robert Mills, attorney from Lost Point, Mississippi, dated August 27, 1976, requiring you to, or asking you to fill out an affidavit about this civil suit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The witness responded that he had received the letter after his arrest on the charges considered here. Appellants contend that the disclosure of this letter\u2019s contents violated the attorney-client privilege and that the contents of the letter were inadmissible hearsay. The Government responds that the evidence served a proper impeachment purpose in establishing the falsity of Vernon Blunk\u2019s testimony that the lawsuit in Pennsylvania was never withdrawn and that he had never authorized such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">An examination of the transcript establishes that the information in this letter did not impeach the direct testimony of Vernon Blunk. In the direct examination, counsel was seeking to show, through Vernon\u2019s answers, Vernon's innocent state of mind. The letter in question, however, referred to his Pennsylvania lawyer\u2019s state of mind in questioning the validity of that lawsuit, apparently after details of the alleged conspiracy had been disclosed to him. Disclosure of this letter\u2019s contents on cross-examination did not constitute proper impeachment. The letter\u2019s contents amounted to a statement by a person not present and under oath, and was therefore inadmissible hearsay. Moreover, the lawyer\u2019s opinion on the merits of the lawsuit was not relevant to any issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">We cannot say, however, that the error was of such a prejudicial nature as to require a retrial. The cross-examination in question related to the good faith of the appellants in bringing the lawsuit. That subject was injected into the trial by the direct testimony of appellant Vernon Blunk. Moreover, we do not believe that the introduction of this hearsay comment was significant in light of the overwhelming evidence establishing that Joseph and Vernon Blunk did conspire with Ronald Waller to stage an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Appellants\u2019 complaint of error regarding the admission of testimony by Lynn Greer, an insurance adjuster who had interviewed Joe Blunk shortly after the accident, does not justify reversal. Greer testified that Joe Blunk did not tell him that he knew the driver of the tractor-trailer. However, Greer\u2019s subsequent testimony indicated that he had not asked Blunk about any acquaintance with the driver of the tractor-trailer. In light of this admission by Greer, the questioned evidence, if erroneously admitted, did not prejudice the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">IV. <em>Other Contentions of Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">We briefly comment upon other claims of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">Vernon Blunk\u2019s contention that the prosecution should have been dismissed for prosecutorial delay focuses on a delay of approximately eleven months between October 1975, when the Poole Truck Lines learned of the conspiracy, and September 1976, when appellants were indicted. Knowledge by the Poole Truck Lines of the conspiracy does not constitute knowledge by the Government and its prosecutors. The record shows neither intentional prosecutorial delay nor prejudice to appellant Vernon Blunk. Thus, his contention must be rejected. <em>See United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">The court committed no prejudicial error in its reasonable doubt instruction, <em>see United States v. Collins, </em>552 F.2d 243, 248 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Knight, </em>547 F.2d 75 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>534 F.2d 1262, 1279 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Conley, </em>523 F.2d 650, 655 (8th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 920, 96 S.Ct. 1125, 47 L.Ed.2d 327 (1976), nor in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>instructions relating to the Government\u2019s obligation to prove a sufficient number of fraudulent representations \u201cto satisfy * * beyond a reasonable doubt that the scheme and artifice alleged was, in fact, developed,\u201d <em>see, e. g., Schaefer v. United States, </em>265 F.2d 750, 753-54 (8th Cir. 1959); <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>134 F.2d 125, 133 (8th Cir. 1943); <em>cf. Myrick v. United States, </em>332 F.2d 279, 281 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We have otherwise reviewed the instructions in this case, some of which have been challenged by appellants. As a whole, the instructions are adequate and fairly presented the issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Appellants have also presented a number of challenges to the pretrial disclosures made to the defendants pursuant to the orders of the district court. We find no misconduct on the part of the prosecutors in carrying out its disclosure policies. We are satisfied that the prosecutors made adequate and proper disclosures of information to appellants either before or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Joseph Blunk a severance, in light of the common factual issues involved in the charges against each defendant and the lack of any particular prejudice to Joseph\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Accordingly, the judgments of conviction of Joseph and Vernon Blunk in Nos. 76-2051 and 76-2066 are affirmed; the judgment of conviction of Donna Blunk in No. 76-2052 is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
