L. Mechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 375, 376, 84 S.Ct. 874, 11 L.Ed.2d 788 (1964). In this return engagement to the reviewing courts, Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB or petitioner), representing common carrier barge lines handling almost all of the regulated traffic along the Mississippi River system <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitions this court to review and set aside <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a report and final order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, \u25a0 acting through its Division 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which granted an application filed by member railroads of the Southwestern Freight Bureau for special relief from the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s general prohibition against long- and short-haul rate discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7 4(1), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 4(1) (1970).

Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>existing rates would continue in effect for intermediate destinations along the St. Louis-to-Houston route and would be higher than the proposed rate in certain cases, the railroads were required at the same time to seek relief from the general proscription of section 4(1). See <em>generally In-termountain Rate Cases, </em>234 U.S. 476, 34 S.Ct. 986, 58 L.Ed. 1408 (1914). This \u201cfourth-section\u201d application was supported by one shipper, Granite City Steel Company, which during 1971 had shipped 92.6 percent of more than 37,000 tons of various steel products by barge from St. Louis to Houston. J.A. 332. The proposed rate of $14.01 per ton was calculated at 110 percent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the shipper\u2019s aggregate costs for comparable transportation of its product by barge. Both the railroads and the shipper claim that this rate was determined upon lengthy negotiations to be \u201cthe highest rate which would permit movement of the traffic by rail.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.; </em>Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 3.

United States, </em>211 F.Supp. 42, 44-45 (N.D.Ala. 1962). Of these four criteria, we need concern ourselves on this appeal only with the second, for WFB\u2019s essential position collapses basically to the argument that the railroads failed to meet their burden of showing that the proposed $14.01 rate was \u201cno lower than necessary to meet existing competition.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">This case consequently boils down to little more than a dispute over the discrete cost items to be included in determining the shipper\u2019s total cost of moving the goods to Houston via barge. The railroads based their proposed rate on the following calculation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Origin loading cost $ 2.00 per net ton</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">Barge rate (St. Louis to Houston) 7.98</p>\n<p id=\"ATXY\">Houston transfer 1.60</p>\n<p id=\"ad9-dedup-0\">Interstate switching 1.16</p>\n<p id=\"Avq\">Total 10% Add On $12.74 per net ton 1.27</p>\n<p id=\"ATyG\">TOTAL $14.01 per net ton</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\"><em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 12; J.A. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-21\">Petitioner discredits this calculation, claiming that the total cost of utilizing barge transportation actually is significantly higher because most ex-barge traffic in Houston travels by truck, not railroad, and that'at least half of all such truck deliveries to Houston-area customers suffer delays that result in additional dockside storage and reloading charges. While it does not dispute the first three above-described cost items, petitioner vigorously argues that to reflect accurately the actual total cost of getting the shipper\u2019s products to their ultimate destination, the Houston-area customer, the ex-barge interstate rail switching charge of $1.16 per net ton should be replaced by a \u201cdrayage\u201d charge of $2.00 per net ton for land movement in Houston and a Houston pier transfer and reloading charge of $1.00 per net ton. Petitioner therefore contends that the actual cost of the subject barge and ex-barge shipments, and perforce the lowest railroad rate \u201cnecessary to meet existing competition\u201d by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>barge line members, is not $14.01 per net ton as proposed but rather $16.04.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Quite obviously, the higher the railroads\u2019 rate the lower the intermodal competition and the less the barge lines need fear the railroads\u2019 encroachment into the market for the shipper\u2019s transportation requirements, such as it now is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In passing upon WFB\u2019s claims we are mindful of the limited nature of our review. If the Commission\u2019s action in this fourth-section proceeding is not strictly one of ratemaking in the usual sense, as counsel for the barge lines asserted during oral argument, it is at least for our current purposes functionally indistinguishable from ratemaking. See <em>Igert </em>v. <em>United States, </em>211 F.Supp. at 44; <em>Seatrain Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>168 F.Supp. 819, 826 (S.D.N.Y.1958). This being so, as we believe it clearly is, the rate-determining action in the instant case is a product of the agency\u2019s informal rulemaking powers, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(4), 553 (Supp. V 1975); <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Florida East Coast Railway Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973), for which the proper standard of review is that specified by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)-(D) (1970), and principally by paragraph (A). Basically, then, we may disturb the Commission decision only if we find that it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(A). We may require no more than that a rational basis be discernible \u201cin the Commission\u2019s opinion ... for its treatment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 290, 95 S.Ct. 438, 444, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>see, e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>406 U.S. 742, 748-49, 92 S.Ct. 1941, 32 L.Ed.2d 453 (1972); <em>National Association of Food Chains, Inc. v. ICC, </em>535 F.2d 1308, 1313-14 (D.C.Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">This less stringent standard of review is especially appropriate in ratemaking cases, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">[t]he process of rate making is essentially empiric. The stuff of the process is fluid and changing \u2014 the resultant of factors that must be valued as well as weighed. Congress has therefore delegated the enforcement of transportation policy to a permanent expert body and has charged it with the duty of being responsive to the dynamic character of transportation problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\"><em>Board of Trade of Kansas City </em>v. <em>United States, </em>314 U.S. 534, 546, 62 S.Ct. 366, 372, 86 L.Ed. 432 (1942); <em>see, e. g., ICC v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., </em>222 U.S. 541, 550, 32 S.Ct. 108, 112, 56 L.Ed. 308 (1912) (\u201cthere is no possibility of solving the question as though it were a mathematical problem to which there could only be one correct answer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">Notwithstanding these strict limits upon our review, we conclude that the decision challenged in this appeal cannot survive the minimal requirements of rationality on the present state of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the total transportation cost from the shipper to the Houston-area receivers more closely approximated WFB\u2019s calculation than the applicant railroads\u2019, J.A. 198, 335, though he ultimately held that the second criterion of the four-prong test enunciated in <em>Transcontinental Cases of 1922, </em>had been rendered nugatory by the enactment of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15a(3). The railroads did except to this \u201cfinding\u201d in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>of the WFB\u2019s proffered figure, J.A. 289-90, but, on appeal, Review Board No. 4\u2019s <em>ratio decidendi </em>again entailed a section 15a(3) analysis and not an analysis of whether the proposed rate was \u201cno lower than necessary to meet existing competition.\u201d J.A. 301. The Commission, however, expressly disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s cost analysis and his conclusion that the WFB\u2019s figure was the more accurate one. J.A. 340. It held that \u201cthe actual costs <em>incurred to the shipper </em>of moving these commodities by barge more closely approximates [the applicants\u2019 figure] . . . .\u201d J.A. 342 (emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s report gives the following reasons in support of this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">We find no basis in evidence to substantiate the $2.00 per net ton drayage charge. As noted in the initial decision, much of the beyond-Houston tonnage (approximately 90 percent according to applicants\u2019 evidence) is carried by truck in the customers\u2019 private, unregulated vehicles, and this is not disputed by protestants. Drayage charges for these shipments are generally paid by the customer to the Houston stevedores, and not by the shipper. Generally, all additional and potentially required movements after destination at Houston, such as drayage, are paid by the receiver and not the shipper, whether the line-haul shipment is by barge or rail and whether moved after-wards by common carrier or private carriage. The proposed rail rate of $14.00 [$14.01] per net ton has been computed on a basis of 110 percent of the shipper\u2019s total through costs of moving these commodities by barge. Since drayage is generally paid by the receiver at Houston, this charge would not be included in the computation of the shipper\u2019s total barge costs, and therefore would not [sic] used by applicants in the construction of their rate. Since a portion of the ex-barge traffic does move by rail, we find the $1.16 per net ton switching charge the best evidence of record in calculating the shipper\u2019s total costs, and find its use applicable in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">j(&lt; * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-7\">While protestants\u2019 assertions of fact in regard to additional unloading and reloading at Houston can be properly accepted, we find no basis in evidence to substantiate the extra $1.00 per net ton charge beyond the $1.60 per net ton direct transfer charge. As in the situation with drayage charges noted above, 90 percent of the beyond-Houston tonnage moves by private carriage. These charges are generally paid by the customer to the Houston stevedores, and could not possibly be computed on a per net ton basis to all of Granite City\u2019s private carriage receivers which require the extra handling. Further, additional common carrier ex-barge movements above the direct transfer charge, such as extra rehan-dling, are generally paid by the receiver and not by the shipper as part of his total costs. As such, this extra charge would not be included in the computation of the shipper\u2019s total barge costs, and therefore would not be used by applicants in the construction of their rate. Further, assuming the extra handling charges for even a small portion of this traffic would be paid for by the shipper, we could not possibly compute on a per net ton basis this extra cost to the shipper, because there is no method with which we could determine the percentage of traffic in which the shipper would pay these charges so as to verify a $1.00 figure or any per net ton figure. Based on the above, we find the additional $1.00 per net ton extra handling charge inapplicable in the computation of the shipper\u2019s total costs of moving the issue commodities by barge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">J.A. 340-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">Petitioner challenges the assumption underlying the above-quoted reasoning, namely that the primary issue involved is one of cost to shippers only and that, consequently, the charges generally paid by receivers are not relevant inputs into the fourth-section calculus. It argues rather that the relevant inquiry is the total cost from origin to ultimate destination, no matter who pays the various shipping charges, because \u201call charges incurred in the use of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>route eventually will be reflected in the price paid for goods and ultimately must be considered in any rational selection of the lowest cost method of transportation.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Reply Brief at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">In support of this argument, petitioner refers us to two Commission decisions which it claims demonstrate that heretofore the agency in fourth-section cases has always included a <em>11 </em>charges incurred in using barge service irrespective of whether the consignor or consignee paid any or all of them. <em>Steel Pipe From The East To The Southwest, </em>301 I.C.C. 203, 223 (1957); <em>Pig Iron From New York Points To Detroit, </em>296 I.C.C. 747, 750 (1955); <em>see </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 33-34; Petitioner\u2019s Reply Brief at 4. Neither the Commission nor the intervenor railroad has troubled to distinguish or even cite these two cases, apparently choosing instead to cast a veil of silence over the difficulties they raise. We cannot ignore these cases, and neither should the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">In the <em>Steel Pipe </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the Commission held that certain proposed all-rail rates were lower than necessary to meet the existing competition and, consequently, denied the fourth-section applications. Recognizing that establishing differential rate treatment of competing services was not an accurate science, the agency noted that the difference in value of the competing services over their respective routes must nonetheless be considered in passing upon the applications.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>301 I.C.C. at 223. It then went on to analyze and discuss various intermodal \u201cvalue differences\u201d that were evident from the record before it. One of these resulted from the fact that some producers did not have direct access to water service and, hence, had to pay additional costs to get their goods from their plants to the barges. This, of course, presents a different factual situation from our immediate case because Granite City Steel maintains a barge dock only a short distance from its steel mill, J.A. 194, and origin loading costs of $2.00 per net ton were included in the railroads\u2019 calculation. J.A. 332. The Commission in <em>Steel Pipe, </em>however, did emphasize, in apparent contrast to its present position, that it is not necessarily who pays any immediate shipping charge but rather who ultimately bears the transportation costs and influences or makes the traffic-routing decisions that is analytically germane.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-11\">The [railroads] consider all costs which are incidental to the barge loadings as outside the competitive scope of the respective rates in that the consignee, who pays the freight, is interested only in the charges beyond the loading points. <em>But this record is not convincing that the producers who would bear these incidental costs would have no influence in the routing so as to avoid such expenses.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>301 I.C.C. at 223 (emphasis added). We believe that the record in the present case is similarly barren.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Even more to the point, the Commission in <em>Steel Pipe </em>also stressed that the ex-barge costs at the destination port were a material difference between barge and rail services warranting consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">The [railroads] apparently constructed their all-rail rates on the belief that transfer charges at the ports were generally absorbed by the motor carriers, and that some shipments move directly through the ports and do not incur the charge. But other than the testimony of 1 shipper . . . there is little evidence of record to establish that such charge is not generally incurred. On the contrary, several shipper witnesses supporting the [railroads] readily admitted that such charges were being incurred, and, as seen, absorption of such charges by the motor carriers was found to be unlawful in <em>Oilfield Equipment to and between the Southwest, supra. </em>In their exceptions, the [railroads] argue that barge-truck service without storage is available and alone necessitates this competitive level of rail rates. In a particular situation this might be true. <em>But where, as here, an extensive adjustment of rates is under consideration, all factors must be viewed in their proper perspective to the whole, and we cannot ignore the fact that barge traffic generally is stored at the ports and is subject to additional charges therefor. These factors should have been given some consideration in the establishment of the all-rail rates.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 223-24 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">In the other case emphasized by WFB, <em>Pig Iron From New York Points To Detroit, </em>the railroads filed a fourth-section application proposing a reduced rate to enable them better to compete for the pig iron traffic from Buffalo to Detroit, of which they then transported only about two percent. Again, the parties disputed the total costs of the barge service, including whether barge loading and certain dock storage and incidental handling costs at the destination port should be included in the relevant fourth-section cost equation. In concluding that both sets of costs should be so included, 296 I.C.C. at 751-52, the Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-11\">We have consistently held that, in order to justify rail rates lower than normal rail rates to meet water competition, the proposed rates should not be lower than necessary to meet the competition, <em>which is indicated by the cost to the shipper for the transportation over the water route, plus such incidental expenses as are incurred in using the competitive service. </em>Due to somewhat less desirable service, it is often necessary that the water carriers maintain rates lower than those in effect over competing all-rail routes, but the proper relation of the rates depends upon the circumstances in each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 749-50 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">These two cases referred to by the petitioner may not ultimately be dispositive of the cost-evidence issue in the instant proceeding, but they do indicate that in other cases, not dissimilar to the one <em>sub judice, </em>the Commission has required that the cost calculation in a fourth-section application include all incidental costs incurred in shipping via the competing service and has required more than conclusory factual assertions in determining which cost-bearers may influence the routing decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">It may well be, as our intervenor argues, see Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 7-9, that in cases where the receiver is not on a railroad siding and must thus use truck service from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the destination port the ex-rail costs will approximate the ex-barge costs (i. e., shipments by either barge or rail would incur similar reloading and drayage charges) so that neither should be included in computing an acceptable fourth-section rail rate. This argument must await the Commission\u2019s attention, however, for the evidence of record as it currently exists cannot adequately support a factual finding necessary to resolve the point either one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Although the Commission is owed considerable deference when bringing its expertise to bear in ratemaking action, it cannot be permitted simply to abandon the rules of the game ad libitum. Some explanation is due both the parties and the reviewing court when a decision is made that <em>conflicts </em>with relevant precedent. The apparent departure from a method of analysis previously applied in resolving other inter-modal rate competition cases calls for a reexamination and some reasoned explanation by the Commission which is now missing from the record we review. <em>See generally Parkhill Truck Co. v. United States, </em>559 F.2d 834 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">On remand, the Commission should reconcile its disposition of these proceedings with the principles applied in the <em>Steel Pipe </em>and <em>Pig Iron </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>and take a hard look<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> at the respective ex-rail and ex-barge service disabilities in considering whether the proposed rate at issue is no lower than necessary to meet the competition of the barge lines. Specifically, the Commission should address itself once again to the question whether the within-Houston ex-barge costs are actually within or without the competitive scope of the respective barge and rail rates. We accordingly vacate the Commission\u2019s order in this case and remand the record for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">.

Both the ALJ\u2019s and Review Board\u2019s decisions, however, concluded that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15a(3), imposed a burden on the protestant barge lines, which they did not attempt to meet, <em>see </em>J.A. 336, of showing their inherent cost advantages if they were to enjoy protection from rail competition. J.A. 203, 301. This burden was not imposed by the Commission in its final decision, which substituted its own analysis of the cost evidence.

The 10% add-on figure was applied by the railroads to adjust barge shipment costs to reflect certain relative drawbacks of that particular mode\u2019s service characteristics. <em>See </em>J.A. 332; Government\u2019s Brief at 7 n.3. Apparently it is not a required factor in the fourth-section calculation of every case, and, in at least one case, this 10% differential has been characterized by a reviewing court as unduly arbitrary in favor of the barge lines, at least where there had been no showing of their operating costs. <em>See Igert v. United States, </em>211 F.Supp. 42, 46 (N.D.Ala.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">. With the existing intermodal rate structure, the railroads had suffered an almost complete loss of the supporting shipper\u2019s traffic to the barge lines. J.A. 332. in fact, the shipper testified that due to the significantly higher rate for rail transportation this mode generally was used only when inventory shortages necessitated faster delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">What the intervenor-respondent, Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co., means by \u201cthe highest rate which would permit movement of the traffic by rail . . . is not entirely clear. Presumably, it means that the proposed rate would permit the railroads to be more competitive with the barges. The record shows that there was some rail traffic at the prior rate, just not as much as the railroads naturally would like. <em>Cf. </em>Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">. Though it did not advert to the point in its reply brief or during oral argument, petitioner devotes a considerable portion of its main brief to the proposition that subsection 15a(3) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15a(3) (Supp. V 1975), added in a 1958 amendment, Pub.L.No.85-625, \u00a7 6, 72 Stat. 572 (Aug. 12, 1958), did not in any way modify the standards traditionally applied to fourth-section applications. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 42-68. This particular appeal does not present an appropriate context for resolution of this question, however, since it is not a real controversy in the case. The Commission, in its final decision \u2014 the one we review \u2014 neither agreed nor disagreed with WFB\u2019s assertion. Its report expressly states that the application would be disposed of \u201con the evidence of record presented, evaluated under the traditional fourth section criteria, without reaching the issue of whether or not section 15a(3) should be interpreted as amending section 4.\u201d J.A. 344. <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Brief at 15-16. The fact that both the AD and the Commission\u2019s Review Board No. 4 concluded that subsection 15a(3) <em>did </em>affect the agency\u2019s treatment of applications for fourth-section relief is irrelevant, <em>see </em>J.A. 203, 301, for we sit in review of the agency\u2019s final decision and not that of preliminary tribunals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">.

The applicant-railroads in <em>Steel Pipe </em>argued that no differential rate treatment was warranted because many receivers held large inventories and stockpiles in the destination area. The protestant barge lines, on the other hand, argued that no traffic would move by barge without an appropriate differential. <em>See </em>301 I.C.C. at 223. In the case before us now, the parties apparently agree that the 10 percent differential applied by the railroads in their applications was proper; as we have seen, they disagree only over the multiplicand, which is the sum of the barge costs deemed to be within the competitive scope of the intermodal rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">. The \u201crouting influence\u201d issue also was touched upon in the <em>Pig Iron </em>case, <em>supra, </em>where one shipper\u2019s witness stated that the cost of loading the barges was a manufacturing and not a transportation cost. To this proffered nicety, the Commission responded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYL\">regardless of the terminology used, it is clear that the difference, if any, between loading rail cars on the shipper\u2019s siding and of loading from the shipper\u2019s premises to the vessel is an expense that would be considered by shippers in choosing the method of transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">296 I.C.C. at 750.

The Commission\u2019s statement that the ex-barge drayage and extra-rehandling charges are \u201cgenerally\u201d paid by the receiver and not by the shipper is not supported by record evidence so far as we have been able to determine. See J.A. 340. The Commission\u2019s report refers to the ALJ\u2019s finding that approximately 47 percent of the barge traffic shown was transshipped out of Houston to other points within Texas and that 90 percent of this \u201cbeyond-Houston\u201d tonnage was trucked in the customers\u2019 vehicles. J.A. 194.
