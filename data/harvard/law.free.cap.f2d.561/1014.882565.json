For the reasons briefly set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-23\">Appellant Larry Davis was arrested by two narcotics officers in the District of Columbia on May 20, 1976. On June 29, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging him with one count of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>of phenmetrazine (popularly known as \u201cPreludin\u2019\u2019) with intent to distribute and one count of simple possession of the same substance. On August 12, appellant came before the trial judge below for a hearing on his motion to suppress thirteen phenme-trazine tablets taken from him at the time of his arrest. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge denied the motion based upon a finding of probable cause for the arrest and the concomitant search. One week later, the case was tried on a stipulation of facts which recapitulated the testimony presented at the earlier suppression hearing; no new evidence was introduced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was found guilty of possession of phenmetrazine with intent to distribute, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). On September 3, appellant was sentenced to five years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2). On the next business day, September 7, the trial judge corrected the sentence by adding a mandatory special parole term of two years, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Appellant raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether there existed probable cause for his arrest and search; (2) whether the trial judge violated appellant\u2019s rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment when he amended the original sentence by adding the special parole term; and (3) whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) is constitutional as applied to phenmetrazine absent proof in each case that the particular phen-metrazine involved is related to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">I. THE PROBABLE CAUSE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">Appellant argues that the arresting officers lacked probable cause for his arrest and search. The facts surrounding his arrest, as detailed at the suppression hearing and stipulated to at trial, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">During the late afternoon of May 20, 1976, Officers Carl A. Occhipinti and Vance L. Beard were \u201cstaked out\u201d in an observation post on the third floor of a vacant house in the middle of the 1100 block of \u201cO\u201d Street, N.W. These officers were engaged in an ongoing investigation of narcotics activity in that area and were using binoculars to make observations of the 1000 block of \u201cO\u201d Street. According to Officer Occhipinti, who testified at the suppression hearing, the area under observation was well known to him and to other narcotics officers as having a high concentration of narcotics activity, including the street sale of phenmetrazine, heroin and other drugs. He himself had previously made nine arrests in that area, all involving phenmetrazine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was his further testimony that the only type of phenmetrazine found on the street at that time took the form of a pink pill somewhat larger than an aspirin tablet, bearing the inscription \u201cBI-62.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">At approximately 5:00 P.M., the two officers first noticed appellant, who was standing on the north side of the 1000 block of \u201cO\u201d Street, approximately three-quarters of a block away. He was observed by the officers for approximately five minutes, in clear weather, from an unobstructed view. During this period, the officers observed three different men approach appellant and engage him in a brief discussion. In each instance, the conversation concluded with the stranger handing appellant what appeared to be an amount of money, which appellant would then count and place in his front pants pocket. The appellant would then remove a small manila envelope from his rear pants pocket and appear to count out a number of small objects to be given to the stranger before his departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">Officer Occhipinti testified that the first two strangers walked away from the appellant without revealing anything further to the narcotics officers concerning the nature of the observed transactions. After the third man left the appellant, however, he passed directly underneath the observation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>post at a distance of approximately 20-25 feet. As he did so, Officer Occhipinti testified, he momentarily unclenched his fist such that the officers were able to observe several pink pills which appeared to them to be phenmetrazine tablets. The officers then left their observation post, observed appellant entering a liquor store on the southeast corner of 11th and 0 Streets, noticed that he held a large quantity of money in his hand, and placed him under arrest. Officer Beard then removed from appellant\u2019s right rear pants pocket a manila envelope containing thirteen pink phenme-trazine tablets, inscribed with the marking \u201cBI-62.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">On these facts, the trial judge denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the phenme-trazine tablets. He found that the experience and expertise of the arresting officers, coupled with the nature of the events observed, gave rise to a probable cause belief that a crime had been committed. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 400, 403-4, 458 F.2d 819, 821-22 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Appellant challenges this finding by the trial judge, contending that the events observed by the two narcotics officers, even when considered in light of their broad experience and their knowledge of that particular neighborhood as a \u201chigh narcotics area,\u201d are insufficient to constitute probable cause for arrest. He insists that the exchanges observed by the two officers \u201care also susceptible to many innocent interpretations, even in the eyes of an experienced officer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">We do not agree. It is true that an arrest based solely upon an officer\u2019s experience and expertise, without more, lacks probable cause. Similarly, the observation of a generally suspicious currency transaction, even in a high narcotics area, may not necessarily give rise to probable cause. But where, as here, <em>all </em>of the above elements are present in sturdy form- \u2014 and particularly where a suspect is closely observed engaging in the identical suspicious activity <em>three </em>times within a five-minute span \u2014 a finding of probable cause is sound. As this Court recently stated in a similar case involving a single narcotics transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFiL\">Because all innocent explanations for this exchange of a tinfoil packet for currency seem so implausible, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 161, 162, 551 F.2d 347, 348 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">II. THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-14\">Appellant next challenges the trial judge\u2019s alteration of his original sentence. At first, he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment with parole eligibility to be determined in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That sentence, however, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>advertently omitted a special parole term, which is required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Four days after the imposition of the original sentence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial judge corrected the sentence originally imposed by adding a special parole term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge\u2019s action violated his constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy in that it runs afoul of the general rule against increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence after he has begun to serve it. Exception should be made to this rule, he contends, only where an illegal sentence cannot be corrected through means other than by increasing it. <em>Cf. Bozza v. United States, </em>330 U.S. 160, 166, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947). In this case, appellant\u2019s argument continues, the trial judge need not necessarily have increased his sentence to accommodate the mandatory special parole term because he could have altered the sentence to only <em>three </em>years\u2019 imprisonment with a special parole term of two additional years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">This argument was considered and rejected by this Court three years ago in <em>United States v. Brock, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 291, 507 F.2d 1114 (1974). In that case, the trial judge had sentenced a person convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) to five years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2), without any mention of a special parole term. Five months later, the defendant moved to have his sentence vacated, advancing the argument that the trial judge was by virtue of the Double Jeopardy Clause relegated to imposing a new sentence of a three-year special parole term (pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)) and a term of imprisonment not in excess of <em>two </em>years <em>(i. e., </em>not to exceed in total the five years originally imposed). On appeal after the trial judge refused to modify the sentence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court noted that the defendant\u2019s unique argument had at that time been considered and rejected by three circuit courts of appeals. <em>See Garcia v. United </em>States, 492 F.2d 395, 397-98 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 897, 95 S.Ct. 178, 42 L.Ed.2d 142 (1974); <em>Caille v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 614, 616 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>474 F.2d 1336 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>aff\u2019g, </em>356 F.Supp. 173, 174 (E.D.N.Y. 1972).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court at that time found those decisions and their result to be sound; nothing presented here persuades us to the contrary, nor that this case should not be controlled by <em>Brock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">III. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-14\">Lastly, appellant challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) insofar as it prohibits the possession of phenmetrazine which is not shown to have itself moved in interstate commerce. His argument is grounded on the notion that Congress de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>rives power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the intrastate possession of only those controlled substances which it finds to affect interstate commerce. He contends, in short, that because Congress made no such legislative finding <em>specific </em>to phenme-trazine when it enacted this statute, it lacked the power to proscribe the purely intrastate possession<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of that particular drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">We find this argument to be without merit. It has been raised and uniformly rejected in several other circuit courts,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and we see no reason why a different result should apply here. Without repeating the sound reasoning of those decisions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we merely note that the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate broad <em>classes </em>of activities which are found to have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. <em>See Perez v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 146, 152-54, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971); <em>United States v. Collier, </em>478 F.2d 268, 273 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Scales, </em>464 F.2d 371, 375 (6th Cir. 1972). In the instant case, when Congress enacted Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (known as the Controlled Substances Act), it made the express finding that the local use of certain classes of drugs \u2014 one of which includes phenmetra-zine<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201ccontribute^] to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We hold, as other courts have unanimously held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>before us, that such a Congressional declaration is sufficient to justify the exercise of Commerce Clause power here challenged and, furthermore, that Congress had before it ample justification upon which to include phenmetrazine and other related drugs within the controlled substances regulated by the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">. Appellant had waived his right to a jury trial, and the Government had dismissed the simple possession count of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">. In his six years as a narcotics officer, Officer Occhipinti estimated he had made in excess of 400 drug-related arrests, of which approximately one in five involved phenmetrazine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23. Appellant suggests that the officers should have undertaken some unspecified \u201cfurther investigation\u201d prior to making an arrest; he characterizes their failure to do so as a \u201cclassic case of police overreaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">. Appellant challenges the Government\u2019s right to rely on the officers\u2019 additional observation of the small pink pills in the hand of his third visitor based upon the failure of the trial judge to make an express finding of fact concerning that observation at the time that the suppression motion was denied. He points to Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which requires that where \u201cfactual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the record.\u201d It is the Court\u2019s view, however, that even apart from the officers\u2019 observation of the characteristically pink phenmetrazine tablets, their other observations, as noted by the trial judge, were sufficient to give rise to probable cause. <em>See United States </em>v. Thomas, <em>supra; United States v.

For example, when confronted with an identical argument made in connection with the regulation of marihuana, the Sixth Circuit in <em>Scales </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-9\">In Section 101 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, Congress has summarized the results of its in-depth investigations into the problems of drug abuse in the United States. <em>See also </em>H.R. No. 91-1444, 91st Cong.2d Sess. (1970), set forth in 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News, at 4572-74. Comparable to the findings upon which Congress based its 1965 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Section 101 of the present Act summarizes Congress\u2019s conclusions that illegal intrastate activities involving controlled substances substantially affect interstate commerce and that the effective control of the interstate problem requires that intrastate, as well as interstate, activities be regulated. [Compare H.R. 2, 89th Cong. 1st Sess. (1965), reported in 1965 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Adm.

Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-5\">(A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are transported in interstate commerce,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-6\">(B) controlled substances distributed . \u2022 locally usually have been transported in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-7\">interstate commerce immediately before their distribution, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-8\">(C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-9\">(4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-10\">(5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-11\">(6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-12\">(7) The United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international conventions designed to establish effective control over international and domestic traffic in controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">. Appellant\u2019s argument in effect challenges the inclusion of phenmetrazine as a controlled substance based upon his stated assertion that Congress lacked sufficient information specific to that particular drug upon which to conclude that its abuse leads to interstate ramifications. Without judging the accuracy of that assertion, we reject the notion implicit in appellant\u2019s argument that Congress is constrained to legislate with respect to drugs on a piecemeal basis and may not proscribe the use of certain classes of drugs based upon compelling evidence before it which is pertinent to that class. Certainly, Congress\u2019 efforts to regulate in this critical area should not be hindered by a judicially-imposed requirement that it make individual findings of interstate impact for each of scores of similar regulated drugs. Its task is a difficult one at best. As the Fifth Circuit has wisely observed;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-18\">A large percentage of controlled substances, especially those held or manufactured for illicit sale, are unlabeled, thereby making a determination of their source of origin extremely difficult or impossible. The form in which they are held or consumed adds to the difficulty or impossibility of this determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-19\">From such a finding, Congress could reasonably assume that an attempt to separate intrastate activities in controlled substances from those which were conducted on an interstate basis would be a futile exercise substantially interfering with its power to regulate interstate commerce in these substances; a power upon which any attempt to end or alleviate the drug abuse problem would necessarily be based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-20\">Past attempts to regulate interstate commerce in controlled substances had failed because of the difficulty or impossibility of determining the substance\u2019s source of origin. To make another attempt at controlling interstate commerce in controlled substances without regulating both intrastate and interstate activities in these substances would be ineffective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-21\"><em>United States v.
