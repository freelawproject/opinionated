Here, the purchaser was the successful bidder at a December 1972 sheriff\u2019s sale but, because of litigation in state court over the validity of the sale, he did not receive the deed from the sheriff until March 1973. He was issued a policy of title insurance on the property in March 1973, insuring him against \u201c[a]ny defect in or lien or encumbrance on such title.\u201d Under Pennsylvania law, real estate taxes attached on January 1, 1973 and thus constituted a lien at the time the deed was delivered and recorded, and a title policy issued. We adopt as our own the opinion of The Honorable Edward R. Becker, <em>Bragman v. Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co., </em>421 F.Supp. 99 (E.D.Pa.1976). The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
