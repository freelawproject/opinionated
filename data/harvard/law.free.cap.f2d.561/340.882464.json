SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b398-27\">This appeal is from the District Court\u2019s judgment denying appellant\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court held that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>because appellant was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the language of that section, he was not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. We hold that appellant was a prevailing party within the statutory language, and we accordingly reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The events that preface this appeal are presented briefly in the District Court\u2019s judgment, <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mumford, </em>11 E.P.D. \u00b610803 (D.D.C.1976),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and more fully in the extensive administrative record. On March 27, 1974 appellant, who is black and was then a bindery foreman classified WP-19,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a \u201cComplaint of Discrimination\u201d with his employer, the Library of Congress. JA 8, 61. Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that two white supervisors had discriminated against him on the basis of race. Specifically, the complaint cited the selection on March 7, 1974 of a less qualified applicant for promotion to the GS-12 position of Printing Officer. On May 17, 1974 the Coordinator of the Library\u2019s Equal Opportunity Office (EOO) cancelled appellant\u2019s complaint for \u201cfailure to prosecute.\u201d JA 72-73. The notice of cancellation informed appellant that he could appeal the decision within the agency to the Deputy Librarian and, if dissatisfied, then file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court within 30 days of final agency decision. JA 72. Appellant did appeal (JA 74-78) and on May 17, 1974 the Deputy Librarian stated that he concurred in the cancellation. JA 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Shortly thereafter appellant obtained private counsel. JA 3. On June 17, 1974, through his counsel, he filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to, <em>inter alia, </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e \u2014 2000e-17 (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975). Appellant sought declaratory and injunctive relief including award of back pay and attorneys\u2019 fees. JA 5. After the filing of this lawsuit and \u2014 according to the District Court \u2014 \u201c[a]s a result of the lawsuit,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Deputy Librarian of Congress on July 8 vacated and rescinded the agency decision of May 17 to cancel appellant\u2019s complaint. The Deputy Librarian remanded the case to the EOO for further investigation and recommendation. JA 88-89. After obtaining authorization from appellant\u2019s attorney, the United States Attorney prepared, signed, and filed on July 30, 1974 a stipulation staying all further proceedings in the District Court action for a period of 60 days following the date of a final administrative decision by the Library of Congress. JA 10. The District Court approved this stipulation on August 5. JA 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The Library\u2019s EOO then conducted counseling and investigation concerning appellant\u2019s employment discrimination claim. Subsequently, a four-day hearing was held (JA 16), after which appellant was eventually promoted to the GS-12 position he sought. On January 28, 1976 appellant returned to the District Court and filed a motion for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $12,146. Appellant based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>claim on Section 706(k) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1970), as made applicable to the federal government by Section 717(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(d) (Supp. V 1975). JA 12. Most of the attorneys\u2019 fees claimed by appellant related to administrative proceedings conducted by the Library of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On April 7, 1976 the District Court, in a memorandum and order, denied the motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. The basis for the District Court\u2019s holding was its assertion that appellant was \u201cnot a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) [Section 706(k)] and therefore not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Foster v. Mumford, supra, </em>11 E.P.D. \u00b610803 at 7362. \u201cThis Court has * * * merely received plaintiff\u2019s discrimination complaint and stayed its hand by consent of the parties. No further judicial relief has been pursued or obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7363. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The factual history of this litigation, as outlined above, is not in dispute. In view of these facts, we cannot accept the District Court\u2019s conclusion that appellant was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and is thus not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Unfortunately, the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d is not defined in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nor was the term specifically defined in the legislative history of the 1964 Act or the 1972 amendments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the recent case of <em>Grubbs v. Butz, </em>179 U.S. App.D.C. 18, 548 F.2d 973 (1976), however, this court, in construing the meaning of \u201cprevailing party,\u201d did examine the purposes of Title VIPs attorney fee provision as revealed in the legislative history. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">First, Congress desired to \u201cmake it easier for a plaintiff of limited means to bring a meritorious suit,\u201d as Senator Humphrey stated in explaining the changes made by the amendment. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">548 F.2d at 975 (footnote omitted). Surely the effectiveness of this incentive for persons of limited means would be greatly diminished if the complainant were forced to bear the expense of his attorneys\u2019 fees whenever the Government chose to award the requested relief after a court action had been filed but prior to a judgment or a court order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Our conclusion is supported by two recent decisions of this court construing the analogous attorney fee provision in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) (Supp. V 1975). That section allows the court to \u201cassess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.\u201d In each of the two cases interpreting this provision, <em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>180 U.S.App. D.C.-, 553 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1977), and <em>Nationwide Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Sampson, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. -, 559 F.2d 704 (decided April 18, 1977), the appellant sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees after the Government, subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit by the appellant but without a court order having been entered, provided the information requested in the appellant\u2019s FOIA suit. In each case this court held that the appellant had \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) and rejected the appellee\u2019s contention that, by mooting a lawsuit through granting the relief sought, the Government could avoid liability for attorneys\u2019 fees. A court order compelling disclosure of the requested documents is not, the court held, a prerequisite to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under FOIA. <em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, supra, </em>553 F.2d at 1363, 1365; <em>Nationwide Building Maintenance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sampson, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 708-710. The court adopted a passage from the District Court\u2019s opinion (unpublished) in <em>Communist Party of the United States v. Department of Justice, </em>D.D.C.Civil Action No. 75-1770 (March 23,1976) (slip op. at 3), <em>appeal pend</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>ing, </em>D.C.Cir. No. 76-1746, that is equally applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">If the government could avoid liability for fees merely by conceding the cases before final judgment, the impact of the fee provision would be greatly reduced. The government would remain free to assert boilerplate defenses, and private parties who served the public interest by enforcing the Act\u2019s mandates would be deprived of compensation for the undertaking. Thus, a general bar to awards of fees in cases resolved before final judgment cannot be accepted by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In this case, in fact, neither the District Court nor the Government on appeal suggests that appellant did not prevail in his claim that he had been discriminated against or in his quest for proper remedial relief. Rather, both the District Court and the Government contend, in essence, that, because the bulk of appellant\u2019s litigational time and effort was spent in the administrative rather than the judicial process, he was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We note with considerable interest that the facts of this case \u2014 as regards the question whether the complainant was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under Section 706, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) \u2014 are indistinguishable from the facts of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Matthews [sic], </em>411 F.Supp. 1059 (D.D.C.1976), which we today affirm. <em>See Parker v. Califano, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. -, 561 F.2d 320 (No. 76-1416, decided June 30, 1977). Yet in its appeal from the District Court\u2019s decision in <em>Parker, </em>which was argued the same day before the same division of this court as was the appeal in this case, the Government did not challenge in any respect the holding that the complainant was indeed the prevailing party. Moreover, in its brief on this appeal the Government makes no attempt to distinguish the two cases. The District Court did seek to distinguish <em>Parker </em>but, in so doing, only emphasized the nearly perfect similarity of the two cases. The District Court stated: \u201cUnlike the Parker case, supra, defendant\u2019s reconsideration of plaintiff\u2019s administrative complaint involved the agency\u2019s setting aside of a threshold procedural error, which permitted the interrupted investigative process to go forward.\u201d 11 E.P.D. It 10803 at 7363. It could more accurately be said that in this case, <em>like </em>the <em>Parker </em>case, <em>supra, </em>defendant\u2019s reconsideration of plaintiff\u2019s administrative complaint involved the agency\u2019s setting aside of an erroneous administrative action that permitted the interrupted administrative process to go forward. In both cases the administrative reconsideration immediately followed the complainant\u2019s filing of a lawsuit, and in both cases the District Court found that these two events were causally as well as temporally related.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for a determination of reasonable attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>fees under Section 706(k), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). Consistent with our opinion in <em>Parker v. Califano, supra, </em>the District Court\u2019s determination of the attorney fee award should include compensation for services rendered by appellant\u2019s counsel at the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-14\">. In any action or proceeding under this sub-chapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"AYT\">This provision is made applicable to the federal government by \u00a7 717(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(d) (Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">For a discussion of the statutory framework of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, specifically, an analysis of \u00a7\u00a7 706(k) &amp; 717(d), <em>see </em>our opinion in <em>Parker v. Califano, </em>182 U.S. App.D.C. -, 561 F.2d 320 (No. 76-1416, decided June 30, 1977). Section 717(b) of Title VII, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b) (Supp. V 1975), provides that, \u201c[w]ith respect to employment in the Library of Congress, authorities granted in this subsection to the Civil Service Commission shall be exercised by the Librarian of Congress.\u201d Neither this court nor the parties ascribe any importance, for purposes of the issue on appeal, to the fact that appellant\u2019s claim was processed through Library of Congress rather than Civil Service Commission channels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-14\">.

United States, </em>554 F.2d 632 (4th Cir., decided May 4, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">It might be argued that our decision today will encourage Title VII complainants to file court actions at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure their entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees if they prevail in the administrative proceedings. Although our decision today is limited to the particular facts of this case, we do feel compelled to note, as regards this broader question, that under \u00a7 706(k), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1970), the prevailing party is entitled only to \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">and the amount to be awarded is a matter within the District Court\u2019s discretion. Abuse of the judicial or administrative process could properly be considered by the District Court in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">It could also be argued that our decision in this case, as well as our decision in <em>Parker v. Califano, supra </em>note 1, will create an anomalous distinction between Title VII complainants. That is, it might be suggested that these decisions will be read as permitting award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a complainant who prevails only after filing a lawsuit while denying such fees to a complainant who succeeds in the administrative proceedings without having to file suit. For reasons stated in <em>Parker v. Cali-fano, </em>561 F.2d 329, at n. 24, we believe this potential anomaly is far from inevitable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
