Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-26\">In <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>the issue for decision was whether or not a constitutional violation would necessarily result if the decision not to rehire a teacher was based in substantial part on the teacher\u2019s exercise of constitutionally protected conduct. The Court held that such a refusal to rehire could nevertheless pass constitutional muster if the employer could prove that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-27\">The Court enunciated the procedure to be followed by district courts in determining cases where there are allegedly both per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>missible and impermissible grounds for the termination of the employment relationship. Initially, the employee must carry the burden and prove \u201cthat his conduct was constitutionally protected and that the conduct was a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 \u2014 or, to put it in other words, that it was a \u2018motivating factor\u2019 in the Board\u2019s decision not to rehire him.\u201d 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576 (footnote omitted). If the employee carries that burden the district court must then determine if the employer has shown \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to the [employee\u2019s] reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">In the instant case, the requirements of the intervening Supreme Court decision have not been met. The record is not sufficient for our decision. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the district court so that by hearing or otherwise the reasons for the termination of appellant\u2019s employment may be explored and the findings of fact and conclusions of law mandated by <em>ML Healthy </em>may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
