The bankrupt\u2019s former wife, Judith Jean Woods <em>nee </em>Crabb (referred to herein as Judith), appeals from the determination by the bankruptcy court that the particular term at issue provided for a distribution of marital property and was therefore a discharge-able debt, and the affirmance of this finding by the district court. Woods, the bankrupt, filed no brief on appeal, so this case is considered by this court on the brief of appellant and record, without oral argument, in accordance with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">On March 16, 1973, a decree of absolute divorce from Woods was awarded to Judith. The couple had no children, although Judith had two small youngsters from a previous marriage. A \u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d entered into by the parties was approved by the court and incorporated into the decree as a part thereof. This agreement, denominated \u201cthe full and complete property settlement between the parties,\u201d allocated to Woods property consisting of two motorcycles, a 1968 Oldsmobile, and a stereo, all subject to existing liens and indebtedness. Judith was awarded the marital residence and its furnishings, as well as a 1964 Chevrolet. She assumed the mortgage on the real estate. The contested portion of the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">4. It is specifically understood and agreed that the husband does hereby assume as his own sole bills and obligations, and agrees to pay all of same from his own private assets, and indemnify and hold harmless the wife upon, all the following debts of the parties or either of them, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>a. All debts to Terre Haute Savings Bank or others for siding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">b. Terre Haute First National Bank and others for carpet and air conditioning . . . and any other debts owed to said institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">c. Avco Financial Services, for king size mattress, cycles and all other items and debts owed to said lender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">d. Sears Roebuck Co. \u2014 for TV, refrigerator and all other items and debts owed for or to said company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">e. Debt for World Book Encyclopedias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">f. Woolco Department Store \u2014 all accounts and debts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">g. Grants Company \u2014 all bills and debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">5. The wife shall be the sole owner of all the items mentioned in the immediately foregoing paragraphs and sub-paragraphs, notwithstanding that the husband is assuming and obligating himself to pay all debts, liens and encumbrances against the same, and the wife shall have a cause of action against him for any failure to pay or default in paying any of said obligations for any repossessions, harm, judgment or other liabilities or hurts that come to her by reason of his failure to abide by this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">Woods filed his petition in bankruptcy on June 15, 1973, and designated Judith as an unsecured creditor for an indebtedness of an \u201camount undeterminable.\u201d Judith timely filed a petition objecting to the discharge of Woods from the aforementioned debts, characterizing his agreement to assume these obligations as an award in the nature of support and maintenance, which is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">A hearing on Judith\u2019s specifications of objection revealed that she had co-signed with Woods for the debts due Avco,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sears, and the two Terre Haute banks. Woods\u2019 net income was approximately $128 per week. Judith realized a weekly income of approximately $65 from baby sitting services she provided in her home, and received $25 per week as child support from her first husband,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a total of $90. The bankruptcy judge, upon review of the foregoing facts, determined that Woods\u2019 promise to pay the couple\u2019s joint debts was a part of the property settlement, and was not made in lieu of support for Judith. Judith\u2019s petition was therefore denied and Woods was discharged from all debts referred to in the separation agreement. The district court affirmed these findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-19\">The findings and conclusions of the bankruptcy judge, which were not disturbed by the district court, must be sustained by this court unless found to be clearly erroneous. <em>In re Solomon, </em>506 F.2d 463 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>In re Northern Illinois Development Corp., </em>324 F.2d 104 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-20\">That the award was termed a \u201cproperty settlement\u201d and did not purport to grant \u201calimony,\u201d in the general sense, to Judith is not dispositive, for it is the basis for creation of the obligation which determines whether it was intended as an equalization of property rights or as support and maintenance. <em>Nichols v. Hensler, </em>528 F.2d 304 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>White v. White, </em>338 N.E.2d 749 (Ind.App.1975). The record before the bankruptcy judge and the district court consisted of a copy of the divorce decree and that separation agreement incorporated therein, but does not conclusively reveal the intent of the divorce court or of the parties in including the disputed term. The law of Indiana, therefore, determines whether Woods\u2019 assumption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>parties\u2019 debts is to be construed as dividing the marital property or as providing support for Judith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Nichols, supra; Desjar-dins v. Desjardins, </em>193 F.Supp. 210, 213 (E.D.Ky.1961), <em>aff\u2019d as modified, </em>308 F.2d 111 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In <em>Nichols, supra, </em>this court addressed the issue of the actual nature of an alimony award in Indiana, and noted the dichotomy surrounding that question which is evidenced in Indiana case law. One line of cases emphasizes an award to a spouse as purely a property settlement. <em>See, e. g., Shula v. Shula, </em>235 Ind. 210, 132 N.E.2d 612 (1956); <em>Eppley v. Eppley, </em>341 N.E.2d 212 (Ind.App.1976). Another group of cases recognizes the support and maintenance aspects of an alimony award. <em>See, e. g., Wellington </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>304 N.E.2d 347 (Ind.App.1973); <em>White v. White, </em>338 N.E.2d 749 (Ind.App.1975); <em>Stanford v. Stanford, </em>352 N.E.2d 93 (Ind.App.1976). However, an analysis of the elements considered by the Indiana courts in determining that an award is for future support demonstrates that this agreement can be construed only as a present and complete settlement of the respective property rights of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">First, the agreement makes absolutely no provision for payment of any kind to Judith. The obligation to pay bills incurred during the marriage assumed by Woods benefits Judith too tenuously and indirectly to have been undertaken for her future support. By contrast, Indiana cases considering an award as support invariably involve payment of money, either in gross or periodically, or transfer of property directly to the spouse to be supported. <em>See, e. g., Wellington, supra; White, supra; Stanford, supra; Ceiga v. Ceiga, </em>114 Ind.App. 205, 51 N.E.2d 493 (1943); <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>245 Ind. 551, 201 N.E.2d 215 (1964); <em>Bosho-nig v. Boshonig, </em>148 Ind.App. 496, 267 N.E.2d 555 (1971). <em>Cf. Nichols, supra. </em>Second, the provision creating the obligation at issue occurs in the midst of provisions allocating property between the parties, and is not separate therefrom or additional thereto. <em>Nichols, supra </em>at 308. Third, there is no indication that this term was intended to balance the relative income of the parties. <em>Nichols, supra </em>at 308. No children whom Woods is obligated to support are involved; only the support of Judith is at issue. While the record evinces a difference of approximately $38.00 per week between the parties\u2019 net incomes, this disparity is not so gross so that it must be presumed by this court that the disputed term is tantamount to an allowance for support. <em>Compare Stanford, supra; Bosho-nig, supra; Ceiga, supra. </em>Finally, the agreement makes no provision for payment of a fixed sum and no specification by the court regarding the character and method of payment, <em>i. e., </em>whether in gross or in periodic payments, as seems to be required by Indiana law, Ind.Code \u00a7 31 \u2014 1\u201412\u201417, repealed September 1, 1973. <em>See White, supra </em>at 753; <em>Boshonig, supra, </em>148 Ind.App. 498, 267 N.E.2d at 557. In view of these factors, the conclusion of the bankruptcy judge that only property equalization considerations motivated the divorce court and the parties is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Judith argues further, however, that Woods\u2019 agreement to \u201cindemnify and hold [her] harmless\u201d on the debts referred to in the decree operates as a lien for the amount of indebtedness assumed. Indiana law supports this contention, Ind.Code \u00a7 31 \u2014 1\u201412\u2014 17, repealed September 1, 1973; however, recognition of a lien does not alter the basic nature of the obligation. The decree provides for distribution of marital property whereby each party is awarded some of the mutual possessions and incurs some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>mutual debts. Debts assumed by reason of such property settlements are dischargeable in bankruptcy. <em>See Nichols, supra </em>at 307, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, the findings and conclusions of the bankruptcy judge and the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-16\">. Section 17(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(7), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWH\">A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part, except such as . (7) are for alimony due or to become due, or for maintenance or support of wife or child .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-21\">. The Avco debt was secured by the two motorcycles in Woods\u2019 possession. He returned this property to the creditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-22\">. The bankruptcy judge indicated as part of his findings of fact that the amount of child support was $25 per month. However, Judith\u2019s testimony at the hearing clearly places the sum received at $25 per week. App. at 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. This divorce was rendered prior to the effective date of the new Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ind.Code \u00a7 31-1-11.5-1 et seq. (Burns Supp. 1976). Thus, the old statutory and case law is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">. The agreement specifically states that the property described and allocated therein represents a complete disposition of all marital property, and nothing in the record indicates contrariwise. Thus, Woods\u2019 agreement to pay the bills does not represent \u201ca division of other marital property not described in the agreement\u201d. <em>Nichols, supra, </em>at 309.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
