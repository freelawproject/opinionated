Laughlin and Hugh Woodside, executors of the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, filed their account embracing the proceeds of real estate of their testator, and showing a balance for distribution of $55,112.55. The account having been confirmed absolutely on March 16th, on May 4th a decree was entered distributing three fifths of the fund to distributees whose claims were undisputed, the remaining two fifths to be held by accountants subject to the further order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">When adjudication was had upon the distribution of these two fifths of the fund, it was made to appear that Alexander Laughlin, Sr., had died in May, 1867 ; that Alexander Laughlin, Jr., who would have received one fifth of the fund, had died in 1878, prior to the sale of the real estate the proceeds of which were accounted for, leaving a will; that F. B. Laughlin, entitled to the other one fifth, had become involved in 1884, and had confessed a judgment to James H. Reed, as trustee, upon which the interest of F. B. Laughlin in the real estate of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, had been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale and bought in by said Reed, in 1885, prior to the sale of said real estate by the executors of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, which had taken place in 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">On October 8, 1888, Hawkins, P.

The material facts are these :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-10\">Alexander Laughlin, Sr., died in May, 1867, leaving a will, in which, inter alia, he gave his residuary estate to his executors, \u201c to be divided by them \u201d into five shares, and one each of said shares \u201c distributed\u201d to his sons, Frank B. and Alexander, and empowered said executors \u201c to sell and dispose of any part \u201d of his \u201c real estate, wherever situate, when in their judgment they should find it prudent, and for the best interests of the legatees and- devisees \u201d named in said will. In 1886 said exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>cutors, by virtue of the discretionary power so given them, sold certain real estate belonging to said residue, and have embraced the proceeds in the present account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">In the meantime (1878) Alexander Laughlin, Jr., died, leaving a will in which, inter alia, he set apart his interest in said real estate, then unsold, along with other individual assets, subject to certain reservations not material to be mentioned here, \u201c as a fund, or estate, out of which \u201d payment in full of certain legacies then specified, amounting to the sum of $58,000, should be made, subject to the proviso, inter alia: \u201c that in case this said fund, or estate, so designated for the payment of the legacies aforesaid, shall prove inadequate or insufficient for the payment of the same in full, then the said respective legatees shall be paid proportionately to the amount devised to each; and in case the said fund or estate shall exceed the amount necessary for the payment of said legacies, said surplus shall constitute my residuary estate.\u201d \u201cAll the rest and residue\u201d of the estate \u201cnot hereinbefore provided for\u201d was given to if. IE Laughlin, who was appointed executor, with power \u201cto mahc sale or disposition of any or ail \u201d testator\u2019s property, \u00abc he might deem necessary. \u25a0*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">On December 6, 1854, J. JL lieod, trustee, obtained judg-. ment against F. iL laughlin individually. On December 9th, he issued thereon on execution attachment, and had the same served on F. B. Laugliiin aforesaid, executor of the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased; and on June 20, 1885, he received tlio sheriffs deed, by virtue of his purchase, at a sale on said judgment, of the interest of said F. B. Laughlin in the real estate aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">It is conceded that the proceeds of this real estate, embraced in the present account, are required for the \u201cpayment in full\u201d A' the legacies given by Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, as ; i Arosaid: but it is claimed in behalf of J. H. Reed, trustee, that Ik. is not only entitled to the share devised to F. B. Laughlin from his father, Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, but also tbat devised from bis brother, Alexander Laugliiin, Jr., deceased, without deduction, because the lien of said legacies was divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">It is claimed in bebalf of said legatees that the legacies were not mere charges or liens upon this land; tbat F. B. Laughlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>had no beneficial interest or estate in the land in question, which was subject to the lien of a judgment against him personally ; that nothing passed to Mr. Reed by the sheriff\u2019s sale, and that the equities arising under the will of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, can only be adjusted in the settlement of his estate, and consequently his executor must receive the fund for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">There is a strong implication in the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, that he intended an absolute conversion of his estate into personalty. It is given to his executors upon an active trust to be divided into five equal shares and \u201c distributed \u201d by them amongst his children and grandchildren. The share given to his grandchildren is to be again subdivided and \u201c distributed\u201d amongst them. The word \u201cdistribute\u201d ordinarily applies to personal estate, and that it was intended to be used in that sense is strengthened by the consideration that the executors were invested with the legal title and a power of sale with a view to make division and distribution. The division into-fiye shares, and the subdivision of one of these' into five, could only have been made conrveisently of personalty, and it is reasonable to infer contemplated conversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">\u25a0 It was argued that the power oi sale'gi.-en the executors was discretionary and only operated .is <em>% </em>conversion from the dat\u00e9 of its exercise. But thisrpower is plainly discretionary only as to the time of its exercise. ' The executors were empowered, \u201c when in their judgment they should find it prudent or for the best interests of the legatees and devisees.\u201d The discretion was legal and its exercise could have been compelled :\u2022 Erisman v. Poor Directors, 47 Pa. 509. When a discretionary power becomes imperative, it must be regarded as a trust; for, unless it is executed the legatees cannot be paid, and the will is thereby defeated. If there was an equitable conversion, it is conceded that this fund must be awarded to the executors of the will of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">But assuming that conversion under the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, did not take place until the date of the exercise of the power of sale, the will of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, presents an insuperable obstacle to the claim of Mr. Reed. The manifest intention there was to give certain specified legatees an interest, as distinguished from a lien, in his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>dividual property. He expressly \u201c sets apart or designates \u201d that property as a \u201c fund, or estate, out of which \u201d their \u201c payment in full \u201d should be made. It is not given to F. B. Laughlin individually, subject to the payment of the legacies: his beneficial interest is expressly limited to the \u201cexcess\u201d after \u201cpayment in full\u201d of these legacies: Craighead v. Given, 10 S. &amp; R. 351; Smith\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 559; Page v. Leaping-well, 18 Yes. 463. The will made it his duty, as executor, to pay them, and with that view invested him with discretionary power of sale of his realty included in the \u201c fund or estate \u201d \u201c set apart or designated \u201d for the purpose of payment. When this discretionary power became imperative, as it is conceded it did here, it became a trust, for unless executed the legatees could not be paid: Lindley\u2019s App., supra. If the sale had not become necessary, F. B. Laughlin, being beneficially entitled to the \u201cexcess\u201d need not have exercised the discretionary power. The testator could have had no other purposed</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">Without, therefore, the exercise of the discretionary power given by Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, this real estate must have been sold; and, so far as the parties claimant here are concerned, conversion may be treated as having been made under the will of Alexander Laughlin, J'r., deceased, and relating back, by operation of law, to the time when the necessity for conversion arose. It must be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that this necessity existed when Alexander Laughlin, Jr., died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">The appropriate proceeding for the adjustment of the equities of those interested in this fund, is in the settlement of the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased. The legal title of the land until sold, and its proceeds since, has been in the executors of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased. It is now, when the time for distribution has arrived, in fact personal estate. It has only now become an available asset of the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased. So far as appears, it may be required for the payment of his debts, if such there be. In any event, upon the settlement of that estate, all parties interested, whether creditors or legatees, will have their day in court, and can raise the same questions as have been raised here. The fund here for distribution is, in fact, now part of the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, and will be payable as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of the assets of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased. The contestants here claim through the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, and must look to the settlement of that estate for the final adjustment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\">A decree was then reported awarding $11,020.-81, the one fifth of the fund originally for distribution, less costs, to James H. Reed, trustee, and the other one fifth, to wit, $11,020.81, to F. B. Laughlin, executor of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, upon his giving security on account of his late assignment for the benefit of his creditors.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">Thereupon, James H. Reed, trustee, filed exceptions alleging that the auditing judge erred: 1. In making said decree.1 2. In not awarding to said trustee the whole of said fund.8 3. In awarding $11,020.81 of said fund to F. B. Laughlin, executor of A. Laughlin, Jr., and in not awarding said sum to said trustee.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">Said exceptions having been dismissed on argument before the court in banc, without opinion filed, and the final decree entered as adjudicated, James H. Reed, trustee, took this appeal, specifying that the court erred in overruling the said several exceptions.1 to 3</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-9\"><em>Mr. John S.
