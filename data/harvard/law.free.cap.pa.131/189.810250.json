Leitz, the trustee in the mortgage and a son-in-law of Samuel Reynolds, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, bought from the stockholders owning them the $6,250 of bonds pledged to the defendant and in his hands, of which purchase the defendant had notice ; that out of the proceeds of the judicial.sale of the railway, the defendant, in November, 1876, was awarded and paid $2,424.80, on account of his $7,000 loaned to the company; that after the judicial sale the company was reorganized as the Evergreen Passenger Railway Co., but the defendant had no connection with the new company until in 1879, when, Henry D. Leitz having died, the defendant was appointed by the Court of Common Pleas No. 1 his successor as the mortgage <em>trustee; </em>that in 1880 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the road was much injured by a flood, and it required a large amount of money to repair and put it in order, one half of which was supplied by the defendant, he receiving in consideration therefor the one half of all the then stock, to wit, 250 shares; that in 1881, the then stockholders sold the entire concern to A. G. Hatry, for $80,000, delivering to the latter all its property and stock; that of this purchase money, the defendant received $15,000, and delivered to Hatry all the bonds he had, including the $6,250, owned by the plaintiff\u2019s testator; that this conversion of the bonds, as alleged, was not discovered by the plaintiffs until 1887, when this suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">In the defendant\u2019s case, the defendant was called in his own behalf, when the following offers were made :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">Counsel for the defendant proposes to show by the witness that at No. 488 April Term 1877, an action was brought against the Lawrenceville &amp; Evergreen Railway Co., on a contract- or\u2019s claim, being a scire facias to enforce claim under the resolution of 3842; and that the witness being apprehensive that an execution upon that judgment would divest the lien of the bonds and mortgage in question here, being informed that Samuel Reynolds claimed an interest in those bonds, went to see Mr. Reynolds\u2019 executors, in order that they might, with him, protect the securities as against this claim; that he was told that they considered the bonds of no account and that they would put no money up to protect them; and that after such action on the part of the executors the witness employed counsel to protect the securities against the claim, and paid the fees and finally paid the claim itself: this for the purpose, first, of establishing the right of the witness to a charge upon the securities for the amount of that expenditure, and secondly, for the purpose of showing an abandonment on the part of plaintiffs of any interest in the securities in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">Objected to, as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">By the court: Objection sustained; exception.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-8\">Counsel for defendant proposes to prove by the witness that in the year 1880, a flood having washed away the tracks, road bed, and appurtenances of the Lawrenceville &amp; Evergreen Railway Co., the same was left in such condition as to be worth considerably less than the amount of the bonds and mortgage in question; and that the witness, for the preservation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>securities expended a large sum of money, to wit, the sum of about |5,500, in restoring the different portions of the road to their places and in rebuilding the road; this for the purpose of showing the amount by way of recoupment against any claim of the plaintiffs in this case; to be followed by evidence in support of this offer that any value the securities in question had, or the road had, at the time of the agreement of April 11, 1881, with Hatry, was' by reason of this expenditure of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">Objected to, as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">By the court: Objection sustained; exception.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Stowe, P.

That if the jury find that in December, 1874, Samuel Reynolds became the owner of the bonds in question, in this case, subject to the claim and interest of Matthew Cridge therein and thereon, and that during his lifetime he did not at any time tender or offer to pay the debt due Cridge, for which they were pledged, or give said Cridge any notice of his interest in said bonds, or assert in any way any interest or claim therein; and that after his death his executors never offered to pay said Cridge said debt, or demanded said bonds; and that 'after the washing away of the railway in 1880 they still made no tender to said Cridge of the debt due to him, theu the jury may presume an abandonment or relinquishment on the part of the plaintiffs and their testator of any interest in the bonds in question, and on that presumption find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-10\">Answer: Refused.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-11\">3.

It appears from all the evidence, and especially that of Judge Magee, that the road was generally considered worthless, and that the amount realized for its stock and property in 1881 was largely, if not entirely, based on the reconstruction, by means of defendant\u2019s advances, after the flood of 1880. It would seem apparent that the value of plaintiffs\u2019 bonds must have been enhanced by the same cause, and plaintiffs should in equity contribute their ratable proportion to the expenditure which produced such result. Whether the costs of defending against the contractor\u2019s claim in the suit of April, 1877, were a proper charge against the bonds is not so clear, as we do not understand the offer in the second assignment to be to show that a sale under a judgment in that suit would in fact divest the lien of the mortgage and bonds, but only that there was ground to apprehend that it would do so. The witness was certainly not competent to prove by parol the object or the legal effect of that suit, but a reasonable apprehension of danger may be sufficient to justify a trustee in incurring expenses to preserve the trust property, though it turn out that the danger was not actual. The validity of the charge for such expenditure must be determined by the circumstances as they appeared at the time, and these the defendant was entitled to show.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The offer in the second assignment was also relevant and competent on the question of the abandonment of plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the bonds. That an executor may abandon property pledged, or subject to assessment, if there is no value over the debt or the assessment to be preserved for the estate, was ruled by Chief Justice Shaw in Ripley v. Sampson, 10 Pick. 373. Such result or intention will not be lighty inferred, but the offer was of testimony tending to support it, and should have been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments are not sustained. Merely leaving a pledge in the hands of the pledgee with no offer to redeem, but also with no demand by the creditor for payment, is not of itself enough to justify submitting the question of abandonment to a jury. Nor is the lapse of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>a bar to the plaintiffs, in the absence of circumstances of equitable estoppel, such as existed in Waterman v. Brown, 31 Pa. 163, and the cases cited from 55 Ill. 468, Adams v. Sturges; and 96 U. S. 611, Hayward v. National Bank. The other assignments do not seem to require particular notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
