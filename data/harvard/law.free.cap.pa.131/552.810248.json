Term 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">On October 27, 1889, Anna May Neely, by her next friend, filed a libel for divorce a vinculo matrimonii. Testimony taken before an examiner having been considered, the court, White, J., filed the following opinion and decree :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">The divorce is asked for on the ground of desertion. The act of assembly says, \u201c wilful and malicious desertion and absence from the habitation of the other without a reasonable cause for two years.\u201d The evidence does not establish such a case. It does not even raise a presumption that his going away with his sister was a \u201c wilful and malicious desertion.\u201d The fair inference from the testimony is that he was taken away by his sister and brothers because he was sick. Nor does it appear that he has wilfully refused to support his family ; rather, that he is sickly and unable to do so. Sickness or inability to support the wife is no ground for divorce. The very meagre and indefinite character of the testimony confirms the view that it was not a \u201c wilful and malicious desertion .....without a reasonable cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">And now, February 27,1889, this cause came on to be heard, and upon consideration thereof decree of divorce is refused and case dismissed at costs of libellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">Thereupon the libellant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred: 1. In finding that the desertion of the libellant by the respondent was not a wilful and malicious desertion. 2., In refusing the libellant a decree of divorce,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-9\"><em>Mr. Henry A. </em>Davis, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-10\">There was no appearance for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-17\"> Where cases are decided on the argument at bar, as were this case and the two immediately preceding it, it is difficult to avoid overlooking them until it is too late to insert them at their proper places.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-11\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">On the argument at Bar,</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
