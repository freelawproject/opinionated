And I wish to here express my earnest desire that Henry Nieman Pruss will grow a sober and industrious man.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>On June 25, 1889, argument having been heard on petition and answer and the will exhibited, the following opinion was filed, Hawkins, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">The court is of opinion that, (1) The pecuniary legacies given to H. N. Pruss and the first-born child of Wilhelmine Nieman are vested and therefore subject to the lien of collateral inheritance tax; and (2) As Mrs. Nieman has the power to appropriate the balance of the estate to her own use during life, the amount, if any, collateral inheritance tax to which the state shall be entitled, cannot be ascertained until the widow\u2019s death. The reasons which have led to this conclusion will be briefly stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">1. The legacies are completely cut off from the rest of the estate; the bequest is direct, and there is no gift, expressed or implied, of an interest in the subject, to any other than these legatees; and certainly Mrs. Nieman can justly claim no residuary or contingent interest. She is given the estate upon express condition that \u201c she \u201d pay these legacies to the \u201c persons named\u201d at a definite \u201ctime.\u201d The direction, so far as she is concerned, is absolute and unqualified; she is given the balance of the estate after the payment of these legacies, and nothing more. The provision in the clause containing these legacies for contingencies \u201c hereafter \u201d is not answered by the fifth clause which follows. That clause gives Mrs. Nieman no additional interest in the estate; it is a general residuary clause, and it makes no reference to the pecuniary legacies. It simply directs a disposition by her of such estate as she should die seised. Suppose she should die before the contingency upon which these legacies are said to depend should happen, could she, in contemplation of law, be said to have died seised or possessed of them ? Surely not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">It was suggested at the argument that in case of doubtful construction the presumption must be in favor of testacy, and that consequently the fifth must be regarded as a general residuary clause. The answer to this is, that the meaning of a testator must be ascertained from the language which he has used, and that the language used here will not justify an inference of an intention to give the widow any interest in these legacies. The whole scope of the clause is limited to a direction how to dispose of the remainder of the estate which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>been previously given her. The word \u201chereafter\u201d does not necessarily mean heremafter, but may refer to a contemplated codiciliary provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The fact that no provision for a gift over upon the contingencies mentioned was made in the will, and that the subject was manifestly in the testator\u2019s mind when the codicil was executed, seem to indicate the latter sense. The purposes of testator had in the meantime undergone a change in respect of a gift over upon contingencies. The habit of sobriety in the legatee which before had been an intended basis of condition subsequent was made simply precatory. The testator must be assumed to have had his whole scheme of disposition in mind when he made his codicil. He attached no condition to these legacies, and there is no apparent reason why we should clog one and not the other. The first legacy to H. N. Pruss was expressly given for his education, and might all be used for that purpose. The legacy to the first-born child of W. Nieman must be sent to Germany, whence no return would likely be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">2. Construing the whole will together, there is no apparent limitation upon the widow\u2019s power to appropriate during life to her own use the estate given her. In the second clause, it is given to her \u201c to have and to hold the same as her own undisputed property; \u201d and in the first clause of the codicil she is expressly given \u201c full power and authority to apply such portion or portions of my (the) said estate, the principal as well as the increase thereof, to hqr own use during life,\u201d and only the estate of which she shall die seised, and necessarily the balance, is given over. There is no limitation upon the use, nothing is said about support or maintenance : Lininger\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 398. There is no measure, therefore, by which the balance can be ascertained as a basis for collateral inheritance tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">And now, to wit, June 25, 1889, this matter came on to be heard upon appeal from the assessment of collateral inheritance tax upon the estate of decedent, and was argued by counsel; and upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed: (1) [That the appeal from the assessment of collateral inheritance tax on legacies to Henry N. Pruss and the first-born child of Wilhelmine Nieman be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>missed.] 1 And (2) that the appeal from the assessment of the residue of estate be sustained, and said assessment is set aside and vacated. The tax on said legacies and tbe costs of this proceeding to be paid by executors out of the residuary estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">Thereupon the petitioners took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">1.

The pecuniary legacies to H. N. Pruss and the first-born child of Wilhelmine Nieman are clearly liable to the collateral inheritance tax. The gift to them is direct; they are collaterals, and no one else has any interest in said legacies. The widow is given the estate upon the express condition that she pay these legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">As to the residue of the estate, it goes to the widow, under the terms of the will. It is true, there is a disposition of the surplus remaining after her death, but there may be no such surplus. The widow is given full power over the estate, and should there be a surplus, the amount of it can only be ascertained after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
