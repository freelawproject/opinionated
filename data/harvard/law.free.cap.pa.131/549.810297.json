T. McGrath against John E. Donnelly to recover an account for goods sold and delivered upon the order of defendant\u2019s wife. Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">At the trial on October 1, 1888, it was made to appear that defendant\u2019s family consisted of himself and wife, and that he had given a notice to the plaintiff not to sell goods to Mrs. Donnelly on his credit. The plaintiff admitted the receipt of the notice, but claimed that it had been revoked. The defendant denied the revocation of the notice, and testified that he and his wife were living together when the goods charged for were furnished, and that he had supplied her with means to pay the household expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">The court, Slagle, J., charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACF\">There are two questions in this case for you to determine. That a notice not to sell on credit was given is not denied. Mr. McGrath admits that on August 9, 1884, Mr. Donnelly told him that he should not furnish goods upon credit to his wife. The first question for you to determine then is, whether that notice was revoked. It is not necessary, in order to enable Mr. McGrath to recover, that there should have been an actual revocation in words; it may be implied from the circumstances surrounding the case. I therefore submit it to you, upon all the testimony, to determine whether or not there was a revocation of that prohibition to supply his wife. The plaintiff testifies, that after this notice was given some difficulty occurred between Mr. Donnelly and his wife; that she came to his house, and that he then saw Donnelly, and told him he had better have his trouble with his wife arranged; that Mr. Donnelly replied \u201c send my wife around and we will make it right; \u201d that he did send her around, and next day she came back and said it was all right, and commenced buying goods. Now the mere fact that she said it was all right would not be ' conclusive. I do not think that it would be competent evidence, to prove tbe fact by her declaration, and therefore you ought to exclude that testimony in considering the matter. But you have the fact that it was right so far as their living together, because it is admitted that from that time on, Mr. and Mrs. Donnelly lived together, and are now living together. You have the fact, excluding her testimony,'that there was a reconciliation.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>[The first question for you to determine, as I have already said is', whether or not, under all circumstances, you believe that the revocation of the notice given by Mr. Donnelly was made. If so, these go\u00f3ds being suitable for their circumstances, ordinary groceries for a family, a wife would have the right to buy them upon credit; and if you find that the notice given to Mr. McGrath was revoked, you ought to find for the plaintiff. If you find that the notice was not revoked, but that it stood, and that Mr. McGrath had a right to understand that he was not allowed to supply necessaries to Mrs. Donnelly, on the credit of her husband, then comes the second question. A man, though he has a right to notify any person with whom his family deals that he must not trust them, can only do so and the notice be effective when he himself supplies the necessaries that they should have; and if he fails to supply them, then some person else may, upon his credit. You will then determine, if you conclude the notice was not revoked, whether or not Mr. Donnelly did supply the necessaries.] 3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">From the bill it appears that the goods were furnished about the time that Mr. McGrath testifies he made the reconciliation between them. The first month, it seems, there were about $20 worth of goods furnished. From that on, until the last of 1886, there were a few groceries furnished each month, some months none at all, but only a dollar or two during each month, which would indicate that Mr. Donnelly was doing what he says he was doing, furnishing money to buy groceries. That is all. But did he furnish all that was necessary? If he did not, then his wife had the right to supply the deficiency. I therefore leave the case for you to determine it on those two questions. In order to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim, you must find the defendant gave notice, that it was not revoked, and that he supplied his wife. Because if he gave her money to get groceries, then she had no right to go elsewhere to buy them, and charge them to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">I am requested by counsel for defendant to instruct you:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">1. That if the jury believe that defendant did not revoke the notice which plaintiff admitted he received, not to furnish any goods to defendant\u2019s wife, plaintiff cannot recover, as there is no sufficient proof that defendant failed and refused to supply his wife with necessaries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Answer: Refused: The question whether the necessary supplied were furnished, is for the jury.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $48.84. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, the defendant took this appeal, assigning for error: 1. The refusal of defendant\u2019s point.1 2.
