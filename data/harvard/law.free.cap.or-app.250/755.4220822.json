Plaintiffs original complaint, filed one day before the two-year limitations period ran, named Davis as defendant. Plaintiffs amended complaint, filed several weeks later, named the personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate and the estate itself as defendants. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint on the ground that it was filed outside the two-year limitations period and did not relate back to the original complaint. On plaintiffs appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">For purposes of this appeal, the facts are not in dispute. On December 10, 2007, the car that plaintiff was driving collided with another vehicle that was driven by Davis. Plaintiff alleges that Davis\u2019s negligence caused the collision and that she suffered injuries as a result. Plaintiff filed her original complaint, naming Davis as defendant, on December 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">As it turns out, Davis had died in September 2008, and his widow, Yvonne Davis, had opened a \u201csmall estate\u201d proceeding about two months later as claiming successor to Davis\u2019s estate. The record of that probate proceeding shows no activity other than its November 2008 initiation and its closure in March 2009. Plaintiffs attorney did not learn of Davis\u2019s death until December 10, 2009, the day after he filed the original complaint. Plaintiffs original complaint and a summons directed to \u201cMilton E. Davis (Deceased) c/o Yvonne P. Davis\u201d were served on Yvonne Davis about three weeks later, as were the complaint and a summons addressed to Yvonne Davis herself, in her capacity as claiming successor of Davis\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In late January 2010, plaintiff petitioned to have Yvonne Davis appointed as the personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate. The petition alleged that plaintiff filed it \u201cto establish a legal entity against which to pursue the claim\u201d in her complaint. The court refused to appoint Yvonne Davis absent her written consent to the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Shortly thereafter, on January 27, 2010, plaintiff filed an amended petition, seeking to have Thomas A. Huntsberger appointed as the personal representative of the estate. Again, plaintiff asserted that she was filing the petition \u201cto establish a legal entity against which to pursue the claim.\u201d The court granted the petition the same day. Also on that same day, plaintiffs attorney mailed a copy of the original complaint to a lawyer whose address had been identified, in the 2008 probate proceeding, as the address at which claims against Davis\u2019s estate should be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The next day, January 28, 2010, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which she identified two defendants: Davis\u2019s estate and Thomas A. Huntsberger, as personal representative of that estate. The amended complaint was served on Huntsberger on January 29. Plaintiffs attorney sent Yvonne Davis a copy of the amended complaint on February 1, 2010. Yvonne Davis was appointed as successor personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate on February 23 \u201cfor the limited purpose of defending\u201d this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Defendant estate filed motions under ORCP 21 seeking dismissal of both the original complaint and the amended complaint. Defendant estate argued that the amended complaint should be dismissed under ORCP 21 A(9) because the applicable limitations period for the negligence claim \u201cexpired before the Amended Complaint changing the named party was filed and the amendment [did] not relate back to the filing date of the Original Complaint.\u201d The estate argued that the original complaint should be dismissed because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over a deceased individual defendant and service of the summons and complaint on his widow was insufficient. The trial court granted the Rule 21 motions and entered a general judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">On appeal, the parties appear to agree on two fundamental points. First, it is undisputed that plaintiff filed her original complaint, which named Davis as defendant, within the two-year limitations period that ordinarily applies to negligence claims. ORS 12.110. Second, it is undisputed that plaintiff filed her amended complaint outside that limitations period. Moreover, plaintiff does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiff could not properly sue Davis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>December 9, 2009 \u2014 the day on which she filed her original complaint \u2014 as he had died about 14 months earlier, but instead needed to sue the personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate under ORS 12.190(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiff does not contend that this case could have proceeded based on her original complaint. Consequently, the only question before us is whether the amended complaint \u2014 which properly named the personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate as defendant\u2014 relates back to the date on which the original complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Plaintiff contends that her amended complaint relates back under ORCP 23 C, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment <em>changing the party </em>against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against the party to be brought in by amendment, such party (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining any defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party brought in by amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">(Emphasis added.) Under the first sentence of that rule, \u201cthe filing of an amended pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading if the claims in both pleadings arise out of the same \u2018conduct, transaction, or occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kowalski v. Hereford L\u2019Oasis, </em>190 Or App 236, 240, 79 P3d 319 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 597 (2004). However, the second sentence of the rule \u201cimposes additional conditions for relation back when the amended pleading \u2018changes\u2019 the party against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240-41; <em>see Harmon v. Fred Meyer, </em>146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Or App 295,298, 933 P2d 361 (1997) (similarly describing the different requirements in the two sentences of ORCP 23 C).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Plaintiff argues that her amended complaint did not \u201cchang[e] the party\u201d against whom she had filed suit and, therefore, the second sentence of ORCP 23 C does not apply. Instead, she contends, her initial naming of Davis as defendant was simply a \u201cmisnomer\u201d that she corrected when she filed the amended complaint identifying Davis\u2019s estate and its personal representative as the defendants. Consequently, plaintiff argues, only the first sentence of ORCP 23 C applies to this case, and her amended complaint relates back to the original complaint because the two pleadings involved the same claim. In short, plaintiff characterizes this case as involving \u201csimply a matter of correctly naming the defendant, and not changing the party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Defendants disagree with plaintiffs assertion that this is a \u201cmisnomer\u201d case. They argue, to the contrary, that plaintiff chose the wrong defendant when she initially sued Davis and that she did \u201cchang[e] the party\u201d when she filed the amended complaint naming Davis\u2019s estate and its personal representative as defendants. Thus, defendants characterize this case as one involving \u201cthe misidentification of a party, not the mere misnaming.\u201d Consequently, defendants argue, the second sentence of ORCP 23 C applies, meaning that the amended complaint could relate back to the original complaint only if the new defendants had notice of the action before the two-year limitation period expired. Defendants conclude that, because neither the estate nor the personal representative had notice of plaintiffs action before the statute of limitations ran on December 10, 2009, the amended complaint did not relate back under ORCP 23 C.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The parties\u2019 disagreement centers on the difference between \u201cmisnomer\u201d cases (to which only the first sentence of ORCP 23 C applies) and \u201cmisidentification\u201d cases (to which the second sentence of that rule also applies). Those types of cases are distinguished based on the type of mistake the plaintiff has made: (1) a mistake in choosing <em>which </em>person or entity to sue \u2014 a \u201cmisidentification\u201d \u2014 or (2) a mistake in naming that person or entity, that is, an error in stating what the defendant is <em>called </em>\u2014 a \u201cmisnomer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Our cases illustrate the difference. \u201cMisidentification\u201d occurs when the plaintiff mistakenly sues a person or entity other than the one whose conduct allegedly harmed the plaintiff. For example, in <em>Smith v. American Legion Post 83, </em>188 Or App 139, 141, 71 P3d 136, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 60 (2003), the plaintiff filed suit against, among others, \u201cAmerican Legion Post 83\u201d and served the registered agent for \u201cAmerican Legion Post 83 SAL\u201d with a summons and complaint. The entity that allegedly had harmed the plaintiff by wrongfully terminating her employment, however, was a different nonprofit corporation: \u201cNorth Eugene-Santa Clara Post 83, The American Legion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, holding that the complaint named \u201can entity that, although related, [was] a separate corporation from the proper defendant\u201d and \u201cthe proper defendant did not receive notice of the complaint until after the statute of limitations had run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cmisidentification\u201d occurs when two separate entities have similar names, and the plaintiff chooses the wrong one to sue. <em>See also Herman v. Valley Ins. Co., </em>145 Or App 124, 129, 928 P2d 985 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 438 (1997) (the plaintiff, who intended to sue her own insurance company, mistakenly sued a different insurance company with a similar name; in those circumstances, the plaintiffs amended complaint \u2014 which identified the correct insurance-company defendant but which was filed after the limitations period expired \u2014 changed the party and, therefore, could relate back only if it met the requirements of the second sentence of ORCP 23 C).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">\u201cMisidentification\u201d cases also arise when plaintiffs incorrectly choose between similarly named individuals when drafting their complaints. In <em>Hamilton v. Moon, </em>130 Or App 403, 405, 882 P2d 1134, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 492 (1994), the plaintiff filed an action \u201cfor injuries sustained in an automobile accident with defendant Joon Moon.\u201d In his original complaint, however, the plaintiff named Kwon Moon \u2014 Joon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Moon\u2019s son \u2014 as the defendant. After the statute of limitations had run, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint identifying Joon Moon as the defendant. We held that the amended complaint did not relate back because it involved a \u201cchange\u201d of the defendant, and new defendant Joon Moon had not received notice of the action within the limitations period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">An incorrect choice of defendant also can occur in other circumstances, as when the plaintiff fails to identify all of the potentially liable defendants. For example, the plaintiff in <em>Krauel v. Dykers Corp., </em>173 Or App 336, 338, 21 P3d 1124 (2001), was injured in a bowling alley and sued \u201cDykers Court [sic], dba Grand Central Bowl,\u201d for negligence. She also alleged in the complaint that defendant Dykers, \u201can Oregon corporation,\u201d operated the bowling alley. <em>Id. </em>After the two-year limitations period ran, the plaintiff amended her complaint to add \u201cCascade Entertainment, L.L.C.,\u201d as an additional defendant. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint against Cascade Entertainment, holding that the amended complaint did not relate back to the earlier complaint because the original complaint stated a claim only against Dykers, and Cascad\u00e9 \u2014 an additional party added in the amended complaint \u2014 did not have notice of the action within the two-year limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In each of the \u201cmisidentification\u201d cases described above, the plaintiff initially chose the wrong defendant to sue or, at least, failed to choose all of the correct defendants. By comparison, we have described \u201cmisnomer\u201d cases as those in which the plaintiff chooses the correct defendant and simply misnames it. <em>See id. </em>at 340. If, considering all the allegations of the original complaint and the summons, an entity could \u201creasonably identify itself * * * as the entity intended to be sued,\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>146 Or App at 300, a \u201cmisnomer\u201d has occurred, and an amended complaint correctly naming the defendant will relate back as long as it relates to the same \u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\u201d ORCP 23 C (first sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">For example, in <em>Harmon, </em>the plaintiff named as a defendant \u201cInterlake, Inc., a Delaware Corporation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>although no such entity operated in Oregon at that time, and the corporation on which plaintiff served his complaint actually was called \u201cThe Interlake Companies, Inc.\u201d 146 Or App at 298. We held that the plaintiffs amended complaint, which corrected the defendant corporation\u2019s name, did not \u201cchange the party\u201d and, therefore, could relate back to the original complaint without meeting the requirements of the second sentence of ORCP 23 C. <em>Id. </em>at 299-300. In so holding, we explained that the defendant corporation \u201cshould reasonably have understood from the allegations of the [original] complaint that it was the entity intended to be sued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. The plaintiff had not chosen the wrong defendant to sue; he had only misnamed that defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Similarly, <em>Mitchell v. The Timbers, </em>163 Or App 312, 319, 987 P2d 1236 (1999), was a \u201cmisnomer\u201d case because, although the original complaint named only a tavern \u2014 The Timbers \u2014 as the defendant, and not the individual who did business as The Timbers, the individual later named as the defendant in an amended complaint \u201cunderstood from the [original] pleadings that he was the entity intended to be sued.\u201d Our decision in <em>Mitchell </em>turned on the facts of that case, including that the original summons stated the individual defendant\u2019s name correctly, the allegations in the complaint identified activity at The Timbers, no other entity or individual did business under a name similar to The Timbers, and there was no actual confusion about the nature or identity of the tavern where the plaintiff suffered his injuries. Again, the plaintiff did not choose incorrectly between multiple possible defendants \u2014 after all, \u201cThe Timbers\u201d did not exist independently from the individual who did business under that assumed business name \u2014 but simply misnamed the defendant that she had intended to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Plaintiff asserts that this is a misnomer case in which amending the complaint was \u201csimply a matter of correctly naming the defendant, and not changing the party.\u201d Defendants argue, to the contrary, that this is a misidentifi-cation case, in which plaintiff brought in a new party when she filed her amended complaint against Davis\u2019s estate and its personal representative. We agree with defendants. Plaintiff did not err in stating the name of the defendant whom she intended to sue; rather, she chose the wrong person to sue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>When plaintiff filed her original complaint against Davis, that individual was not \u2014 and could not be \u2014 liable to her, because he no longer was a living person over whom a court could exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Ramirez v. Lembcke, </em>191 Or App 70, 75, 80 P2d 510 (2003) (where \u201cthe only named defendant [was] a deceased person, the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over him\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 76 (\u201c[A]n action cannot be maintained against a deceased person.\u201d). A personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate was the only person or entity that plaintiff could sue after Davis died. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Moreover, the personal representative of a deceased person\u2019s estate is not merely the decedent by a different name. As a metaphysical matter, the decedent and his estate\u2019s personal representative cannot exist simultaneously; the personal representative cannot assume that legal identity until after the decedent has died. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Manders, </em>127 Or App 147, 150, 872 P2d 420, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 149 (1994) (\u201cA personal representative is a <em>distinct legal entity </em>from the individual who performs that role[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.)) In addition, a personal representative has obligations that may differ from those that the decedent had while alive. For example, an estate\u2019s personal representative has a fiduciary duty to preserve the estate, yet the decedent might lawfully have been entitled to give away the estate property or squander it before his death. Thus, the decedent and the personal representative do not have coextensive legal identities any more than they have coextensive lives. Consequently, when a plaintiff sues a person who has died, rather than the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate, the plaintiff has chosen the wrong person to sue. She has not merely misnamed the correct defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">To summarize: When a plaintiff files a complaint that names a person who already has died as a defendant, and the plaintiff later amends the complaint to name the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate as the defendant, that amendment \u201cchang[es] the party against whom [the] claim is asserted\u201d for purposes of ORCP 23 C. Under those circumstances, the plaintiff has misidentified the defendant, not merely misnamed the defendant. Consequently, the amended complaint will relate back to the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>of the original complaint only if the requirements of both sentences of ORCP 23 C are met, including that the personal representative who was \u201cbrought in by amendment\u201d received adequate notice of the action \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action\u201d against him. ORCP 23 C.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">That holding is fatal to plaintiffs case. By the time plaintiff took steps to have a personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate named so that she could sue that personal representative, the two-year limitations period for negligence already had expired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the personal representative did not have notice of the litigation \u201cwithin the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>of law for commencing the action,\u201d as the second sentence of ORCP 23 C requires. <em>See Harmon, </em>146 Or App at 298 (\u201c[I]f the amendment \u2018changes\u2019 a party, the rule requires that it will relate back only if the \u2018party to be brought in\u2019 has received notice of the action within the statutory limitation period, rather than within the 60-day grace period allowed for service.\u201d (Citation omitted.)); <em>Mitchell v. Harris, </em>123 Or App 424, 428, 859 P2d 1196 (1993) (the reference to \u201cthe period provided by law for commencing the action\u201d in ORCP 23 C \u201cends when the complaint can no longer be timely filed with the clerk, and the time allowed for service of process is of no consequence\u201d). Plaintiffs amended complaint did not, therefore, relate back to the date on which she had filed her original complaint. The trial court correctly granted defendant estate\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> ORS 12.190(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cIf a person against whom an action may be brought dies before the expiration of the time limited for its commencement, an action may be commenced against the personal representative of the person after the expiration of that time, and within one year after the death of the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-5\"> In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff did not attempt to amend the complaint to name the proper defendant. Even if she had, we explained, \u201cthe amendment would not have related back\u201d because \u201cthe proper defendant did not receive notice of the complaint until after the statute of limitations had run.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>188 Or App at 145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-5\"> In advocating for this result, defendants rely on <em>Wheeler v. Williams, </em>136 Or App 1, 900 P2d 1076, <em>rev den, </em>322 Or 362 (1995), which they claim is controlling. Indeed, <em>Wheeler </em>involved facts very similar to those in this case. Like plaintiff here, the <em>Wheeler </em>plaintiff sued a defendant who already had died by the time the complaint was filed. <em>Id. </em>at 3. After the limitations period expired, the plaintiff sought appointment of a personal representative whom she could name as a defendant in an amended complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The probate court declined to appoint a personal representative because, it ruled, any amended complaint naming the personal representative as a defendant would have been untimely and would not have related back to the original complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 5. We agreed with the probate court\u2019s reasoning, holding that any amended complaint naming a personal representative as the defendant could not relate back, because that defendant would not have received notice within the statutory limitations period, as the second sentence of ORCP 23 C requires. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Wheeler </em>is not controlling, however, because the parties\u2019 appellate briefs did not give us reason to decide <em>whether </em>the second sentence of ORCP 23 C applied in that case, which would be true only if it involved \u201cmisidentification\u201d of the correct defendant, not a mere \u201cmisnomer.\u201d Rather, the parties\u2019 briefs appear to have presumed that the second sentence of ORCP 23 C applied, and they addressed only whether the requirements in that section of the rule could have been <em>met </em>had an amended complaint been filed. Accordingly, our opinion did not address whether the case involved a misidentification or a misnomer, but resolved only the parties\u2019 disagreement about whether all of the ORCP 23 C requirements could have been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\"> Because Davis had died more than a year before the expiration of that period, the limitations period was not extended by operation of ORS 12.190(2), which provides: \u201cIf a person against whom an action may be brought dies before the expiration of the time limited for its commencement, an action may be commenced against the personal representative of the person after the expiration of that time, and <em>within one year after the death of the person.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">In addition to arguing that plaintiffs amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint, defendants also argue that the original complaint was untimely because ORS 12.190(2) actually <em>shortened </em>the limitations period in this case, as defendant died more than one year before the normal two-year limitations period for negligence would have expired. Given our agreement with defendants\u2019 relation-back argument, we do not reach their alternative argument about the timeliness of the original complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
