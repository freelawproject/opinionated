ORS 652.310(1) defines \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cany successor to the business of any employer.\u201d BOLI concluded that Blachana was liable for wage claims made by former employees of an entity, NW Sportsbar, Inc., that had previously operated a restaurant and bar at the same site as a restaurant and bar operated by Blachana. Blachana maintains that BOLI\u2019s interpretation of \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d in ORS 652.310(1) is not within the legislature\u2019s intended meaning of the term and that it is not a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar because it is a separate corporate entity with no connection to NW Sportsbar. Alternatively, Blachana contends that, even if BOLI\u2019s statutory interpretation is correct, BOLI erred in its application of the statute to the facts of this case. We ultimately conclude that Blachana is not a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar within the meaning of ORS 652.310(1) and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The property related to this dispute is designed and has long been used to operate a bar and restaurant. Before 2005, the owner of the property, C.P. Underhill, LLC, (Underhill) and its manager, Janet Penner, operated a bar called the \u201cPortsmouth Club\u201d and a restaurant named \u201cMama\u2019s BBQ\u201d at the location.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2005, NW Sportsbar entered into agreements with Underhill and Chris Penner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to lease the property and purchase the business assets, including the inventory and goodwill, of Underhill\u2019s business. NW Sportsbar subsequently operated a bar and restaurant at the location with food, drinks, and live music under the names of \u201cPortsmouth Club\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cAnchor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Grill\u201d \u2014 the latter of which was on the sign outside the building. In early May 2006, after falling behind in its payment obligations to Underhill, NW Sportsbar\u2019s sole shareholder called the Penners and indicated that he was \u201cdone.\u201d Within days, NW Sportsbar surrendered the property and the business to Underhill pursuant to a surrender and release agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, NW Sportsbar surrendered the business and the real property to Underhill \u201cin full satisfaction of NW Sportsbar\u2019s obligations and liabilities arising under the Sale Agreement and Lease.\u201d The bar and restaurant closed. NW Sportsbar\u2019s shareholder left town without paying four employees. Underhill took possession of the property along with the bar and restaurant equipment that remained on the premises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Underhill, however, took no ownership or management interest in NW Sportsbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Approximately one week later, Janet Penner organized and registered Blachana, LLC, as a corporation. The next day, Blachana registered the assumed business name of \u201cPenner\u2019s Portsmouth Club.\u201d Blachana applied for and received a liquor license, lottery license, city business license, and tax and employer identification numbers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In June 2006, a BOLI employee twice called the phone number registered for NW Sportsbar, and Chris Penner answered the phone by identifying the business as the \u201cPortsmouth Club.\u201d Blachana opened \u201cPenner\u2019s Portsmouth Club\u201d in the bar area of the property on June 26, 2006. The restaurant area initially remained closed and was used for storage. In the months that followed, Blachana began offering live music at the bar and replaced all of the kitchen equipment except for the dishwasher station. Blachana continued to use much of the bar equipment that remained after NW Sportsbar surrendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the premises and has also used the same beer vendor. Blachana, however, contracted with a different food vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Blachana did not employ any of NW Sportsbar\u2019s former employees. After almost a year of operation, Blachana registered the assumed business name of \u201cPortsmouth Pizza and Pub\u201d and began cooking and serving pizza.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In the months after NW Sportsbar ceased doing business, its former employees filed wage claims with BOLI to recover unpaid wages. BOLI paid the claims, totaling $7,047.62, from the Wage Security Fund. <em>See </em>ORS 652.409 (establishing fund to pay wage claims if employer is no longer in business and is without sufficient assets to pay the claim). Subsequently, BOLI notified Blachana that it, as a \u201csuccessor\u201d to NW Sportsbar, was responsible for the claims. Following a contested case hearing with an administrative law judge, BOLI\u2019s commissioner issued a final order concluding that Blachana was a \u201c \u2018successor to the business\u2019 of NW [Sportsbar] within the meaning of ORS 652.310(1) and, as an employer, is subject to the provisions of [the wage claim laws].\u201d The commissioner ordered Blachana to reimburse BOLI for the unpaid wages, plus penalties authorized by statute. <em>See </em>ORS 652.414(3) (authorizing a penalty in the amount of 25 percent of the wages paid from the fund). Blachana petitioned for judicial review, challenging BOLI\u2019s determination that it is a \u201csuccessor\u201d to NW Sportsbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">BOLI has statutory authority to recover from an \u201cemployer\u201d the amounts paid from the Wage Security Fund. ORS 652.414(3) (authorizing BOLI\u2019s commissioner to commence an action to recover amounts paid from the fund \u201cfrom the employer, or other persons or property liable for the unpaid wages\u201d). An \u201c[e]mployer\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cany person who in this state, directly or through an agent, engages personal services of one or more employees and includes <em>any successor to the business of any employer, </em>or any lessee or purchaser of any employer\u2019s business property for the continuance of the same business, so far as such employer has not paid employees in full.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">ORS 652.310(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Blachana did not purchase or lease NW Sportsbar\u2019s business property; thus, Blachana\u2019s liability for unpaid wages was premised on whether it was a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar. In answering that question during the administrative proceedings, BOLI analyzed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201c[(1)] the name or identity of the business; [(2)] its location; [(3)] the lapse of time between the previous operation and the new operation; [(4)] whether the same or substantially the same work force [was] employed; [(5)] whether the same product is manufactured or the same service is offered; and [(6)] whether the same machinery, equipment, or methods of production are used.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">BOLI concluded that Blachana was a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar because it operated under a similar business name, used the same beer vendor, occupied the same physical space, used much of the same equipment to offer the same type of service (i.e., food, drinks, and live music in a club atmosphere), and opened for business only 47 days after NW Sportsbar ceased doing business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, BOLI concluded that Blachana fit within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in ORS 652.310(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On appeal, Blachana contends that BOLI misinterpreted ORS 652.310(1) when it concluded that Blachana was a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar. When an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is at issue, as it is here, our review depends on the nature of the statutory term. <em>See Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 223, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>621 P2d 547 (1980) (identifying \u201cexact,\u201d \u201cinexact,\u201d and \u201cdelegative\u201d statutory terms and the proper method of analyzing each). The parties implicitly assume, and we agree, that the relevant wording of ORS 652.310(1), \u201cany successor to the business,\u201d is an \u201cinexact term.\u201d Inexact terms express a complete legislative policy but have a \u201cless precise\u201d meaning that initially requires agency interpretation. <em>J. R. Simplot Co. v. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>340 Or 188, 197, 131 P3d 162 (2006); <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp. v. Real Estate Agency, </em>331 Or 348, 354, 15 P3d 29 (2000). An agency \u201cmay express their interpretation of the laws they are charged with administering either by adjudication or by rulemaking, or both.\u201d <em>Trebesch v. Employment Division, </em>300 Or 264, 273, 710 P2d 136 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">We \u201creview[ ] the agency\u2019s actions pursuant to [inexact terms] as a matter of law to determine whether the <em>agency\u2019s </em>action effectuated the legislative policy\u2019 in the statute. <em>J. R. Simplot Co., </em>340 Or at 197. To do so, we determine the legislature\u2019s intended meaning of the relevant statutory text, <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354, by examining the text and context of the statute, including any relevant legislative history, and, if ambiguity remains after that examination, resorting to applicable statutory construction canons. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u2018When applying [inexact terms] to specific facts, whether by order or by rule, the task of the agency, and ultimately of the court, is to determine whether the legislature intended the compass of the words to include those facts.\u201d <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 224. Our task in this case, therefore, is to determine what the legislature intended in ORS 652.310(1) and whether the agency\u2019s action in this case \u2014 its determination that Blachana was a successor under the factors noted earlier \u2014 is consistent with that intended meaning. <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">On appeal, Blachana argues that the legislature intended to limit the meaning of \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d to the common-law principles of successor liability in corporate law. Blachana points to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d in corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>law that \u201cwhere one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.\u201d Blachana notes that there are four recognized exceptions to that general rule. The \u201csuccessor\u201d corporation can be liable if (1) the new company agreed to assume the debt or liability, (2) the new company is a mere continuation of the old business, (3) the transaction was a <em>de facto </em>merger or consolidation, or (4) the transfer of assets to the new company was fraudulent. <em>See Erickson v. Grande Ronde Lbr. Co., </em>162 Or 556, 568, 92 P2d 170, <em>modified, </em>94 P2d 139 (1939). Accordingly, Blachana contends that BOLI exceeded its statutory authority by imper-missibly imposing liability on a corporate entity that bears no connection to NW Sportsbar and does not fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We begin our inquiry with the relevant text. In examining statutory text, we give words of common usage their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning unless the text or context indicates that another meaning was intended. <em>Edwards v. Riverdale School District, </em>220 Or App 509, 513-14, 188 P3d 317 (2008). We give words that have well-defined legal meanings those meanings. <em>Bergerson v. Salem-Keizer School District, </em>341 Or 401, 413, 144 P3d 918 (2006). None of the relevant terms in this case is defined in the statute, so we first look to definitions from dictionaries in use at the time that the statute was enacted to provide possible meanings. <em>See State v. Perry, </em>336 Or 49, 53, 77 P3d 313 (2003). When the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d was enacted by the legislature in 1931, \u201csuccessor\u201d was defined by the dictionary at that time as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201c[o]ne that succeeds or follows; one who takes the place which another has left, and sustains the like part or character; one who takes the place of another by succession[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2073 (1910). As a legal term at that time, \u201csuccessor\u201d was defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201c[o]ne who succeeds to the rights or the place of another; particularly, the person or persons who constitute a corporation after the death or removal of those who preceded them as corporators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1674 (3d ed 1933). ORS 652.310(1) requires that a successor must be to <em>the </em>business of any employer. If successor is given its ordinary meaning, and in light of the use of the definite article \u201cthe,\u201d an employer includes one that succeeds, follows, or replaces the predecessor in <em>the </em>business of that employer. Even if \u201csuccessor\u201d is given its legal definition, the possible meaning is similar: one that succeeds to the rights or place of the predecessor in the business. Both definitions imply that a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d substitutes in the place of the predecessor in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Those definitions, however, do not plainly resolve what it means to substitute in the place of the predecessor in the predecessor\u2019s business. On one hand, the legislature could have intended that a successor is only a party that succeeds, by some operation of law, to the legal rights and obligations of the predecessor. In that sense, the text at issue in this case would only encompass circumstances where a party could be held liable for the predecessor\u2019s liabilities as a function of the law outside ORS chapter 652, such as contract, agency, common-law successor liability, or other statutory law. On the other hand, the legislature could have intended a broader meaning that would also encompass a successor that serves as a \u201cfunctional\u201d substitute for the predecessor in the business. In other words, a successor may include both a \u201clegal substitute\u201d for the predecessor as well as a party that replaces a predecessor in the business in a functional sense but does not necessarily assume the predecessor\u2019s rights and liabilities as a matter of any law other than ORS 652.310(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The context of the statute supports the conclusion that the legislature intended \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d to include only those parties that are \u201clegal substitutes\u201d for the predecessor. For context, we examine additional text in ORS 652.310(1) that informs legislative intent. As noted, an \u201c[e]mployer\u201d under ORS 652.310(1) includes \u201cany successor to the business of any employer, <em>or </em>any lessee or purchaser of any employer\u2019s business property for the continuance of the same business.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature\u2019s use of \u201cor\u201d may indicate that the phrases are intended to be disjunctive and distinctive. An interpretation of the statute that would give distinctive meaning to both clauses would be that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the legislature intended to impose liability in the first clause on a party that succeeds to the rights and liabilities of the predecessor as a matter of law and, in the second clause, defined an additional circumstance \u2014 when a party purchases or leases the employer\u2019s business property to continue the same business \u2014 in which a party that would not be liable as a \u201clegal successor\u201d could still be culpable for a wage claim. That reading of the text gives distinct meaning to both of those clauses in the statute. <em>State v. Mayorga, </em>186 Or App 175, 180, 62 P3d 818 (2003) (statute should be interpreted, when possible, to give effect to all provisions). If we ascribe an intended meaning of \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d in the first clause to include \u201cfunctional successors,\u201d the text in the second clause would then be duplicative in that a party that purchases business property to continue the same business is necessarily a functional replacement of the predecessor in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The common-law context in which the legislature enacted the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d now found in ORS 652.310(1) also informs the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See Tyree Oil, Inc. v. BOLI, </em>168 Or App 278, 282, 7 P3d 571 (2000) (noting that the common law \u201csometimes is helpful in providing a backdrop against which the statute was enacted\u201d). At the time that the legislature defined \u201cemployer\u201d in the wage claim laws, the common-law rule cited by Blachana was in effect \u2014 that is, that the transfer or sale of assets between corporate entities does not automatically make the transferee liable for the transferor\u2019s debts and liabilities. <em>See Erickson, </em>162 Or at 568. That common-law rule is based on the legislative policy that corporations are distinct corporate entities with a separate legal existence. <em>See Dahlke v. Cascade Acoustics, Inc., </em>216 Or App 27, 37, 171 P3d 992 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 401 (2008). It follows, therefore, that the legislature understood \u201csuccessor\u201d to carry a technical meaning that reflected the policy that legal obligations in business are not transferred to separate entities absent some operation of the law. That policy, when considered with the legislature\u2019s use of \u201csuccessor to the business,\u201d indicates that the legislature intended the definition of \u201csuccessor\u201d to be limited to a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that has succeeded by law to the legal rights and obligations of the predecessor in that business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In sum, the underlying context of ORS 652.310(1) indicates that the legislature intended that the employer that received the benefit of the wage claimant\u2019s services should be held liable for the obligation it incurred. By including \u201csuccessor\u201d in the statutory definition of employer, the legislature recognized that any party that, as a matter of law, assumed or had conferred upon it, the legal rights and obligations of the predecessor should also be held culpable for any wage claims. That understanding of legislative intent is consistent with the statutory text and the common-law context in which the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We next evaluate whether Blachana was a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar in light of the intended meaning of ORS 652.310(1). Nothing in the record establishes that Blachana succeeded to the rights and obligations of NW Sportsbar as a matter of law. Blachana and NW Sportsbar were separate corporate entities and there was no contractual relationship between them. Blachana had no financial or ownership interest in NW Sportsbar. NW Sportsbar surrendered some, but not all, of the assets of the Portsmouth Club and Anchor Grill to Underhill, but there is nothing to indicate that any other interest of NW Sportsbar was surrendered. Nothing indicates that Blachana could be considered liable for NW Sportsbar\u2019s debts and liabilities under the common-law successor liability rule, and there does not appear to be any other source of law under which Blachana could be considered to have succeeded to the legal rights and obligations of NW Sportsbar. Accordingly, we conclude that BOLI erred in concluding that Blachana was a \u201csuccessor to the business\u201d of NW Sportsbar under ORS 652.310(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\"> Apparently, the property contains separate spaces for a restaurant and a bar.

BOLI agrees that OAR 839-001-0500(10) tracks the text of ORS 652.310(1). Because Blachana is challenging BOLI\u2019s determination that Blachana was an \u201cemployer\u201d as the term is defined in ORS 652.310(1), we do not address OAR 839-001-0500(10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-13\"> The parties dispute whether the factors applied by BOLI had the status of a rule adopted through agency adjudications.
