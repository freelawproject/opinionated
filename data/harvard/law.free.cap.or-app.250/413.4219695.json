In 2006, before it could reach defendants\u2019 pump house, all the water in the pipeline was being diverted to plaintiffs\u2019 property through a valve installed on the pipeline by plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors-in-interest. For that reason, defendants placed a cap on the pipeline, shutting off the water altogether for a period of time. Plaintiffs filed an action and asserted that, pursuant to the terms of an express easement, they were entitled to take water from the pipeline and defendants had acted wrongfully. Defendants responded that the terms of the easement did not permit plaintiffs to obtain water through the valve on the pipeline. Both parties sought damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney fees. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief to defendants and also giving plaintiffs limited injunctive relief. The court did not award monetary damages or attorney fees to either party. Defendants appeal, raising four assignments of error. Plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cross-appeal and raise six assignments of error. On appeal, we reverse and remand in part, and affirm in part. On cross-appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">A. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, supplemented with uncontrov-erted information from the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs and defendants own contiguous properties, both of which were once part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>larger parcel known as Hot Lake Resort. Plaintiffs own the northwesterly portion of the original parcel, while defendants\u2019 property is located to the south and east of plaintiffs\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In 1968, while the entire parcel was still under single ownership, water rights for the land were approved. Springs 1 and 2, to which those water rights relate, are located on defendants\u2019 property. Water from those springs runs into a collection box at the base of the springs, which, in turn, feeds springwater into a six-inch pipeline that runs toward the east from the springs on defendants\u2019 property over a section of plaintiffs\u2019 property (the recreational vehicle (RV) park property) and ends up at a pump house on defendants\u2019 property. The pipeline has been in that location since at least 1973 (when plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 properties were still part of the larger Hot Lake Resort parcels) and has been used to transport water to the pump house since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In 1988, the RV park property was separated from the rest of the original parcel and conveyed. At that time, a series of easements, including a freshwater easement (the 1988 easement) were executed in favor of the purchaser of the RV park property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1988 easement grants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201can easement and use for a fresh water pipe running from the pump station in Lot 6 generally westerly to the RV building in lot 4; said line will run along the meander of the Old Immigrant Road, also known as the Meander Line of Tule Lake; as built.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Later, in 1995, in light of foreclosure litigation relating to the RV park property that had the potential to extinguish the 1988 easement, an agreement reaffirming the 1988 easement was executed. In the 1995 agreement, each of the parties \u201creaffirms the Easements * * * and consent to the continued existence of the Easements * * * for the use and benefit of the R.V. Park and the successors and assigns of the current owner of that property.\u201d Pursuant to the 1995 agreement, \u201cthe Easements * * * shall run with the land.\u201d The 1995 agreement further provides that \u201c[s]hould any legal proceeding, including arbitration, be necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred including any costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Defendants purchased their property in 2002. Plaintiffs purchased the RV park property in late 2004. As noted, since at least 1973, water from springs 1 and 2 flowed easterly through the pipeline to the pump house on defendants\u2019 property. In 2004, plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in interest installed a valve into the pipeline at a point where the pipeline crosses the RV park property. The valve served to divert springwater to the RV park property before the water reached defendants\u2019 pump house. Eventually, all of the collected springwater was diverted through the valve in the pipeline before it reached defendants\u2019 pump house. Accordingly, in 2006, defendants capped the pipeline at the collection box and, thereby, prevented all flow of water into the pipeline. Defendants left the cap on the pipeline for between 11 and 13 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In response, plaintiffs commenced this action. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs sought, among other things, damages for breach of the 1988 easement, as preserved in the 1995 agreement, along with attorney fees pursuant to the attorney fee provision of the 1995 agreement, damages for interference with water rights, and an injunction preventing defendants from interfering with the flow of water from springs 1 and 2 through the pipeline. Plaintiffs asserted that, \u201c[p]ursuant to the terms and conditions of easements and agreements for freshwater lines granted by the parties\u2019 predecessors in interest, [they have] an easement for running water lines to [the RV park] property from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Springs 1 and 2.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was their position that, by capping the pipeline at the collection box, defendants had interfered with their easement and water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Defendants asserted a number of counterclaims. In their first counterclaim, they sought attorney fees pursuant to ORS 20.105, asserting plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous. They also sought declaratory relief pursuant to ORS 28.020. Specifically, as pertinent here, defendants asked the court to declare that (1) plaintiffs \u201chave no right to place a valve on the 1973 pipe at any location between the spring collection box for Springs 1 and 2 and defendants\u2019 property,\u201d (2) plaintiffs may obtain their irrigation water \u201cby a waterline from defendants\u2019 property pursuant to the recorded easements,\u201d and (3) defendants \u201chave an implied easement for delivery of water through the 1973 pipe over those portions of plaintiffs property that the pipe crosses.\u201d Defendants also sought damages from plaintiffs, an injunction to prevent plaintiffs from further interfering with delivery of water through the 1973 pipeline, and attorney fees pursuant to the terms of the 1995 agreement. In their fourth counterclaim, defendants also requested a declaration regarding several of the easement documents executed in 1988. Specifically, defendant asked for a declaration that an easement executed on June 3,1988, did not encumber their property, the only easement that \u201ccould have affected\u201d their property was a document dated June 28, 1988, and plaintiffs could only \u201cobtain water for delivery to their property pursuant to the terms of the June 28,1988 and 1995 agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">B. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">After a bench trial, the court concluded that, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the 1988 easement and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>1995 agreement are not ambiguous and do not grant any express or implied \u201ceasement that would apply to Defendants\u2019 springs 1 and 2. The language in the 1988 and 1995 agreements are straightforward \u2014 the easement only runs from the pump house westerly to the RV Park.\u201d Thus, in order to use water from springs 1 and 2, plaintiffs would have to make arrangements for the physical transport of water from the pump house to the RV park property. Because plaintiffs had not made such arrangements, the court concluded that defendants had not interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 easement or water rights by capping the pipeline. With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief, however, the court concluded that, although plaintiffs \u201cdo not own an easement onto Defendants\u2019 property to reach springs 1 and 2,\u201d they were entitled to injunctive relief \u201cthat will legally prevent Defendants from shutting down springs 1 or 2 or from damaging or dismantling such springs or from doing any act that would disrupt the flow of water from springs 1 and 2 to Lot 6 or Defendants\u2019 property at or near the pump house.\u201d However, an injunction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u201cwill only exist if and when Plaintiffs are able to expressly use their easement from Defendants\u2019 property at Lot 6 at the pump house and are able to actually transfer the water westerly to the RV Park. This will require Plaintiffs to either construct a pipeline west to the RV property from Lot 6 (pump house) or otherwise be legally able to transport such water onto the RV property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Thus, the judgment granted injunctive relief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cAt such time as plaintiffs install the necessary piping to allow water to flow from the pump house on defendants\u2019 property to plaintiffs\u2019 property or are otherwise legally able to transport such water to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, defendants shall not interfere with the flow of said water to plaintiffs\u2019 property and are specifically enjoined from such interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The court dismissed all of plaintiffs\u2019 other claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">With respect to defendants\u2019 counterclaims, the court held that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not \u2022without an objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>reasonable basis and, accordingly, were not frivolous pursuant to ORS 20.105. As to defendants\u2019 request for declaratory relief, in light of its interpretation of the 1988 easement and the 1995 agreement, the court declared that plaintiffs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">\u201chave no right to place a valve on the 1973 pipe between the spring collection box for spring 1 and 2 and the pump house located on defendants\u2019 property. Plaintiffs neither have nor have ever had the legal right to cap the 1973 pipeline across the plaintiffs\u2019 RV property. The existing valve on the 1973 pipeline on the RV property must be removed on or before May 22, 2009. Plaintiffs shall be further enjoined from interfering with the flow of water in such pipe to Defendants\u2019 property, except as may apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 easement located on lot 6 at or near the pump house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">With respect to defendants\u2019 request for an implied easement for the 1973 pipeline, the court concluded that it was \u201cclear that Defendants make use of water at the pump house\u201d and that such \u201cuse has been made since the \u20181973 pipeline\u2019 from springs 1 and 2 was constructed.\u201d The pipeline \u201cclearly benefits Defendants\u2019 property near the pump house\u201d and was \u201ccreated and used by Defendants and their predecessors well before either the 1988 or 1995 agreements.\u201d According to the court, \u201c[p]laintiffs were clearly on notice when they purchased the RV property (anytime after 1973) that there was a pipeline on the property carrying water from springs 1 and 2 to Defendants\u2019 property at the pump house.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, \u201c[w]hen the 1988 and 1995 agreements were drafted, * * * there was an implied intent that Defendants would have a continued right to transport water across Plaintiffs\u2019 RV property to the pump house[.]\u201d Accordingly, the court declared that defendants \u201chave an implied easement across plaintiffs\u2019 property for use and delivery of water through the 1973 6\" pipe from springs 1 &amp; 2.\u201d Finally, the court declared that plaintiffs\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cright to use water from springs 1 and 2 only exists as a right to exercise Plaintiffs\u2019 easement in lot 6 at or near the pump house. Plaintiffs\u2019 express easement grants them an easement only from the pump house area of Defendants\u2019 lot 6 westerly to the Plaintiffs\u2019 RV Park.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The court denied defendants\u2019 fourth counterclaim for declaratory relief and dismissed their remaining claims. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the judgment designates defendants as \u201cthe prevailing party in these proceedings,\u201d the court did not award any attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">C. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">As noted, defendants raise four assignments of error, and plaintiffs raise six assignments of error on cross-appeal. On appeal, in their first two assignments of error, defendants contend that, in light of the attorney fee provision of the 1995 agreement, the trial court erred in failing to award them attorney fees. They also assert, in their third assignment of error, that \u201cthe trial court erred in granting Plaintiffs a contingent, future injunction because it goes beyond the scope of Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief and the injunction does not relate to an actual * * * controversy between the parties.\u201d Finally, in a fourth assignment of error, defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying the request for declaratory relief in their fourth counterclaim (in which they sought a declaration that a recorded easement dated June 3, 1988, did not encumber their property and that an easement dated June 28, 1988, was the only easement that could encumber their property).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On cross-appeal, plaintiffs assert in assignments of error one through four that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the 1988 easement and the 1995 agreement in a number of ways. In their fifth and sixth assignments of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in granting defendants an implied easement because it did not apply the clear and convincing evidence standard in doing so, and because it did not take into consideration the factors that are important in determining whether a party has established an implied easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We reject defendants\u2019 fourth assignment of error without discussion. In addition, we note that the trial court properly interpreted the unambiguous language of the 1988 easement. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error one though four without additional discussion. With respect to the parties\u2019 remaining contentions on appeal, we begin by addressing defendants\u2019 assertion that the injunctive relief granted to plaintiffs was improper. We then turn to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions regarding the implied easement and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>finally, to the issue of attorney fees pursuant to the 1995 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">D. <em>Grant of Injunctive Relief Against Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Defendants assert that the trial court \u201cerred in granting an injunction that Plaintiffs had not requested regarding future rights and obligations that were not in dispute.\u201d (Emphasis and boldface omitted.) Specifically, although the court found that defendants had not interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 existing easement or water rights, it nonetheless enjoined defendants from interfering with the flow of water to plaintiffs\u2019 property when and if plaintiffs \u201cinstall the necessary piping to allow water to flow from the pump house on defendants\u2019 property to plaintiffs\u2019 property or are otherwise legally able to transport such water to the plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d According to defendants, there was no basis for the trial court to grant \u201cthis unrequested, future, contingent injunction based upon circumstances that were not before the trial court.\u201d That is so because \u201c[t]here is no immediate or irreparable harm related to future easement rights that are not in dispute.\u201d Plaintiffs respond only that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the 1988 easement and 1995 agreement \u2014 an assertion that we have rejected. They do not otherwise specifically address defendants\u2019 contentions regarding the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u201cAn injunction is an extraordinary remedy, to be granted only on clear and convincing proof of irreparable harm when there is no adequate legal remedy.\u201d <em>Knight v. Nyara, </em>240 Or App 586, 597, 248 P3d 36 (2011) (citing <em>Wilson v. Parent, </em>228 Or 354, 369-70, 365 P2d 72 (1961)). \u201cMoreover, there must be an appreciable threat of continuing harm.\u201d <em>LeVasseur v. Armon, </em>240 Or App 250, 259, 246 P3d 1171 (2010); <em>see Knight, </em>240 Or App at 597. In other words, to qualify for injunctive relief, it must be shown that the conduct to be enjoined is \u201cprobable or threatened.\u201d <em>McCombs et al v. McClelland, </em>223 Or 475, 485, 354 P2d 311 (1960). An injunction may not be granted \u201cmerely to allay the fears and apprehensions of an individual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In light of those standards, the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs the injunctive relief at issue. As the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court found, at the time of trial, defendants had not interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right to obtain fresh water. Pursuant to the 1988 easement and 1995 agreement, plaintiffs had a right to install a \u201cfresh water pipe running from the pump station in Lot 6 generally westerly to\u201d the RV park property. However, as the trial court correctly concluded, plaintiffs did not have the right to take water directly from springs 1 and 2 or to divert it out of the 1973 pipeline before it reached the pump house. Because plaintiffs had not made arrangements to lawfully obtain water from the pump house, defendants did not interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 easement or water rights when they capped the 1973 pipeline in 2006. Again, the trial court granted plaintiffs an injunction to prevent defendants from interfering with the flow of water to the RV park property when and if plaintiffs make arrangements to lawfully transport the water. However, given that defendants had never interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 rights, the facts do not support a conclusion that the conduct enjoined was \u201cprobable or threatened.\u201d In other words, the facts found by the trial court and the evidence in the record do not support a finding that there existed, at the time of trial, an appreciable threat of irreparable harm to plaintiffs if the injunction were not granted. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">E. <em>Implied Easement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">It is plaintiffs\u2019 position that an implied easement for the 1973 pipeline should not have been granted to defendants because there is not clear and convincing evidence of factors identified by the Oregon Supreme Court as \u201cimportant\u201d in determining whether an easement should be implied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>disagree. We conclude that the trial court could properly find by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time the RV park property and the 1988 easement were conveyed, the parties intended that defendants\u2019 predecessors-in-interest would continue to transport water through the 1973 pipeline across plaintiffs\u2019 property to defendants\u2019 pump house. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that defendants have an implied easement to continue that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u201c[A]n easement may be created by implication in favor of either the grantor or grantee\u201d of property. <em>Cheney v. Mueller, </em>259 Or 108, 118, 485 P2d 1218 (1971). Such an easement arises as an inference of the intention of the parties to a conveyance of land based on the circumstances existing at the time of the conveyance, <em>see Fischer v. Walker, </em>246 Or App 589, 598, 266 P3d 178 (2011), and must be established by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Thompson v. Schuh, </em>286 Or 201, 203, 593 P2d 1138 (1979). \u201cAlthough there are many factors to consider, the essential question is whether a reasonable purchaser would [expect] the easement under the circumstances in which he or she purchased the land.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Mueller, </em>144 Or App 330, 341, 927 P2d 612 (1996). Among the factors used to evaluate whether an easement by implication has been created are \u201cthe claimant\u2019s need for the easement, the manner in which the land was used before its conveyance, and the extent to which the manner of prior use was or might have been known to the parties.\u201d <em>Penny v. Burch, </em>149 Or App 15, 19, 941 P2d 1049 (1997); see <em>Fischer, </em>246 Or App at 598; <em>see also Cheney, </em>259 Or at 118-19 (listing factors considered important in determining whether the circumstances surrounding a conveyance of land imply an easement). The factors to be considered \u201care variables rather than absolutes and [n]one can be given a fixed value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Here, with respect to the central issue in an implied easement claim \u2014 the intent of the parties \u2014 the trial court found that in 1988 (as well as 1995) \u201cthere was an implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>intent that Defendants would have a continued right to transport water across Plaintiffs\u2019 RV property to the pump house[.]\u201d As part of its determination that the parties intended an easement for the 1973 pipeline, the court found that the evidence was \u201cclear\u201d that defendants and their predecessors had been using the 1973 pipeline to transport water from springs 1 and 2 to defendants\u2019 pump house since \u201cwell before\u201d 1988. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cmanner in which the land was used prior to its conveyance\u201d is one factor that may be important in implying an easement). Furthermore, it found that plaintiffs (and any purchaser of the RV property after 1973) were \u201cclearly on notice\u201d of the 1973 pipeline on the property. <em>See id. </em>(another important factor is \u201cthe extent to which the manner of prior use was or might have been known to the parties\u201d). Both of those findings are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In addition, there is evidence from which the court could find that an implied easement for the 1973 pipeline would result in reciprocal benefits to both parties. <em>See id. </em>(listing as a factor that may be considered in implying an easement \u201cwhether reciprocal benefits result to the conveyor and the conveyee\u201d). That is, the express terms of the 1988 easement allow plaintiffs (and their predecessors) to obtain water from springs 1 and 2 by running a water line from defendants\u2019 pump house to the RV park property. The water in question reaches the pump house (and thus is made available to the location where plaintiffs\u2019 easement begins) by way of the 1973 pipeline. Thus, based on the terms of the 1988 easement, the court could conclude, by clear and convincing evidence, that an easement by implication would provide a reciprocal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court could properly find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parties to the conveyance intended an easement for the continued use of the 1973 pipeline. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 fifth and sixth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">F. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Finally, we turn to defendants\u2019 contention that the trial court erred in failing to award them reasonable attorney fees. Neither party disputes that the attorney fee clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the 1995 agreement applies to the interpretation of the provisions of the 1988 easement. Indeed, before the trial court, both parties sought fees pursuant to that provision. However, defendants assert that, although the court concluded that they had not interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 water rights or plaintiffs\u2019 rights pursuant to the 1988 easement, and both determinations involved \u201can interpretation of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the terms of the 1988 Easement, as preserved by the 1995 Agreement,\u201d it declined to award fees pursuant to the terms of the 1995 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Plaintiffs respond in two ways. First, they contend that defendants \u201cwould not be the prevailing parties\u201d had the trial court not erred in its interpretation of the terms of the 1988 easement, as preserved by the 1995 agreement, and in determining that defendants have an implied easement for the 1973 pipeline. As discussed above, we have already rejected the premises underlying that contention. In our view, the trial court was correct both in its conclusions regarding the unambiguous terms of the easement and in its declaration regarding defendants\u2019 implied easement. Second, plaintiffs argue that, given the complexity of issues presented and that both parties prevailed in some ways, the court \u201cwas correct in not awarding prevailing party attorney fees\u201d and \u201c[designation of a prevailing party was not appropriate in this case.\u201d We agree with defendants that the trial court erred when it declined to award attorney fees pursuant to the attorney fee clause in the 1995 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We turn first to the terms of the 1995 agreement with respect to attorney fees. The attorney fee clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cShould any legal proceeding, including arbitration, be necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, <em>the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees </em>incurred including any costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the agreement provides for mandatory attorney fees to the prevailing party; it \u201cdoes not vest any discretion in the trial court not to award attorney fees.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Beggs v. Hart, </em>221 Or App 528, 536, 191 P3d 747 (2008) (discussing a substantially similar attorney fee clause that provided: \u201cIf any suit or action [is] filed by any party to enforce this agreement or otherwise with respect to the subject matter of this agreement, <em>the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees </em>incurred in preparation or in prosecution or defense of any such suit or action as fixed by the trial court, and if any appeal is taken from the decision of the trial court, reasonable attorneys fees as fixed by the appellate court.\u201d (Brackets in original; emphasis added.)). Accordingly, the trial court was required to identify the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees, and to award reasonable fees for claims relating to the 1988 easement as preserved by the 1995 agreement. To the extent that the trial court believed it had discretion not to award any fees, in light of the mandatory nature of the attorney fee provision, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Furthermore, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, \u201cit does not necessarily follow that, merely because a party does not obtain all the relief sought, a party is not a prevailing party[.]\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>ORS 20.077(1) (\u201cIn any action or suit in which one or more claims are asserted for which an award of attorney fees is either authorized or required, the prevailing party on each claim shall be determined as provided in this section.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, with respect to each claim that falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>within the terms of the attorney fee provision and for which, therefore, fees are mandatory to the prevailing party, the trial court must determine, on a claim-by-claim basis, which party received a \u201cfavorable judgment\u201d and is, therefore, the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d ORS 20.077(2); <em>see Beggs, </em>221 Or App at 537. The court must then determine and award reasonable attorney fees to the party who prevailed on such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On appeal, reversed and remanded in part, and affirmed in part. Affirmed on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> The plaintiffs in this case are James and Margaret Hollandsworth, a married couple, along with Eagles Five, LLC, a limited liability corporation owned by the Hollands worths. Although the limited liability corporation is the legal owner of plaintiffs\u2019 recreational vehicle park property, for ease of reference, we simply refer to plaintiffs collectively throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> Although the parties assert that, as to the issues relating to equitable claims, our standard of review is <em>de novo, </em>the notices of appeal in this matter were filed after the effective date of the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Those amendments, which apply to cases in which the notice of appeal is filed after June 4, 2009, make <em>de novo </em>review discretionary in equity cases. Although \u201c[u]pon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, [this court], acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record,\u201d ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>19.415(3)(b), we will exercise our discretion to do so \u201conly in exceptional cases,\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(c). Here, neither party has requested that we review <em>de novo </em>and, because this is not an exceptional case where <em>de novo </em>review would be appropriate, we decline to exercise our discretion to conduct such a review. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law and are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by any evidence in the record. <em>Neff v. Sandtrax, Inc., </em>243 Or App 485, 487, 259 P3d 985, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 716 (2011); State <em>v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> A number of freshwater easement agreements, each signed by a different grantor, were executed and recorded in June 1988. However, all of those documents contain the same description of the freshwater easement granted to Hot Lake Recreational Vehicle Resort, Inc., the purchaser of the RV park property at that time. Accordingly, herein, we simply refer to the 1988 easement rather than separately discussing the various 1988 easement agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em> </em>In the alternative, plaintiffs sought an implied easement. They asked the court for a \u201cjudgment decreeing that plaintiffs own an easement appurtenant * ** * for the right to use, operate, and maintain a collection box and the existing water line over and in defendants\u2019 property from the collection box to the current point of entry on plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d As part of that implied easement claim, plaintiffs asked the court to enj oin defendants from \u201crestricting or in any way interfering with the flow of water from Springs 1 and 2 through water lines located across property owned by defendants.\u201d They also sought damages for wrongful use of civil proceedings. The trial court denied all of those claims, and they are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> As noted, plaintiffs specifically assert that the trial court erred because, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the court did not apply the \u201c \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence standard when granting Defendants an implied easement for a water line across Plaintiffs\u2019 property and did not apply \u201cthe <em>Cheney v. Mueller, </em>259 Or 108, 485 P2d 1281 (1971) factors in granting Defendants an implied easement across Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d We construe those assignments of error to assert that the trial court erred in ruling that defendants have an easement by implication across plaintiffs\u2019 property. See Marc <em>Nelson Oil Products, Inc. v. Grim Logging Co., </em>199 Or App 73,75 n 1, 110 P3d 120, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>200 Or App 239, 115 P3d 935 (2005) (\u201cAssignments of error * * * are to be directed against rulings by the trial court, not against components of the trial court\u2019s reasoning or analysis that underlie that ruling.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> To the extent that plaintiffs assert that the trial court was required to explicitly address each of the factors discussed in <em>Cheney, </em>we observe that there is no legal obligation on the court to make explicit findings or otherwise set forth and discuss each factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-5\"> ORS 20.077 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201c(1) In any action or suit in which one or more claims are asserted for which an award of attorney fees is either authorized or required, the prevailing party on each claim shall be determined as provided in this section.
