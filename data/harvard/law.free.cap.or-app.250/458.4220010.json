The board based that award largely on a medical arbiter\u2019s determination that claimant had suffered lost range of motion due partly to his compensable condition and due partly to a noncompensable degenerative disease and claimant\u2019s long history of smoking. Claimant\u2019s challenges to the board\u2019s order include a contention that the board erred by apportioning claimant\u2019s disability between the compensable condition and his noncompensable condition, with the result that claimant received only a five percent PPD award instead of the 14 percent award that he would have received had the range-of-motion loss been attributable entirely to his com-pensable condition. In particular, claimant argues that OAR 436-035-0013 (2009), under which claimant\u2019s disability award was apportioned, \u201cexceeds the statutory authority granted to the director in developing rules for the evaluation of impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review for errors of law and substantial evidence, ORS 183.482(8), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We summarize the facts from the board\u2019s order and the record. Claimant compensably injured his low back while at work in April 2008, and SAIF accepted a lumbar strain. Claimant was taken off work after his injury and, over the next several months, received an extensive course of chiropractic care before being referred to Dr. Jeffrey Gerry. After examining claimant in late 2008, Gerry opined that claimant had \u201csome symptoms suggestive of lumbar radiculopathy\u201d and referred claimant to undergo a lumbar MRI. However, Gerry also authorized claimant \u201cto try to go back to regular work.\u201d SAIF later provided Gerry with a description of claimant\u2019s regular job duties \u2014 which included lifting and carrying up to 80-pound loads on a daily basis \u2014 and a questionnaire asking whether claimant could return to regular work. Gerry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>completed the questionnaire, indicating that \u201cyes,\u201d claimant could return to his regular work as of December 1, 2008. In February 2009, Gerry declared claimant medically stationary and released him to regular work without restriction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on Gerry\u2019s findings, SAIF issued a notice of closure that did not award PPD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Claimant requested reconsideration and appointment of a medical arbiter, citing a disagreement \u201cwith the impairment findings used to determine and rate permanent disability.\u201d During a July 2009 medical arbiter examination, claimant reported that he had attempted to return to regular work in early March, but his back pain had recurred. Claimant also reported that he had been employed since that March attempt, but not in his regular work. Following his examination of claimant, the arbiter opined that claimant \u201chas some limitation in his ability to use the spinal area. I would classify it as moderate. He cannot lift over 50 pounds and needs to avoid recurrent bending and twisting.\u201d The arbiter also explained that he \u201cwould attribute [claimant\u2019s impairment] findings mainly to the off the job factor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cThis is based on the fact that his MRI demonstrates only mild degenerative changes at Ll-2 and L4-5. He however does smoke and this contributes to an acceleration of the aging process. Based on the evaluation I would rate 33% of the problem secondary to his on-the-job and 67% secondary to his pre-existing mild DJD and long history of smoking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Relying on the arbiter\u2019s impairment findings, the Appellate Review Unit of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) issued an order on reconsideration awarding claimant five percent whole-person impairment and no work disability. The order on reconsideration explained that claimant was not entitled to work disability because he had been released to his at-injury job by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>attending physician, Gerry. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0009(4) (\u201c[o]nly permanent impairment is rated for those workers * * * who have been released * * * to regular work\u201d). The order also concluded that claimant was not entitled to a \u201cchronic condition\u201d award for his back condition because the arbiter had not described \u201csignificant limits on the ability to repetitively use the lumbar spine due to the accepted condition and/or direct medical sequelae.\u201d Finally, the order concluded that, because only the portion of impairment findings that are \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable condition receive a value under OAR 436-035-0013, claimant\u2019s \u201cvalue for loss of range of motion, 13.8%, is apportioned at 33% for an impairment value of 4.55%, which rounds to 5% under OAR 436-035-0011(4).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Claimant requested a hearing, challenging each of those conclusions. Specifically, claimant contended that, although his attending physician had released him to regular work, he was entitled to work disability based on the arbiter\u2019s report, which indicated that he could not do his \u201cregular work\u201d as it had been described to claimant\u2019s attending physician. Claimant also argued that the order on reconsideration erred in finding that claimant was not \u201csignificantly limited in the repetitive use\u201d of his low back, as is required for a chronic condition impairment award under OAR 436-035-0019(1). Finally, claimant argued that OAR 436-035-0013, under which claimant\u2019s disability award was apportioned, \u201cexceeds the statutory authority granted to the director in developing rules for the evaluation of impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The ALJ affirmed the reconsideration order, finding that claimant\u2019s arguments were not consistent with existing case law and controlling statutes and administrative rules. The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order, and on judicial review, claimant renews the arguments that he made below.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We dispose of claimant\u2019s first two arguments in short order. Claimant\u2019s argument that he is entitled to PPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>benefits based on his claimed inability to perform his at-injury job, even though his attending physician released him to regular work, cannot be squared with the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Under ORS 656.214(1)(c), PPD may include \u201conly impairment\u201d or may include \u201cboth impairment and work disability.\u201d <em>Suchi v. SAIF, </em>238 Or App 48, 51, 241 P3d 1174 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 231 (2011). \u201cImpairment\u201d relates to \u201cthe loss of use or function of a body part.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(a). Consistently with that focus on a \u201cbody part,\u201d claimant was awarded impairment benefits based on his lost range of motion in his back. \u2018Work disability,\u201d on the other hand, is defined as \u201cimpairment modified by age, education and adaptability to <em>perform a given job.\u201d </em>ORS 656.214(l)(e) (emphasis added). That emphasis on ability to perform a particular job is reflected in the statutes that govern when an injured worker may be entitled to a work-disability award. Under ORS 656.214(2), work-disability benefits are available only to otherwise-qualified injured workers who have <em>not </em>been released to their regular work \u201cby the attending physician or nurse practitioner.\u201d Accordingly, a worker who <em>has </em>been released to his or her regular work \u201cby the attending physician or nurse practitioner\u201d can be entitled to \u201conly impairment benefits.\u201d ORS 656.726(4)(f)(E); <em>see </em>ORS 656.214(2)(a) (\u201cIf the worker has been released to regular work by the attending physician or nurse practitioner * * *, the award shall be for impairment only.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Here, evidence supports the board\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s attending physician, Gerry, released him to regular work. Consequently, claimant was not entitled to work-disability benefits. ORS 656.214(2)(a); ORS 656.726(4)(f)(E). We reject claimant\u2019s contrary argument, which is based on his assertion that we should not apply \u201cthe statutory subsection\u201d \u2014 apparently referring to ORS 656.726(4)(f)(E) \u2014 \u201cexactly as written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Claimant\u2019s second argument fares no better. He contends that he was entitled to a \u201cchronic condition\u201d impairment award under OAR 436-035-0019(1), which states that a worker \u201cis entitled to a 5% chronic condition impairment value\u201d when, \u201cdue to a chronic and permanent medical condition, the worker is significantly limited in the repetitive use\u201d of certain body parts. Claimant\u2019s argument is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the arbiter\u2019s determination that claimant has \u201csome\u201d \u201cmoderate\u201d \u201climitation in his ability to use the spinal area.\u201d Claimant asserts that the board misinterpreted the words \u201csignificantly limited\u201d when it determined that the arbiter\u2019s findings did not establish that claimant was significantly limited in the use of his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We disagree with a basic premise of claimant\u2019s argument, which is that the board applied an incorrect legal standard. Claimant identifies nothing in the board\u2019s order that suggests it misinterpreted the words \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d Rather, claimant\u2019s argument reduces to a claim that, because the board concluded that he was not \u201csignificantly limited\u201d in using his back, the board <em>must have </em>applied the wrong legal standard. We are not persuaded. The board\u2019s order reflects that the board properly avoided looking for \u201cmagic words\u201d (like \u201csignificant\u201d) in the medical arbiter\u2019s report and, instead, simply determined as a <em>factual </em>matter whether the arbiter\u2019s findings, including its determination that claimant had \u201csome\u201d \u201cmoderate\u201d limitation, established that claimant\u2019s ability to use his back was significantly limited. Substantial evidence supports that determination, which we do not disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Finally, claimant challenges the board\u2019s determination that his PPD award was properly \u201capportioned\u201d based on the arbiter\u2019s determination that only 33 percent of his range-of-motion loss was due to his compensable condition and that the rest was attributable to his noncompensable degenerative disease and his long-term smoking. Claimant\u2019s award was apportioned pursuant to OAR 436-035-0013 (2009), which provides, in part, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cwhere a worker has a superimposed or unrelated condition, only disability due to the compensable condition is rated, provided the compensable condition is medically stationary. Then, apportionment is appropriate. Disability is determined as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201c(1) The physician describes the current total overall findings of impairment. The physician describes the portion of those findings that are due to the compensable condition. Only the portion of those impairment findings that are due to the compensable condition receive a value. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>As explained above, the arbiter found that only 33 percent of claimant\u2019s range-of-motion loss was due to his compensable injury. Consequently, application of the apportionment rule led to claimant receiving only about 33 percent of the PPD benefits he otherwise would have obtained (a five percent award, as opposed to the 14 percent award he would have received if his impairment were due entirely to his compen-sable condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Claimant contends that the DCBS director acted outside the scope of statutory authority by adopting OAR 436-035-0013. <em>See </em>ORS 183.400(4)(b) (court may declare administrative rule invalid if it \u201c[e]xceeds the statutory authority of the agency\u201d). In that regard, claimant first argues that no provision of ORS chapter 656 \u201cauthorizes an apportionment of impairment or work disability.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">ORS 656.726(4)(f) authorizes the director to adopt rules that provide \u201cstandards for the evaluation of disabilities.\u201d That statute also provides that the \u201ccriterion for evaluation of permanent impairment under ORS 656.214 is the loss of use or function of a body part or system <em>due to </em>the com-pensable industrial injury or occupational disease.\u201d ORS 656.726(4)(f)(A) (emphasis added). The cross-referenced statute, ORS 656.214, similarly emphasizes that the \u201cimpairment\u201d on which PPD impairment benefits are based is only that impairment that is \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201c \u2018Impairment\u2019 means the loss of use or function of a body part or system <em>due to </em>the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease determined in accordance with the standards provided under ORS 656.726, expressed as a percentage of the whole person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">ORS 656.214(l)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Thus, both ORS 656.214(l)(a) and ORS 656.726(4)(f)(A) contemplate that PPD impairment benefits will be awarded only for impairment that is \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable condition. OAR 436-035-0013 implements those statutes by describing the way in which overall findings of impairment will be apportioned between \u201cthose [impairment] findings that are due to the compensable condition\u201d and those that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>not. Put another way, the rule sets out the specific method for implementing the legislature\u2019s express intent that workers receive PPD benefits only for impairment \u201cdue to\u201d compen-sable conditions. We reject claimant\u2019s argument that nothing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law authorized the DCBS director to adopt that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Claimant also argues that the board\u2019s order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent. He contends that, in <em>Barrett v. D &amp; H Drywall, </em>300 Or 325, 709 P2d 1083 (1985), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>300 Or 553, 715 P2d 90 (1986) <em>(Barrett </em>7), which discussed a previous version of ORS 656.214, the court interpreted what it means for impairment to be \u201cdue to\u201d a compensable condition in a way that precludes apportionment of disability in the manner that OAR 436-035-0013 specifies. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In <em>Barrett I, </em>the claimant had an underlying asymptomatic arthritic condition in his low back before he suffered the compensable injury, a fall that caused back pain. <em>Barrett I, </em>300 Or at 327. The employer denied any liability for the arthritic condition but accepted responsibility for the com-pensable injury. <em>Id. </em>In considering whether the claimant also was entitled to any benefits for his arthritic condition under ORS 656.214(5) (1985), the Supreme Court held that nothing in that statute precluded the board from considering the worker\u2019s arthritic condition in making its PPD determination. <em>Id. </em>at 330. On reconsideration, the court clarified that the statutory phrase \u201cdue to the compensable injury\u201d encompassed situations in which a compensable injury caused a previously asymptomatic condition to become symptomatic. <em>Barrett v. D &amp; H Drywall, </em>300 Or 553, 555-56, 715 P2d 90 (1986) <em>(Barrett </em>77). In those circumstances, the court explained, the \u201closs of earning capacity is \u2018due to\u2019 the compen-sable injury, and the statute requires an award of compensation therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court emphasized, however, that its \u201cdecision [did] not require any award of compensation\u201d for a disease or resulting disability that existed before the compen-sable injury, if the compensable injury did not worsen or trigger symptoms of the underlying condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Nothing in <em>Barrett I </em>or <em>Barrett II </em>precludes apportionment of impairment findings. To the contrary, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Supreme Court carefully explained in its opinion on reconsideration that an injured worker\u2019s entitlement to disability benefits extends <em>only </em>to benefits for lost earning capacity that is caused by the compensable condition. 330 Or at 555-56. It follows that where a physician determines that an injured worker\u2019s impairment is due partly to a previously undiagnosed noncompensable condition \u2014 and the physician does not find that the noncompensable condition was worsened or rendered symptomatic by the compensable injury\u2014 apportionment is appropriate. OAR 436-035-0013 (2009) is consistent with those principles, it does not conflict with <em>Barrett I </em>or <em>Barrett II, </em>and the DCBS director did not lack statutory authority to adopt that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> Under OAR 436-035-0003(1), the disability rating standards apply to all claims \u201cclosed on or after the effective date of these rules[.]\u201d Claimant\u2019s notice of closure was dated March 3, 2009.

The parties do not contest the accuracy of that total rating for claimant\u2019s loss of spinal range of motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
