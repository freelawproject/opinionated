J.</author>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Employer seeks review of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) order awarding compensation for an injury that claimant suffered when, during a paid break, she slipped and fell in an employer-owned parking lot while walking from her workplace to a credit union to deposit a personal check. This case is before us for the second time. In <em>Legacy Health Systems v. Noble, </em>232 Or App 93, 100, 221 P3d 180 (2009) <em>(Noble I), </em>we held that the injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 claimant\u2019s employment; however, we reversed and remanded for the board to determine whether the injury \u201carose out of\u2019 claimant\u2019s employment. ORS 656.005(7)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On remand, the board concluded that claimant\u2019s injury did arise out of her employment and, thus, that claimant\u2019s injury was compensable. We conclude, on review, that claimant\u2019s injury did not arise out of her employment because neither claimant\u2019s work nor her work environment exposed her to the risk of the injury that she suffered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The material facts are undisputed. Claimant was a patient-care coordinator, who \u201cmanaged the desk and the day-to-day operations in the short-stay unit\u201d at employer\u2019s Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in northwest Portland. On the morning of February 21, 2007, claimant decided to walk from the hospital to her nearby credit union to deposit a personal check during a paid 15-minute break. Claimant\u2019s purpose was purely personal \u2014 she was not going to the credit union for any work-related purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">To that end, claimant, while on her paid break from work, left her desk and walked out the front door of the hospital on NW 22nd Avenue near NW Marshall Street. She then crossed NW 22nd Avenue and continued past the intersection with NW Northrup Street and then, as the most direct route to the credit union (which was located on NW Overton Street), started to cut across a parking lot. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>parking lot was owned and controlled by employer and associated with employer\u2019s Green Gable House, a facility, separate from the hospital, that serves families of cancer clinic patients. Claimant did not work in the Green Gable House; nor did she park her car in that parking lot. As claimant crossed the parking lot, she slipped on a slick surface, fell, and fractured her ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The board, in its original order, which was the object of review in <em>Noble I, </em>determined that claimant\u2019s injuries were compensable. In doing so, the board applied the \u201cparking lot\u201d rule and determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence that claimant was injured on the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Noble </em>1,232 Or App at 96 (internal quotation marks omitted). On judicial review <em>in Noble I, </em>we sustained the board\u2019s determination that, because claimant had been injured in a parking lot over which employer had control, the circumstances fell within the \u201cparking lot\u201d exception to the general principle that injuries sustained while going to or coming from the place of employment are not compensable \u2014 and that, in turn, established that claimant\u2019s injuries had occurred \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100. However, that alone was legally insufficient to establish compensability under the unitary work-connection test, which (as amplified below) requires a claimant to prove not only that the injury occurred in the course of employment, but also that the injury arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>Because we agreed with the employer that the board (and the administrative law judge) had failed to address the conjunctive \u201carising out of\u2019 inquiry, we reversed and remanded for it to do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On remand, the board reiterated its determination of compensability, determining that claimant\u2019s injury had arisen out of her work. The gravamen of the board\u2019s reasoning in that regard was (1) claimant\u2019s \u201cfall was caused by a hazard\u201d (slippery conditions) \u201cassociated with the employer\u2019s premises\u201d (the parking lot); (2) because claimant\u2019s \u201croute\u201d to the credit union \u201cbegan at her desk\u201d and she took \u201cthe most direct route from her workplace to the credit union,\u201d her fall \u201coccurred during normal egress from work\u201d; and (3) employer \u201chad acquiesced\u201d in claimant\u2019s activity during her personal break.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Employer again seeks judicial review, challenging the board\u2019s \u201carising out of\u2019 determination as being erroneous as a matter of law. While deconstructing and disputing the correctness of specific aspects of the board\u2019s <em>analysis </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201cnormal egress\u201d and \u201cacquiescence\u201d \u2014 the overarching theme of employer\u2019s challenge is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">\u201cNot every risk encountered while in the course of employment is an \u2018employment risk.\u2019 Under the specific circumstances of this case, claimant\u2019s injury resulted from a risk originated by her pursuit of a personal errand while in the course of her employment. The fact that it occurred on a parking lot controlled by the employer in connection with a different workplace was merely coincidental. <em>Because it resulted from a \u2018personal risk\u2019 (or at most a \u2018neutral risk\u2019) to which her employment did not expose her, claimant\u2019s injury did not \u2018arise out of employment\u2019 as required to qualify for worker\u2019s compensation benefits\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">(Citations omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Claimant remonstrates that consideration of the personal, non-work-related nature of her errand is subsumed within the \u201cin the course of\u2019 inquiry and has been concluded by the board\u2019s original determination in that regard and by that aspect of <em>Noble I </em>that sustained that determination. Beyond that \u2014 and beyond reiterating facets of the board\u2019s reasoning \u2014 claimant emphasizes that compensability can be based on only a slight showing as to \u201carising out of\u2019 if (as claimant urges is true here) the \u201cin the course of\u2019 component is very strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We agree with employer that the uncontroverted circumstances of claimant\u2019s injury are legally insufficient to support a determination of compensability under the unitary work-connection test. We so conclude because, as we will try to explain, the application of that test, in its sometimes arcane particulars, cannot, and must not, be divorced from its overarching purpose \u2014 and, indeed, the overarching purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. By way of foreshadowing our essential reasoning, to which we will return, we posit the following hypothetical, a variant of which we posed during the oral argument in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cA,\u201d an employee of a business owned by an employer in one part of a city, has a one-hour lunch break, during which A is not subject to employer\u2019s direction and control, and is free to do anything she chooses. One day, A decides to deliver her rent check, during her lunch break, to her property manager who, coincidentally, works at another of the employer\u2019s establishments on the other side of the city. A (who, of course, intends to return to work after her break) drives across the city, on public streets, and parks in the parking lot of the employer\u2019s establishment where the property manager works. As A walks from her car to the front door, she slips on ice and is injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Is A\u2019s injury compensable in workers\u2019 compensation as connected to her work? What meaningful purpose, relating to the fundamental purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, would be served by such a result \u2014 as opposed to consigning/permitting A to pursue an action and remedy in tort? Our hypothetical is, ultimately, materially indistinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We turn to the applicable legal principles. A claimant bears the burden of establishing the compensability of his or her injury \u2014 and, specifically, the requisite connection between the injury and his or her employment. <em>Phil A. Livesley Co. v. Russ, </em>296 Or 25, 29, 672 P2d 337 (1983). \u201cA \u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury * * * arising out of <em>and </em>in the course of employment.\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(a) (emphasis added). That is, both conjunctive statutory elements must be met. In determining whether an injury occurs \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment, we look at the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Robinson v. Nabisco, </em>Inc., 331 Or 178, 186, 11 P3d 1286 (2000). The \u201carising out of\u2019 prong refers to the causal link \u2014 the causal nexus \u2014 between the injury and the employment. <em>Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>323 Or 520, 525-26, 919 P2d 465 (1996). \u201c[A] worker\u2019s injury is deemed to \u2018arise out of employment if the risk of the injury results from the nature of his or her work or when it originates from some risk to which the work environment exposes the worker.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 601, 943 P2d 197 (1997). As noted, both prongs of the \u201cunitary work-connection test\u201d must be met to some degree. <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 531. Nevertheless, the test may be satisfied, even if the factors supporting one prong are weak, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>those supporting the other are strong. <em>Redman Industries, Inc. v. Lang, </em>326 Or 32, 35, 943 P2d 208 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly cautioned that the reading of other decisions is normally of little assistance when this issue is presented and that each case must be decided on its own particular facts.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Green Thumb, Inc., </em>296 Or 79, 81, 672 P2d 344 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so because, as a practical matter, some overlap between the facts and circumstances pertaining to the two prongs may be unavoidable and because the ultimate determination is functional, predicated on practical reference to the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Thus, our decisions \u2014 and, for the most part, decisions of our Supreme Court \u2014 addressing compensability may provide useful points of departure and guidance, but they do not impose methodological straightjackets. <em>See Robinson, </em>331 Or at 185 (\u201c[T]he unitary work-connection test does not supply a mechanical formula for determining whether an injury is compensable.\u201d). Rather, as we explained 35 years ago in <em>Allen v. SAIF, </em>29 Or App 631, 633-34, 564 P2d 1086 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cThe statutory phrase \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment\u2019 must be applied in each case so as to best effectuate the socio-economic purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: the financial protection of the worker and his/her family from poverty due to injury incurred in production, regardless of fault, as an inherent cost of the product to the consumer. 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 2.20. Various concepts have arisen from attempts to rationalize that purpose, e.g., the going and coming rule, special errands, lunch hour cases, dual purpose trips, impedimenta of employment, horseplay, etc. Each is helpful for conceptualization and indexing, but there is no formula for decision. Rather, in each case, every pertinent factor must be considered as a part of the whole. It is the basic purpose of the Act which gives weight to particular facts and direction to the analysis of whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">(Citation omitted.) <em>See also Robinson, </em>331 Or at 185-86 (quoting the above-quoted language with approval); <em>Hayes, </em>325 Or at 597 n 9 (same); <em>Rogers v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 633, 642-43, 616 P2d 485 (1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Consistently with those functional premises, the determination of whether a claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his or her employment depends on an assessment of the nature of the claimant\u2019s work and work environment in conjunction with the risk of harm that resulted in the injury. As we explained in <em>Sandberg v.JC Penney Co. </em>Inc., 243 Or App 342, 347, 260 P3d 495 (2011), \u201cour focus is on whether claimant established a causal connection between her injury and her employment, that is, <em>whether claimant\u2019s injury resulted from a risk connected to either the nature of her work or her work environment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That assessment, in turn, implicates categorization of the risk and, specifically, the classic, albeit stilted, tripartite taxonomy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">\u201cRisks distinctly associated with the employment are universally compensable; risks personal to the claimant are universally noncompensable; and neutral risks are com-pensable if the conditions of employment put claimant in a position to be injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Panpat v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, </em>334 Or 342, 349-50, 49 P3d 773 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The parties have vigorously disputed the proper categorization of the <em>risk </em>\u2014 viz., the slippery conditions in the Green Gable House parking lot that was under employer\u2019s control \u2014 that caused claimant\u2019s injury. Claimant especially invokes <em>Hayes </em>in contending that the injury-producing risk was distinctly associated with her employment, while employer contends that various \u201cpersonal errand\u201d-related decisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> afford superior guidance on the correct understanding of the operative causal risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Even as we are mindful of <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>admonition against case-matching, we begin by \u201cclearing the decks\u201d of <em>Hayes. </em>In <em>Hayes, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the claimant\u2019s injury originated from an employment-related risk. There, the claimant, a retail department manager, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>attacked and stabbed by a stranger as she was returning to her car in the employer\u2019s store parking lot at the end of her shift. 325 Or at 595. The employer had directed her to park on the poorly lit perimeter of the parking lot. <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the injuries arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment, the court emphasized that \u201cher employer required her to park at the fringes of the parking lot in an area that was not well lit\u201d and that those factors \u201cmade claimant vulnerable to an attack and created the risk that such an attack would occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601-02 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, of course, there is absolutely no evidence that employer directed claimant to do anything during her paid break, much less required her to follow a specific route, across the employer-owned parking lot, to the credit union. <em>Hayes </em>is patently distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We return to and reiterate the dispositive principle: The \u201carising out of\u2019 prong is satisfied only if the claimant\u2019s injury is the product of either (1) \u201ca risk connected with the nature of the work\u201d or (2) \u201ca risk to which the work environment exposed claimant.\u201d <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 36; <em>see also Sandberg, </em>243 Or App at 348 (\u201c[T]o arise out of employment, an injury must result from a risk connected with the nature of the work or a risk connected with the work environment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The circumstances here did not meet either of those alternative formulations. Nothing in the <em>\u201cnature </em>of [claimant\u2019s] work\u201d as a patient-care coordinator, whose work activities were confined to the hospital, bore any causal connection to suffering an ankle injury while walking across a slippery parking lot to deposit a personal check.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Nor did claimant\u2019s \u201cwork environment\u201d expose claimant to a risk of the injury that she suffered. To be sure, employer did own and control the premises, the parking lot where claimant was injured. But that alone is insufficient because the Green Gable House parking lot had no (for lack of a better term) \u201cenvironmental\u201d nexus to claimant\u2019s work. <em>See Norpac Foods, Inc. v. Gilmore, </em>318 Or 363, 369, 867 P2d 1373 (1994) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that an injury occurs in a parking lot that is owned and maintained by an employer when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>an employee is going to and coming from the employee\u2019s regular place of employment does not, in and of itself, establish compensability. Claimant\u2019s injury must also \u2018arise out of the employment, <em>i.e., </em>some causal connection must be demonstrated.\u201d). Claimant did not use that lot to park her own car there \u2014 and there is no suggestion in the record that that lot was used by hospital personnel. Thus \u2014 as in our \u201cforeshadowing\u201d hypothetical \u2014 claimant\u2019s employment was causally immaterial to the injury that she suffered. The board, accordingly, erred in concluding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> ORS 656.005(7)(a) provides, in part, \u201cA \u2018compensable injur/ is an accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> Because the relevant facts are undisputed, we review for errors of law.
