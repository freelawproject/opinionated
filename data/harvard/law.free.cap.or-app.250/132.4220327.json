Other interested parties intervened in that validation proceeding, including the City of Eugene. Intervenors argued that EWEB lacked authority to enter into the contract because, under the Eugene Charter, \u201cextension of water service\u201d is subject to control by the Eugene City Council, which has not approved the sale at issue. The trial court entered a judgment validating the contract. Intervenors appeal, renewing the argument that the water sale described in the contract constitutes an \u201cextension of water service\u201d and, accordingly, requires the city council\u2019s approval. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The facts are neither disputed nor extensive. EWEB and the City of Veneta entered into the contract in question in April 2010. The contract requires the City of Veneta to purchase \u201can estimated 150 million gallons per year to serve its customers.\u201d It characterizes the water to be sold as \u201csurplus water\u201d and the sale as \u201cwholesale,\u201d and it specifies that EWEB will not directly provide service to customers in Veneta. The contract identifies a \u201cpoint of delivery\u201d just inside the Eugene city limits; it contemplates that EWEB will construct a transmission line from its existing water system to that point and that the City of Veneta will construct a line from there to its own water system. Section 3.3 of the contract provides, \u201cExcept as allowed by applicable statutes, administrative rules, and land use regulations, Veneta will not sell, allow unmetered water use (except for emergency events) or dispose of any of the Surplus Water purchased under this agreement outside of its Direct Service Territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">EWEB is not required to perform its contractual obligations until it obtains validation of the contract. ORS 33.710(2) provides that a governing body \u201cmay commence a proceeding in the circuit court * * * for the purpose of having a judicial examination and judgment of the court as to the regularity and legality of* * * [t]he authorization of any contract and as to the validity of the contract * * *.\u201d Accordingly, EWEB petitioned for validation of the contract under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>statute. The trial court granted motions to intervene by the City of Eugene and by the LandWatch intervenors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">All intervenors moved for summary judgment, arguing that the proposed sale would violate the Eugene Charter and the Eugene Code. In essence, intervenors argued that both sources of authority provide that the decision to approve the sale of water rests with the city council, not with EWEB. EWEB also moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Eugene Charter grants it full authority over the water utility, subject only to the city council\u2019s control over \u201cextension of water service,\u201d which, according to EWEB, does not include wholesale sales like the one at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The trial court agreed with EWEB. It denied inter-venors\u2019 summary judgment motions, granted EWEB\u2019s, and entered a judgment validating the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On appeal, the parties renew their arguments regarding the extent to which the Eugene Charter reserves to the city council authority over water sales.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 dispute centers on section 44(3) of the charter, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cThe board [EWEB] shall maintain and operate the water utility and the electric utility of the city, subject to control by the council of extension of water service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">EWEB contends that \u201cwater service\u201d refers only to EWEB\u2019s direct provision of water to the ultimate users. Because the contract states that EWEB will sell water wholesale to the City of Veneta, which will in turn distribute the water to end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>users through its own system, EWEB contends that the contract does not call for an \u201cextension of water service\u201d by EWEB and therefore does not require the city council\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In their responses, intervenors frame their arguments slightly differently. The City of Eugene appears to accept EWEB\u2019s assertion that \u201cservice\u201d is limited to service provided by EWEB, but it contends that delivery of water wholesale to another distributor constitutes \u201cwater service.\u201d In its view, the City of Veneta is just another customer to which EWEB would provide water service, albeit at the wholesale level. As we understand the LandWatch interven-ors\u2019 argument, their view is that an \u201cextension of water service\u201d includes any provision of water from EWEB\u2019s water system to new users, regardless of what entity actually distributes the water to the users. The arguments do not differ fundamentally; they both depend on the notion that the term \u201cwater service\u201d is broad enough to encompass the wholesale provision of water to another entity, regardless of what entity distributes that water to end users.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The parties\u2019 arguments turn on the meaning of Eugene Charter section 44(3), which was referred to the voters of Eugene by the city council and adopted in 1976. \u201cA city\u2019s charter is, in effect, the city constitution.\u201d <em>Portland Police Assn v. Civil Service Board, </em>292 Or 433, 440, 639 P2d 619 (1982). We interpret city charter provisions \u201cby the same means as other legislation, including attention to the meaning intended by those who adopted it if that can be ascertained.\u201d <em>DeFazio v. WPPSS, </em>296 Or 550, 569, 679 P2d 1316 (1984). Because the charter provision was adopted by the voters, \u201c[o]ur task is to discern what the voters intended * * *, which we derive by first looking to the text and context of the provision, taking into account any history of the measure that illuminates the voters\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Burke v. DLCD, </em>241 Or App 658, 665, 251 P3d 796, <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 532 (2011) (applying those principles to construction of a statute enacted by legislative referral); <em>see also Stranahan v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>331 Or 38, 56-57, 11 P3d 228 (2000) (applying the same principles to a constitutional amendment enacted by referendum); <em>Ecumenical Ministries v. Oregon State Lottery Comm., </em>318 Or 551, 559 n 7, 871 P2d 106 (1994) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201ccaution is required in ending the analysis before considering the history of an initiated constitutional provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">As noted earlier, section 44(3) of the Eugene Charter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cThe board shall maintain and operate the water utility and the electric utility of the city, subject to control by the council of extension of water service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The provision begins by granting EWEB complete authority to \u201cmaintain and operate the water utility * * * of the city,\u201d but it then carves out a portion of that authority \u2014 control over the extension of water service \u2014 and gives it to the city council. Accordingly, control of wholesale water sales lies with EWEB unless those sales constitute \u201cextension of water service,\u201d a phrase that the charter does not define. The parties do not dispute the meaning of \u201cextension\u201d. \u2014 all agree that it means enlargement or expansion \u2014 rather, their disagreement centers on the meaning of \u201cwater service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Although we often turn to the dictionary when attempting to discern the ordinary meaning of terms in statutes and other laws, the dictionary provides little help in this case, as it includes definitions of \u201cservice\u201d that lend at least some support to both parties\u2019 arguments. As the city contends, delivering water to a particular point, from which it will be taken and distributed by another utility, could be understood to be providing a \u201cservice\u201d \u2014 that is, wholesale \u201cwater service.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2075 (unabridged ed 1976) (defining \u201cservice\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201caction or use that furthers some end or purpose : conduct or performance that assists or benefits someone or something\u201d). \u201cWater service\u201d also can be read more narrowly, as EWEB argues, to mean only provision of water directly to users. <em>See id. </em>(also defining \u201cservice\u201d to mean \u201ca pipe branching from a gas or water main to serve the premises of a user\u201d); <em>cf. id. </em>at 2076 (defining \u201cservice pipe\u201d as \u201ca pipe connecting a main pipe (as a gas or water mail or an electrical conduit) with a building\u201d). Yet another definition of \u201cservice\u201d could be used as support for either party\u2019s view; \u201cthe provision, organization, or apparatus for conducting a public utility or meeting a general demand,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2075, can be understood as referring either to (a) the provision of water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>wholesale, meeting the general demand of the public at an early point in the process, or (b) the provision of water to many individual users, meeting the \u201cgeneral demand\u201d by satisfying individual users\u2019 needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Instead of picking from those dictionary definitions, we find it more helpful to consider, from a practical standpoint, what the voters would have understood the term \u201cwater service\u201d to mean when they voted on the charter in 1976. Viewed from that perspective, we believe that EWEB\u2019s interpretation of \u201cwater service\u201d \u2014 the direct provision of water to end users \u2014 is more plausible. Voters, who for the most part were end consumers of water, would have understood that EWEB was the entity that provided them with \u201cwater service.\u201d To them, the term \u201cwater service\u201d would have connoted the provision of water to the end user. We think it unlikely that voters would have understood the term also to encompass the wholesale transfer of water from one utility or entity to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The city\u2019s interpretation also seems strained when the charter provision\u2019s text is compared to what the city says that text means. The city repeatedly equates the charter phrase \u201cextension of water service\u201d with any \u201csale of water\u201d outside of the City of Eugene. If that is all the phrase meant, section 44(3) could have stated simply that EWEB \u201cshall maintain and operate the water utility * * * subject to control by the council of the sale of water outside the city limits.\u201d But the term \u201cwater service\u201d suggests a more technical, precise meaning than do the words \u201csale of water,\u201d and the city\u2019s interpretation deprives \u201cwater service\u201d of that more technical character. As noted above, we believe that voters who were, themselves, beneficiaries of EWEB\u2019s water service, would not have read \u201cwater service\u201d so broadly that it would include wholesale water sales to other entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We acknowledge, however, that consideration of the charter\u2019s text, standing alone, does not provide a certain answer regarding the meaning of \u201cextension of water service.\u201d Accordingly, we look to the charter provision\u2019s context in an effort to discern the voters\u2019 intent. In construing other voter-enacted laws, Oregon courts have considered as context \u201cany relevant statutory framework in effect at the time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the voters adopted the provision.\u201d <em>Li v. State of Oregon, </em>338 Or 376, 388-89, 110 P3d 91 (2005) (voter-initiated constitutional provision); <em>see Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>351 Or 219, 240, 264 P3d 1265 (2011) (context of referred statute includes \u201cstatutory framework within which the law was enacted\u201d); <em>English v. Multnomah County, </em>229 Or App 15, 32, 209 P3d 831, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>230 Or App 125, 213 P3d 1265 (2009), <em>rev dismissed, </em>348 Or 670 (2010) (context of voter-initiated statute includes other related statutes). Applying that methodology here, we have reviewed the pertinent statutory framework that existed at the time of the charter vote, and we have found one statute that sheds some light on the question of what the voters would have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In 1969, the legislature created three local government boundary commissions, including one with jurisdiction over Lane County. Or Laws 1969, ch 494, \u00a7 4; <em>former </em>ORS 199.425 (1969), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 239, \u00a7 315. The legislature\u2019s stated purpose in creating those commissions was \u201cto provide a method for guiding the creation and growth of cities and special service districts in Oregon\u201d \u2014 including domestic water supply districts \u2014 \u201cto prevent illogical extensions of local government boundaries and to assure adequate quality and quantity of public services * * ORS 199.410(2) (1975). Under ORS 199.464 (1975), the boundary commissions\u2019 functions included approving establishment of new community water supply systems and extensions of water lines by existing systems, including city-owned systems like EWEB\u2019s. In that context, the legislature used the word \u201cservice\u201d in two ways that enforce our preliminary understanding of the term \u201cwater service.\u201d First, the legislature set forth procedures related to the allocation of \u201cservice territory\u201d for community water supply <em>systems </em>\u2014 i.e., the geographic region within which a particular water supply system would provide water to residents and other consumers. ORS 199.464(5)(a), (d) (1975). Second, the legislature included the word \u201cservice\u201d in its definition of \u201cwater line,\u201d which excluded certain water lines going to \u201cpremises of the water user <em>unless the line providefd] for extraterritorial extension of service\u201d </em>ORS 199.464(7) (1975) (emphasis added). That definition used the word \u201cservice\u201d in relation to providing water to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>users, suggesting that \u201cextension of service\u201d would refer to providing water to other users \u2014 that is, new retail customers. Both of those statutory references to \u201cservice\u201d seem to reflect a general understanding that providing \u201cwater service\u201d would mean, at least in this context, providing water to individuals and entities that actually use it. Thus, ORS 199.464 (1975) provides context supporting our view that the voters likely would have understood \u201cextension of water service\u201d to refer to providing water directly to users, not to providing wholesale water to other utilities or municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Admittedly, we have found no additional contextual clues supporting that conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, nothing in the context suggests the voters had the different understanding of \u201cextension of water service\u201d that the City of Eugene advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nor does the charter\u2019s enactment history prompt us to adopt the city\u2019s broad interpretation of \u201cextension of water service.\u201d That history includes a statement in a voters\u2019 guide explaining that, under the charter, the \u201cCity Council will control the extension of water service as an essential tool in land use planning and the control of urban sprawl.\u201d The city argues that interpreting section 44(3) to exclude wholesale water sales from the city council\u2019s control would substantially undermine the council\u2019s ability to achieve those objectives. For example, the city contends, EWEB\u2019s interpretation would allow a developer to build a subdivision just outside Eugene\u2019s urban growth boundary, create a private water supply system, and have the private water company contract with EWEB for wholesale water, thereby circumventing the city council\u2019s ability to control sprawl. We recognize that our adoption of EWEB\u2019s interpretation might leave the city council with a less-effective planning and sprawl-controlling tool than it otherwise would have. But intervenors\u2019 and EWEB\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>interpretations of section 44(3) both are consistent with the objectives stated in the voters\u2019 guide, as both afford the city council <em>some </em>added measure of control over land-use planning and urban sprawl. Intervenors\u2019 interpretation might provide the city with more authority than would EWEB\u2019s, but nothing in the charter\u2019s enactment history tells us whether the voters intended the city to have that greater level of control. Consequently, we do not find the voters\u2019 guide statement particularly illuminating. Nor have we found anything else in the charter\u2019s enactment history that adds weight to either possible interpretation of \u201cextension of water service.\u201d In short, the history does not detract from (or add support to) our conclusion based on the charter\u2019s text, read in context.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">To sum up, we conclude that section 44(3) of the Eugene Charter grants the city council control only over extensions of EWEB\u2019s water service to end users, not over EWEB\u2019s wholesale sale of water to other entities that, themselves, will distribute the water further. It follows that EWEB had authority to enter the contract with the City of Veneta without first obtaining approval from the Eugene City Council. The trial court did not err in validating the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> LandWatch Lane County, Friends of Eugene, and three individuals moved as a group to intervene. The two organizations and one of the individuals have appealed. For convenience, we refer to them collectively as \u201cthe LandWatch intervenors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\"> In their brief, the LandWatch intervenors also argue that the Eugene Code requires city approval of the water sale. The code provision that they rely on provides in part that neither the city nor EWEB shall \u201cprovide water, water service or sewer service outside the city limits except as authorized pursuant to the city charter, this code, and adopted resolutions.\u201d Eugene Code 2.212. Because the city code itself references authorization under the Eugene Charter, the viability of the LandWatch intervenors\u2019 code argument still depends entirely on whether the charter reserves to the city council authority to approve the sale. Accordingly, our decision about the charter also disposes of the argument under the city code, so we do not address that argument separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> EWEB cites as contextual evidence sources indicating that \u201cwater service\u201d is a term of trade usage with a meaning consistent with EWEB\u2019s position. EWEB\u2019s reliance on those sources is problematic for two reasons. First, nothing in the record suggests that the Eugene voters were aware of that trade usage when they enacted the charter. Second, the sources on which EWEB relies may not even have existed in 1976, when the charter vote took place. For example, EWEB cites the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in an industry dictionary published in 2010. <em>See The Water Dictionary </em>544 (2d ed 2010). Because current sources shed little light on what the voters intended in 1976, we do not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> The City of Eugene offers, as \u201cenactment history,\u201d minutes of a city council meeting and a memorandum provided to the council, all reflecting deliberations by the council and negotiations between city and EWEB staff members concerning section 44(3). Nothing in the record indicates that the voters were aware of any of those discussions, so they do not aid our analysis. <em>See Shilo Inn v. Multnomah County, </em>333 Or 101, 129-30, 36 P3d 954 (2001), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>334 Or 11, 45 P3d 107 (2002) (\u201c[T]he history that we consider does not include early drafts of the legislative bill that later was referred to the people, nor does it include statements made by legislators in hearings on that matter. Those materials maybe indicative of the <em>legislature\u2019s </em>intent in crafting [a measure] but * * * \u2018it is the <em>people\u2019s </em>understanding and intended meaning of the provision in question \u2014 as to which the text and context are the most important clue \u2014 that is critical to our analysis.\u2019 It follows that only those materials that were presented to the public at large help to elucidate the public\u2019s understanding of the measure and assist in our interpretation of the disputed provision.\u201d (quoting <em>Stranahan, </em>331 Or at 57) (emphasis in <em>Shilo Inn)).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
