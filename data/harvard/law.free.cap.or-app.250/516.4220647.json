We write only to address her first assignment of error and reject the others without discussion. In her first assignment, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on one of the third-degree assault charges. Defendant contends that there was no evidence on which to base that conviction. Thus, defendant requests that we review the error as one apparent on the record under ORAP 5.45(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state concedes that \u201cthe evidence in this record does not appear to support the conviction at issue\u201d but argues that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that the error was plain and exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We state the relevant facts, which are few, in a light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Burgess, </em>240 Or App 641, 643, 251 P3d 765 (2011). Defendant and Lemarroy stole money and drugs from the victim\u2019s apartment and fled the scene. The victim and his girlfriend, who discovered defendant and Lemarroy in the apartment during the commission of the crime, followed in hot pursuit. When the victim confronted the thieves, a fight broke out. The victim and Lemarroy, who had a knife, wrestled for control of the stolen property. Meanwhile, defendant and the victim\u2019s girlfriend fought nearby. Although the victim suffered multiple knife wounds, at no point during the melee did defendant inflict physical injury on the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Defendant was charged with numerous offenses for her involvement in those events. As relevant here, Count 13 of the indictment alleged that defendant committed third-degree assault against the victim, that is, that she \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly cause physical injury to [the victim] while aided by another person actually present.\u201d The case was tried to a jury. After the state had rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal but advanced no specific argument in support of the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would be making a motion for judgment of acquittal at this time. I\u2019m not making any argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Any nonargument to the non-argument that you want to make on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: No, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I believe, in the light most favorable to the state, there is sufficient evidence to send all counts to the trier of fact, so that will be to the jury. So the motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The jury ultimately convicted defendant of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Defendant now appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on Count 13 because, at most, the evidence showed that she provided on-the-scene aid to another person (Lemarroy) who inflicted physical injury upon the victim. Defendant argues that, under <em>State v. Merida-Medina, </em>221 Or App 614, 191 P3d 708 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009), that evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to prove that she committed third-degree assault. She acknowledges that her argument is unpreserved but contends that the error is plain and that we should exercise our discretion to correct it. The state argues that we should not review defendant\u2019s claim of error in light of the purposes of preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Generally, we will not consider an unpreserved issue on appeal. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Nonetheless, we may review an unpreserved assignment of error as one \u201capparent on the record\u201d under ORAP 5.45(1) if certain conditions are met: (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201capparent,\u201d in that the \u201clegal point is obvious, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record,\u201d such that \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Even where those conditions are satisfied, we must determine whether to exercise our discretion to reach the error and correct it. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law, and we need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to resolve the issue in this case. <em>See, e.g., State v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 243 P3d 862 (2010) (reviewing sufficiency of the evidence argument as plain error). There is no evidence in the record that defendant personally inflicted physical injury on the victim. Thus, the question is whether she can nonetheless be found liable \u2014 either directly or as an accomplice \u2014 for her conduct and, if not, whether that legal point is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 207, 82 P3d 130 (2003), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cthe fact that a defendant provided on-the-scene aid to another person who inflicted physical injury upon a victim does not, in itself, render the defendant [directly] liable for third-degree assault * * *. Rather, such a defendant either must have inflicted physical injury directly himself or herself, or must have engaged in conduct so extensively intertwined with infliction of the injury that such conduct can be found to have produced the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Subsequently, in <em>Merida-Medina, </em>we held that, \u201cin an assault in which the assailant is aided by another person who is actually present,\u201d the aiding person cannot be found guilty of third-degree assault as an accomplice. 221 Or App at 616, 619-20. Those cases were both decided before trial in this case, and the legal points that they establish are not reasonably in dispute. Because defendant could not be held liable as an accomplice for third-degree assault, and because there was no evidence that her conduct was \u201cso extensively intertwined with infliction of the injury\u201d that she could be held directly liable, she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on that third-degree assault charge. <em>Cf. State v. Nefstad, </em>309 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>523, 543, 789 P2d 1326 (1990), <em>cert den, </em>516 US 1081 (1996) (restraining the victim while he was being stabbed constituted \u201cpersonally\u201d committing the homicide); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. K. C. W. R., </em>235 Or App 315, 230 P3d 973 (2010) (youth\u2019s conduct in attacking the victim while a third person struck the victim with a bat was so extensively intertwined with the infliction of the injury that youth could be held directly liable for third-degree assault). Thus, the trial court committed plain error in entering a judgment of conviction on Count 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error. Among the considerations relevant to that determination are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Related considerations may include whether the defendant in some way encouraged the trial court to make the error; whether the defendant made a strategic choice not to object; and whether the error could have been remedied if raised below. <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We have often declined to invoke plain error review where a defendant has failed to move for a judgment of acquittal, <em>Inloes, </em>239 Or App at 54 (so noting), or where such a motion is unspecific as to its theory, <em>State v. Schodrow, </em>187 Or App 224, 231 n 5, 66 P3d 547 (2003) (same). That is because the trial court has not, consistently with the purposes of preservation, been apprised of the issue and given an opportunity to avoid the error by allowing supplemental evidence to be introduced. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (explaining that the policy reasons underlying the rule of preservation are procedural fairness to the opposing parties, development of a full record to facilitate review, and promotion of judicial efficiency). The state contends that the same restraint should be exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>when a defendant moves for, but does not argue in favor of, a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Nonetheless, we conclude that there are sound reasons to correct the error in this case. First, the gravity of the error \u2014 an additional felony conviction based on insufficient evidence \u2014 is substantial. Defendant has a strong interest in having a criminal record that accurately reflects the nature and extent of her conduct. <em>State v. Valladares-Juarez, </em>219 Or App 561, 564, 184 P3d 1131 (2008) (so noting in the context of a failure to merge convictions); <em>see also State v. Ryder, </em>230 Or App 432, 435, 216 P3d 895 (2009) (imposition of additional felony conviction \u201cstrongly militates in favor of the exercise of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Indeed, the error \u2014 entry of a criminal conviction without sufficient proof \u2014 is of constitutional magnitude. As held by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 US 307, 316, 99 S Ct 2781, 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cthe due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment [mandates] that no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof\u2014 defined as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The seriousness of that error, the \u201conus of a criminal conviction,\u201d is not diminished by the fact that defendant will serve no additional time in prison, given that her sentence on the erroneous conviction will run concurrently with other sentences. We drew a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Gibson, </em>183 Or App 25, 51 P3d 619 (2002), where we exercised <em>Ailes </em>discretion to address a plainly erroneous conviction. There, the defendant was convicted on a number of charges after agreeing with the state on guilty pleas to those crimes. The judgment, however, included a conviction on a charge to which the defendant had not pleaded guilty. The defendant did not object to that conviction during his sentencing hearing. We nevertheless reviewed the unpreserved claim of error, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201c[w]e choose to exercise our discretion to review the error, because convicting defendant of a crime to which he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>plead guilty and of which a jury did not find him guilty violated defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>433 US 307, 314, 99 S Ct 2781, 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979) (\u2018It is axiomatic that a conviction upon a charge not made or upon a charge not tried constitutes a denial of due process.\u2019). Although defendant may not gain any benefit in the form of a decrease in his overall term of incarceration and post-prison supervision, we review his first assignment of error in order to protect that constitutional right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">183 Or App at 33; <em>see also State v. Hathaway, </em>207 Or App 716, 717-18, 143 P3d 545, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 254 (2006) (exercising discretion to correct merger error despite state\u2019s argument that the additional convictions had no effect on the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment and noting that, \u201calthough the effects of merger are not always immediately apparent, they can be real and varied\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Second, correcting the error would not, on the whole, undermine the important policies behind the preservation rule, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cprocedural fairness to the parties and the trial court, judicial economy, and full development of the record.\u201d <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340, 211 P3d 262 (2009). \u201cUltimately, the preservation rule is a practical one, and close calls \u2014 like this one \u2014 inevitably will turn on whether, given the particular record of a case, the court concludes that the policies underlying the rule have been sufficiently served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The \u201cparticular record\u201d in this case shows that the insufficiency of evidence could not have been cured by a contemporaneous objection. This is not a case where, if the error had been timely raised, the state could have reopened its case and corrected the deficiency in its proof. The victim testified unequivocally that defendant did not inflict physical injury on him (\u201cShe never assaulted me at all. * * * [My girlfriend] had her pretty much, you know, subdued.\u201d). <em>See State v. Matheson, </em>220 Or App 397, 409, 186 P3d 309 (2008) (correcting plain error as to insufficiency of the evidence where, among other things, the victim\u2019s testimony made it \u201cunlikely that the state would have been able to reopen the record and elicit additional testimony\u201d to remedy the deficiency in proof and concluding that the state was not prejudiced by a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>preservation); <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>188 Or App 255, 258-59, 71 P3d 168, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 146 (2003) (correcting plain error as to insufficiency of the evidence where, among other things, there was \u201cno suggestion that the state could have introduced evidence\u201d that would have remedied the deficiency in proof). Given the lack of any factual dispute on that point, it is unlikely that the record would have developed differently had defendant\u2019s argument been made. The state does not contend otherwise. Thus, consideration of the plainly erroneous conviction in this case would not undermine the policy interest in the \u201cfull development of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Indeed, the irrefutable fact of defendant\u2019s lack of guilt distinguishes this case from the more common scenario of an unpreserved claim as to the sufficiency of the evidence \u2014 situations where the deficiency in proof is happenstance, where not all of the evidence that could be adduced was introduced into the record. That was the case in <em>State v. Hockersmith, </em>181 Or App 554, 47 P3d 61 (2002), where we refused to review a defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of a controlled substance, alleged to be wrongful because drug testing reports had not formally been received into evidence. <em>See also Matheson, </em>220 Or App at 407-08 (state could have reopened record if error were raised by the defendant); <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>187 Or App 720, 726, 69 P3d 830 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 376 (2004) (state could have remedied defect in indictment if error were raised by the defendant). Allowing review in those rare cases where a defendant\u2019s innocence is established \u2014 as opposed to those where guilt is unproved \u2014 -is consistent with the preservation principle that plain error review be exercised only in \u201crare and exceptional cases.\u201d <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 166, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In addition, we cannot fathom any reason why the state would have an interest in upholding the erroneous conviction. Defendant did not encourage the error, and she will not obtain a more advantageous result than if she had raised the error at trial. Thus, correcting the wrongful conviction would not result in unfairness to the adversarial party.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Furthermore, we can conceive of no <em>plausible </em>tactical reason for defendant\u2019s failure to make her argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>below. The dissent contends that defendant may have elected \u201cto pursue a holistic \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 strategy with respect to Count 13,\u201d so as to avoid drawing attention to \u201cthe availability and propriety of a conviction for fourth-degree assault.\u201d 250 Or App at 542 (Haselton, C. J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Simply put, we do not think that that is a plausible strategic choice. The difference between those convictions is not insignificant \u2014 indeed, it is the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor conviction. ORS 163.160(2); ORS 163.165(2)(a). Under that circumstance, a trial counsel\u2019s decision \u2014 if indeed trial counsel consciously makes a decision \u2014 to forgo a motion for judgment of acquittal is not reasonable. Moreover, an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach is as likely in this case as it is in any other where there are multiple charges or where a lesser-included offense exists; that is, under the dissent\u2019s theory, nearly every failure to move for a judgment of acquittal could be deemed a strategic choice. <em>See State v. Martino, </em>245 Or App 594, 597, 263 P3d 1111 (2011) (rejecting state\u2019s \u201cstrategic choice\u201d argument for similar reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Admittedly, the preservation principle of \u201cjudicial efficiency\u201d would not be served by review of defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of error. Had defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the third-degree assault charge, that relief could have been obtained sooner and with less consumption of judicial resources. That inefficiency, however, is present in nearly all cases where review of unpreserved issues are under consideration. That consideration does not distinguish those cases where review should be allowed from those where it should not. We said as much in <em>State v. Morris, </em>217 Or App 271, 274, 174 P3d 1127 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cTo be sure, as the state suggests, if defendant had raised his present objection before the trial court, error might well have been avoided. But that is true in many \u2018plain error\u2019 cases \u2014 indeed, in virtually all such cases except for those in which the claim of error is based on an intervening, post-judgment change in the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Thus, the error in this case is plain and serious, and its correction will not undermine the relevant principles that underlie the preservation rule. For the most part, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>dissent does not quibble with those conclusions. Chief Judge Haselton agrees that the error is plain and grave, so much so that the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion is \u201cpresumptive.\u201d 250 Or App at 537 (Haselton, C. J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Where the dissent parts company is in the next step of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We conclude that the ends of justice in this case militate in favor of correcting the plain error. As the dissent notes, it is likely that defendant would be able to obtain post-conviction relief from the erroneous conviction. However, we conclude, contrary to the dissent, that the availability of post-conviction relief is a reason in support of affirmatively exercising our discretion. As we have noted in the plain error context before,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201c[w]e see no reason, and the state offers none, as to why [the] defendant should be made to jump through more procedural hoops before he can get the relief to which he is entitled. In this case, we are in a position to order the same relief to which [the] defendant would be entitled under a post-conviction proceeding, and we do so in the interests of judicial economy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>State v. Cleveland, </em>148 Or App 97, 100, 939 P2d 94, <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 621 (1997). There is, in short, no reason to deny review where it would result in more unnecessary proceedings and, ultimately, less judicial efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Defendant concedes that the entry of a conviction on the lesser-included offense of fourth-degree assault is appropriate. The burden on the judicial system in amending the judgment and resentencing defendant is minimal. <em>See Ryder, </em>230 Or App at 435 (citing the minimal burden on the judicial system as a reason to correct plain error); <em>see also State v. Donner, </em>230 Or App 465, 469, 215 P3d 928 (2009) (\u201cGiven that our burden in reviewing and correcting the error is minimal and that sentencing defendant according to the law serves the ends of justice, we elect to exercise our discretion to correct the error here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Correction of the plain error on direct review, then, implements our mandate to administer justice \u201ccompletely and without delay\u201d under Article I, section 10, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The normal barriers to the complete administration of justice at the appellate level in the review of unpreserved claims of error \u2014 an incomplete record or procedural advantage or unfairness to either party \u2014 are not present. And postponing correction of an unjust conviction to another day, to the purview of a post-conviction relief or habeas corpus court, is delayed justice. Thus, those constitutionally mandated \u201cends of justice\u201d strongly support the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In sum, the reasons in favor of exercising our discretion to correct the plain error in this case outweigh any considerations militating against our review. <em>See Fults, </em>343 Or at 523 (suggesting that exercise of discretion depends on a \u201cweighing\u201d of \u201cthe relevant factors\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that correction of the error is warranted. <em>See, e.g., Matheson, </em>220 Or App at 409 (exercising discretion to correct plain error as to sufficiency of the evidence where the defendant would not obtain a more advantageous result, it was unlikely that the state could have reopened the record, and the gravity of the error was substantial); <em>State v. Hurst, </em>147 Or App 385, 936 P2d 396 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998) (exercising discretion to correct an error apparent on the record where no evidence supported the conviction); <em>State v.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Az5\">concurring in part, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">For nearly 40 years, beginning with <em>State v. Willy, </em>36 Or App 853, 585 P2d 762 (1978), our court has addressed \u2014 or declined to address and correct \u2014 unpreserved challenges to the sufficiency of evidence supporting criminal convictions. As with all other plain error decisions, our holdings have, ultimately, depended on our resolution of two subsidiary questions: (1) Did the trial court commit plain error by entering a conviction based on legally insufficient evidence, notwithstanding the absence of a motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) or its functional equivalent? And (2) if so, should we exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to correct that error?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Our answers to those questions \u2014 which we have, not infrequently, conflated \u2014 have been diffuse and obtuse. Even allowing for case-specific circumstantial variability, our analysis, viewed collectively, has been inscrutable at best\u2014 and whimsical at worst.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>This case is the most recent of the genre. By that, I imply no criticism of the majority\u2019s analysis, which is considered and thoughtful, though I disagree with some of its particulars and ultimately dissent from the positive exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. Rather, as the latest of this incorrigible genus, this case provides at least some opportunity to try to identify a few coherent and durable principles that may inform our approach going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Toward that end, I write separately. Consistently with the principles posited below, I conclude that (1) in this case, the entry of a judgment of conviction on Count 13 did constitute plain error, but (2) in the totality of the circumstances here, the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion is unwarranted \u2014 and, in fact, constitutes an abuse of that discretion. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s disposition as to Count 13 but concur in the affirmance of defendant\u2019s other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Before turning to putative principles and their application, a quick \u201cdeck-clearing\u201d observation: There was no legally cognizable MJOA here. To be sure, defendant\u2019s counsel uttered the term, but a \u201cmotion for judgment of acquittal\u201d proffered generically and expressly without \u201cany argument,\u201d much less without any differentiation among 14 counts involving multiple victims and distinct criminal conduct, is a nonmotion. It is meaningless and, ultimately, an abdication of counsel\u2019s obligation to identify for the court\u2019s consideration purported deficiencies \u2014 that is, legal insufficiency \u2014 of the state\u2019s proof as to particular elements of particular charges. <em>See, e.g., State v. Paragon, </em>195 Or App 265, 268, 97 P3d 691 (2004) (\u201cA motion for judgment of acquittal does not automatically encompass a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The motion must state the specific theory on which the state\u2019s proof was insufficient.\u201d). For purposes of our present consideration, such a \u201cmotion\u201d preserved nothing \u2014 and is immaterial to the proper exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Thus, given that posture, this case is no different from any other plain error case \u2014 that is, a case in which the appellant seeks to have us correct a trial court\u2019s action (or inaction) notwithstanding the failure to raise that matter, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>any cogent fashion, before the trial court. That is the essential construct of any plain error challenge, including, as here, challenges based on the purported legal insufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to make an MJOA or functional equivalent before the trial court. And, as with any other invocation of plain error review, our analysis and disposition depends on two cumulative inquiries: (1) Did the challenged judicial action or inaction constitute an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), under the classic formulation prescribed in <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355-56, 800 P2d 259 (1990)? And (2) if so, should the court exercise its discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to correct that error?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">A. <em>\u201cPlain error\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">So much for abstract methodology. The devil is in the details, jurisprudential and prudential. And the first of those bedeviling details with respect to unpreserved challenges to the sufficiency of evidence supporting criminal convictions pertains to the first, \u201cWas it plain error?\u201d question \u2014 and, specifically, to the proper characterization of the purported error.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Frequently, the asserted error is cast as \u201cthe trial court erred in failing <em>sua sponte </em>to enter a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Hockersmith, </em>181 Or App 554, 556, 47 P3d 61 (2002); <em>see also State v. Ford, </em>245 Or App 500, 501, 263 P3d 1110 (2011) (the defendant asserted that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal * * * <em>sua sponte\u201d)', Willy, </em>36 Or App at 856 (addressing assignment of error relating to \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to give a verdict for defendant, <em>sua sponte\u201d). </em>That is, the \u201cerror\u201d addressed in some of our cases has been cast in terms of the trial court <em>failing to grant </em>relief that was never requested. In other cases, criminal defendant appellants have, apparently, phrased their challenges more broadly (or less precisely) as simply pertaining to the insufficiency of evidence to support the conviction \u2014 that is, at least implicitly, that the trial court erred in <em>entering the judgment of conviction. See, e.g., State v. Hurst, </em>147 Or App 385, 936 P2d 396 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998); <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>45 Or App 607, 609 P2d 386 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The distinction transcends form. Consistently with deference to the dynamics of the adversarial system, the universe of circumstances in which a trial court is compelled to act, in the absence of a motion or objection by a party, is extremely limited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 625, 630, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (directing trial courts, with respect to certain testimony tantamount to a \u201ccomment on the credibility\u201d of another witness, to <em>\u201csua sponte * * * </em>summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it\u201d); <em>see also State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 277 P3d 588 (2012) (reversing criminal conviction based on trial court\u2019s plain error in failing to preclude testimony <em>sua sponte </em>in accordance with <em>Milbradt). </em>At least \u2014 at the very least \u2014 in the context of a jury trial, it is a highly debatable proposition that the court is obligated to direct acquittal in the absence of a predicate motion. Indeed, in <em>Ford, </em>where the defendant, for the first time on appeal, argued that a conviction based on a purportedly uncorroborated confession must be reversed, we held that \u201c[t]he trial court had no duty to rule, <em>sua sponte, </em>on the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence.\u201d 245 Or App at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Conversely, casting and viewing the purported error in terms of the court\u2019s action in entering the judgment of conviction more comfortably comports with our treatment of other species of plain error, including, most consistently, sentencing error, in which we have held that, even in the absence of an objection, a trial court exceeded its authority in undertaking a particular act. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gutierrez, </em>243 Or App 285, 259 P3d 951 (2011) (reversing, as plain error, court\u2019s imposition of sentence that exceeded statutory maximum); <em>State v. Ryder, </em>230 Or App 432, 216 P3d 895 (2009) (court committed plain error in entering multiple convictions on counts that should have been merged). Bluntly: If a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>court commits plain error by imposing a sentence exceeding the statutorily prescribed maximum, why isn\u2019t it similarly erroneous for a court to enter a judgment of conviction based on legally insufficient evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Either of the contending formulations of the predicate error is imperfect, but the latter most closely corresponds to the essential concern, <em>viz., </em>that the defendant has been wrongly convicted of, and sentenced for, a crime. The inquiry focuses not on whether the trial court erred in failing to act <em>sua sponte </em>but, instead, on whether the action that the court <em>did </em>undertake was plainly contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">With the first, \u201cWas it plain error?\u201d question so focused, the answer is straightforward: In every case in which, viewing the evidence and disputed inferences in the light most favorable to the state, the legal insufficiency of the state\u2019s proof is \u201cnot reasonably in dispute,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355, the entry of the judgment of conviction is plain error. The critical qualification is, of course \u2014 as it is in many plain error cases \u2014 the \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d requirement. To satisfy that requirement, the appellant must, in turn, demonstrate <em>both </em>that (1) the operative legal principles governing sufficiency of the evidence as to the pertinent element(s) of the crime are \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>id.-, and </em>(2) it is beyond reasonable dispute that, applying those \u201cobvious\u201d legal principles to the evidence adduced at trial, that proof was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The touchstone is not whether, as a substantive/ merits matter, the appellant\u2019s position as to the law and its proper application is correct; rather, it is whether that position is correct beyond reasonable dispute. Thus \u2014 to invoke a quintessentially contentious issue of criminal proof \u2014 it could well be that a <em>preserved </em>challenge as to the sufficiency of proof based on the multiplicity or strength of inferences could result in a reversal, but an <em>unpreserved </em>challenge on the same grounds would be unavailing because the asserted legal insufficiency was \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Such concerns are inapposite to this case. For purposes of our review, the circumstances of defendant\u2019s conviction for third-degree assault on Count 13 are undisputed. The applicable law, as announced in <em>State v. Merida-Medina, </em>221 Or App 614, 191 P3d 708 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>is precise. And the proper application of the latter to the former is straightforward \u2014 almost arithmetical in its simplicity. The legal insufficiency of the proof on which the challenged conviction was based is patent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">B. <em>A digression to discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Before turning to <em>Ailes </em>discretion, a pause for some historical perspective \u2014 a sort of <em>entr\u2019acte </em>\u2014 is in order. That is so because of the convolutions of our treatment of discretion, including some apparent conflation of the \u201cplain error\u201d and \u201cexercise of discretion\u201d determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">It all began with <em>Willy, </em>where the defendant raised an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of evidence underlying a conviction for unlawfully obtaining food stamps. 36 Or App at 856-57. We noted that we \u201cnormally [would] not take cognizance of matters not called to the attention of the trial court,\u201d but, nevertheless, \u201c[b]ecause * * * the allegation is that there was absolutely no evidence from which the defendant could have been convicted,\u201d we \u201cconsidered] the issue\u201d and rejected it because the record did, in fact, include evidence that the defendant had unlawfully obtained food stamps. <em>Id. </em>In so holding, we made no reference to discretion \u2014 or even, for that matter, to \u201cplain error\u201d (or its requisite characteristics) \u2014 which is unsurprising because <em>Willy </em>antedated <em>Brown </em>by 12 years and <em>Ailes </em>by 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The first reference to \u201cdiscretion\u201d in this context appears in <em>Lindsey, </em>which we decided two years after <em>Willy. </em>There, the defendant, who was convicted of fourth-degree assault after a trial to the court, appealed, asserting that \u201cthere was no evidence to support that conviction.\u201d 45 Or App at 609. Specifically, the defendant contended \u2014 and the state conceded \u2014 that \u201cthe only injury the victim suffered was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>torn shirt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reversed. In so holding, we referred to <em>Willy </em>and cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><em>\u201cWilly </em>should not be read as establishing any general rule that we will <em>always </em>consider challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence when such challenges were not raised in the trial court. The rule is that we may consider such assignments in our discretion. <em>Willy </em>was a case in which we exercised that discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">45 Or App at 609 n 1 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Thus, in <em>Lindsey, </em>we phrased and framed the exercise of discretion as pertaining to our \u201cconsideration]\u201d of the unpreserved challenge, but we did not identify any principles informing or constraining that discretion. <em>See also State v. Dennison, </em>55 Or App 939, 944, 640 P2d 669, <em>rev den, </em>293 Or 104 (1982) (characterizing <em>Lindsey </em>as having been \u201cdecided on the theory that a defendant ought not be convicted if there [is] no evidence of the substantive elements of the offense\u201d and further describing <em>Lindsey </em>and <em>Willy </em>as \u201crepresenting] a very narrow exception to a general rule\u201d of preservation).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In <em>State v. Wagner, </em>67 Or App 75, 77, 676 P2d 937 (1984), the defendant contended, for the first time on appeal, that his conviction for witness tampering must be reversed because \u201cthere was no evidence that [the putative witnesses] had been legally summoned to an official proceeding at the time [the defendant] allegedly induced them to leave.\u201d Invoking <em>Lindsey </em>and <em>Willy </em>\u2014 and notwithstanding the state\u2019s non-preservation objection \u2014 we reversed, observing that, where \u201cthere [is] absolutely no evidence to support [a] conviction, we will <em>usually </em>exercise our discretion to consider that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Again \u2014 at that point seven years before <em>Brown </em>\u2014 we referred only to \u201cdiscretion to consider\u201d the purported error, and the only consideration that we identified as bearing on that discretion was whether \u201cthere was absolutely no evidence to support\u201d the challenged conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, it appears that, in the <em>pre-Brown /Ailes </em>age, we embraced an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>approach that, if a conviction was based on legally insufficient evidence, we would, regardless of nonpreservation, presumptively (albeit not necessarily) correct that error and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">We entered the <em>Brown/Ailes </em>era with <em>Hurst. </em>There, the defendant, who had been convicted for unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, raised an unpreserved challenge, contending that the state had failed to prove that the rifle she possessed was not, in fact, registered as required under federal law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hurst, </em>147 Or App at 387. We reversed the conviction after determining, by reference to <em>Ailes, </em>that the error was \u201capparent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further stated that \u201cwe exercise[d] our discretion to review it\u201d \u2014 but offered no explanation or justification for the positive exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Our most recent reference to <em>Willy </em>\u2014 until today\u2014 was in <em>Hooker smith, </em>where we declined to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved contention that his conviction for possession of a controlled substance must be reversed because certain documents evincing the nature of the substance had, inadvertently, never been received into evidence. In so holding, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201c[Djefendant does not contend that the error is one of law apparent on the face of the record. Even assuming that it is, however, he offers no justification for exercising our discretion to consider it. Particularly in light of the fact that defendant stipulated to the facts contained in the police report and the laboratory reports, was shown them at trial, and then stood idly by as the trial court ruled without formally admitting them into evidence, we are not inclined to address his complaints about the failure to admit those reports for the first time on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">181 Or App at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Thus, our refusal to exercise <em>Ailes </em>discretion in <em>Hockersmith </em>turned on the consideration that, if the deficiency in the proof had been raised by way of a timely MJOA, the trial court would (almost certainly) have permitted the state to reopen to remedy that deficiency and the necessary proof would readily have been adduced. To permit the defendant in <em>Hockersmith </em>to prevail on his unpreserved claim of error and, thus, obtain an outright reversal of his conviction, would have placed him in a better position than if trial counsel had timely raised the purported error. <em>Accord State v. Caldwell, </em>187 Or App 720, 726, 69 P3d 830 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 376 (2004) (declining to remedy alleged \u201cplain error\u201d defect in indictment because, given that the statute of limitations had run during the pendency of the appeal, the defendant would secure an outright reversal, rather than a remand \u2014 which would, effectively, \u201creward defendant for not making a timely challenge at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Finally, and most recently, in <em>State v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 243 P3d 862 (2010), we addressed the application of Ailes\u2019s discretionary criteria, where the belated challenge to the sufficiency of evidence underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction for criminal mistreatment was predicated on a post-trial change in decisional law, <em>viz., State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010). We predicated our exercise of discretion on two considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cFirst, given the intervening material change in the law, correcting the asserted error here will not subvert the judicial system\u2019s interest in requiring preservation of error. Second, the gravity of the error \u2014 the imposition of four felony convictions based on legally insufficient evidence \u2014 -is extreme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Inloes, </em>239 Or App at 54-55 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In sum, to paraphrase <em>Ecclesiastes, </em>\u201cBetter is the end of [the] thing than the beginning.\u201d But not much. For nearly 40 years we have referred to our \u201cdiscretion\u201d to review and correct unpreserved error of this sort \u2014 but, in doing so, we have variously conflated or equated the clarity of the error <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d) with the appropriate exercise of discretion, exercised discretion without any explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(even as prescribed in <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382), or attempted to explain the exercise or nonexercise of discretion by reference to some of Ailes\u2019s nonexclusive criteria or to criteria developed and applied in other plain error contexts. <em>See, e.g., Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49; <em>Hockersmith, </em>181 Or App 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">To be sure, some case-specific variability is inevitable and, indeed, desirable. And, given the mix-and-match interplay of various <em>Ailes </em>discretionary considerations, <em>see Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6, precision is a fool\u2019s errand. It is, after all, <em>discretion. </em>But still, in the end, the judicious exercise of discretion must be cabined and guided by some consistent prudential principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">C. <em>Deconstructing discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Toward that end, I respectfully submit that several salient principles, which comport with our diffuse precedents, can and should inform and channel our exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion with respect to consideration of criminal convictions based on legally insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>First, </em>the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion in such circumstances is presumptive. That premise harkens to some of our <em>pre-Ailes </em>opinions, <em>e.g., Wagner, </em>67 Or App at 77 (\u201c[W]e will usually exercise our discretion to consider that issue.\u201d), and partakes of notions of fundamental fairness. In general, in the absence of compelling countervailing considerations, affirming a criminal conviction based on insufficient evidence is unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\"><em>Second, </em>that presumption is not absolute or conclusive. Given <em>Ailes, </em>it cannot be. <em>Ailes </em>emphasizes, and subsequent Supreme Court decisions have reiterated, that plain error review and correction is a \u201crare and exceptional\u201d deviation from the rule of preservation. <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 166, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). That premise is grounded in the recognition that the rule of preservation promotes not only systemic \u201cefficiency\u201d but also, and far more importantly, the principled and evenhanded operation of our adversarial system of justice. That is, the rule of preservation is not some mere mindless dictate of form over substance; rather, it is itself designed to promote fairness. <em>See, e.g., Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>P3d 637 (2008) (describing rationale for preservation requirements). That, in turn, necessitates an explicit explanation of why, in the totality of material circumstances, such an extraordinary departure from the rule is warranted. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382. <em>Ailes </em>discretion is not a \u201cone size fits all\u201d proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><em>Third, </em>consistently with the second principle, considerations bearing materially on our exercise of discretion in cases of this type should include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">(1) <em>\u201cThe ends of justice in the particular case.\u201d </em>This is, of course, a quintessential <em>Ailes </em>criterion, 312 Or at 382 n 6, and is almost reflexively dovetailed with the \u201cgravity of the error\u201d consideration. <em>See, e.g., Merrimon, </em>234 Or App at 522; <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 513-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010). In this context, the latter is, effectively, a makeweight, in that it is captured and effectuated in the first, presumptive principle above. That is, entering a criminal conviction based on legally insufficient evidence <em>is </em>an extremely serious error, and that is so regardless of the nature of the underlying charge. At first blush, the same might seem to be true of the \u201cends of justice\u201d consideration \u2014 that is, that it can never comport with the ends of justice to fail to reverse a conviction based on legally insufficient evidence \u2014 and, thus, that consideration is already given effect by the initial presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">That, however, is not always true \u2014 in some circumstances, as a practical matter, the \u201cends of justice\u201d may not militate in favor of overriding the rule of preservation. In particular, our \u201cends of justice\u201d assessment should be informed by: (a) consideration of the functional role of the defendant\u2019s challenged conviction and sentence in the totality of his or her circumstances (including other convictions and sentences); and (b) the availability of other mechanisms <em>(e.g., </em>post-conviction relief) to address and remedy the asserted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">With respect to the first inquiry, the classic \u201cends of justice\u201d scenario is one in which a defendant has been erroneously convicted of a single, very serious crime and is incarcerated even as we review the claim of the plain error. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>circumstance, every day we delay plain error review and correction is another day of unjust confinement. But not every case is so stark; indeed, few are. Consider, for example, a case in which a defendant has been convicted on over a dozen criminal counts, many more serious than the single count that was based on insufficient evidence \u2014 and the sentence on that count is much shorter than, and concurrent with, those on his or her myriad unchallenged convictions. The \u201cends of justice\u201d assessment in the two cases is qualitatively different.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">So too with respect to the potential availability of collateral relief \u2014 which, after all, is designed to (ultimately) achieve the ends of justice. Presumably, in virtually every case in which counsel, without reasonable explanation, has failed to move for a judgment of acquittal whose allowance would have been required under law existing as of the time of trial, the wrongly convicted defendant will be able to obtain post-conviction relief, reversing the conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question, practically, becomes whether the error should be remedied by plain error review on direct appeal or left to post-conviction correction \u2014 that is, whether to act sooner rather than later. In the first scenario outlined above, the answer is clear. But it is not so clear with respect to the second, in which the defendant is suffering no present detriment from the purported wrongful conviction \u2014 and, in fact, may not suffer cognizable prejudice from that conviction for years (if ever), by which time any collateral proceedings will long be concluded. In the latter scenario, the ends of justice will not, in any real sense, be subverted by the court declining plain error review and correction and consigning the defendant to collateral proceedings \u2014 and the prudential policies underlying the rule of preservation may well be concomitantly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">(2) <em>Post-trial developments in law pertaining to proof of the disputed offense. </em>This <em>State v. </em>Jury-based consideration can have cross-cutting implications with respect to the application of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. On one hand, in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>cases, trial counsel cannot be faulted for failing to have anticipated the change of law \u2014 and, even if counsel had, the MJOA would have been denied under then-extant law \u2014 and, thus, plain error review will not subvert policies underlying the rule of preservation. <em>See, e.g., Inloes, </em>239 Or App at 54. On the other hand, that is true only if we can be fully confident that the evidentiary record would not have been materially different if the subsequent developments in the law had been extant as of the time of trial. Otherwise, the record-development policies of preservation will be subverted \u2014 with the consequence that the defendant, by securing an outright reversal, may have obtained a better result than if he or she had raised a contemporaneous challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">(3) <em>The potential record-development effect of a contemporaneous MJOA. </em>At the risk of reiteration and overlap with the preceding discussion, which pertained to Jury-predicated challenges, this consideration applies to our review of every unpreserved challenge to the legal insufficiency of evidence. That is so because of the patent potential for tactical sandbagging \u2014 or, in all events, the potential for contemporaneous cure. Because of the underlying potential for bait-and-switch manipulation yielding an outright reversal, <em>see, </em>e.g., <em>Hockersmith, </em>181 Or App 554, this consideration can militate powerfully, indeed, decisively, against the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion in this context. Nevertheless, its application is, not infrequently, unsatisfying because of the constraints of the record on appeal: In their briefing on <em>Ailes </em>discretion, even the most skilled advocates are reduced to hypothesizing about what proof might (or might not) have been adduced if a timely MJOA had been made (and if the trial court had permitted reopening) \u2014 and we, as the referees and judges of that shadowboxing contest, are regularly reduced to rendering what amounts to a \u201cwe know it when we see it\u201d determination as to what would have occurred at trial if something that never occurred had occurred. Still, in the dynamics of <em>Ailes </em>discretion, this, among the various considerations, comes closest to being a \u201ctie goes to the runner\u201d factor \u2014 with the state being the \u201crunner,\u201d \u201csafe\u201d for now, unless or until the defendant can develop a fuller, more favorable record in the post-conviction proceedings as to putative prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>D. <em>Application and conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The application of the foregoing principles to this case is straightforward. Notwithstanding the generic presumption in criminal cases favoring the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion when the evidence is insufficient, defendant\u2019s particular circumstances do not correspond with those in the generality of such cases. Further, nothing in the circumstances here suggests that this is such a \u201crare and exceptional case[ ],\u201d <em>Gornick, </em>340 Or at 166, as to warrant, much less compel, the extraordinary exercise <em>o\u00ed Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The point of departure is the totality of defendant\u2019s convictions and consequent sentences. Defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, on 14 criminal counts, including six Class A felonies involving two different victims, four Class B felonies involving the same two victims, and four Class C felonies (including Count 13) involving the same two victims. The trial court (a) merged the guilty verdicts on the first two counts and imposed a 40-month sentence on the resulting conviction; (b) imposed a 90-month sentence on each of the other Class A felony convictions to be served concurrently with one another, with 80 months to be served consecutively to the 40-month <em>sentence </em>\u2014 i.e., a total of 120 months\u2019 incarceration; (c) imposed 70-month sentences on each of the four Class B felony convictions, to be served concurrently with one another and with the sentences described in (b); and (d) imposed a dispositional upward departure sentence of six months with respect to each of the four Class B felony convictions, to be served concurrently with one another and with the sentences described in (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The upshot is that, regardless of the asserted plain error, defendant \u2014 like the defendant in the hypothetical posited above, <em>see </em>250 Or App at 538-39 (Haselton, C. J., dissenting in part, concurring in part) \u2014 stands convicted of a very large number of felonies, many of which are much more serious than the challenged conviction, and her sentence on the challenged conviction is dwarfed by and subsumed within her sentences on the other, indisputably lawful convictions. Defendant identifies no meaningful collateral consequence from her conviction and sentence on Count 13 \u2014 and, given the totality of the circumstances, none is manifest. The \u201cends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of justice\u201d in this case hardly compel plain error correction on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Nor is this a case in which some subsequent, reasonably unforeseen change in the law mitigates or excuses the failure to make a contemporaneous MJOA. <em>Accord Inloes, </em>239 Or App at 54-55 (addressing exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion in context in which substantive law changed between trial and appeal). Further, although this does not appear to be a case in which the <em>evidentiary </em>record might have developed differently if a timely MJOA had been made, it is at least plausible that defense counsel made a tactical choice to pursue a holistic \u201call-or-nothing\u201d strategy with respect to Count 13, as he did with respect to all of the charges, and to forgo an MJOA predicated on <em>Merida-Medina, </em>which would have focused the court\u2019s (and the state\u2019s) attention on the availability and propriety of a conviction for fourth-degree assault. Of course, that <em>is </em>speculative \u2014 but it is also plausible. And on this record, pending any further elucidation in collateral proceedings, that, too, cuts against the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the end, nothing in this case justifies the exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s disposition as to Count 13 represents an abuse of that discretion. I respectfully dissent from that disposition and concur in the balance of the majority\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> And that is just in our published dispositions, without reference to those cases in which we have rejected such challenges and affirmed without opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-5\"> That otherwise constricted universe can be, and has been, existentially expanded by our application of <em>State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003), by which the temporal benchmark for determination of plain error is by reference to the law existing as of the time the appeal is decided, and not as of the time of trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 243 P3d 862 (2010) (reviewing unpreserved contention as to purported insufficiency of evidence to support criminal conviction by reference to appellate decisions that issued after the date of trial and conviction); <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010) (holding that admission of evidence of diagnosis of child sex abuse constituted plain error in the light of <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), which issued after the date of the defendant\u2019s conviction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> The state acknowledges as much \u2014 while at the same time vehemently contending that the court should not exercise its <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The state\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d as to plain error is largely \u2014 and perhaps entirely\u2014 immaterial. Each of the three cumulative <em>Brown </em>requisites is objective. Consequently, as a matter of law, the asserted error either satisfies those objective requisites or it doesn\u2019t, and the state\u2019s ostensible concession cannot alter our obligation under <em>Brown </em>to render that legal determination correctly. <em>But cf. Inloes, </em>239 Or App at 53 (noting state\u2019s concession that insufficiency of evidence was no longer in reasonable dispute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> None of our post <em>-Willy </em>cases explains the meaning of \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d \u2014 as opposed to \u201cno evidence\u201d or \u201clegally insufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> That contention was, in turn, based on <em>State v. Vasquez-Rubio, </em>323 Or 275, 917 P2d 494 (1996), which was decided after the defendant\u2019s trial and conviction. Thus, <em>Hurst </em>effectively anticipated <em>Jury </em>and <em>Inloes </em>in that we assessed the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof by reference to the standards prescribed in decisions that issued after the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> One exception, addressed below, <em>see </em>250 Or App at 540 (Haselton, C. J., dissenting in part, concurring in part), is where, if a timely MJOA had been made, the trial court would likely, and properly, have permitted the state to rectify the defect in its proof. <em>See, e.g.,Hooker smith, </em>181 Or App at 558.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
