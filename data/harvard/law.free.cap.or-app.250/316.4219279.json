J.</author>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment convicting him of, among other offenses, misdemeanor fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160, menacing, ORS 163.190, and felony fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160(3). He assigns error to the court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score for purposes of sentencing him on the felony fourth-degree assault charge, arguing that the court erred in counting the other two convictions as part of his score and, as a result, erred in sentencing him to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment on that count. The issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s conviction for felony fourth-degree assault arose from a separate criminal episode from his convictions for misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and menacing. For the reasons that follow, we remand for resen-tencing and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Defendant stipulated to the pertinent facts, which come from a statement of defendant\u2019s wife, M. Defendant awoke one evening at 9:30 p.m. and expressed his frustration with M for not waking him earlier. M sent defendant\u2019s son, C, who had been preparing to go to bed, to his bedroom. Defendant yelled at M for leaving the window of his office open and accused her of searching the office. After she told him that \u201che needed to stop throwing a temper tantrum,\u201d defendant grabbed M\u2019s hair and pulled her head back, aggravating a bulging disc in her neck, and continued to yell at her, referring to her in derogatory terms and stating that he hoped that she \u201crotted from [cancer] slowly.\u201d She slapped him, and he let her go.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Defendant persisted in yelling at M, questioning her about why they had so many condoms in their bathroom and accusing her of marital infidelity. He told her that she needed to leave, presumably the house, and she responded that it was he who needed to leave, which led defendant to grab her and shake her violently.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Defendant and M eventually moved to the bathroom, where he accused her of using cocaine. She denied the accusation, and, after further argument, defendant left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>bathroom and went to the kitchen, where he knelt on the floor and yelled at M, who had followed him into the kitchen, to hit him. When she refused, he pulled a kitchen knife out of a drawer and forcibly placed it in her hand, yelling at her to stab him with it. She reached down and pulled his hair until he released his hold on her hand in which he had placed the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">After defendant released his hold on her hand, M \u201cjumped over him and ran into the living room [to use a telephone] to call 9-1-1\u201d for help. Defendant followed her and, while she held the phone in her hand, pulled the phone\u2019s cord out of the wall. M fled to C\u2019s bedroom and told C that they were going to leave the house. Defendant followed M to the bedroom and told her that she was not going to take C. C was crying and wrapped his arms around M. Defendant told C to stop crying and said that M was brainwashing him into fearing defendant. Defendant pulled C and M apart, shook M again, and threw her against a bookshelf. Defendant then grabbed C and slammed his face into the ladder of his bunk bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Defendant forced M out of the bedroom and again told C that M was brainwashing him. Defendant then left the bedroom and told M that he was going to the store for cigarettes. It was approximately 3:00 a.m. by that point. Defendant later returned to the house, retrieved a blanket, and proceeded to sleep in M\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As relevant to this appeal, defendant was convicted of three criminal counts involving M: Count 1, misdemeanor assault, for pulling M\u2019s head back and aggravating her neck injury; Count 2, menacing, for placing M in fear of imminent serious physical injury when he shook her in the living room and pulled the knife out of the drawer in the kitchen; and Count 4, felony assault, for throwing her against the bookshelf in C\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">At sentencing, the state asked the court to count defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 and 2 as part of defendant\u2019s criminal history score in sentencing defendant on Count 4. The state contended that, because Counts 1 and 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>constituted two separate \u201cperson Class A misdemeanors\u201d and because Count 4 arose from a separate incident that came after the events that gave rise to his convictions on Counts 1 and 2, defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 4 should be \u201cD\u201d rather than \u201cI.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Defendant\u2019s counsel responded that the counts did not involve separate incidents because \u201cthere was no opportunity [for defendant] to withdraw or calm down between them. Incidents one and two were part of a single, continuous argument with\u201d M. He began to refer to Count 4 but was interrupted by a question from the court. Defense counsel then responded, \u201cIt was all done as part of one incident where [defendant] was angry, arguably out of control. He did not have a cooling-down period sufficient to stop.\u201d Eventually, defense counsel specifically contended that Count 4 was part of the same episode as the other two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The state responded that there was a break in time between the events that occurred in the living room, bathroom, and kitchen and those that occurred in C\u2019s bedroom. In response to the parties\u2019 arguments, the court stated that it had no \u201cproblem finding that [Count 4] was separate and came later.\u201d The court ultimately determined that defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 4 was \u201cD\u201d and that Count 4 fell in category 6 of the crime seriousness scale under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">However, instead of imposing the presumptive sentence of 14 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 4 under grid block 6-D of the sentencing guidelines, the court ordered a downward departure sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a probation condition, the court prohibited defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>having any contact with M or C. Defendant subsequently violated the terms of his probation by contacting M, and the court revoked his probation and sentenced him to the presumptive sentence of 14 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendant appeals, contending that the court erred in calculating his criminal history score on Count 4 and, consequently, erred in imposing 14 months\u2019 imprisonment on that count. The state disputes those contentions. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">A defendant\u2019s criminal history score is used to calculate the sentence that a court imposes under the sentencing guidelines. OAR 213-004-0006; <em>State v. Norman, </em>216 Or App 475, 485, 174 P3d 598 (2007), <em>vac\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>345 Or 319, 207 P3d 423 (2008). The court calculates the defendant\u2019s criminal history by assessing several factors, including the number and severity of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. OAR 213-004-0006; <em>Norman, </em>216 Or App at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">When a court imposes sentences for multiple convictions in a single proceeding, the court may use a defendant\u2019s convictions arising from earlier criminal episodes to calculate the defendant\u2019s criminal history score with respect to a crime arising from a later criminal episode. <em>Norman, </em>216 Or App at 485 (citing <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 317, 855 P2d 1100 (1993)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s multiple convictions stem from the same criminal episode, his criminal history score remains the same with respect to all of those convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485-86. In other words, a conviction cannot be included in a defendant\u2019s criminal history score for purposes of imposing sentence on another crime if the second crime could not have been prosecuted separately from the first, that is, if double jeopardy principles required the two crimes to be prosecuted together. Accordingly, the determination whether defendant\u2019s convictions for Counts 1 and 2 could be included in his criminal history score in sentencing him on Count 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>turns on whether, in accordance with double jeopardy principles, the counts had to be prosecuted together. <em>See id. </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>State v. Potter, </em>236 Or App 74, 234 P3d 1073 (2010), we set out the analytical sequence by which to determine whether crimes arise from the same criminal episode for purposes of double jeopardy. The court first considers \u201cwhether \u2018a complete account of one [crime] <em>necessarily </em>includes details of the other\u2019 \u201d or, framed another way, whether the crimes are \u201ccross-related.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82-83 (quoting <em>State v. Boyd, </em>271 Or 558, 566, 533 P2d 795 (1975)) (emphasis in <em>Potter). </em>If a complete account <em>of </em>each crime necessarily includes details of the other, then they arise from the same criminal episode. Crimes are not cross-related, and thus do not necessarily include details of one another, where one of the crimes may be proved without evidence of the other crime. <em>See State v. Lyons, </em>161 Or App 355, 363, 985 P2d 204 (1999) (determining that charges underlying a violation of the Oregon Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (ORICO) and the ORICO violation, itself, were not cross-related because proof of the underlying charges did not \u201cin any way depend on proof of the ORICO violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Here, defendant contends that \u201cthe facts of each [count] were so linked in time, place, and circumstance that one [crime] could not be explained without relating the facts of the other[,]\u201d emphasizing that \u201cone could not take one aspect of the defendant\u2019s conduct and explain it as a discrete event without providing the context of the domestic dispute of that evening.\u201d We conclude that, although the events that led to the three relevant counts in this case would have provided useful context for proving each count, defendant\u2019s conviction for Counts 1 and 2 in no way depended on proof of Count 4. Thus, the three counts are not cross-related, and a complete account of Counts 1 and 2 does not necessarily include details of Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Where a complete account of one crime does not necessarily include details of another, the crimes may nonetheless have arisen from the same criminal episode, depending on consideration of the factors listed in ORS <em>131.505(4) </em>\u2014 viz., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>whether the crimes were part of \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that * * * is so joined in time, place and circumstances that [the] conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d Here, the court found \u201cthat the [Count 4] felony was separate and came later\u201d in relation to Counts 1 and 2. We defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cto the extent they are supported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Potter, </em>236 Or App at 82. Hence, defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score on Count 4 reduces to whether there is evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that Count 4 was separate from Counts 1 and 2 for purposes of the test established in ORS 131.505(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that it lacks such evidence. The state based its prosecution of defendant on Count 2 on defendant\u2019s actions in shaking M in the living room and pulling out a knife from a drawer in the kitchen. The record establishes that M responded to defendant pulling out the knife by fleeing from him: after forcing him to release his hold on her hand by pulling his hair, she \u201cjumped over him and ran into the living room [to use a telephone] to call 9-1-1.\u201d Defendant chased M into the living room and continued to direct threatening conduct toward her by ripping the phone\u2019s cord out of the wall while she held the phone in her hand, thereby preventing her from obtaining relief from defendant\u2019s abuse by calling for help. M responded by going to C\u2019s bedroom and telling C that they were leaving the house. However, defendant pursued M into the bedroom, where defendant continued his abusive behavior by throwing M into a bookshelf.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Thus, the record establishes that M attempted to escape from defendant\u2019s abusive behavior in the kitchen by running to the living room to use a phone to call 9-1-1, which defendant thwarted by ripping the phone\u2019s cord out of the wall, and then fleeing to C\u2019s room so that she could leave the house with C to escape from defendant\u2019s abusive behavior, at which point defendant continued the abuse by throwing M into a bookshelf. There is no evidence in the record from which the trial court could find that that series of events was interrupted. Instead, the record establishes that Counts 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and 4 arose from continuous and uninterrupted conduct by defendant that was joined in time, place, and circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Counts 2 and 4 also shared a common criminal objective of harassing and injuring the victim through physical and emotional abuse. <em>State v. Kautz, </em>179 Or App 458, 39 P3d 937 (2002), is illustrative. In that case, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s workshop, took various items of personal property, and put those items in a car at the workshop. <em>Id. </em>at 460. As the defendant left the workshop, the victim saw him taking the car, pointed a gun at him, and demanded that he stop. The defendant pointed a shotgun, which he had taken from the workshop, at the victim, told him to \u201cback off,\u201d and ran away. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Based on those actions, the defendant was charged with burglary and robbery. He contended that the court incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines in calculating his sentence because the burglary and robbery arose from a single criminal episode. <em>Id. </em>at 464-65. The state contended that the court correctly determined that the burglary and the robbery arose from separate criminal episodes because the two crimes were not directed at the same criminal objective. The state contended that the objective of the burglary was to steal the victim\u2019s property while the objective of the robbery was to threaten the victim so that the defendant could escape with the property that he had stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We concluded \u201cthat that kind of parsing of [the] defendant\u2019s criminal objective is inconsistent with the intent of ORS 131.505(4).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. We concluded that the crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>arose from a single criminal episode, explaining that, although the \u201cdefendant may have acquired an additional criminal objective to escape when confronted by [the victim], his earlier objective to steal [the victim\u2019s] property continued during the course of all of the events.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The present case is similar. Defendant physically and emotionally abused M throughout the course of the night in response to a series of alleged actions by M, <em>viz., </em>failing to wake defendant, leaving a window open, searching defendant\u2019s office, committing marital infidelity, engaging in illegal drug use, and attempting to leave the house with C. Nonetheless, to accept that defendant\u2019s criminal objective changed over the course of the abuse would improperly parse defendant\u2019s criminal objective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">As in <em>Kautz, </em>where the defendant\u2019s objective of taking the victim\u2019s property continued even when he threatened the victim with a shotgun to facilitate his escape, here, defendant\u2019s objective of abusing the victim in the kitchen continued into the living room and eventually into C\u2019s bedroom as she attempted to escape his abuse. Although defendant may have acquired the additional objective in C\u2019s bedroom that the dissent ascribes to him, <em>viz., </em>to stop M from taking C with her as she tried to flee from defendant, defendant\u2019s earlier and ongoing criminal objective to harass and abuse M continued throughout the episode.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Because Counts 2 and 4 arose from continuous and uninterrupted conduct that was joined in time, place, and circumstances and that shared a common criminal objective such that it would violate double jeopardy principles to prosecute defendant separately for the two counts, we conclude that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Count 4 was separate from Count 2 for purposes of calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 4. It follows that the court erred in calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 4 to be \u201cD\u201d and in sentencing defendant to the presumptive sentence of 14 months\u2019 imprisonment under the sentencing guidelines on the basis of that score. We therefore must remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> The state contended that defendant\u2019s two Class A misdemeanor convictions for Counts 1 and 2 combined to equal a felony conviction for criminal history score purposes, thereby qualifying defendant for a criminal history score of \u201cD\u201d for sentencing on Count 4. <em>See </em>OAR 213-004-0008 (\u201cEvery two prior adult convictions of person Class A misdemeanors in the offender\u2019s criminal history shall be counted as one adult conviction of a person felony for criminal history purposes.\u201d); OAR 213-004-0007 (\u201cD \u2014 The offender\u2019s criminal history includes one adult conviction * * * for a person felony[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> Had the court not included Counts 1 and 2 in defendant\u2019s criminal history score, defendant would have been sentenced under grid block 6-1, which provides a presumptive sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation. OAR 213-004-0007; OAR 213-005-0008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> In <em>Bucholz, </em>the Supreme Court held that, when multiple convictions occur in a single proceeding, a court may recalculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history score for one conviction based on the other convictions, provided that those other convictions arose from an earlier criminal episode. <em>Norman, </em>216 Or App at 485.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> We need not address whether the record establishes that Counts 1 and 4 arose from continuous and uninterrupted conduct by defendant that was joined in time, place, and circumstances in order to reach the conclusion that the court erred. If Counts 2 and 4 arose from a single criminal episode, but Counts 1 and 4 arose from separate criminal episodes, then defendant would have only one Class A misdemeanor conviction for the purpose of determining his criminal history score for sentencing on Count 4. <em>Norman, </em>216 Or App at 485. Had the court included only Count 1 in defendant\u2019s criminal history score, defendant would have been sentenced under grid block 6-H, which provides the same presumptive sentence as grid block 6-1. OAR 213-004-0007; OAR 213-005-0008. Thus, defendant\u2019s presumptive sentence for Count 4 would be the same whether we conclude that the behavior underlying both Counts 1 and 2 occurred in the same criminal episode as Count 4 or conclude that the behavior underlying Count 2 occurred in the same criminal episode as Count 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> The Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Boyd </em>against construing the phrase \u2018\u2018directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective,\u201d too narrowly. 271 Or at 565 n 4. <em>A </em>narrow understanding of that phrase would fail to afford a defendant the protection that our constitution provides against successive prosecutions, a protection that the court concluded the legislature intended to replicate in adopting ORS 131.505(4). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> It is unclear whether the objective that the dissent identifies, stopping M from leaving the house with C, can be considered to be a criminal objective, because it is unclear on this record whether preventing M from taking C from the house would constitute a crime if the manner in which defendant did that were not otherwise criminal. Of course, if that objective is not a criminal objective, then that is a further reason to reject the dissent\u2019s thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In contrast, defendant\u2019s conduct in ripping the telephone cord out of the wall to prevent M from calling 9-1-1 did, in fact, add a new criminal objective to the criminal episode, that of interfering with making a report to a 9-1-1 emergency reporting system. <em>See </em>ORS 165.572. However, as in <em>Kautz, </em>the addition of another criminal objective does not detract from the focus on the overarching criminal objective that is required under a proper application of the standard that the legislature established in ORS 131.505(4) to protect people against double jeopardy. <em>See, e.g., Boyd, </em>271 Or at 562-71, 565 nn 4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b346-5\">EDMONDS, S. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKEg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">As framed by the parties, this case presents a question of first impression: whether, under OAR 213-004-0006, the trial court erred when it imposed the sentence on Count 4 based on defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 and 2. Defendant argues that his convictions on Counts 1, 2, and 4 were the result of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct against the same victim and, therefore, the court erred when it reconstituted defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 4 based on his convictions on Counts 1 and 2 and thereafter imposed a 14-month prison term after the revocation of defendant\u2019s probation. In the majority\u2019s view, defendant had only one overarching criminal objective and the fact that he formed an additional criminal objective when he committed the crime of assault against the victim is of no legal consequence. For the reasons that follow, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the addition of another criminal objective does not authorize the imposition of a separate sentence for the commission of a separate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Preliminarily, the majority and I do not appear to disagree on what the record expresses regarding the events that led to defendant\u2019s convictions. Rather, we disagree on the legal import of those facts for purposes of sentencing under OAR 213-004-0006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, we agree that the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>test for determining whether defendant had more than one criminal objective is not satisfied by the facts in this case in that Counts 2 and 4 are not so interrelated that a complete account of the details of Count 2 cannot be described without referring to the details of Count 4, and <em>vice versa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">With those understandings in mind, I turn to the allegations of the charging instrument which provide the foundation for defendant\u2019s convictions. Count 2 alleges that defendant committed the crime of menacing by \u201cintentionally attempting] to place [M] in fear of imminent serious physical injury by words or conduct[.]\u201d Count 4 alleges that defendant committed the crime of felony assault in the fourth degree constituting domestic violence by \u201crecklessly causing] physical injury to [M], the said acts having been committed in the immediate presence of, or witnessed by a minor child or stepchild of the defendant or victim, or by a minor child residing within the household of the defendant or of [M].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Factually, the circumstances in this case involve three people, defendant, his wife, M, and defendant\u2019s son, C, and their interactions during a time period that began at approximately 9:30 p.m. and ended about 3:00 a.m. The circumstances underlying the allegation in Count 2 are that defendant and M became involved in a violent argument regarding defendant\u2019s claim that M had been cheating on him with his friend, R, including an incident during which defendant pulled M\u2019s hair. Defendant told M that she had to leave, and M told defendant that he needed to leave. The argument \u201cwent on for hours.\u201d At some point in time, and after defendant had accused M of hiding objects in the bathroom, they went into the bathroom. Defendant, pointing to cut marks on the sink, accused M of cutting cocaine, an accusation that M denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Defendant then left the bathroom and went into the kitchen. Defendant grabbed a kitchen knife, placed it in M\u2019s hand, screamed at her, and urged her to kill him. M forced defendant to let go of her hand and fled to the living room in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>order to call the police. Before she could call 9-1-1, defendant pulled the phone cord from the wall. M then left the living room and went into C\u2019s room. As is evident from the above description, defendant\u2019s criminal objective during the above time period in the kitchen and the living room was to cause M to be in <em>fear </em>of imminent serious physical injury and was unrelated to C, who was not present in the kitchen or living room at the time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">After departing from the living room, M attempted to leave the house with C. There is no evidence that M desired or attempted to leave the residence before that point in time. When M entered C\u2019s bedroom, C climbed down from his bunk bed and embraced her. Defendant followed M into C\u2019s bedroom, stating to her that he was not doing anything to frighten C and accusing M of brainwashing C. The conduct for which defendant was convicted in Counts 4, 5, and 6 occurred thereafter in C\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">That conduct is described in the record by M\u2019s statements at defendant\u2019s stipulated facts trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201c[Defendant] then pulled [C] and I apart and started shaking me and threw me into a bookshelf. I then saw [C] flying to the ladder of his bunk bed and heard [C] groan. [Defendant] told him to stop acting like he had just hurt him, that he had not thrown him. [Defendant] then grabbed [C] and slammed his face first into the ladder and told him to get the fuck up on his bed and stay there. [C] was so scared he was saying Yes, sir; yes, sir.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201c[Defendant] then shoved me out of [C]\u2019s room and was holding the door shut. [Defendant] was telling [C], \u2018I love you son. [M] is brainwashing you.\u2019 I got back into the room and told [defendant] that it was not okay to bring this fight in front of [C]. [Defendant] said I had done that by trying to \u2014 leaving with [C].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Defendant then left C\u2019s bedroom, went back into C\u2019s room \u201cstill ranting,\u201d then went back to the living room and stated that he \u201cwas going to the store for cigarettes\u201d and that \u201c[C] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and I better not \u2014 better be here when he got back.\u201d Defendant then left the residence and did not return except to obtain a blanket so that he could sleep in a van.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">As the result of his conduct in C\u2019s bedroom, defendant was convicted of assaulting M in the presence of C (Count 4), assaulting C (Count 5), and recklessly endangering the welfare of C (Count 6), as well as misdemeanor assault in the fourth degree and menacing arising out of his conduct that occurred before M went into the bedroom. At sentencing, the trial court ruled that defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 and 2 arose out of the same criminal episode but that the conduct that occurred in C\u2019s bedroom constituted a separate criminal episode. That ruling resulted in an enhancement of defendant\u2019s criminal history score for purposes of sentencing on Count 4. In the majority\u2019s view, that ruling was error. Although it acknowledges that defendant formed a discrete criminal objective in the bedroom to prevent M and C from leaving the residence that he had not held previously, it characterizes that objective as a mere \u201cadditional objective\u201d that \u201cdoes not detract from the focus on the overarching criminal objective that is required under a proper application of the standard that the legislature established in ORS 131.505(4) to protect people against double jeopardy.\u201d 250 Or App at 325 n 6. The issue therefore is whether the majority has reached the correct legal conclusion based on the above facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In <em>State v. Bryant, </em>245 Or App 519, 263 P3d 368 (2011), this court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201c \u2018[A] defendant\u2019s criminal history score is used to calculate the sentence the court is to impose. OAR 213-004-0006. The score is determined by several factors, including the number and character of the offender\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>When multiple convictions occur in the same proceeding, ones occurring in an earlier criminal episode may be used to recalculate the defendant\u2019s criminal history score with respect to convictions stemming from a later criminal episode. <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 317, 855 P2d 1100 (1993); <em>State v. Allen, </em>151 Or App 281, 290-91, 948 P2d 745 (1997). In contrast, when a defendant\u2019s multiple convictions stem from the same criminal episode, his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>history score remains the same with respect to all of those convictions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 522 (quoting <em>State v. Norman, </em>216 Or App 475, 485-86, 174 P3d 598 (2007), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>345 Or 319, 207 P3d 423 (2008)) (emphasis omitted). As noted above, one circumstance that could determine whether there are multiple criminal episodes for purposes of OAR 213-004-0006 is whether the circumstances are so interrelated that a complete account of one offense cannot be related without relating the details of the others. <em>Bryant, </em>245 Or App at 523. If that test is applied, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The majority\u2019s alternative proposed test is rooted in former jeopardy principles as expressed in ORS 131.505(4). That statute provides that a criminal episode means \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that establishes at least one offense and is so joined in time, place and circumstance that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d Nothing in the language of the statute supports the understanding that an additionally acquired criminal objective that operates to either supplant or accompany an initial criminal objective will have the legal effect of prohibiting a separate conviction and/or sentence for the conduct that carries out that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Rather than being based on the language of ORS 131.505(4), the majority\u2019s \u201cadditional criminal objective\u201d rule appears to be derived from its interpretation of the holdings in <em>State v. Boyd, </em>271 Or 558, 533 P2d 795 (1975), and <em>State v. Kautz, </em>179 Or App 458, 39 P3d 937 (2002). It is therefore critical to the analysis that <em>Boyd </em>and <em>Kautz </em>be understood for what they hold and what they do not hold. In <em>Boyd, </em>the indictment against the defendant charging him with possession of controlled substances had been dismissed because of a prior unsuccessful prosecution of the defendant for theft arising from the possession of stolen property. On review, the Supreme Court held that the statutory bar in ORS 131.505(4) and the \u201csame act or transaction\u201d in permissive joinder statutes were synonymous. 271 Or at 565-66. The practical effect of that conclusion, according to the court, was that, whenever a prosecutor becomes aware of multiple charges facing a defendant, the prosecutor must make a determination about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>whether they arose out of the same criminal episode. In the case before it, the court held that, because the possession of the television set and the drugs existed at the same place and time, there existed only a single criminal episode, and therefore, the prior unsuccessful prosecution for theft barred the subsequent prosecution for possession of controlled substances. <em>Id. </em>at 570-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">As is evident from the above description, the majority\u2019s construct regarding the enhancement of a sentencing factor does not find support from the facts or the holding in <em>Boyd. </em>Rather, the majority relies on language in footnotes 4 and 5 of the opinion. Footnote 4 refers to the attempt by the court to clarify how the phrase \u201csame act or transaction\u201d as used in <em>State v. Brown, </em>262 Or 442, 497 P2d 1191 (1972),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the phrase \u201csame criminal episode\u201d found in ORS 131.505(4) relate to each other. <em>Boyd, </em>271 Or at 560. In footnote 4, the <em>Boyd </em>court states, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cThis finding of equivalence is dependent upon the meaning given \u2018circumstances\u2019 and \u2018directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective\u2019 in ORS 131.505(4). It is <em>possible </em>to construe these terms so narrowly that \u2018same criminal episode\u2019 would fail to include a wide range of cases which fall clearly within the intention of <em>Brown. </em>Even the facts of <em>Brown </em>itself might not fall within a narrow reading of ORS 131.505(4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">271 Or at 565 n 4 (emphasis in original). In footnote 5, the <em>Boyd </em>court states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u201cThis test, based upon the cross-relationships between the facts of each of the charges is not, however, broad enough to cover all factual situations where the double jeopardy principle would require joinder. It should be observed that the single episode definition in ORS 131.505(4) is formulated upon the hypothesis that the accused has engaged in conduct which involves a sequence of events that flow in a continuous and uninterrupted way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and that all of these events can be plotted on a plane of time, as where the accused is charged with killing a teller in the course of robbing a bank, or where a bank cashier makes a series of false reports to the commissioner of banking to conceal a series of thefts of money from the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cThe statute was not intended to deal with the situation where there is only <em>one act </em>which results in the commission of multiple crimes as where the accused kills two victims by firing one bullet or where (under prior Oregon law) the accused is charged with larceny and shoplifting for the same theft, or where, as in <em>State v. Brown, </em>the accused is charged with carrying a concealed weapon and with being a convict in possession of a concealable weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">271 Or at 566 n 5 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In <em>Kautz, </em>the issue was whether a burglary and a robbery committed by the defendant were part of the same criminal episode for purposes of determining whether the trial court was authorized to impose consecutive sentences for the crimes. The predicate to the imposition of consecutive sentences under the sentencing guidelines is whether the crimes were committed as part of the same criminal episode. While in the course of committing the burglary, the defendant grabbed a gun that he had stolen and pointed it at the property owner who had surprised him. Telling the property owner to \u201cback off!\u201d the defendant escaped by running through a hedge and disappearing into a nearby field. Observing that the <em>Boyd </em>court had held that a \u201ccriminal episode\u201d is synonymous with the phrase \u201csame act or transaction,\u201d and applying ORS 131.505(4) to the facts of the case, we utilized the test of whether the burglary and robbery were so joined in \u201ctime, place and circumstance that a complete account of each charge cannot be related without also relating the details of the other charge.\u201d <em>Kautz, </em>179 Or App at 466. Although the state argued that the defendant had dual criminal objectives \u2014 the objective of the burglary was to steal the victim\u2019s property and the objective of the robbery was to threaten the victim so that the defendant could escape \u2014 we rejected that argument. We explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cWhile [the] defendant may have acquired an additional criminal objective to escape when confronted by [the victim], his earlier objective to steal [the victim\u2019s] property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>continued during the course of all of the events. Because the facts underlying the robbery and burglary were so closely joined in time, place and circumstances as to show that [the] defendant continued to pursue the same criminal objective to deprive [the victim] of his property, we conclude that the trial court erred in concluding that the burglary and the robbery were separate criminal episodes.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 467 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">When correctly understood, neither ORS 131.505(4) nor the case law supports the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred by using the convictions for Counts 1 and 2 in enhancing the criminal risk history score for purposes of imposing a sentence on Count 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The established test under <em>Kautz </em>for determining whether the statute governs is whether the crimes committed are not so closely joined in time, place, and circumstance so that one could not be related without reference to the other. The majority concedes that the conduct underlying Counts 1 and 2 in this case could be related without reference to what occurred to M and to C in the bedroom. Moreover, what distinguishes this case from <em>Kautz </em>are the facts themselves. In <em>Kautz, </em>the defendant threatened the use of a weapon to facilitate or carry out the commission of his initial and sole crimina] objective. In this case, when defendant followed M into the bedroom and assaulted her, that assault was unrelated to the reasons underlying his earlier conduct. Rather, his objective in assaulting her was to prevent her from leaving with C, an objective that he had not previously held with regard to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>earlier menacing and assaultive conduct. Defendant\u2019s conduct may have been continuous and uninterrupted, but it was not directed at the accomplishment of a single criminal objective as the statute requires.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> The legal determination that convictions for crimes arise out of separate criminal episodes is based on a factual finding that the acts that give rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>convictions are not part of continuous and uninterrupted conduct that is so joined in time, place, and circumstance that it is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal episode. <em>State v. Yashin, </em>199 Or App 511, 514, 112 P3d 331, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 407 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> M had told C to go to his room when the argument between defendant and M began about 9:30 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant, an ex-convict, was arrested while carrying a concealed weapon. He was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and subsequently prosecuted for being a convicted person in possession of a firearm. The court held that because both charges were based on the single act of carrying the firearm, constitutional principles of double jeopardy barred the second prosecution. 262 Or at 443-44,458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> ORS 131.515(2) provides that \u201c[n]o person, shall be separately prosecuted for two or more offenses based upon the same criminal episode, if the several offenses are reasonably known * * * at the time of * * * the first prosecution * * In this case, the state complied with the provisions of ORS 131.515(2), and defendant correctly does not raise the issue of double jeopardy. It is correct that the definition of \u201ccriminal episode\u201d in ORS 131.505(4) applies to ORS 131.515(2) but, as to the issue before us, the statutory definition of \u201ccriminal episode\u201d plays a role only because it has been grafted into the sentencing case law. Because no constitutional provision or statute directly addresses the issue before us in terms of former or double jeopardy, the majority\u2019s belief that the trial court\u2019s ruling violated double jeopardy principles by enhancing defendant\u2019s sentence on Count 4 because of his convictions on Counts 1 and 2 is puzzling. Said another way, it is unclear why the majority believes that the legislature\u2019s test under ORS 131.505(4) for determining when a single criminal episode occurs is constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\"> Assume that a person breaks into a dwelling in order to steal its contents. While inside, the person decides to set the house on fire in order to cover up his burglary. For purposes of ORS 131.505(4), the burglary and the arson would be held to have arisen out of the same criminal episode. Assume, however, that the person, while inside the dwelling, decides that because of his dislike of the owner, he will set the house on fire. Under that scenario, he has acquired an additional criminal objective (his spite directed at the owner), an objective that would result in more than one criminal episode occurring under ORS 131.505(4). The point of the hypothetical is this: whether the \u201caccomplishment of a single criminal objective\u201d rule in ORS 131.505(4) controls the analysis depends on the reasons underlying the criminal conduct and not on whether there is an overarching criminal objective as the majority posits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
