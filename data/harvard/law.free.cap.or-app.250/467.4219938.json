On Count 1, the trial court imposed an upward dispositional departure sentence of six months in jail with 12 months\u2019 post-prison supervision on the basis of two enhancement <em>facts </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cprior sanctions not deterring [defendant\u2019s] conduct\u201d and \u201cthe harm was potentially much greater than is typical.\u201d On appeal, defendant contends that the court erred in imposing a departure sentence on Count 1 because the state failed to provide notice of the sentence-enhancement facts as required by ORS 136.765 (2009), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 267, \u00a7 1, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cIn order to rely on an enhancement fact to increase the sentence that may be imposed in a criminal proceeding, the state shall notify the defendant of its intention to rely on the enhancement fact by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201c(1) Pleading the enhancement fact in the accusatory instrument; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201c(2) Within a reasonable time after filing the accusatory instrument, providing written notice to the defendant of the enhancement fact and the state\u2019s intention to rely on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The state concedes that it failed to provide the required notice in this case. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
