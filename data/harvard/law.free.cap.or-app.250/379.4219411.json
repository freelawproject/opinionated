The convictions arose from a controlled buy in which defendant purported to sell two different firearms to a police informant. On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in failing to merge the guilty verdicts into a single conviction under ORS 161.067(3). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to be separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from other such violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">ORS 161.067(3). According to defendant, \u201cbecause [he] was charged under the same statutory provision for both counts, the state was the victim in both cases, and there was not a sufficient pause between possessing each gun, the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s request for merger of the guilty verdicts.\u201d In response, the state argues that the trial court correctly did not merge the verdicts because ORS 161.067(3) applies \u201conly if the crimes at issue involved a \u2018victim\u2019 who was a <em>person </em>and does not apply where, as here, the crimes are victimless crimes.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We recently rejected the state\u2019s argument in <em>State v. Torres, </em>249 Or App 571, 578, 277 P3d 641 (2012), in which we held that \u201cthe public is a single collective \u2018victim\u2019 of a violation of ORS 166.270 for purposes of merger under ORS 161.067(3).\u201d Thus, to be separately punishable under ORS 161.067(3), each of defendant\u2019s crimes \u2014 that is, each \u201cpossession,\u201d must have been separated from the others \u201cby a sufficient pause * * * to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d The state does not contend that the record would support a finding of a sufficient pause in defendant\u2019s possession of the two firearms, nor is there evidence in the record to support such a finding. Accordingly, the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>failing to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts on the felon in possession charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could reach a nonunanimous verdict and in accepting the jury\u2019s nonunanimous verdict. We reject those arguments without discussion. <em>See State v. Cobb, </em>224 Or App 594, 596-97, 198 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009); <em>State v.
