J.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for giving false information to a police officer, ORS 162.385(l)(b), arguing that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal because no rational trier of fact could have found that the officer to whom she lied about her identity had asked for her name for the purpose of arresting her on a warrant. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Because defendant was convicted by a jury, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Officer Abies stopped defendant for riding her bicycle without a light. When Abies asked defendant her name, defendant replied \u201cKelly M. Dowling\u201d and gave him a date of birth. Abies returned to his police car to run the name through his computer \u201cfor the purpose of issuing a citation and also to check for warrants.\u201d By so doing, Abies learned that there was an \u201caka\u201d for the name \u201cKelly M. Dowling\u201d with the date of birth that defendant had given him. That name was \u201cLynette Moresco,\u201d and the computer indicated there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest. Abies walked back to defendant and asked if her name was Lynette. Defendant said yes. Abies informed defendant that there was a warrant for her arrest, and defendant responded, \u201cI know, that\u2019s why I lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">At the close of the evidentiary portion of the trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201c[t]his is charged as giving false information to a police officer for an arrest warrant. And at the time he asked for her name, he had specifically stopped her for a violation, a traffic violation. So when he asked her for the name and when she gave him a false name it was because he was investigating a traffic citation not \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any knowledge of the warrant at the time that he asked her for her name the first time and that\u2019s when arguably a false name could have been given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and she was convicted by the jury. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>State v. Allen, </em>222 Or App 71, 77, 191 P3d 762, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008). Under <em>Allen, </em>defendant contends, for a person to violate ORS 162.385(1)(b) by giving a false identification to a police officer, the officer must have asked for the person\u2019s identification for the purpose of arresting her on a warrant. The evidence in this case, defendant argues, unequivocally showed that Abies was not aware of the warrant until <em>after </em>defendant had given him the false name. It follows, defendant concludes, that Ables\u2019s request for defendant\u2019s identification could not have been made for the purpose of arresting her on a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The state agrees with defendant\u2019s reading of <em>Allen, </em>but contends that the evidence in this record was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Abies had asked for defendant\u2019s identification \u201c[f]or a dual purpose. The officer testified that he requested her name \u2018[flor the purpose of issuing a citation and also to check for warrants.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, the state reasons, \u201ca rational trier of fact could infer that defendant knew the officer intended to both run a check for warrants and arrest her on a warrant if one was outstanding.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">ORS 162.385(l)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of giving false information to a peace officer for issuance or service of a citation or for an arrest on a warrant if the person knowingly uses or gives a false or fictitious name, address or date of birth to any peace officer for the purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201c(b) The officer\u2019s arresting the person on a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">As we explained in <em>Allen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">\u201cTo demonstrate that a defendant violated ORS 162.385, the state must show (1) that \u2018the person knowingly uses or gives a false or fictitious name, address or date of birth to any peace officer\u2019 and (2) that the officer asked for that information for the purpose of \u2018issuing or serving the person a citation\u2019 or \u2018arresting the person on a warrant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">222 Or App at 77. Here, it is undisputed that Abies was not aware of the warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest when he asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>for her identification; thus, Ables\u2019s request for defendant\u2019s identification could not have been \u201cfor the purpose of * * * arresting [defendant] on a warrant.\u201d ORS 162.385(l)(b). That <em>defendant </em>was aware of the warrant and that, based on that awareness, she chose to lie to Abies, is not sufficient to prove that <em>Abies </em>asked for her identification for the purpose of arresting her on the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The state\u2019s reliance on Ables\u2019s testimony that he requested defendant\u2019s identification \u201cfor the purpose of issuing a citation and also to check for warrants\u201d is misplaced: ORS 162.385(l)(b) requires that an officer request the defendant\u2019s identification for the purpose of <em>arresting </em>the defendant on a warrant, not merely for the purpose of ascertaining whether a warrant exists.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the evidence in the record was insufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find that Abies requested defendant\u2019s identification \u201cfor the purpose of * * * arresting [her] on [the] warrant,\u201d the trial court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> The state did not charge defendant with violating ORS 162.385(1)(a), which proscribes \u201cgiving a false or fictitious name * * * to any peace officer for the purpose of* * * issuing or serving the person a citation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
