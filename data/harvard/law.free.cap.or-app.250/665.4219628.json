Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony of two police detectives concerning statements that defendant made to them through police interpreters. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of other evidence in the face of a different hearsay objection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Defendant was arrested by police after he was identified as the shooter in a drive-by murder. While in custody, defendant was interviewed on separate occasions by Detectives Remilly and Boyce. Because defendant primarily spoke Spanish and Remilly and Boyce did not speak Spanish, the detectives conducted their interviews with the assistance of two police interpreters. Officer Diaz interpreted for Remilly, and Officer Byers performed that function for Boyce. At trial, the state indicated its intent to offer statements that defendant made during the police interviews. In response, defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the interpreted statements as \u201cdouble hearsay.\u201d Defendant relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>345 Or 39, 188 P3d 268 (2008), as requiring exclusion of the interpreters\u2019 statements to the detectives, but he conceded that his statements to the interpreters were admissible as statements by a party-opponent. The prosecutor responded that <em>Rodriguez-Castillo </em>authorized admission of defendant\u2019s statements under the residual hearsay exception set out in OEC 803(28). The trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201cOkay. Well, I will take a look at the statute \u2014 I mean at the cases, but <em>assuming that the state lays the proper foundation, </em>I\u2019m going to allow the testimony as an exception to the hearsay exclusion. I <em>will allow </em>you to make the objection, and the objection will be a standing objection so that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>don\u2019t have to make it and reiterate it for each witness and for each statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">After the trial court made that ruling, the prosecutor called Officer Diaz as a witness. Diaz testified that he was certified through the City of Salem to act as an interpreter for Spanish speakers. He also testified that Spanish was his first language, that he grew up in a household with Spanish-speaking parents, and that he primarily communicated with his parents in Spanish. Diaz testified that, when he assisted Remilly in conducting defendant\u2019s interview, he and defendant were able to communicate effectively with each other. Diaz explained that he interpreted \u201cword for word,\u201d that he had no communication problems during the interview, and that he translated everything accurately. Remilly then testified about the content of defendant\u2019s translated statements during the interview. Defendant did not object to Diaz\u2019s or Remily\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s statements on hearsay or other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">After Remilly testified, the prosecutor called Byers as a witness. Byers testified that he was fluent in Spanish; he had lived in Peru between 1979 and 1982 while on a church mission, and he also had taken Spanish classes at college. He further testified that he had spoken Spanish in his police work for the past 20 years, that he frequently had served as a Spanish language interpreter in his employment, that for the past seven years he had owned a local business with partners who only spoke Spanish, and that he had spoken Spanish every day for the past 20 years. Byers testified that he was able to communicate effectively with defendant during the interview with Boyce. Byers understood defendant\u2019s words but, at times during the interview, he had difficulty understanding what defendant was saying in relation to Boyce\u2019s questions. That difficulty, Byers explained, arose because he was unfamiliar with the underlying facts of the case, and defendant\u2019s answers sometimes were not responsive to Boyce\u2019s questions. Instead, defendant sometimes would add or change facts during his answers to the questions. When that occurred, Byers would clarify defendant\u2019s responses before translating them to Boyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>After Byers testified, the state called Boyce to testify about defendant\u2019s statements to him. Defendant objected to Boyce\u2019s testimony on hearsay grounds. In particular, defendant challenged the adequacy of the foundation for Byers\u2019 translation of defendant\u2019s statements to Boyce. Defense counsel stated, \u201cI do not believe, based upon his testimony and his qualifications, that his translation satisfies the rule as announced\u201d in <em>Rodr\u00edguez-Castillo. </em>According to defendant, the foundation for Byers\u2019s translation was not \u201csufficiently guaranteed to qualify for an admission under the residual exception to the hearsay rule[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201cI did pay careful attention to the qualification identified by witness Byers for his \u2014 both his fluency in Spanish and also his ability to interpret accurately. * * * I find that what the witness testified that he did is consistent with the set of cognitive skills that an interpreter is required to have for purposes of translation. I know there was \u2014 there was questioning of him in terms of whether he does exact word for word, but in looking at what the criteria is for the cognitive skills, it says they have to listen to what\u2019s said, comprehend it, abstract the entire message from the words and the word order, store the idea, search his memory for conceptual and semantic matches, and reconstruct the message, keeping the same register or level of difficulty as in the source language, and that\u2019s essentially what the witness testified that he did; that he conveyed always what the \u2014 what the defendant was telling him so that it was consistent with the intent, meaning of the original statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cSo I don\u2019t find grounds to exclude the testimony of the next witness [Detective Boyce]. Certainly you may cross-examine that witness in terms of how he used the interpreter and your objection can be restated. But based on the interpreter\u2019s testimony, I don\u2019t find the interpretation to have been outside the trustworthiness of the exception provided by subsection 28.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling, Boyce then testified with respect to defendant\u2019s translated statements to him. The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>On appeal, defendant separately assigns error to Remilly\u2019s testimony with respect to the statements that Diaz translated and Boyce\u2019s testimony with respect to the statements that Byers translated. The state initially asserts that defendant failed to adequately preserve a hearsay objection to Remilly\u2019s testimony. We agree. The trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was conditional: if the state laid a proper foundation for the detectives\u2019 testimony, the court indicated that it would admit the translated statements under OEC 803(28). However, that ruling required defendant, if dissatisfied with the foundation that was laid, to renew his objection. Because defendant failed to renew his objection to either Diaz\u2019s or Remilly\u2019s testimony after the state laid a foundation for the translated statements, his assignment of error to Remilly\u2019s testimony is unpreserved. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (party must provide trial court with explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to afford court opportunity to analyze any alleged error).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s assignment of error concerning the admission of Boyce\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s translated statements. As noted, defendant did adequately preserve his hearsay objection to that testimony. Defendant concedes that, if offered without translation, his statements were admissible under OEC 801(4)(b)(A), which provides that a \u201cparty\u2019s own statements\u201d are not hearsay. However, defendant urges that the translation of his statements by Byers added a hearsay layer to Boyce\u2019s testimony and that Byers\u2019s translation lacked sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to qualify for admission under the residual hearsay exception in OEC 803(28).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d OEC 801(3). Hearsay is inadmissible unless if falls within one of the exceptions set out in OEC 801 to 806 or as \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d OEC 802. An out-of-court translation of a non-English speaker\u2019s statements to a third party constitutes hearsay because the interpreter\u2019s translation constitutes an assertion of the English meaning of the original statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>See Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>345 Or at 41. OEC 803(28)(a), the so-called residual exception to the hearsay rule, authorizes the admission of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">\u201c[a] statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201c(A) The statement is relevant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201c(B) The statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201c(C) The general purposes of the Oregon Evidence Code and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In <em>Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>the victim primarily spoke Spanish, and the detective spoke only English. To facilitate their communication, a bilingual middle school tutor served as an interpreter. 345 Or at 41. During the detective\u2019s interview with the victim, the victim told the tutor that the defendant had sexually abused her. <em>Id. </em>at 42. The tutor then translated the statements into English and repeated them to the detective, who repeated them to the jury for the truth of the matter asserted. The court observed that the victim\u2019s statements that the defendant had abused her would have been admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b) if she had made them to the detective, and if he had been able to testify to them without the tutor\u2019s facilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 48. However, because the victim told the tutor what happened, and the tutor relayed the victim\u2019s statements to the detective, the trial court concluded that the tutor\u2019s statements to the detective added a layer of hearsay that was admissible only if the tutor\u2019s out-of-court statements qualified for admission under an exception to the rule against hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">On appeal, the state argued for the first time that the detective\u2019s statements were admissible under the residual hearsay exception in OEC 803(28). <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. However, the court held that, because the state did not rely on the residual hearsay exception in the trial court, the record was inadequate to allow the court to rule on the admissibility of the statements under OEC 803(28). <em>Id. </em>at 50. In so holding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the court quoted from Mueller and Kirkpatrick\u2019s <em>Federal Evidence:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\">\u201c \u2018Because of the notice requirement, and because it is peculiarly important in the case of the [residual] exception that the judge consider the evidence and apply the exceptions in the first instance, resort to this provision for the first time on appeal as the basis for challenging or supporting rulings below is inappropriate.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting 5 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 8:140 at 272). The court further concluded that the admission of the detective\u2019s testimony was not harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Accordingly, the court reversed an earlier decision by this court, <em>State v. RodriguezCastillo, </em>210 Or App 479, 151 P3d 931 (2007), which had held that the challenged evidence was admissible under OEC 803(28).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Because the Supreme Court declined to address the merits of the applicability of OEC 803(28) in <em>Rodr\u00edguez-Castillo, </em>it is useful to consider this court\u2019s analysis of the issue in that case as we address the parties\u2019 parallel arguments in this case. As pertinent here, the Supreme Court described this court\u2019s analysis under OEC 803(28) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cThe lead opinion assumed that [the tutor\u2019s] repetition of the victim\u2019s statements to the detective added another layer of hearsay, and it concluded that [the tutor\u2019s] statements were not admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b), as the trial court appears to have ruled. <em>Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>210 Or App at 489. However, a majority of the court concluded that [the tutor\u2019s] statements were admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule, OEC 803(28) \u2014 an exception that neither the state had argued before the trial court nor that the trial court had considered. <em>See id. </em>at 496 (lead opinion) (upholding the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on that ground); <em>id. </em>at 513, (Edmonds, J., concurring). We allowed defendant\u2019s petition for review to consider the evidentiary issue that divided the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cThe lead opinion concluded that the statements were trustworthy based on evidence that it gleaned from various parts of the trial record. It noted that [the tutor] explained that he spoke Spanish \u2018quite well,\u2019 that [he] works as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>bilingual middle school tutor, and that the victim\u2019s trial testimony was consistent with the detective\u2019s recitation other out-of-court, translated statements. [.Rodriguez-Castillo,] 210 Or App at 494. The dissenting opinions reasoned that the ability to speak a second language is quite different from the ability to serve as an interpreter, that there was no evidence that [the tutor] was a qualified interpreter, nor was there any evidence that he had employed one of two accepted methods of interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 528-30 (Brewer, C. J., dissenting). Rather, as the dissenting opinions reasoned, \u2018[i]t is possible that [the tutor] summarized or paraphrased the victim\u2019s statements instead. When asked whether he had accurately translated the conversation, [the tutor] responded only, \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, as far as I \u2014 -as far as I know.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 530.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>345 Or at 44-45, 50-51. (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Interpreting requires a special set of cognitive skills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cAn interpreter must listen to what is being said, comprehend the message, abstract the entire message from the words and the word order, store the idea, search his or her memory for the conceptual and semantic matches, and reconstruct the message (keeping the same register or level of difficulty as in the source language). While doing this, the interpreter is speaking and listening for the next utterance of the language to process, while monitoring his or her own output.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Cathy Rhodes, <em>Court Certification, </em>1 Access to Justice Journal 1, 2 (Summer 1999). Professional interpreters commonly use one of two interpretative methods: simultaneous or consecutive. In simultaneous interpretation, the speaker does not stop or pause, but continues to talk without interruption. The interpreter therefore conveys a virtually simultaneous interpretation of the words while the speaker is still talking. <em>See Oregon Judges Criminal Benchbook </em>1014 (2005). In consecutive interpretation, the interpreter transfers the questions asked of the non-English-speaking person from English into the person\u2019s primary language after each question is asked and, then, interprets the person\u2019s response into English after the person responds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In <em>Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>there was no evidence of the tutor\u2019s competence in performing interpretive functions. 210 Or App at 529 (Brewer, C. J., dissenting). He did not indicate that he had any training or experience in that area, or even that he understood what was expected of him in the role of interpreter. <em>Id. </em>The record also did not disclose the method that the tutor used to interpret the victim\u2019s statements; in fact, it was possible that he had merely summarized or paraphrased the victim\u2019s statements. <em>Id. </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Here, in contrast, the state created a markedly superior foundational record for the admission of the translation of defendant\u2019s statements. Byers testified that he was a fluent Spanish speaker. He spoke the language every day and had done so for 20 years. He received a pay differential from his employer for his Spanish language skills, and he frequently served as an interpreter. With respect to his translation of defendant\u2019s statements to Boyce, the difficulties that Byers experienced were not translational; rather, they were the result of defendant\u2019s nonresponsive and sometimes self-contradicting statements. Byers testified that defendant had said that \u201che understood what [Byers] was saying,\u201d that the two were able to \u201ccommunicate effectively,\u201d that Byers \u201cunderstood everything [defendant] said,\u201d and that Byers had \u201crelay[ed] exactly the meaning of what defendant [was] saying to Detective Boyce.\u201d Because of word arrangement differences between Spanish and English, Byers did not perform a word-for-word translation of defendant\u2019s statements. However, he clarified and repeated questions and answers when speaking to defendant so that, in translation, he made sure that the \u201cactual meaning\u201d of defendant\u2019s statements was communicated to Boyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We conclude that the proffered foundation satisfied the requirements of OEC 803(28).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s own statements regarding his connection with the murder and the events precipitating it were highly relevant, and his own words \u2014 if translated accurately \u2014 were more probative than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>any other evidence that reasonably could be obtained. The foregoing evidence demonstrates that Byers was fluent in Spanish and that he frequently acted as an interpreter. The evidence also established that, in this case, Byers utilized a consecutive translation method in which he listened to what defendant said, understood the meaning of his statements, discerned the entire meaning from the words and the word order, absorbed it, searched his memory for the conceptual and semantic matches, and reconstructed the message with the same meaning as in the source language, without additions or omissions. It follows that the reliability and trustworthiness of Byers\u2019s translation of defendant\u2019s statements served the general purposes of the Oregon Evidence Code in that admission of the translated statements was not qualitatively different from admission of defendant\u2019s own direct statements. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the challenged translation of defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> We reject the latter assignment of error without discussion, except to note that it is unpreserved. Although defendant initially lodged a hearsay objection to the challenged line of testimony, after the prosecutor laid an additional foundation, defendant failed to further object when the prosecutor proceeded to elicit the identical testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s unpreserved contention that the evidence did not qualify for admission under OEC 803(28) on the ground that the translated statements <em>may have been </em>\u201ccovered by\u201d another hearsay exception, OEC 801(4)(b)(D), as an agent\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
