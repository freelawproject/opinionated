J.</author>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In this proceeding pursuant to ORS 183.400,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitioner asserts, in his first assignment of error, that a notice-of-rights form used by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board) constitutes a \u201crule\u201d for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act (the APA), ORS chapter 183, and is therefore invalid because it was adopted without compliance with the applicable rulemaking procedures. ORS 183.400(4)(c). Petitioner further, and alternatively, asserts that the notice-of-rights form violates the federal and Oregon constitutions and contravenes statutory authority. ORS 183.400(4)(a), (b). We agree with petitioner that the form is invalid under ORS 183.400(4)(c); therefore, we need not reach his other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The notice-of-rights form at issue in this case is one component of a three-document packet, dated September 21, 2009 (the hearing notice packet). The first document has a block at the top entitled \u201cHEARING NOTICE &amp; NOTICE OF RIGHTS PACKET.\u201d The block contains \u201cfill-in-the blank\u201d spaces for identifying the inmate, hearing date, hearing location, and type of hearing. The next section of the document is titled \u201cHEARING TYPES,\u201d followed by a list of 10 different categories of hearings, each identified by code\u2014 for example, administrative review is listed and identified by the code \u201cAR\u201d; aggravated murder review is identified by the code \u201cMR.\u201d Finally, the document contains some general information under a heading \u201cBE PREPARED\u201d and a statement that copies of the board\u2019s administrative rules are available in the inmate legal library.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The second document in the hearings packet consists of definitions of the 10 hearing types listed on the first document.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The third document \u2014 entitled \u201cINMATES\u2019 RIGHTS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\u201d \u2014 is the notice-of-rights form that petitioner challenges here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the title indicates, the form describes, in separately captioned sections covering four pages, various aspects of the practices and procedures followed in hearings before the board. Specifically, the sections are entitled, \u201cLaw that Applies,\u201d \u201cRight to an Attorney,\u201d \u201cWho May Attend the Hearing,\u201d \u201cInformation Considered at the Hearing,\u201d \u201cPresiding Officer,\u201d \u201cNotice and Waiver,\u201d \u201cRefusal,\u201d \u201cHearing Procedure,\u201d \u201cDepending on the purpose of the hearing,\u201d \u201cContinuances,\u201d \u201cDecision,\u201d \u201cRecord,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative Reviews and Appeals.\u201d (Boldface and underscoring omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On judicial review, petitioner contends that the notice-of-rights form is a \u201crule,\u201d as defined in ORS 183.310(9), and, therefore, it is invalid because it was not promulgated according to the rulemaking procedures of the APA. <em>See </em>ORS 183.325 - 183.410 (setting out those procedures). ORS 183.310(9) defines \u201crule,\u201d in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201c \u2018Rule\u2019 means any agency directive, standard, regulation or statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the procedure or practice requirements of any agency. The term includes the amendment or repeal of a prior rule[.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>In petitioner\u2019s view, the notice-of-rights form satisfies that definition because it is a \u201cstatement of general applicability for all persons appearing before [the board] in contested case type proceedings\u201d and it \u201csets out the procedure and practice requirements\u201d for those hearings. The board, on the other hand, contends that the form is a statement of <em>\u201c'specific </em>applicability\u201d and, therefore, not a rule under ORS 183.310(9). (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In support of its argument that the notice-of-rights form is of specific, rather than general, applicability, the board relies on the fact that the first document in the hearing notice packet \u2014 of which, as noted, the form is a part\u2014 includes a blank space for the board to insert the name of the inmate who is to receive the notice. In the board\u2019s view, the form thus operates like an \u201corder\u201d; therefore, it cannot be a \u201crule.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Portland Inn v. OTC, </em>39 Or App 749, 752, 593 P2d 1233 (1979) (\u201c[A]n agency action cannot be both an \u2018order\u2019 and a \u2018rule,\u2019 and * * * a party cannot follow the APA\u2019s procedures for review of a quasi-judicial act if the act is in fact legislative.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, the board argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201cWithout a named individual in the notice, the hearing notice and notice-of-rights packet has no utility, force, or effect \u2014 and certainly no statement about the general practices and procedures of the board. The packet thus operates like an \u2018order\u2019 \u2014 and not a \u2018rule\u2019 for purposes of ORS 183.310.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We are not persuaded. ORS 183.310(6)(a) defines \u201corder,\u201d in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201c \u2018Order\u2019 means any agency action expressed orally or in writing directed to a named person or named persons, other than employees, officers or members of an agency. \u2018Order\u2019 includes any agency determination or decision issued in connection with a contested case proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Here, although the first page of the hearing notice packet is <em>addressed </em>to a\u2018particular inmate \u2014 identifying who is to receive the notice and providing logistical information, such as the hearing date, location, and type of hearing \u2014 the <em>content </em>of the form itself is generalized and applicable to all inmates in a particular category or class of hearings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, the actual content of the notice-of-rights form is identical with respect to all hearings to which it applies\u2014 regardless of the name appearing on the first page. Thus, we do not understand the notice-of-rights form to be \u201cagency action * * * directed to a named person.\u201d ORS 183.310(6)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">That conclusion is supported by our case law, including our recent decision in <em>Homestyle Direct, LLC v. DHS, </em>245 Or App 598, 263 P3d 1118 (2011). In that case, the Department of Human Services (DHS) had promulgated nutritional standards for its home-delivery meal program and incorporated those standards into each of its agreements with providers. We concluded (and DHS did not dispute) that the nutritional standards constituted a \u201crule\u201d for purposes of the APA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cThe nutritional standards are generally applicable requirements for obtaining a provider number, and they describe when DHS can issue such a number. Thus, DHS should not have circumvented the unambiguous requirement to promulgate rules according to the APA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 602. We further held that DHS could not enforce those \u201cunpromulgated standards by putting them in the provider agreement and then enforcing the rule that allows sanctions for noncompliance with that agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. In short, the standards constituted a rule for the purposes of the APA, <em>notwithstanding </em>that they were incorporated into individualized provider agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In <em>Pen-Nor, Inc. v. Oregon Dept. Higher </em>Ed., 84 Or App 502, 734 P2d 395 (1987), by contrast, we concluded that the challenged agency action did not constitute a rule. There, the petitioner contended that a state agency had adopted a \u201crule\u201d to the effect that a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to meet minority business enterprise goals did not require negotiating with certified minority business enterprises (MBEs), after the petitioner, an MBE, was not selected as a subcontractor on a project. <em>Id. </em>at 504. We concluded that the agency action was not a rule because it was directed to one specific entity, the prime contractor, and, \u201cif a policy decision occurred[,] it pertained only to that immediate set of facts\u201d; thus, it was not of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d under the statutory definition of the term \u201crule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508. Here, the notice-of-rights form plainly affects more than one person and encompasses more than an \u201cimmediate set of facts\u201d; the form is applicable, without differentiation, to all inmates in a particular category of hearing before the board. <em>See also Amazon Coop. Tenants v. State Bd. High. Ed., </em>15 Or App 418, 420, 516 P2d 89 (1973) (\u201cAn administrative act regulating rentals of tenants is clearly a quasi-legislative one of \u2018general applicability,\u2019 rather than a quasi-judicial act adjusting the rights or privileges of a named person or persons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The board does not dispute \u2014 nor could it \u2014 that the form \u201cdescribes the procedure or practice requirements\u201d of the agency. ORS 183.310(9). It is essentially labeled as such and explains the board\u2019s hearing procedures and requirements. <em>Cf. Kessler v. OSCI, </em>26 Or App 271, 274, 552 P2d 589 (1976), <em>overruled on other grounds by Rutherford v. OSP, </em>39 Or App 431, 592 P2d 1028 (1979) (agency\u2019s procedures for interstate transfer of inmates, which set out certain rights reserved to inmates, such as notice and hearing procedures, was a rule rather than an internal directive).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the notice-of-rights form is a rule within the meaning of ORS 183.310(9); consequently, the board was required to follow the rulemaking procedures of the APA in adopting it. The board does not dispute that it failed to do so. Accordingly, the form is invalid. ORS 183.400(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Rule held invalid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> ORS 183.400 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201c(1) The validity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases. ** * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201c(4) The court shall declare the rule invalid only if it finds that the rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVN\">\u201c(a) Violates constitutional provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">\u201c(b) Exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">\u201c(c) Was adopted without compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> In particular, petitioner focuses on the following emphasized statements that appear in the form under the heading \u201cInformation Considered at the Hearing\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\"><em>\u201cDiscovery is not permitted. </em>Requests that the Board research and obtain information you want considered cannot he honored. It is your responsibility to provide that information. <em>You do not have the right to call witnesses or to cross-examine witnesses who have provided information to the Board.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">(Footnote and boldface omitted; underscoring in original; emphasis added.) Petitioner contends that nothing in the board\u2019s formally adopted administrative rules indicates that a party to a hoard hearing \u201cdoes not have the right to discovery of evidence the agency intends to rely upon at the hearing\u201d or \u201cthe right, in appropriate circumstances, to call witnesses or pose questions to witnesses appearing at hearings before the agency.\u201d Petitioner also contends that those statements are contrary to statute and case law. Because, as explained below, we conclude that the form is an invalid rule under ORS 183.400(4)(c), we need not address those arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> ORS 183.310(9) goes on to describe what is <em>not </em>a \u201crule\u201d; none of those exclusions applies here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> In a previously filed motion to dismiss, the board argued that, because the form simply explains various aspects of the hearing process, each of which are \u201cthe subject of separate, validly promulgated rules,\u201d it is not a rule under the principle established in <em>Burke v. Public Welfare Div., </em>31 Or App 161, 165, 570 P2d 87 (1977) (\u201c[A]n agency\u2019s pronouncement of how a validly promulgated rule operates in a specific context need not itself be promulgated as a rule if the existing rule necessarily requires the result set forth in that pronouncement.\u201d). The motion was denied, as was the board\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that denial, and the board does not renew that argument on judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Although ORS 183.310 has been amended and renumbered several times since <em>Portland Inn </em>was decided, for purposes of our analysis here, the relevant parts of the definitions of \u201crule\u201d and \u201corder\u201d have remained substantively unchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> It is not clear in which categories of hoard hearings the notice is used. As noted, the hearing notice packet itself indicates that it is applicable in 10 different types of board hearings, including murder review hearings. However, in connection with its motion to reconsider the denial of its motion to dismiss the petition, the board submitted an affidavit averring that the notice is used in all board hearings <em>except </em>murder review hearings. Then, in its brief on review, the board attempts to \u201cclarify\u201d when the notice might be used and explains that \u201cstatutes and board rules provide for <em>additional and other </em>notice-of-rights forms for many of [the] 10 types of board hearings\u201d listed on the packet. (Emphasis added.) Ultimately, that discrepancy is immaterial to our analysis and conclusion here \u2014 that is so because there is no dispute that the notice is used for some <em>categories </em>of hearings; in other words, there is no suggestion by the board that a notice-of-rights form is individually created for each inmate appearing before the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
