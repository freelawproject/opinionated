Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in admitting testimony of a police officer concerning statements that defendant made to the officer through interpreters. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s ranking at sentencing of his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder as a level 11 offense under the sentencing guidelines based on what he asserts were aggravating factors that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Shortly after a fatal drive-by shooting, a surviving witness identified Adrian Montoya-Franco as the shooter. A couple of days later, police stopped a car that defendant was driving, in which Montoya-Franco and another man were passengers. The police detained the three men for questioning about the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Detective Tallan, the lead police investigator, interviewed defendant at the police station. Tallan, who understands little Spanish, conducted the interview with the assistance of two interpreters, Detectives Bethers and Diaz. During the interview, defendant made a number of admissions about his role in the effort to track down and kill the victim, including an earlier, unsuccessful, effort to commit the murder. At trial, Diaz testified that he is a native Spanish speaker who acts as a police interpreter. He testified that he and defendant were able to understand each other, that he interpreted defendant\u2019s statements word for word, that Tallan took down specific quotes from defendant\u2019s translated responses, that Diaz later read Tallan\u2019s written report, and that the report was accurate. Bethers, also a police detective, translated different portions of Tallan\u2019s interview with defendant. Bethers is not a fluent Spanish speaker, but he testified that he had conversational ability to speak and understand Spanish and that he used Spanish skills daily in his job. Bethers did not take notes of Tallan\u2019s interview with defendant, but Tallan took notes. Bethers later reviewed those notes and determined that they were accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">At trial, after Diaz and Bethers had testified, the prosecutor called Tallan as a witness. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u201c[PROSECUTOR] Detective Tallan, were you able to get some sort of background information from the defendant about other people involved in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\u201cQ. Did you specifically talk to him about different vehicles that people owned or used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201cQ. What did he \u2014 did he indicate what type of vehicle he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Objection, Your Honor; hearsay. It violates my client\u2019s right of confrontation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The court did not immediately rule on the objection. Instead, the prosecutor attempted to lay a foundation by eliciting testimony from Tallan that defendant had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that defendant had signed a <em>Miranda </em>advice card, a consent to search card, and another <em>Miranda </em>advice card later that night during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">At that point, the prosecutor resumed questioning Tallan about defendant\u2019s statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">\u201cQ. Detective Tallan, let\u2019s then go back to what [defendant] was indicating to you what vehicles people drove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Objection, Your Honor; it\u2019s still hearsay and it still violates my client\u2019s right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR] Your Honor, it is not hearsay in any form of the word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Both grounds, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Both grounds are overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL] May I have a continuing objection to any statements my client \u2014 he is relating about my client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: You may.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">On cross examination, Tallan testified that portions of his interview with defendant were conducted in English, not Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The jury convicted defendant of both charged offenses. At sentencing, over defendant\u2019s objection that he was entitled to a jury determination if the court were to impose a sentence in excess of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment, the trial court ranked defendant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit murder (an unranked offense under the sentencing guidelines) at the same crime seriousness level as a completed murder. Without submitting any sentencing issue for the jury\u2019s determination, the court then imposed a 128-month presumptive prison sentence on the conspiracy to commit murder conviction under the sentencing guidelines. Defendant appeals, assigning error to both the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The parties advance and parry with numerous arguments on appeal with respect to the challenged evidentiary ruling. In a nutshell, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his hearsay objection<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that, in order to answer the posited question, Tallan was required to recount one of the two police interpreters\u2019 translated accounts of defendant\u2019s underlying statement. The admission of such testimony, in defendant\u2019s view, ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>345 Or 39, 48, 188 P3d 268 (2008), that an interpreter\u2019s account of a witness\u2019s out-of-court statement is required\u2014 independently of the underlying statement \u2014 to pass separate muster under the hearsay rule. The state responds that (1) defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is not preserved; (2) even if preserved, it is not well taken because the interpreters acted as defendant\u2019s agents for purposes of translating his statements and, therefore, the interpreters\u2019 statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>not hearsay under OEC 801(4)(b)(C) or (D);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) even if the trial court erred, admission of the evidence was harmless because it was unlikely to have affected the verdicts. Because we conclude that defendant did not adequately preserve the argument that he makes on appeal, we need not consider the state\u2019s alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">To preserve an issue for appeal, a party\u2019s explanation of its position must be \u201cspecific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). One of the primary purposes of preservation is to ensure that the opposing party is not surprised, misled, or denied the opportunity to meet the argument in the trial court. <em>State v. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or 631, 640, 136 P3d 22 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Defendant concedes that, if offered without translation, his statements were admissible under OEC 801(4)(b)(A), which provides that a \u201cparty\u2019s own statements\u201d are not hearsay. Therefore, as defendant acknowledges on appeal, the only cognizable hearsay objection that he could have made, based on <em>Rodr\u00edguez-Castillo, </em>would have been to any translation of his statement that underlay Tallan\u2019s testimony. The difficulties with that proposition, on this record, are intractable. First of all, no such objection was made to the trial court in any coherent way. In making his objection, defendant did not refer to any translation of his statement, and it is apparent that the prosecutor did not understand defense counsel to be making such a reference. When the objection was initially made, the prosecutor responded by laying a foundation for Tallan\u2019s testimony based on the officers\u2019 extensive provision of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. From that response, it appears that the prosecutor understood defendant to argue that his statement was hearsay because, on account of a constitutional infirmity, it failed to qualify as an admissible statement of a party under OEC 801(4)(b). When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>defendant renewed his hearsay objection after that foundation was laid, the prosecutor replied that the statement was not hearsay \u201cin any form of the word.\u201d Because defendant did not elaborate on his objection with any cogent explication, the prosecutor and the trial court had no reason to doubt that defendant was making a <em>pro forma </em>\u2014 and mistaken \u2014 hearsay objection to a statement that, in light of OEC 801(4)(b), was patently nonhearsay. Thus, rather than attempt to lay a foundation for the admission of any translated statement under an agency theory (which is the theory of admissibility that the state espouses on appeal), the prosecutor took a different foundational tack \u2014 that is, to establish the voluntariness of <em>defendant\u2019s own </em>statements \u2014 which has no bearing on the layered hearsay argument that defendant elaborates for the first time on appeal. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (explaining that preservation allows a trial court to avoid or correct its own error, ensures fairness to an opposing party, and fosters full development of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">To reinforce the point, even though Tallan and the two police interpreters had previously testified that Tallan had interviewed defendant with the assistance of the interpreters, the question to which defense counsel objected did not expressly call for a hearsay response. Instead, the prosecutor asked Tallan to recount what defendant \u201cwas indicating to you.\u201d In order to establish that the answer would have been inadmissible hearsay, defendant could have inquired in aid of objection whether the answer was recounted by one of the interpreters. Defendant\u2019s failure to do so is more than academic, because, as noted, in later cross-examination, Tallan testified that portions of defendant\u2019s interview were conducted in English. Therefore, in the end, defendant\u2019s failure to adequately elaborate the precise nature of his objection has made it impossible to determine whether the triad court erred at all. <em>See State v. Hasson, </em>153 Or App 527, 531, 958 P2d 183 (1998) (where the defendant objected to the admission of an entire tape recording and did not distinguish among the various statements that the victim had made during the conversation, if any one of the victim\u2019s statements contained on the tape recording were admissible in the face of a hearsay objection, the appellate court would affirm the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of the tape recording). In sum, we conclude that defendant\u2019s assignment of error to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. Before his sentencing, defendant filed a memorandum in which he argued that any sentence that the court imposed on his conspiracy to commit murder conviction in excess of a 90-month prison term under Ballot Measure 11 would be unconstitutional in the absence of appropriate factual findings being made by the jury. As noted, the trial court rejected that argument, ranked the conviction as a level 11 offense, and imposed a 128-month prison sentence. In doing so, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * The court ranks the conspiracy to commit murder charge as a level 11 charge, which places you in a grid block of 11-H, and the basis for this ranking is that the underlying crime of murder is ranked as an 11 by the sentencing guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cThe evidence elicited during your trial established that your involvement in the planning and preparation of the eventual murder of [the victim] warrants the court placing you in this grid block and ranking the conspiracy to commit murder in the same level. In fact, it would appear that but for the intoxication of Mr. Mariscal-Lopez, you would have committed the murder yourself, since you gave him the gun that he then attempted to shoot and couldn\u2019t shoot because he, by his own description was under the influence of narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cSo, it is your \u2014 it\u2019s your dumb luck, if you will, that he was not able to achieve the killing at the time that you were in the truck with him and the first attempt on the victim\u2019s life the basis for this ranking is that the underlying crime of murder is ranked as an 11 by the sentencing guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Defendant renews his objection to the sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 490, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Pursuant to that rule, the Court explained in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), that enhancement facts required for the imposition of an upward departure sentence must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Those holdings do not apply to discretionary matters decided by trial courts, such as the ranking of offenses under the sentencing guidelines. The ranking of an unclassified offense does not increase the maximum sentence that a jury verdict authorizes but, instead, establishes the maximum sentence that is permitted in the absence of special jury factual findings. OAR 213-004-0004 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201cExcept for ORS 163.095-163.105 Aggravated Murder, when a person is convicted of any other felony which is omitted from the Crime Seriousness Scale, the sentencing judge shall determine the appropriate crime category for the current crime of conviction and shall state on the record the reasons for the offense classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The commentary to the rule indicates that the seriousness of the offense of the underlying intended crime \u201cshould in most cases determine the crime seriousness\u201d of the conspiracy conviction. Commentary, Oregon Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual 14 (1989). The sentencing court, however, has discretion to rank an unclassified offense even higher than its predicate offense. <em>See State v. Coleman, </em>130 Or App 656, 883 P2d 266 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 569 (1995) (racketeering properly ranked higher than its predicate offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201cit is clear that the sentencing court has the discretion to determine the seriousness of an unranked offense. Our review under ORS 138.222(4)(b) is limited to whether the court\u2019s reasons are stated on the record and whether those reasons reflect a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-9\"><em>State v. Rathbone, </em>110 Or App 419, 421-22, 823 P2d 432 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 300 (1992) (Footnote omitted). In <em>State v. Evans, </em>113 Or App 210, 215, 832 P2d 460 (1992), we held that the sentencing court had \u201cdiscretion to rank conspiracy to commit murder in the same crime seriousness category as the completed act of murder.\u201d The sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>in this case did just that: it ranked defendant\u2019s crime seriousness category for his conspiracy to commit murder at category 11, the same category that the legislature prescribed for completed murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Defendant remonstrates that \u201cORS 137.700 provides that the presumptive sentence for conspiracy to commit murder is 90 months\u2019 prison. ORS 137.700(2).\u201d Defendant is mistaken. ORS 137.700 only prescribes the mandatory minimum sentence for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder; it specifically permits the imposition of \u201ca greater sentence if otherwise permitted by law, but * * * not * * * a lower sentence[.]\u201d The presumptive sentence for conspiracy to commit murder is determined by the sentencing guidelines gridblock. Because the offense is unclassified, its ranking \u2014 and thus its presumptive sentence \u2014 is controlled by the crime seriousness ranking that the sentencing court assigns to it. In this case, the sentencing court ranked defendant\u2019s conspiracy crime seriousness at level 11. The presumptive sentence for a grid block 11-H offender such as defendant here is 122 to 128 months\u2019 imprisonment. It follows that the sentence that the court imposed in this case was not a departure but, rather, was within the presumptive range. Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>do not forbid the sentence that the court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-5\"> Defendant does not make a separate argument on appeal that admission of the challenged evidence violated his \u201cconfrontation rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> OEC 801(4) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201cA statement is not hearsay if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">\u201c(b) The statement is offered against a party and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff waited and made his request to amend his pleading during trial apparently in an attempt to meet objections to plaintiffs evidence which did not conform to his pleadings. After the court\u2019s ruling on plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff knew or should have known of the need to submit new evidence and or new pleadings. The untimely attempt to amend at the close of plaintiffs case raised a completely new set of legal issues and if allowed, imposed a tremendous additional burden of proof on the defendants. This burden they had no advance notice of and no opportunity to prepare to meet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u201c(C) A statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201c(D) A statement by the party\u2019s agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationshipt.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
