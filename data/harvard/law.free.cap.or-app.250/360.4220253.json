We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">NWCT operates an acting school and theater in northwest Portland. Its mission is to \u201ceducate, entertain, and enrich the lives of young audiences.\u201d In November 2007, SAIF conducted an audit of NWCT\u2019s operations and issued a premium audit billing reflecting its determination that all of the individuals employed by NWCT during the audit year\u2014 July, 1, 2006 to July 1, 2007 \u2014 were \u201cworkers\u201d who must be included on the NWCT payroll and covered by its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">For that audit year, NWCT included on its payroll and provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for only 13 of the many individuals who provided it with services. NWCT considered the other individuals to be independent contractors, not \u201cworkers,\u201d and appealed the premium audit billing to DCBS. For the purpose of that appeal, the parties grouped the disputed individuals into different categories: (1) instructors, (2) instructional assistants, (3) production designers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) actors (both child and adult). Following a contested hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a proposed order affirming the billing in part and reversing it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>part. Relevant to this judicial review, the ALJ concluded that NWCT instructors and instructional assistants were \u201cworkers,\u201d but that its production designers and actors were not. Both parties filed objections to the proposed order. The ALJ issued a revised proposed order but did not materially change her earlier conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The director of DCBS reviewed the ALJ\u2019s revised proposed order. The director agreed with the ALJ in all respects except one: the director determined that NWCT instructors were not \u201csubject workers.\u201d SAIF petitioned for reconsideration, contending that DCBS had erred in classifying NWCT\u2019s instructors, production designers, and actors because it incorrectly applied the \u201cright to control\u201d and \u201cnature of the work\u201d tests used to determine whether they were \u201cworkers.\u201d DCBS adhered to its decision but clarified its reasoning in a revised final order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In its conclusions of law, DCBS decided that the \u201cright to control test\u201d conclusively established that instructors, production designers, and actors were independent contractors and, therefore, that the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test was inapplicable. DCBS explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cthe \u2018nature of the work\u2019 test does not apply when the \u2018right to control\u2019 test conclusively indicates that the relationship between the employer and worker is not an employment relationship. <em>See Stamp v. DCBS, </em>169 Or App 354 (2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As a result, in its revised final order, DCBS deleted all prior references to the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test and held, on the basis of the \u201cright to control\u201d test alone, that instructors, production designers, and actors were not \u201cworkers\u201d for whom NWCT was required to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">SAIF seeks judicial review and contends that DCBS erred in that determination and that NWCT instructors, production designers, and actors are \u201cworkers\u201d under ORS 656.005(30). When, as here, the basic facts are not in dispute, the question of an individual\u2019s status as a \u201cworker\u201d is one of law. <em>Rubalcaba v.

Every employer employing one or more \u201csubject workers\u201d is subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. ORS 656.023. A \u201csubject worker\u201d is a \u201cworker\u201d who is subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. ORS 656.005(28). All \u201cworkers\u201d are \u201csubject workers\u201d unless a statutory exception makes them nonsubject. <em>See </em>ORS 656.027 (listing exceptions). A \u201cworker\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cany person, including a minor whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, who engages to furnish services for a remuneration, <em>subject to the direction and control of an employer * </em>* * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">ORS 656.005(30) (emphasis added).

Law, </em>214 Or App 349, 353, 164 P3d 1186, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 467 (2007). The \u201cright to control\u201d test is predicated on the comm on-law distinction between a servant and an independent contractor. <em>Woody v. Waibel, </em>276 Or 189, 192-94, 554 P2d 492 (1976). The \u201cright to control\u201d test examines whether the employer has a right to control the individual\u2019s performance. The \u201cright to control\u201d test includes four factors: \u201c(1) direct evidence of the right to, or exercise of, control; (2) the furnishing of tools arid equipment; (3) the method of payment; and (4) the right to fire.\u201d <em>DCBS v. Clements, </em>240 Or App 226, 234, 246 P3d 62 (2010); <em>Stamp v. DCBS, </em>169 Or App 354, 357, 9 P3d 729 (2000); <em>Coghill v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>155 Or App 601, 606, 964 P2d 1085 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The \u201cnature of the work\u201d test effectuates the purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. <em>Woody, </em>276 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>at 193-97. Starting with the premise that the workers\u2019 compensation system is \u201cbased upon the theory that the cost of industrial accidents should be borne by the consumer as a part of the cost of the product,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 194-95, that test permits consideration of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">\u201c[T]he character of the claimant\u2019s work or business\u2014 how skilled it is, how much of a separate calling or enterprise it is, to what extent it may be expected to carry its own accident burden and so on \u2014 and its relation to the employer\u2019s business, that is, how much it is a regular part of the employer\u2019s regular work, whether it is continuous or intermittent, and whether the duration is sufficient to amount to the hiring of continuing services as distinguished from * * * contracting for the completion of a particular job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 195. As we have explained, the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test consists of two elements. The first is the character of the person\u2019s work or business \u2014 its skill, its status as a separate enterprise, and the extent to which it may be expected to carry the burden of its accidents itself. <em>Stamp, </em>169 Or App at 358. The second is the relation of the person\u2019s work to the employer\u2019s business \u2014 how much it is a regular part of the employer\u2019s regular work, whether it is continuous or intermittent, and whether it is of sufficient duration to be the hiring of continuing services rather than contracting for a particular job. <em>Id. </em>at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In this case, the parties disagree about the relationship between the two tests. SAIF takes the position that the two tests are to be applied together and relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rubalcaba </em>for the proposition that, \u201cin situations in which there is <em>some evidence </em>suggesting that an employer retained the right to control the method and details of a claimant\u2019s work, a conclusion about the claimant\u2019s status depends on the analytical factors relevant to both tests.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">DCBS takes the position that, if the right to control test conclusively indicates that there is no right to control, then the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test is inapplicable. DCBS relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Stamp </em>for the proposition that we are to apply the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test \u201c[i]f, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>only if,\u201d the \u201cright to control\u201d test is inconclusive. 169 Or App at 360. According to DCBS, that means that, if the application of the \u201cright to control\u201d test yields a conclusion\u2014 supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason\u2014 that the employer had no right to control an individual\u2019s performance, then a decision-maker is precluded from applying the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. To the extent that <em>Rubalcaba </em>states otherwise, DCBS contends, its statement is <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Thus, in the circumstance in which the parties present evidence that in some respects indicates a right to control, but that in others indicates a lack of a right to control, DCBS asserts that, as long as the decision-maker considers all of the evidence, applies the \u201cright to control\u201d test, and concludes, under that test, that an individual is not a \u201cworker,\u201d the inquiry is complete. The decision-maker is neither compelled nor permitted to consider the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. In contrast, SAIF asserts that, in that circumstance, there is \u201csome evidence\u201d of a right to control, and the decision-maker must apply not only the \u201cright to control,\u201d but also the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. For the reasons that follow, we agree with SAIF that it is the evidence presented and not the conclusion the decision-maker reaches that determines the applicability of the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We begin our analysis with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Woody. </em>There, the trial court concluded, using the common-law \u201cright to control\u201d test, that the individual in question was not a \u201cworker\u201d subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In deciding whether the trial court erred, the Supreme Court began by observing that the evidence demonstrated that the employer had a right to control the individual\u2019s performance \u201cin some respects but not in others.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>276 Or at 197. Indicating a right to control were the facts that either party could terminate the agreement without liability, the employer had some control over the individual\u2019s work schedule, and the parties did not contract for the performance of a specific piece of work. Indicating a lack of right to control were the facts that the employer paid the individual by the piece rather than by the hour, the individual furnished and maintained his own equipment, and the individual employed assistants and worked for other companies. <em>Id. </em>at 192 n 2. That competing evidence, the court decided, made it essential to consider both the \u201cright to control\u201d and the \u201cnature of the work\u201d tests to decide whether the relationship between the parties was subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In <em>Rubalcaba, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) decided, using only the common-law \u201cright to control\u201d test, that an individual was not a \u201cworker\u201d under ORS 656.005(30). 333 Or at 618-19. The court observed that some of the factors relevant to the \u201cright of control\u201d test indicated a right of control, although others did not,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 623-25, and held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cwhen an employer has the right to control [an individual\u2019s] performance in some respects but not in others, \u2018it is essential that we consider the factors that make up the \u201cnature of work\u201d test in deciding whether the control that the employer retains makes the relationship one of master and servant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 627 (quoting <em>Woody, </em>276 Or at 197). That holding was not, as DCBS argues, <em>dictum. </em>The court specifically rejected the employer\u2019s argument that \u201cthe court applies the nature of the work test only if the evidence under the right to control test is so evenly divided that there is no principled way to decide employment status without resort to an additional test,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 626-27, and applied and relied on both the \u201cright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to control\u201d and the \u201cnature of work\u201d tests in deciding that the board erred in concluding that the claimant in that case was not a \u201cworker\u201d under ORS 656.005(30).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Since <em>Rubalcaba, </em>this court has interpreted that case to require the application of the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test whenever \u201can employer has the right to control a claimant\u2019s performance in some respects but not others.\u201d <em>Bovet, </em>214 Or App at 353; <em>Schmidt v. Intel Corp., </em>199 Or App 618, 622, 112 P3d 428 (2005). For instance, in <em>Bovet, </em>the court noted that evidence that the employer paid the individual on an hourly basis, retained the right to terminate the individual without contractual limitation, and told him where to work and what to accomplish on particular days constituted some evidence of a right to control, but the evidence that the individual provided his own tools, set his own work hours, and performed his work in accordance with a contract that he proposed pointed in the other direction. As a result, the court concluded that it was appropriate to apply the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test before reaching a final conclusion about whether the individual was subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. 214 Or App at 353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We do not view <em>Stamp, </em>the case on which DCBS relies and which it urges us to follow, as requiring a different decision. <em>Stamp </em>is a <em>pre-Rubalcaba </em>case, and, even assuming it has some continuing precedential value, we do not consider it necessarily inconsistent with <em>Rubalcaba </em>or with our post-<em>Rubalcaba </em>cases. In <em>Stamp, </em>the hearings officer applied the factors relevant to both the \u201cright to control\u201d and the \u201cnature of the work\u201d tests and concluded that the individual in question was a \u201cworker\u201d under the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. On judicial review, this court agreed that the individual was a \u201cworker\u201d but applied only the \u201cright to control\u201d test to reach that result. Had the court followed <em>Rubalcaba </em>and applied both tests, we know from the factors considered and the conclusions reached by the hearings officer that the court would not have reached a different result. The factors relevant to the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test did not take away from, but provided additional support for, the court\u2019s conclusion that the individual in question was a \u201cworker.\u201d To the extent that <em>Stamp </em>can be understood to preclude the use of the \u201cnature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the work\u201d test when there is \u201csome,\u201d but not \u201cconclusive,\u201d evidence of a right to control, it is inconsistent with <em>Woody </em>and does not survive <em>Rubalcaba.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In addition to relying on <em>Stamp </em>for its position, DCBS also asserts that the text of ORS 656.005(30) requires us to focus on whether an individual is subject to another\u2019s \u201cdirection and control.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Requiring the application of the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test when there is <em>some evidence </em>of a right of control, DCBS argues, runs afoul of that legislative mandate. DCBS contends that, because it is hard to conceive of any instance in which <em>some </em>fact would not point away from \u201cdirection and control,\u201d the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test will almost always be applicable and will swallow the \u201cright to control\u201d test. The legislature mandated the latter test, DCBS contends, and \u201cno further test should be required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">That argument ignores, however, the genesis and purpose of the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test. In <em>Woody, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly decided that the legislature did not intend that the common-law \u201cright to control\u201d test be the exclusive measure of whether an individual is subject to another\u2019s \u201cdirection and control\u201d and thus subject to the requirements of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. 276 Or at 196-97. The court explained that, although \u201ccontrol is an essential ingredient in the test for determining who is a servant within the meaning of the [workers\u2019 compensation act],\u201d the statutes do not \u201cpreclude a consideration of the factors germane to the relative nature of the work test in deciding whether there was sufficient control to denominate the relationship as one of master and servant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, the court emphasized, \u201cto give meaning to our recognition * * * that the statute must be interpreted in light of the purposes of the [act], it is essential that we consider the factors which make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>up the \u2018nature of work\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. Thus, the court held, an individual is not a \u201cworker\u201d unless there is \u201csome evidence\u201d of a right to control under the factors relevant to the common-law test, but when such evidence exists, a decision-maker cannot determine the individual\u2019s status based on that evidence alone. The decision-maker also must consider evidence relevant to the \u201cnature of the work\u201d factors. That does not mean that the \u201cright to control\u201d factors lose their weight or significance; it means only that those factors are not the exclusive measure of the individual\u2019s status. Thus, under the <em>Woody </em>framework, the factors relevant to the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test supplement, rather than swallow, the factors relevant to the \u201cright to control\u201d test. The decision-maker must consider the factors relevant to both tests and decide, in light of all of the relevant factors, whether the individual in question is a \u201cworker\u201d subject to the \u201cdirection and control\u201d of an \u201cemployer\u201d as those terms are used in ORS 656.005(30).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We conclude that, if there were <em>some evidence </em>that NWCT had a right to control instructors, production designers, and actors, DCBS was required to apply both the \u201cright to control\u201d and the \u201cnature of the work\u201d tests to determine whether those individuals were \u201cworkers\u201d subject to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. DCBS erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">That does not, however, complete our inquiry on judicial review. NWCT argues that there was <em>no </em>evidence that it had the right to control its instructors, production designers, or actors and, therefore, that DCBS was correct to apply only the \u201cright to control\u201d test in this instance. Although DCBS does not join in that argument, we proceed to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We consider the findings of fact adopted by DCBS in its revised final order. We begin our statement of those facts with those pertaining to instructors.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">NWCT\u2019s education director, an employee listed on the theater\u2019s payroll, managed the acting school. The education director determined the classes to be taught for a particular term and which of the school\u2019s classrooms would be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>for which classes. The education director then hired instructors appropriate to teach each class. Selection of specific plays, scripts, themes, skills, and methods of teaching was up to the instructors. During the audit year, NWCT hired 33 instructors, including a core group of 11 instructors who taught several classes each. Some of the instructors were local actors, and they often taught at different schools or performed at other theaters at the same time that they taught at NWCT.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">NWCT entered into contracts with its instructors and designated them as \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d The contracts required the instructors to perform all services \u201cagreed upon by Education Director and Instructor, including but not limited to time of class and performance.\u201d Instructors were responsible for \u201c[conducting the class as agreed upon\u201d and \u201c[b]eginning and ending the class at agreed upon times.\u201d The contracts provided for lump sum payments to the instructors for each course that they taught and permitted termination \u201cat any time prior to the end of the class or classes, for any reason deemed in good faith sufficient by NWCT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">NWCT provided instructors with classrooms, stages, sets, and administrative services. NWCT also provided costumes and props that instructors could use if they chose to do so, but often instructors also provided their own supplies and materials. The education director \u201cobserved what each instructor was doing and[,] if it was a lab class, she watched the production at the end of the lab.\u201d In practice, the education director did not interfere with or intervene in the way classes were taught and did not fire any of the instructors during the terms of their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In analyzing those facts, we observe first that NWCT\u2019s designation of its instructors as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d is not controlling. <em>Woody, </em>276 Or at 198-99. We look beyond the label that the parties attach to their relationship to the facts that describe it, and we conclude that the record includes <em>some evidence </em>that NWCT had a right to control the performance of its instructors. Through its education director, NWCT had the right to decide \u2014 and did decide \u2014 what classes to offer. The instructors could not teach whatever, wherever, and whenever they wanted. NWCT controlled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>services that the instructors provided, the way they conducted their classes, the beginning and ending times of each class, and which of the school\u2019s classrooms would be used for which classes. This court has recognized such evidence as indicative of a right to control under the \u201cright to control\u201d test. <em>See Bovet, </em>214 Or App at 354 (evidence that employer \u201cmonitored the means, manner, and method by which the claimant completed his work by telling him where to work and what to do on particular days\u201d constituted evidence of right to control); <em>Lockard v. The Murphy Company, </em>49 Or App 101, 106, 619 P2d 283 (1980) (employer\u2019s designation of time and place of performance demonstrated worker status).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In addition, NWCT observed instructors\u2019 classes and lab productions and had the right to terminate an instructor\u2019s employment for any reason it deemed in good faith to be sufficient. Therefore, NWCT could decide, mid-contract, that it did not want to continue the services of an instructor and could terminate that instructor\u2019s contract in the absence of any breach of contract by the instructor. <em>Cf. Henn v. SAIF, </em>60 Or App 587, 593, 654 P2d 1129 (1982) (fact that contract could be terminated only on individual\u2019s violation of terms of contract indicative of lack of control). That right existed even if NWCT did not exercise it, <em>see Clements, </em>240 Or App at 234; <em>Coghill, </em>155 Or App at 606 (right to control, not actual control, is dispositive), and it is a factor that points toward a right of control under the \u201cright to control\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As NWCT argues, DCBS also found facts that pointed in the other direction. However, it is not necessary for us to discuss those factors at this juncture. The question before us is whether the findings of fact include some evidence that NWCT had a right to control the performance of its instructors. We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We next examine those findings as they pertain to those individuals NWCT hired to direct and produce its plays. NWCT employed a number of those individuals and included them on its payroll. Those employees included an artistic director, a stage manager, and a technical director. The artistic director selected the plays and developed the budget for each. The artistic director then hired a director for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>each play.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The stage manager attended the play rehearsals and, after the play director completed work, made sure that the play was executed according to the play director\u2019s vision. The technical director built the sets after receiving plans from the set designer.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">NWCT did not include individuals involved in play production other than those employees on its payroll. The nonpayroll individuals worked as play directors, designers, choreographers, musical directors, and musicians and were included in the category that the parties defined as \u201cproduction designers.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Turning first to the play directors, DCBS found that they were responsible for setting a vision for a play and keeping its cost within a prescribed budget. The play directors signed contracts with NWCT that required them to allow the artistic director \u201cartistic input, on artistic decisions (including, but not exclusive to casting, design, concept, textual changes, staging and interpretation).\u201d The contracts gave the artistic director the right to approve final casting and responsibility for negotiating performer contracts. The contracts also required play directors to meet deadlines, attend specified meetings and rehearsals, and observe the rules of the building and NWCT management. NWCT could terminate contracts with its play directors, but only if the directors were unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Some of that evidence indicates that NWCT had a right to control the performance of its play directors. The artistic director was a NWCT employee involved in all aspects of play production, and she had a right to provide the play director with input on casting, design, concept, textual changes, staging, and interpretation, and to make final decisions as to casting. And, as mentioned, NWCT contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>required the play directors to meet deadlines, attend specified meetings and rehearsals, and observe the rules of the building and NWCT management. That contractual oversight was some evidence of a right to control the play directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The play directors selected the other production designers, including set designers, costume designers, prop designers, sound designers, lighting designers, choreographers, musical directors, and musicians.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the play directors, those other production designers brought their specific talents and skill sets to the production of the plays. However, production designers worked under the control of the play directors to fulfill the needs specified by the play directors. The other production designers also contracted with NWCT, and their contracts contained terms similar to those of the play directors. The contract of the production designers required them to work with the play director and the artistic director, meet deadlines, attend specified meetings and rehearsals, and observe the rules of the building and NWCT management.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Although the findings of fact also include competing evidence indicating that the production designers worked independently,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the evidence to which we call attention pointed to a right to control sufficient to make the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Finally, we examine the facts that describe the relationship between NWCT and its actors, both adult and youth. During the audit year, NWCT used 99 actors that it recruited through local advertisements or hired from its acting school. Actors brought their specific talents and skill sets to the production of the plays. However, actors worked under the control of play directors and learned their lines from a script provided by NWCT. After the play directors completed their work, the stage manager attended rehearsals and made sure that the play was executed according to the play director\u2019s vision. Actors signed contracts with NWCT equivalent to those executed by play directors and production designers. Although, as DCBS argues, there certainly are ineffable qualities that actors bring to their performances, we conclude that the facts also reveal some evidence that NWCT had a right to control its actors\u2019 performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Because there was some evidence that NWCT had a right to control the performance of its instructors, production designers, and actors, DCBS erred when it failed to apply the \u201cnature of the work\u201d test in addition to the \u201cright of control\u201d test to decide whether individuals in those positions were \u201cworkers\u201d and \u201csubject workers\u201d for whom NWCT was required to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> The \u201cproduction designer\u201d category includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cguest directors, designers and musicians, assistant choreographers, assistant costume designers, assistant directors, assistant house managers, assistant stage managers, audio describers, carpenters, choreographers, composers, sound designers, costume shop managers, cover and poster illustrators, electricians, fight choreographers, fight directors, follow-spot operators, graphic artists, graphic designers, lighting designers, marketing assistant, music director, painters, parent liaison, photographers, printers, prop designers, properties designer, properties master, puppets, scenic artists, set designers, sound board operators, sound technicians, stagehands, stitchers, wardrobe masters, welders, wig, prosthetic, and makeup designer!!]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\"> In 1976, when the court decided <em>Woody, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation statutes used the term \u201cworkman\u201d instead of \u201cworker,\u201d but both terms have essentially the same definitions. A \u201cworkman\u201d was defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\u201cany person, including a minor whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, who engages to furnish his services for a remuneration, <em>subject to the direction and control of an employer </em>and includes salaried, elected and appointed officials of the state, state agencies, counties, cities, school districts and other public corporations, but does not include any person whose services are performed as an inmate or ward of a state institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">ORS 656.005(28X1975) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> The facts that the court found to be indicative of the right to control were that the employer retained the right to fire the individual without incurring contractual liability, the employer required the individual to wait in line and receive a particular load, the individual was paid according to how much he hauled, and the employer contacted the individual when it needed him. The facts that the court found to be indicative of a lack of control were that the individual owned his own truck and the employer paid him by the volume hauled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> DCBS asserts that the phrase \u201cdirection and control\u201d is, under <em>Springfield Education </em>Assoc. <em>v. Springfield School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 224-28, 621 P2d 547 (1980), an inexact statutory term that requires a determination of whether the DCBS final order is consistent with the legislative policy embodied in the meaning of that term and the legislature\u2019s intent underlying the general statutory framework. Identification of that policy and intent is, according to DCBS, determined by the rules of statutory interpretation, and their attention to statutory text, set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), and <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> The artistic director served as a play director for some of the plays that NWCT produced during the audit period. The artistic director did not receive additional compensation for serving those dual roles. The parties referred to play directors other than the artistic director as \u201cguest directors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> We set out the complete description of the positions included in the production designer category above at 250 Or App 362 n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> The findings of fact do not specifically address other positions in the \u201cproduction designer\u201d category, such as painters, stitchers, carpenters, and other crafts people. The findings state that the ALJ viewed the testimony about the production designers to be \u201crepresentative of that entire group.\u201d Accordingly, DCBS included all of the positions in the production designer category in its conclusion of law that individuals who worked in those positions were not \u201csubject workers.\u201d On appeal, SAIF asserts that, as to the nondesigner people, that conclusion of law is not supported by substantial evidence. Given our disposition in this case, we need not reach that assignment of error. On remand, DCBS will have an opportunity to review the record and to treat the nondesigners differently, if appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> For example, set, costume, prop, lighting, and sound designers often worked off-site with their own supplies and equipment. When their products were delivered to the theater and any adjustments were made by the play director, they were paid and had no further involvement with the play. The choreographers choreographed and taught the scenes, and when that work was complete they were paid and had no further involvement with the play. The musical director directed the musicians and taught the actors any pieces that needed to be sung. Musicians practiced at home and brought their own instruments to the theater (with the exception of the piano, which was provided by NWCT).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
