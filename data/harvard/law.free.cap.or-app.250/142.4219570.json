On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred by (1) denying his motion to suppress evidence and (2) conducting a bench trial without obtaining a written waiver of his right to a trial by jury. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s argument that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. However, defendant\u2019s remaining assignment of error is well taken. The state concedes that the record does not contain a valid waiver of jury trial and that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed. We agree, accept the concession, and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 173 P3d 827 (2007), exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
