Because this is not an \u201cexceptional case\u201d justifying <em>de novo </em>review, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for \u201cany evidence\u201d and its legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>See Travis v. Strubel, </em>238 Or App 254, 256, 242 P3d 690 (2010) (explaining standard of review applicable to SPO appeals); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). Applying that standard of review, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the entry of an SPO against either respondent. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Petitioner and respondent Evan Braude married in the early 1990s and have two children together, a son and a daughter. The couple separated in the fall of 2004 and, following acrimonious divorce proceedings, a judgment dissolving their marriage was entered in 2007. Evan married respondent Karla Braude roughly a year later. Shortly thereafter, he moved to modify the judgment that had dissolved his marriage to petitioner. One hearing in the ongoing modification proceedings was held on May 10, 2010. Petitioner filed civil stalking complaints against respondents the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">At a July 2010 hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for permanent SPOs, petitioner accused Karla of having made inappropriate inquiries into petitioner\u2019s accounts at a bank and a gas company, of having contacted the children\u2019s school in violation of petitioner\u2019s custody agreement with Evan, and of having walked past petitioner in the parking lot of the tile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>store where petitioner worked. Karla smiled at petitioner when they walked past each other in the store parking lot but did not otherwise communicate with petitioner on that occasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Focusing on events that had occurred the previous year, petitioner also accused both respondents of having repeatedly driven by her rural home in a manner that caused her alarm. Respondents own two cars, a silver Audi with dark tinted windows and a Nissan Armada. On more than a dozen days between mid-August and mid-October 2009, one or the other of those cars was spotted in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood. Sometimes, one of the cars was being driven very slowly along the road in front of petitioner\u2019s house; on other days, one of respondents\u2019 cars stopped for a short time on the road near the entrance to petitioner\u2019s driveway, staying there for up to roughly 10 minutes. Those incidents generally occurred between 5:00 and 8:30 in the morning. Petitioner saw respondents\u2019 cars some of the times they were in her neighborhood; on other occasions, only her neighbors saw the cars. One of those neighbors, Kathleen Hendrix, testified that she saw one of respondents\u2019 cars pass by petitioner\u2019s home \u201cover a dozen [times] easily, and it was very concerning.\u201d After one such incident, Hendrix saw that petitioner was \u201ctrembling\u201d and \u201cvery, very upset.\u201d Another neighbor also observed a number of the incidents; she found them threatening because it appeared that someone was \u201ctrying to watch [petitioner].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">On September 18, 2009, following an e-mail exchange about disputed financial matters, petitioner sent Evan another e-mail stating, in part, \u201c[I]f you and Karla continue to drive by and stop in front of my house everyday it will be considered threatening, menacing and or stalking, continuation of this behavior is a direct acknowledgement of yours and Karla\u2019s intent to threaten as well as stalk me.\u201d Karla testified that she drove by petitioner\u2019s house and photographed it once more, on October 19, 2009, although no evidence suggests that anybody saw her car in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>on that date. Indeed, nobody reported seeing either of respondents\u2019 cars in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood again until May 2010, when both petitioner and her neighbor, Hendrix, claimed to have seen respondents\u2019 Audi driving slowly by petitioner\u2019s home early on the morning of May 1. Petitioner sought and obtained temporary SPOs against both respondents later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">At the July 2010 permanent-SPO hearing, respondents acknowledged that Karla repeatedly had driven by petitioner\u2019s home to gather evidence for use in the post-judgment modification proceedings in Evan\u2019s divorce case. Respondents believed that petitioner\u2019s boyfriend had been living with her \u2014 contrary to what petitioner had indicated in her Uniform Support Affidavit \u2014 and so, on the advice of Evan\u2019s attorney, Karla had sought to prove the boyfriend\u2019s residency by taking photographs that showed his car parked at petitioner\u2019s house early in the morning. As noted, Karla took the last of those pictures on October 19, 2009 \u2014 about a month after petitioner had told Evan that respondents should stop driving by her residence. Both respondents asserted, however, that neither of them had driven by petitioner\u2019s house again after that date, disputing petitioner\u2019s claim that they had been in her neighborhood on May 1, 2010. Respondents also testified that Evan never had accompanied Karla on her photography trips and that he never had driven by petitioner\u2019s home to take photographs himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Much of the evidence introduced at the July 2010 hearing related to whether the incidents involving respondents\u2019 cars caused petitioner reasonable alarm or apprehension regarding her safety. Undisputed evidence established that nobody who observed the incidents ever saw either of respondents\u2019 cars travel onto petitioner\u2019s property. Nobody saw either respondent get out of the cars, gesture toward petitioner\u2019s house, or attempt to speak with petitioner or with anybody else. In addition, nobody who saw the cars in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood could tell who was driving or riding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the cars, except on one occasion when petitioner identified Karla as the driver and sole occupant. Nonetheless, petitioner explained, she found the incidents alarming in light of Evan\u2019s past aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">At the SPO hearing, petitioner described two incidents in which Evan had behaved violently toward or around her. The first occurred soon after she and Evan separated in 2004, when Evan was living in an apartment in a separate building on the marital property and petitioner and the children were living in the main house. One day while petitioner and the couple\u2019s daughter were at home, Evan broke open a locked door to enter the house and then broke open the locked door to the master bathroom where the daughter \u2014 then 12 years old \u2014 was bathing. Although Evan did nothing to physically harm either petitioner or his daughter, he \u201crant[ed] and raved and went on\u201d in a manner that \u201cwas very frightening\u201d while he retrieved his business clothes from the bathroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Roughly two months later, the couple\u2019s daughter called petitioner from Evan\u2019s new apartment in tears, and petitioner could hear Evan swearing in the background. Petitioner testified that, when she arrived at the apartment to pick up her daughter, Evan told her to \u201cget the F out of there\u201d and then \u201cphysically grabbed\u201d her, lifted her onto her toes, and then \u201ctossed\u201d her on the floor. Petitioner obtained a restraining order against Evan following that incident, which she later dismissed. In light of those past events, petitioner testified, she felt frightened for her personal safety when respondents\u2019 cars were repeatedly spotted driving slowly past her home in 2009 and, she claimed, in May 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The trial court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support entry of permanent SPOs. First, the court determined that the only conduct by respondents that constituted \u201ccontacts\u201d for purposes of entering the SPOs were \u201cthe contacts at the house, the coming to the house repeatedly early in the morning and parking.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>relied on the 13 photographs of petitioner\u2019s property that either Karla or Evan had taken, noting that those pictures corroborated the testimony of petitioner\u2019s neighbors and \u201cend[ed] any speculation\u201d as to whether repeated and unwanted contact had occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the court concluded that \u201cthere\u2019s enough in the history between the Petitioner and [Evan] for \u2014 to justify her concern and apprehension for her safety when she observes [respondents\u2019] vehicle outside her home in a rural area repeatedly at very early hours in the morning over a period of at least months.\u201d The court therefore entered permanent SPOs against respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">On appeal, respondents argue that petitioner\u2019s evidence did not satisfy the requirements of ORS 30.866, under which the trial court entered the SPOs. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c(1) A person may bring a civil action in a circuit court for a court\u2019s stalking protective order or for damages, or both, against a person if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">ORS 30.866.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">That statute creates several requirements for entry of an SPO. First, a respondent\u2019s conduct must meet the statutory definition of \u201crepeated and unwanted contact\u201d with the petitioner or a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family or household. <em>Reitz v. Erazo, </em>248 Or App 700, 705, 274 P3d 214 (2012). Second, the petitioner must <em>subjectively </em>\u2014 i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cactually\u2019 \u2014 \u201cbe alarmed or coerced by the contacts\u201d and that alarm or coercion must be objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Third, the contacts also must actually cause the petitioner apprehension about personal safety and that apprehension, too, must be objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the respondent must have acted with the requisite mental state. <em>Osborne v. Fadden, </em>225 Or App 431, 437, 201 P3d 278, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 213 (2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In this case, the record does not support the trial court\u2019s determination that unwanted contacts caused petitioner <em>reasonable </em>apprehension for her personal safety. For purposes of reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we assume (without deciding) that the record supports the court\u2019s implicit finding that each respondent intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaged in at least two unwanted contacts with petitioner in the two years before petitioner filed for the SPOs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, we do not question the court\u2019s finding that the contacts caused petitioner genuine alarm. However, ORS 30.866(1) also requires that the contacts cause the petitioner objectively reasonable apprehension regarding her own personal safety or the safety of a member of her immediate family or household. <em>Falkenstein v. Falkenstein, </em>236 Or App 445, 450, 236 P3d 798 (2010). We conclude that the contacts did not rise to that level in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Respondents\u2019 behavior in driving by petitioner\u2019s house and photographing it, although unwelcome and unsettling to petitioner, did not itself evince any threat to petitioner\u2019s safety. Respondents did not enter petitioner\u2019s property during those incidents, did not make threatening gestures or comments (indeed, they did not attempt to communicate with petitioner or her neighbors in any way), and did not wait at the end of her driveway for lengthy periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>time. <em>Cf. Habrat v. Milligan, </em>208 Or App 229, 237-39, 145 P3d 180 (2006) (affirming entry of an SPO because, among other things, the respondent \u2014 who had made \u201cpersistent and inappropriate sexual overtures\u201d to the petitioner\u2014 repeatedly parked directly in front of the petitioner\u2019s work place \u201cfor protracted periods of time,\u201d within her sight, and gave her \u201cmenacing glares\u201d). Moreover, respondents were not strangers to petitioner; the parties all were acquainted and had ongoing dealings with each other \u2014 such as sorting out financial affairs and coordinating Evan\u2019s time with the children \u2014 that required them to communicate periodically. In addition, all but one of the incidents occurred during a roughly two-month period in the fall of2009 that ended more than six months before petitioner filed for the SPOs. Those driveway incidents, standing alone, would not have caused a reasonable person in petitioner\u2019s position to feel apprehension for her personal safety in May 2010. <em>See Falkenstein, </em>236 Or App at 452-53 (evidence that the respondent had waited outside the petitioner\u2019s house and had come over uninvited was insufficient to support an SPO because the contacts were not explicitly or implicitly threatening; \u201cfor example, there was no evidence that respondent made threatening gestures or movements towards petitioner or otherwise exhibited an intent to harm her\u201d); <em>Sparks v. Deveny, </em>221 Or App 283, 292-93, 189 P3d 1268 (2008) (the respondent\u2019s continued attendance at an exercise class that the petitioner attended, even after she told him to stop, would not cause a reasonable person apprehension because there was \u201cno evidence that respondent behaved in a way during the class that would have given rise to concerns for \u2018personal safety\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Nor do the driveway incidents become objectively threatening when considered in the context of Evan\u2019s earlier violent acts. We recognize that conduct that might appear benign when viewed in isolation can take on a different character when viewed either in combination with or against the backdrop of one party\u2019s aggressive behavior toward the other. <em>Boyd v. Essin, </em>170 Or App 509, 518, 12 P3d 1003 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 674 (2001). In this case, however, the parties\u2019 past relationship was not so characterized by violence or abuse as to make the more recent contacts objectively threatening. Rather, Evan\u2019s past aggression toward petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>involved only two isolated incidents that occurred almost five years before petitioner sought the SPOs, at the end of a long-term marriage that did not (as far as the record reveals) involve other abuse. This case is not similar to others, like <em>Boyd, </em>in which we held that present contacts caused an SPO petitioner objectively reasonable apprehension in light of the respondent\u2019s long-standing \u201chistory of violent and abusive behavior.\u201d 170 Or App at 518. Because the record does not support a determination that the driveway incidents would have caused a reasonable person in petitioner\u2019s position to feel apprehension for her personal safety, the trial court erred when it entered the SPOs.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\"> In civil stalking proceedings, the party applying for relief is called the \u201cpetitioner\u201d and the party against whom relief is sought is called the \u201crespondent.\u201d As we previously have noted, \u201cthat nomenclature can be confusing in an appeal like this, where the \u2018respondent\u2019 below is the appellant, and the \u2018petitioner\u2019 below is the respondent.\u201d <em>Schiffner v. Banks, </em>177 Or App 86, 88 n 1, 33 P3d 701 (2001). In accordance with our rule governing the designation of parties in briefs, ORAP 5.15, all references to \u201cpetitioner\u201d in this opinion are to J. L. B. and all references to \u201crespondents\u201d are to Evan Braude and Karla Braude. Because they share the same last name, we sometimes refer to the individual respondents by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\"> The record does not indicate on what date each of those events occurred, except that respondents visited petitioner\u2019s place of work in 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> Evan acknowledged at the SPO hearing that he had waited in his vehicle at the end of petitioner\u2019s driveway on a handful of occasions when one of the children called him from petitioner\u2019s house, seeking a ride. Petitioner does not argue that any of those incidents constituted \u201ccontacts\u201d that could justify entering an SPO against either respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> The trial court determined that other incidents, like Karla going to the store where petitioner worked, were \u201crelevant to the entire situation\u201d but did not constitute unwanted contacts on which an SPO could be based.
