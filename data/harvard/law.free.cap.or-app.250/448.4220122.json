Because the board\u2019s order does not adequately explain the board\u2019s reasoning, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We begin with the facts, which we take from the undisputed evidence in the record. Petitioner was charged with several crimes for making unwanted contact with four young women at Oregon State University (OSU) on the afternoon of May 27,2009. At the time of the charged crimes, petitioner was a junior at OSU, and his mental health had been deteriorating for months. He was depressed and had been isolating himself from family and friends. He also had been neglecting his studies and personal hygiene. And, as petitioner later told his family and doctors, he had been hearing voices.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Around 12:00 p.m. on the day of the charged crimes, petitioner approached a young woman, K. He grabbed her buttocks and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re sexy.\u201d Then he walked away. Based on his conduct toward K, petitioner was charged with sexual abuse in the third degree, ORS 163.415.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Around 2:15 p.m., petitioner approached another young woman, H, and asked to borrow her mobile phone. He told her that he had left his phone in his car and needed to call it. H followed petitioner to where he said his car was parked, and she became suspicious because he was \u201cmumbling\u201d and \u201cnot making sense.\u201d She walked away and called campus security. Based on his conduct toward H, petitioner was charged with attempted kidnapping in the second degree, ORS 161.405; ORS 163.225.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Around 3:30 p.m., petitioner approached a third young woman, S, and grabbed her buttocks. In response, she turned and hit him in the chest. He asked if he could pay her for oral sex. He was \u201crambling,\u201d and she \u201cdid not understand what he was trying to say.\u201d She told him, \u201cYou need to get away from me,\u201d and he walked away. She called the police. Based on his conduct toward S, petitioner was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>sexual abuse in the third degree, ORS 163.415, and prostitution, ORS 167.007.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Also around 3:30 p.m., petitioner approached a fourth young woman, A, and grabbed her buttocks and shoulder. She kicked him, and he grabbed her arm and tried to pull her down a driveway, saying \u201cCome here, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She kicked him again and said, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Get away.\u201d He ran away, and she called the police. Based on his conduct toward A, petitioner was charged with sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, and attempted kidnapping in the second degree, ORS 161.405; ORS 163.225.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Around 3:45 p.m., petitioner was arrested and interviewed by the police. One police officer reported that petitioner was \u201cvery nervous and fidgeted with his clothes and hands[,] * * * paced a short distance side to side[,] or would turn his body back and forth restlessly.\u201d Another officer reported that \u201cit was evident [that petitioner] was struggling with things in his head\u201d when he was being interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">After petitioner was arrested, his parents came to Oregon to move him back home to California. They discovered that his life had become \u201ccompletely disorganized\u201d; his apartment was uncharacteristically \u201cmessy,\u201d his phone and computer were \u201cnon-functional,\u201d and he had \u201chundreds of small notes stuffed in his backpack.\u201d After petitioner moved home, his parents observed him scribble unintelligible notes and talk to himself. They also noticed that his cognitive functioning was impaired; he could not do simple math or understand what he read. And, although petitioner had previously been \u201cmeticulous\u201d about his appearance and hygiene, he was \u201cheedless of both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In June 2009, petitioner was evaluated by Dr. Colistro, a forensic psychologist. The evaluation was conducted in connection with petitioner\u2019s criminal charges. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether, at the time of the OSU incidents, petitioner had a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d that caused him to \u201clack[ ] substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or conform [his] conduct to the requirements of law,\u201d in which case he could be found \u201cguilty except for insanity.\u201d ORS 161.295(1). Colistro diagnosed petitioner with \u201cDepression Severe with Psychotic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Features.\u201d According to Colistro, petitioner\u2019s symptoms included \u201cmarked cognitive impairment, social isolation, uncharacteristic inattention to hygiene and grooming, psy-chomotor retardation, and bizarre behavior suggestive of delusional thinking.\u201d Colistro concluded that \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that, at the time of [the alleged crimes], [petitioner] was unable to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of law.\u201d Colistro further concluded that petitioner was a \u201cgood candidate for counseling and medical management of his condition\u201d and should continue to live with his parents because he was responding well to being with them in California and receiving mental health treatment there.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In California, petitioner engaged in treatment supervised by Dr. Jerry Gelbart, a psychiatrist. Like Colistro, Gelbart diagnosed petitioner with \u201cMajor Depression with Psychotic Features.\u201d Gelbart prescribed antidepressant and antipsychotic medications to petitioner, who took them as directed. From June 2009 to August 2009, petitioner participated in an intensive hospital-based treatment program. Patients in the program spent their days at the hospital, participating in individual and group therapy intended to stabilize them and prepare them for further treatment. After completion of the hospital-based program, petitioner continued to participate in individual therapy with Dr. Gelbart, and he began group therapy with Michael Gelbart, Dr. Gelbart\u2019s brother and a licensed clinical social worker. Petitioner also attended community college and performed volunteer work on a weekly basis. According to Dr. Gelbart, the medications, therapy, family support, and participation in regular, structured activities improved petitioner\u2019s mental health, and petitioner\u2019s prognosis was \u201cexcellent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In November 2009, petitioner returned to Oregon for resolution of the criminal charges against him. Pursuant to a stipulated agreement, the trial court found petitioner guilty except for insanity of attempted kidnapping in the second degree, and the state dismissed the remaining charges. The trial court placed petitioner under the jurisdiction of the board for a period of five years and committed him to OSH. <em>See </em>ORS 161.327(5) (prescribing procedure to be followed when a defendant has been found guilty except for insanity).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>While at OSH, petitioner was treated by Dr. Passmore, a psychiatrist. Like Colistro and Dr. Gelbart, Passmore diagnosed petitioner with \u201cdepression with psychotic features,\u201d and he agreed that petitioner was psychotic during the OSU incidents. Passmore also noted that petitioner admitted to using alcohol and marijuana, and, in Passmore\u2019s opinion, petitioner\u2019s marijuana use probably exacerbated petitioner\u2019s mental health problems. However, by the time that petitioner arrived at OSH, his diagnosed condition was in remission. According to Passmore, petitioner was \u201cwithout symptoms\u201d and \u201cpsychiatrically stable\u201d at OSH; he was \u201ccompliant,\u201d \u201cengageable,\u201d and sought to \u201cdo more than what [was] available to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">While at OSH, petitioner was evaluated by Dr. Walker, a psychologist. In January 2010, Walker conducted a \u201csex offender and violence risk assessment\u201d of petitioner, administering two assessment instruments. Walker reported that it was \u201capparent [that petitioner] was in a floridly psychotic state at the time of his offense and his mental illness did in fact play a role in his actions.\u201d Walker also reported that, based on petitioner\u2019s history and test results, petitioner presented a \u201clow risk for sexually acting out and low risk for future violence as long as he is stabilized on medication in a supportive environment and free of drug and alcohol use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In February 2010, the board held petitioner\u2019s \u201cinitial hearing,\u201d as required by ORS 161.341(6)(a), to determine whether petitioner should be continued in his commitment, conditionally released, or discharged. At an initial hearing, the state bears the burden of proving that a patient continues to be affected by a mental disease or defect and is a substantial danger to others. ORS 161.327(l)(b); OAR 859-050-0055(1). A patient seeking conditional release at an initial hearing bears the burden of proving that he or she can be \u201cadequately controlled and given proper care and treatment\u201d in the community. ORS 161.341(3)-(4); OAR 859-050-0055(4). In this case, petitioner stipulated that he suffered from a mental disease or defect that, when active, rendered him a substantial danger to others, but he requested that the board conditionally release him.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>OSH submitted a conditional release plan on petitioner\u2019s behalf, under which petitioner would return to California to live with his parents and participate in mental health treatment, including medication supervision and individual therapy with Dr. Gelbart and group therapy with Michael Gelbart, who would be petitioner\u2019s conditional release supervisor. In addition, petitioner would attend two self-help groups, Alcoholics Anonymous and Marijuana Anonymous, each week and be tested for alcohol and drug use twice a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">At the hearing, Dr. Gelbart and Passmore testified in support of petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan. They detailed how petitioner had been successful while living in California and at OSH, and they stated that petitioner could be adequately treated and supervised in the community under the proposed conditional release plan. In addition to testimony, the board received exhibits, including the police reports regarding the OSU incidents, Colistro\u2019s report, petitioner\u2019s OSH records, Walker\u2019s evaluation, and a letter from Michael Gelbart, which, like the testimony of Dr. Gelbart and Passmore, supported petitioner\u2019s conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In his letter to the board, Michael Gelbart wrote that as petitioner\u2019s conditional release supervisor, he would ensure coordination of the conditional release plan and make monthly reports to the board regarding petitioner\u2019s progress. He also stated that, if petitioner violated the terms of the conditional release plan, then he would report that to the board. Dr. Gelbert testified that, although Michael Gelbart would be the board\u2019s primary contact person, he would be willing to make reports to the board as well. Additionally, Dr. Gelbart testified that, if he thought that petitioner was a danger to himself or others, then he would hospitalize petitioner in California and immediately report it to the board. And petitioner\u2019s father, a physician, testified that he would cooperate with the board to return petitioner to Oregon if the board revoked petitioner\u2019s conditional release. Petitioner himself agreed to waive extradition to Oregon if the board conditionally released him to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>No one testified against petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan, and the state took \u201cno position * * * on the propriety of a conditional release, even the propriety of a conditional release to California,\u201d except to request that petitioner\u2019s parents be \u201ctrained in relapse prevention and warning signs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In a written order issued after the evidentiary hearing, the board concluded that petitioner could be \u201cadequately controlled and treated in the community,\u201d but that \u201cthe supervision and treatment necessary for [his] conditional release [were] not available in the community\u201d at the time. In its order, the board explained that its conclusion was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cbased upon the Board\u2019s decision that the proposed conditional release plan does not contain all the elements that it believes are necessary for [petitioner\u2019s] safe management in a community setting. Further, the Board was not comfortable with an initial release out-of-state where the Board could exercise little control over [petitioner\u2019s] treatment and supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The board did not specify what \u201cnecessary elements\u201d were missing from petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan, nor did it explain why it would have \u201clittle control\u201d over petitioner if he were released to California under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At the end of its order, the board asked OSH to arrange for two additional evaluations of petitioner. Specifically, the board requested that OSH</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cobtain an outside sexual offender evaluation that would include polygraph testing, to further explore the sexual nature of [petitioner\u2019s] instant offense and history in light of the lack of observable psychotic symptoms witnessed by victims or police at the time of the criminal behaviors. Once that document has been received, the Board would ask the hospital to recommend a community mental health agency in Oregon to evaluate [petitioner] for possible conditional release placement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">We review the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(c). In doing so, we review both the board\u2019s factual findings and its legal conclusions derived from those findings. <em>Salosha, Inc. v. Lane County, </em>201 Or App 138, 143, 117 P3d 1047 (2005). We review its findings to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>determine whether they are supported by the evidentiary record; specifically, we review a finding to determine whether a reasonable person, viewing the record as a whole, could make the finding. ORS 183.482(8)(c). Thus, our task is not to make our own findings but rather to determine whether, viewing all the evidence in the record, the board could reasonably make the findings that it did. <em>Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 295, 787 P2d 884 (1990) (\u201c[T]he court must evaluate evidence against the finding as well as evidence supporting it to determine whether substantial evidence exists to support [a] finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We review the board\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether they logically follow from its factual findings. <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 499-500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996). That is, we assess the board\u2019s reasoning, as expressed in its order. <em>Id. </em>As we have stated, \u201cOur duty is to evaluate the board\u2019s logic, not to supply it.\u201d <em>Castro v. Board of Parole, </em>232 Or App 75, 85-86, 220 P3d 772 (2009). Therefore, we require that the board explain its conclusions with at least sufficient detail for us to review its reasoning. <em>Salosha, Inc., </em>201 Or App at 144-45. If the board\u2019s reasoning cannot be ascertained or is faulty, then the order is not supported by \u201csubstantial reason.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Drew, </em>322 Or at 500-01 (PSRB\u2019s order vacated on substantial reason grounds where, although substantial evidence existed in the record that could support PSRB\u2019s finding that the petitioner was a substantial danger to others, PSRB failed \u201cto connect permissibly its facts and its holding\u201d); <em>Alcala v. Employment Dept. </em>235 Or App 32, 38, 230 P3d 59 (2010) (order not supported by substantial reason where the board \u201cdid not explain\u201d its conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the board\u2019s order in this case is not supported by substantial reason. As described above, the board concluded that \u201cthe supervision and treatment necessary for [petitioner\u2019s] conditional release [were] not available in the community.\u201d The board explained its conclusion by stating that petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan \u201c[did] not contain all the elements that it believe[d were] necessary\u201d for petitioner\u2019s safe management in the community, and the board added that it \u201cwas not comfortable with an initial release out-of-state where [it] could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>exercise little control over [petitioner\u2019s] treatment and supervision.\u201d As noted, the board did not specify what \u201cnecessary\u201d \u201celements\u201d were missing from petitioner\u2019s plan; nor did it explain why it would have \u201clittle control\u201d over petitioner if he were released to California under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The board\u2019s failure to provide sufficient detail or explanation in support of its conclusion prevents us from reviewing the board\u2019s reasoning, as we are required to do. Because the board did not specify what \u201celements\u201d were missing from petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan, we cannot assess the reasonableness of the board\u2019s conclusion that those elements were \u201cnecessary\u201d for petitioner\u2019s release to the community. Similarly, because the board did not provide any factual or legal bases for its expressed discomfort with releasing petitioner to California \u2014 which it has the authority to do, OAR 859-070-0035<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 we cannot assess whether those bases logically lead to the board\u2019s conclusion that it would have \u201clittle control\u201d over petitioner. Thus, the board\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s conditional release is not supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We note that the board\u2019s order made recommendations for further action by OSH, including a recommendation that OSH arrange for a second sex offender evaluation of petitioner. That recommendation suggests that the board denied petitioner\u2019s conditional release request because it believed that petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan might need to include sex offender treatment or supervision conditions. If so, that belief was based on an unsupported factual finding. The board recommended the second sex offender evaluation \u201cto further explore the sexual nature of [petitioner\u2019s] instant offense and history <em>in light of the lack of observable psychotic symptoms witnessed by victims or police at the time of the criminal behaviors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) But, the record does not support the board\u2019s implicit finding that petitioner did not exhibit such symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">As described, one of the young women, H, reported that, when petitioner contacted her, he was \u201cmumbling\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cnot making sense.\u201d Similarly, another one of the young women, S, reported that petitioner was \u201crambling\u201d and she \u201cdid not understand what he was trying to say.\u201d In addition, a police officer reported that \u201cit was evident [that petitioner] was struggling with things in his head\u201d when he was interviewed. Moreover, Colistro, Passmore, and Walker, who had all reviewed the police reports, concluded that petitioner was exhibiting psychotic symptoms when he contacted the young women. And, Walker, who conducted the OSH sex offender evaluation, reported that petitioner was \u201cin a floridly psychotic state at the time of his offense and his mental illness did in fact play a role in his actions.\u201d Thus, the record, viewed as a whole, does not support the board\u2019s implicit finding that petitioner did not exhibit observable psychotic symptoms when he contacted the young women at OSU or when he was interviewed by the police. Therefore, to the extent that the board denied petitioner\u2019s conditional release request because it believed that petitioner\u2019s conditional release plan might need to include sex offender treatment and supervision, the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> OAR 859-070-035 provides, \u201cThe Board may consider and approve a conditional release plan to have the patient reside out of state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
