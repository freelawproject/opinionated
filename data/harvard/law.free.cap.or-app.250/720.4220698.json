At the same time, the Department of Human Services (DHS) moved to establish a particular guardian for C under ORS 419B.366. After a hearing, the juvenile court entered an order establishing the guardianship. Father appeals from that order and raises eight assignments of error. We write to address his first and fourth assignments of error and reject his remaining assignments of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In his first assignment of error, father contends that the juvenile court entered the order after a combined permanency and guardianship hearing and that the court erred in failing to include in the order the permanency determinations required by ORS 419B.476(5). In his fourth assignment of error, father asserts that there is no evidence to support the court\u2019s determination under ORS 419B.366(5)(c) that the \u201cproposed guardian is suitable to meet the needs of the ward and is willing to accept the duties and authority of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>guardian.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the court erred in failing to include in the order the required permanency plan determination and that there was sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that the guardian was suitable and willing. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Father does not request that we exercise our discretion to conduct <em>de novo </em>review in this case, and we perceive no reason to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (the court will exercise discretion to try the cause anew on the record only in exceptional cases). Accordingly, we \u201creview the juvenile court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law but are bound by its findings of historical fact if there is any evidence in the record to support them.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. S., </em>246 Or App 341, 344, 265 P3d 792 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 586 (2012). In light of that standard, we state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, as supplemented with uncontroverted facts from the record. <em>See State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">C was found to be within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction in August 2009. In August 2010, the juvenile court approved a change in the permanency plan for C from reunification to guardianship pursuant to ORS 419B.476. Sometime later, father, who lived in Missouri, requested that the permanency plan be changed back to reunification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In June 2011, DHS moved to establish guardianship and proposed C\u2019s step-grandmother as guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Both issues came before the court at a hearing held on July 22, 2011. At that hearing, father indicated that he was still seeking to change the permanency plan for C to reunification and that he was contesting DHS\u2019s motion to establish guardianship. Father noted that his home state, Missouri, was willing to initiate a home study of father through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), ORS 417.200 to 417.260. He requested that the hearing be continued pending the results of that study.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">C\u2019s attorney opposed that request and asked the court to \u201cproceed with the permanency hearing * * * and then effectuate the guardianship.\u201d The court acknowledged that the hearing was, in part, a permanency hearing for C, and it agreed to continue the hearing, noting that \u201cit\u2019s important that we get the information from the ICPC.\u201d The court then instructed the parties to set a date for the continued hearing \u201cabout 60 days out\u201d and noted that the continued hearing would serve as the yearly permanency hearing for C required by ORS 419B.470(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The continued hearing was held before a different judge on September 30, 2011. Before that hearing, on September 21, 2011, DHS submitted a document \u2014 which was later received by the court as an exhibit \u2014 that identified the purpose of the September 30 hearing as a \u201cContested Guardianship/Permanency Hearing.\u201d However, at the hearing, counsel for DHS stated only that the parties were there for a \u201ccontinuation of the guardianship [hearing]\u201d regarding C. Counsel for DHS also suggested that the hearing had been set for a permanency hearing for father\u2019s other child, T, but that, because T\u2019s plan had already been changed and T was not yet due for a yearly permanency hearing, \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll need another permanency hearing judgment out of today\u2019s hearing.\u201d Additionally, counsel for DHS noted that \u201c[t]he proposed guardian * * * is here today. She\u2019s already been previously questioned by Judge Prall in this case and been found to be a fit and willing proposed guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In response, father\u2019s counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cYour [H]onor, first of all, if I might address the issue of [T], This matter was continued as a permanency hearing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to [T] as well as [C]. And it was also set regarding the guardianship finalization for [C].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">\u201cThe reason that I had asked that it be set that way was that, just prior to the last court hearing, we found out that Missouri was willing to do a new ICPC as to [father]. So we wanted to leave open the opportunity today to ask that the plan on both girls be changed to return to parent, namely [father] in Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cEarlier this week, my staff spoke with the actual worker in Missouri who did the home study, and she reported that they were denying placement. I had a chance to share that with [father] earlier in the week, and he indicates that he\u2019s going to be challenging that through the state of Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cIn any case, I would withdraw the request that today be a permanency hearing as to [T].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The court responded, \u201cThe prior order as to [T] will stand and we won\u2019t need to set a new permanency judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Then, after a brief introduction by counsel, father and the court engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Thank you, [father]. This is an opportunity for you to let the court know why you have a continuing objection to this guardianship for [C]. So your lawyer may have some specific questions for you, but I just want to give you an opportunity to just tell me in your own words what your complaints are about, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">\u201c[FATHER]: First off, my first home study was failed because of my alcohol use. What is upsetting me now is the home study was denied again because my sister accidentally cleaned her car out, put beer bottles in my trash can, and I got denied. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fairly being judged here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you understand, sir, that this court doesn\u2019t have any power to change the outcome of your home study, and it does make it impossible for this court to grant your request to have [C] live with you. And I understand you\u2019re going to go ahead and appeal that. And if something new happens, then we may be in a different posture. But it would appear to me, sir, because of the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that home study that you are, at least for purposes of this hearing, kind of at a dead end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201c[FATHER]: At a dead end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: If there\u2019s other information I need to hear about, tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u201c[FATHER]: Well, today you guys want me to turn around and give guardianship from my daughter, which I do not and I will never agree with that, because I\u2019m the one that made that girl. I am the one that\u2019s supposed to be talking to her on the phone, which the court denied me of that. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t even get letters from her very seldom, and I don\u2019t appreciate that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cAnd yes, I do not agree with this guardianship today, no matter what goes on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. I think you\u2019ve made your position quite clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Following additional questioning by father\u2019s counsel and counsel for DHS, and questioning by the court regarding the issue of father\u2019s contact with C, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u201cOkay. Appointments are terminated today. And with respect to the findings, it seems to me that those findings with respect to the mandatory statutory findings were already made by Judge Prall. Nothing has happened in this hearing which would cause this court to deter from the previous findings made by Judge Prall that the guardianship is in the ward\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">\u201cI think, counselor, in essence, stipulating that adoption is not an appropriate plan and that those efforts have been exhausted, and that happened in prior hearings that I was not a party to. And this was simply a question of whether we could have a return to father plan for [C] or not. And since he\u2019s failed his home study again, that door would appear to be closed unless he\u2019s successful in an appeal, in which case I\u2019m sure he will be letting you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">\u201cIs there anything else we need to do for the record today?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Father\u2019s counsel did not respond to the court\u2019s inquiry. The court ultimately entered the order establishing a guardianship under ORS 419B.366. That order did not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>any of the permanency determinations required by ORS 419B.476(5), including a determination of the permanency plan under ORS 419B.476(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In father\u2019s first assignment of error, he contends that the juvenile court erred in entering an order after the September 30 hearing that did not comply with the requirements of ORS 419B.476(5). As noted, that statute requires a court to enter a written order within 20 days after a permanency hearing that includes a determination regarding the permanency plan for the ward and predicate findings supporting that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Father acknowledges that he did not raise that issue below. However, he asserts that, under the principles established in <em>State ex rel DHS v. M. A. (A139693), </em>227 Or App 172, 205 P3d 36 (2009), he was not required to do so. In that case, we held that preservation principles are inapplicable to claims that the court erred in failing to make the required findings under ORS 419B.476(5). <em>M. A, </em>227 Or App at 182 (\u201cHere, the statute dictates that the required findings be made \u2014 not at the time of hearing \u2014 but in an order issued within 20 days after the hearing. Until that order issued, mother had no way of knowing that the court would enter a judgment that did not comply with the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.)); <em>see also Dept. of Human Services v. W. F., </em>240 Or App 443, 247 P3d 329 (2011) (reversing and remanding judgment that did not comply with ORS 419B.476(5), despite lack of objection below); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. W., </em>239 Or App 596, 244 P3d 922 (2010) (same). Alternatively, father argues that the error is apparent on the record, ORAP 5.45(1), and that we should exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">DHS concedes that the order entered in this case does not contain any of the permanency findings required by ORS 419B.476(5) and that, \u201cin a number of other cases, this court has concluded that preservation is not required with respect to claims of error relating to deficient permanency judgments.\u201d However, DHS contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>M. A. </em>and its progeny because it is not clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>whether the September 30 hearing was, in fact, a permanency hearing. Although DHS acknowledges that the July 22 hearing was a permanency hearing, it suggests that it is at least plausible that father abandoned his request for a permanency determination regarding C at the September 30 hearing. In DHS\u2019s view, because it is unclear whether father abandoned his request for a permanency determination regarding C, father was required to preserve his claim that the court erred in failing to make the required permanency plan determinations in its subsequent order. For the same reason, DHS asserts that any error by the court was not plain and that, in any event, we should not exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">As an initial matter, we conclude that the September 30 hearing was a permanency hearing and that father did not abandon his request for a permanency plan determination regarding C. Father\u2019s counsel explained to the court that the \u201cmatter was continued as a permanency hearing as to [T] as well as [C].\u201d Then, father\u2019s counsel explicitly withdrew \u201cthe request that today be a permanency hearing as to [T].\u201d That withdrawal as to T cannot be understood as a simultaneous withdrawal of father\u2019s request for a permanency hearing as to C. In fact, read together, father\u2019s counsel\u2019s statements to the court are an explicit indication of father\u2019s continued desire for a permanency plan determination regarding C. Moreover, the court\u2019s own statement at the conclusion of the hearing that \u201cthis was simply a question of whether we could have a return to father plan for C\u201d illustrates that the court understood that father was still seeking a permanency plan determination. Finally, the hearing was scheduled as the yearly permanency hearing for C required by ORS 419B.470(6); accordingly, even if father had explicitly withdrawn his request for a permanency hearing, the court was obligated by statute to conduct a permanency hearing and make a permanency plan determination regarding C.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Given all of that, we conclude that the court erred in failing to decide the issue before it \u2014 whether the permanency plan for C should remain guardianship or be changed to reunification \u2014 as required by ORS 419B.476(5)(b). Again, that statute requires the court to enter a written order within 20 days after a permanency hearing that includes, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>other things, the \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of the permanency plan for the ward.\u201d Here, the court entered an order within 20 days of the September 30 permanency hearing that did not contain an express determination of the permanency plan for C. Accordingly, the court erred under <em>M. A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">DHS contends that any error relating to a deficiency in the court\u2019s order is unpreserved because father failed to respond to the court\u2019s inquiry of whether \u201cthere is anything else we need to do for the record today.\u201d We disagree. ORS 419B.476(5) requires the court to \u201center an order * * * after the permanency hearing\u201d on the \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of the permanency plan.\u201d The court\u2019s post-hearing obligation to determine the permanency issue with a written order was not \u201canything else [it] need[ed] to do for the record today,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>something that the court needed to do at the time of the hearing and for purposes of completing the hearing record. Defendant was not invited to remind the court of that different obligation. His failure to do so did not mislead the court or DHS. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. D. D., </em>238 Or App 134, 241 P3d 1177 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 602 (2011) (declining plain error review of failure to make findings at a dependency hearing and distinguishing review of post-hearing obligations to make findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In father\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he contends that there was no evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that the \u201cproposed guardian is suitable to meet the needs of the ward and is willing to accept the duties and authority of a guardian.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings to determine if there is any evidence in the record to support them. <em>N. S., </em>246 Or App at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>We conclude that there was evidence to support the court\u2019s factual determination that the proposed guardian was suitable and willing. Preliminarily, we note that father\u2019s expressed opposition to the appointment of the guardian was solely because \u201cI\u2019m the one that made that girl.\u201d Father never raised an issue of the guardian\u2019s fitness, not even when the court suggested that father might have problems with the guardian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In any event, the record supports the court\u2019s suitability determination. DHS\u2019s motion to establish guardianship contained an attached affidavit of counsel in support of that motion. Because the affidavit was before the court and no objections appear in the record and no party argues otherwise on appeal, we assume that the court considered the contents of the affidavit and that it implicitly received it into evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The affidavit included a statement that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Department of Human Services has determined that [the proposed guardian] is able and willing to assume the role of guardian and is the most appropriate placement for the child. The child has an excellent relationship with this placement.\u201d The affidavit testimony is sufficient support \u2014 at least without any evidence or objection to the contrary \u2014 for the court\u2019s determination that the guardian was suitable and willing. It meets our \u201cany evidence\u201d standard of review. The court did not err in adopting the suitability and willingness finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> ORS 419B.476 sets out the required determinations to be made during and following a permanency hearing.

Dept. v. J. F. B., </em>230 Or App 106, 214 P3d 827 (2009) (stating that principle); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. L., </em>247 Or App 351, 268 P3d 801 (2011) (same); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. G. E., </em>233 Or App 618, 227 P3d 1180 (2010) (same). This case is distinguishable from that line of cases. Here, father appeals from a single order that followed a hearing concerning two separate issues: (1) whether the court should grant father\u2019s motion to change C\u2019s permanency plan to reunification under ORS 419B.476 and (2) whether the court should allow DHS\u2019s motion to establish a guardianship under ORS 419B.366. ORS 419B.366(5) allows the juvenile court to grant a motion for guardianship whenever \u201cthe court has approved a plan of guardianship under ORS 419B.476.\u201d As we have noted, at the time of that hearing, the permanency plan for C was guardianship. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Notwithstanding the efficiencies of deciding both requests together, the court\u2019s establishment of a guardianship under ORS 419B.366 was independent of its obligation to decide father\u2019s request for a permanency plan change. Accordingly, our review of the merits of the order establishing a guardianship is not premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> Father was angry and confrontational in some of his written and oral communications to T and C, in the words of the court, as a \u201cplatform for your grievances.\u201d The court urged father to moderate his letters to more loving thoughts and indicated that \u201cit\u2019s important for you to recognize that not all of this is something that is done to you by either the State of Oregon or the guardians in this case, but has to do with the underlying relationship that you have, or in your case don\u2019t really have, with your daughters.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you want to be pissed off at the guardians, you can write a separate letter to them, but leave the kids out of it because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">\u201c[FATHER]: Exc\u00faseme?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014they don\u2019t care.

The contents of the affidavit related to the prospective status and best interests of C and the suitability and willingness of the prospective guardian, and not the ward\u2019s past history or current prognosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\"> Father also asserts, in part, that the court erred in relying on \u201cthe mandatory statutory findings [that] were already made by Judge Prall.\u201d However, there is nothing in the record to confirm that Judge Prall had previously made findings on whether the proposed guardian in this case was suitable and willing or to suggest that the court relied on evidence presented by DHS at previous hearings. Read in context, the court\u2019s statement that \u201cnothing has happened in this hearing which would cause this court to deter from the previous findings made by Judge Prall that the guardianship is in the ward\u2019s best interests\u201d appears to be a statement regarding the court\u2019s decision not to change the permanency plan for C. Accordingly, we reject that argument without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
