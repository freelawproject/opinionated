Later, Bridge City Watersports sold the same boat and trailer to a third party in a transaction that was also financed by KeyBank. Plaintiff filed a claim against Bridge City Watersports and KeyBank for negligence. Defendant KeyBank<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed an ORCP 21 A(8) motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted. Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint, and defendant filed an answer and affirmative defense. However, the trial court concluded that plaintiff lacked authority to file that amended complaint, and the trial court entered a judgment dismissing the claim against KeyBank. Because we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs amended complaint against KeyBank and in entering judgment for KeyBank, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s order granting KeyBank\u2019s motion to dismiss, we accept all well-pleaded allegations from the complaint as true and give plaintiff the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be drawn from the allegations. <em>Scovill v. City of Astoria, </em>324 Or 159, 164, 921 P2d 1312 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In November 2006, plaintiff bought a new boat and trailer from Bridge City Watersports. The purchase price of the boat and trailer was approximately $90,000. To finance the purchase, plaintiff obtained a consumer installment loan from KeyBank. The boat and trailer were registered in plaintiffs name; plaintiff held title and KeyBank maintained a security interest. Plaintiff stored the boat and trailer at Bridge City Watersports, and plaintiff made all monthly payments in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In November 2007, Bridge City Watersports sold plaintiffs boat and trailer to a third party named Messmer, and KeyBank financed Messmer\u2019s purchase of plaintiffs boat and trailer. At the time of the sale and financing of plaintiffs boat and trailer to Messmer, KeyBank and Bridge City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Watersports were both aware that plaintiff owned the boat and trailer. At the time of the 2007 sale, plaintiff did not know that his boat and trailer had been sold to Messmer or that KeyBank had financed the purchase. Later, plaintiff discovered his boat and trailer had been sold without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">In December 2009, plaintiff filed a complaint against KeyBank, Bridge City Watersports, and a Bridge City Watersports employee, claiming negligence. Plaintiff alleged that, as a result of KeyBank financing Messmer\u2019s purchase, plaintiff had been denied the use and enjoyment of his boat and trailer. Plaintiff also alleged that, as a result of the sale and financing of the boat and trailer, \u201c[t]he value of the boat has markedly deteriorated, and is now estimated to be $60,000.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff further alleged that, \u201c[a]s a result of the conduct of KeyBank, Bridge City Watersports, and [its employee], plaintiff has suffered damages in an amount to be determined at trial but believed to exceed $140,000, as follows: value of boat and trailer, $100,000; loss of profits from the use of the boat $40,000.\u201d Plaintiff also filed a claim for relief against Bridge City Watersports and the employee for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">KeyBank filed a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8), arguing that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim because plaintiffs claim was barred by the economic loss doctrine and that plaintiffs damages were caused by the intervening criminal conduct of Bridge City Watersports, and not KeyBank\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On March 29, 2010, the trial court granted KeyBank\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ruled, \u201cPlaintiffs losses do not arise from any injury to person or property and are therefore economic losses within the meaning of the economic loss doctrine. Nor is there any special relationship between KeyBank and plaintiff that might avoid the application of the doctrine.\u201d The court also stated, \u201cDefendant KeyBank also claims that the intervening criminal acts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>other defendants insulate it from liability to the plaintiff. That contention is supported by the decision in <em>Buchler [v. Oregon Corrections Div., </em>316 Or 499, 853 P2d 798] (1993).\u201d The court\u2019s order does not specify whether the motion to dismiss was granted with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On April 9, plaintiff filed and served a first amended complaint, claiming that KeyBank breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing; plaintiff also alleged claims against Bridge City Watersports and its employee for negligence and conversion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 21, KeyBank filed an \u201cAnswer and First Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint.\u201d That answer was the first responsive pleading that KeyBank filed. KeyBank\u2019s answer alleged that \u201cKeyBank objects to the Complaint on the grounds that on or about March 29, 2010, the court ordered the case against KeyBank dismissed, without leave to amend. Thus, KeyBank denies the allegations in the Complaint in their entirety.\u201d Plaintiff objected to KeyBank\u2019s request to enter judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In an \u201cOrder Allowing Entry of Judgment,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201cThe right to replead under ORCP 21 A is contingent. In this case it was neither sought by the plaintiff nor granted by the court. There being no authority for the filing of an amended complaint, neither it nor the answer filed in response to it are sufficient to avoid the entry of a judgment in favor of defendant KeyBank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">On May 17, the court entered a judgment of dismissal and money award, dismissing plaintiffs claims against KeyBank. Later, the court entered a corrected limited judgment of dismissal and money award.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred in entering judgment for KeyBank, because plaintiff could amend the complaint once as a matter of right under ORCP 23 A before KeyBank filed a responsive pleading. KeyBank relies on ORCP 21 A to argue that the trial court did not err in entering judgment because the court had not granted leave for plaintiff to file an amended complaint. For the reasons that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>follow, we agree with plaintiff that the trial court erred in entering a judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A for errors of law. <em>Yanney v. Koehler, </em>147 Or App 269, 272, 935 P2d 1235, <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 368 (1997). Under ORCP 23 A, a party may amend a pleading once as a matter of right before a responsive pleading is served. <em>Quillen v. Rosehurg Forest Products, Inc., </em>159 Or App 6, 10, 976 P2d 91 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, plaintiff amended his complaint once before KeyBank served a responsive pleading. It would appear that, under the plain language of ORCP 23 A, plaintiff had a right to file an amended complaint as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">KeyBank contends, however, that, once the court grants a motion to dismiss, ORCP 21A provides the exclusive procedure for filing an amended complaint. ORCP 21 A provides, in part, \u201cIf the court grants a motion to dismiss, the court may enter judgment in favor of the moving party or grant leave to file an amended complaint.\u201d <em>See also </em>ORCP 25 A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, KeyBank argues that plaintiff was required to seek permission from the court to file an amended complaint and, because plaintiff failed to do so, the trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>not err in entering judgment in favor of KeyBank. KeyBank asserts that \u201c[p]laintiff s interpretation of ORCP 23 A would nullify the court\u2019s authority under ORCP 21A to enter judgment and render superfluous the court\u2019s authority to grant leave to file an amended complaint.\u201d Neither party attempts to harmonize ORCP 21A and ORCP 23 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Reading ORCP 23 A and ORCP 21 A together, we conclude that a party may amend a complaint once as a matter of right before a responsive pleading is served, even if the court has dismissed the complaint. It is only if the trial court grants a motion to dismiss after the plaintiff has already filed an amended complaint or the defendant has filed a responsive pleading, that, under ORCP 21 A, the plaintiff must file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. <em>See Caldeen Construction v. Kemp, </em>248 Or App 82, 90, 273 P3d 174 (2012) (holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint under ORCP 21 A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court erred in refusing to allow plaintiff to file an amended complaint as a matter of right.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In addition, neither party cites ORCP 15 B(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cIf the court grants a motion and an amended pleading is allowed or required, such pleading shall be filed within 10 days after service of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">After oral argument, this court requested that the parties address the effect, if any, of ORCP 15 B(2) on the resolution of the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In <em>Patterson v. Wasner, </em>128 Or App 254, 875 P2d 506 (1994), we considered whether the trial court erred in dismissing an amended complaint when the defendants had not yet challenged the amended complaint. The plaintiffs argued that they were allowed, as a matter of right, to file an amended complaint because the trial court had granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defendant\u2019s ORCP 21 A(8) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58. We agreed with the plaintiffs that ORCP 23 A allowed an amended pleading in some circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 258. However, we explained that ORCP 15 B(2) required that the amended pleading be filed within 10 days after service of the order granting the ORCP 21 A(8) motion. <em>Id. </em>The record revealed that the plaintiffs had not filed their amended complaint within 10 days of the order dismissing their complaint. We held that the trial court did not err in disregarding the untimely filed amended complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Here, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. Under ORCP 15 B(2), an amended complaint was \u201crequired\u201d in order for plaintiff to continue his claim against all the defendants. Plaintiff had 10 days to file an amended complaint unless the order of dismissal \u201cotherwise directs.\u201d The order of dismissal was silent on that issue. The trial court took the motion to dismiss under advisement after oral argument on the motion. The order of dismissal was filed on March 29, 2010. The court, and not one of the parties, prepared and presumably mailed the order to the parties the day the order was filed. Plaintiffs amended complaint has a date stamp of April 9.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiff also filed a certificate of service stating that plaintiff served the amended complaint on April 9, by mailing a copy of the amended complaint to KeyBank\u2019s attorney. ORCP 10 discusses how time is calculated under the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure. Consistently with ORCP 10 A, the date on which the order was filed \u2014 that is, March 29 \u2014 is not included in computing the time period. ORCP 10 C provides that, when a party is required to act after the service of a paper served by mail, three days shall be added to the proscribed time period. Thus, under ORCP 15 B(2), plaintiff had 10 days after the service of the order of dismissal to file an amended complaint, plaintiff complied with that requirement by filing on April 9, and the trial court therefore erred in dismissing plaintiffs amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Plaintiff also contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for negligence in his original complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>against KeyBank on the grounds that the \u201ceconomic loss doctrine\u201d precluded the claim and plaintiffs damages were caused by the intervening criminal acts of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On a pretrial motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A, \u201cthe trial court can dismiss only if the pleading on its face fails to state a claim.\u201d <em>Business Men\u2019s Service Co. v. Union Gospel Ministries, </em>120 Or App 228, 229, 852 P2d 199 (1993) (emphasis omitted). Under the economic loss doctrine, a party is not liable for negligently causing a stranger\u2019s purely economic loss without injuring the person or his or her property. <em>Harris v. Suniga, </em>344 Or 301, 308, 310-11, 180 P3d 12 (2008) (holding that dry rot in an apartment building constituted property damage, not an \u201ceconomic loss\u201d). Appellate courts \u201cuse the term \u2018economic losses\u2019 to describe financial losses such as indebtedness incurred and return of monies paid, as distinguished from damages for injury to person or property.\u201d <em>Onita Pacific Corp. v. Trustees of Bronson, </em>315 Or 149, 159 n 6, 843 P2d 890 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In his complaint, plaintiff alleged that, as a result of the sale and financing of the boat and trailer to Messmer, plaintiff lost the use and enjoyment of his boat for two years; furthermore, he alleged that the boat, when returned, was less valuable as a result of someone else\u2019s use. Those allegations describe an injury beyond \u201cpurely economic loss.\u201d <em>See Harris, </em>344 Or at 310 (explaining that every physical injury to property could be characterized as a species of economic loss but that Oregon courts have used the term \u201c \u2018economic losses\u2019 to describe \u2018financial losses such as indebtedness incurred and return of monies paid, as distinguished from damages for injury to person or property.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Onita Pacific Corp., </em>315 Or at 159 n 6) (emphasis omitted)). When plaintiffs complaint is construed to give him the benefit of all favorable inferences, the alleged injuries are not limited to economic loss. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint based on the economic loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We turn next to KeyBank\u2019s intervening criminal acts argument. In <em>Buckler, </em>the court stated that \u201cmere \u2018facilitation\u2019 of an unintended adverse result, where intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>intentional criminality of another person is the harm-producing force, does not cause the harm so as to support liability for it.\u201d 316 Or at 511-12. However, this is not a case in which we can tell from the pleadings that there was an \u201cintervening\u201d criminal act that would render the harm to plaintiff unforeseeable as a matter of law. Plaintiff alleged that KeyBank knew that plaintiff owned the boat and trailer but financed the second sale from Bridge City Watersports to Messmer anyway, creating an unreasonable risk that plaintiff would lose his boat and trailer. This situation \u2014 where KeyBank allegedly knew or should have known that it was facilitating the very harm that ultimately befell plaintiff \u2014 is not the type of situation in which a subsequent act by a third party severs the causal link as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> We will refer to KeyBank as the only defendant because neither Bridge City Watersports nor its employee filed an appearance in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> Plaintiff alleged that, at the time of his purchase, there were only nine hours on the motor but, at the time of the complaint, there were 1,000 hours on the motor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> The order was signed and filed on March 29,2010, but it was not entered until April 1,2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> The amended complaint was entered on April 15, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> ORCP 23 A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cA pleading may be amended by a party once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served.

By amending a pleading pursuant to this section, the party amending such pleading shall not be deemed thereby to have waived the right to challenge the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In addition, ORCP 25 B states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">\u201cIf a pleading is amended, whether pursuant to sections A or B of Rule 23 or section A of this rule or pursuant to other rule or statute, a party who has filed and received a court\u2019s ruling on any motion directed to the preceding pleading does not waive any defenses or objections asserted in such motion by failing to reassert them against the amended pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> We note that the issue in <em>Caldeen </em>was framed in terms of the court\u2019s discretion and, consequently, we did not address the \u201conce as a matter of course\u201d issue in that case either explicitly or implicitly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\"> Although the parties do not cite ORCP 25 A, we note that ORCP 25 A can also be harmonized for the same reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> ORCP 9 E provides that the filing with the court occurs when the clerk endorses the pleading with the date and time of the filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
