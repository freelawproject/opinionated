J.</author>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Defendant, who was convicted following a conditional plea of guilty to one count of possession of heroin, ORS 475.854, and one count of possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, appeals. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress (1) physical evidence of methamphetamine possession, and derivative inculpatory statements, obtained after an officer elicited defendant\u2019s consent to remove an item from his pocket; and (2) evidence of heroin possession discovered during a subsequent booking inventory of items, including the contents of closed containers, in defendant\u2019s possession. We reject without published discussion defendant\u2019s challenge pertaining to the methamphetamine-related evidence, but, as explained below, we conclude that the inspection of the contents of the closed containers, two \u201ccanister vials,\u201d was not authorized by the applicable inventory policy and, thus, was unlawful. Consequently, because defendant\u2019s conditional guilty plea was predicated on a suppression ruling that was, in part, erroneous, we reverse and remand for further proceedings. <em>See, e.g., State v. Tannehill, </em>341 Or 205, 210-12, 141 P3d 584 (2006); <em>State v. Dahlen, </em>209 Or App 110, 146 P3d 359, <em>modified on recons, </em>210 Or App 362, 149 P3d 1234 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The circumstances material to the discovery of the heroin-related evidence in the course of the booking inventory are undisputed. After defendant was arrested following the discovery of methamphetamine-related evidence on his person,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was transported to the Marion County correctional facility. At that facility, a deputy responsible for intake saw that defendant had two \u201ccanister vials\u201d hanging from his belt. Those canisters were \u201csmall metal cylinder[s] about the size of a lipstick tube, * * * half an inch in diameter, with a screw-on lid, fairly weather tight.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>responsible for defendant\u2019s intake had never before seen such a container and believed that they \u201clikely [could] contain a contraband item,\u201d including \u201ca small amount of drugs, matches, [a] cigarette, [or a] sharp object.\u201d The deputy then opened the canisters, and the contents of one tested positively as heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The deputy asserted and believed that, in opening the canisters and inspecting their contents, he was acting in accordance with Marion County Sheriffs Office Policy 3315, pertaining to \u201cinmate personal property\u201d (Policy 3315). That policy establishes \u201cwritten guidelines for the receiving and storing [of] inmate personal property\u201d and is intended to \u201censure that all inmate personal property, including monies, is received, recorded, stored, and released in a safe, secure and systematic manner in accordance with the law.\u201d Under that policy, as pertinent here, \u201cwhen taking custody of a prisoner\u2019s property for temporary storage,\u201d deputies engaged in the inmate booking/intake process are required (subject to certain exceptions) to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201c[o]pen closed containers <em>designed to typically carry </em>identification, cash, valuables, medications or contraband.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">(Emphasis added.) Unlike many other \u201cdesigned to hold\u201dcircumscribed inventory policies, Policy 3315 does not include any illustrative reference to examples of items encompassed within its scope.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All items of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>property, including but not limited to valuables, must be taken from the inmate, listed on an inventory form, and safely stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">After being charged with one count of possession of methamphetamine and one count of possession of heroin, defendant, as noted, moved to suppress, <em>inter alia, </em>the heroin found in the one \u201ccanister/vial.\u201d He argued, in part, that the opening and inspection of the contents of the canisters exceeded the authorized scope of the inventory policy because the canisters were not items \u2014 akin to purses, wallets, or suitcases \u2014 that were \u201cdesigned to typically carry\u201d valuables or contraband. The trial court denied suppression, reasoning that, because \u201c[t]he vials opened at the jail were of a type that <em>could contain </em>contraband\u201d (emphasis added), the \u201csearch of the vials was legal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Defendant then entered into a conditional plea of guilty to both of the charged offenses. The addendum to the plea petition specified that the purpose of the conditional plea was \u201cto reserve the defendant\u2019s right of review of the trial court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Suppress.\u201d Thus, the conditional plea was an integrated whole \u2014 it did not purport to differentiate between the two charges and to condition the plea as to either of those charges on the ultimate appellate outcome with respect to the suppression of evidence relating only to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s argument as to the heroin-related evidence is unadorned: (1) Policy 3315, by its terms, authorizes the opening only of those \u201cclosed containers [that are] <em>designed to typically carry </em>identification, cash, valuables, medications or contraband\u201d (emphasis added); and (2) although the trial court found that the canisters <em>\u201ccould </em>contain contraband\u201d (emphasis added), \u201cdesigned to typically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>carry\u201d and \u201ccould contain\u201d are qualitatively different concepts \u2014 and the record adduced at the suppression hearing does not permit a determination that the canisters satisfied the former, and expressly applicable, standard. The state responds that the opening and inspection of the contents of the canisters was authorized under Policy 3315 because the totality of the circumstances, viewed objectively, demonstrates that a reasonable person \u201ccould expect to find valuables in metal containers with weather-tight, screw-on lids that are physically attached to a person\u2019s belt.\u201d (Emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">We note, at the outset, that the issue presented in this case is materially distinct from that presented in <em>State v. Cordova, </em>250 Or App 397, 280 P3d 1036 (2012), and <em>State v. Taylor, </em>250 Or App 90, 279 P3d 254 (2012), both of which we decided very recently. In <em>Cordova, </em>the issue was whether the applicable provision of the inventory policy, which purported to authorize the opening and inspection of the contents of \u201c[a]ll closed containers that could contain valuables,\u201d 250 Or App at 399, was unconstitutionally overbroad. There was no question that, if that provision were constitutionally valid, the items opened and inspected \u2014 a small safe and a can with a false bottom, which was found in the safe \u2014 were within the scope of that provision. We concluded that the inventory provision was, by its terms, impermissibly overbroad because, given that \u201cany closed container <em>could, </em>regardless of <em>objective likelihood, </em>contain valuables * * * the policy, as a practical matter, necessarily requires officers to open and inspect the contents of every opaque closed container.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In <em>Taylor, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s determination that the contents of a closed cigarette box that the police had seized from the defendant\u2019s pocket and searched at the time of his arrest would inevitably have been lawfully discovered pursuant to a subsequent jailhouse booking inventory. In so holding, we concluded that the purportedly applicable inventory provision was unconstitutional as overbroad in that it was \u201cnot, in fact, limited to opening only those containers that are objectively likely to contain contraband[,]\u201d but, instead, required an officer \u201cto search property that he or she deem[s] appropriate,\u2019 without regard to whether the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>will further the security of the facility.\u201d 250 Or App at 98. We further concluded that the policy was defective \u201cbecause it contains no complete and meaningful limitation on the scope of the inventory\u201d and, thus, \u201ceffectively authorizes a search of all property, including any closed container, regardless of what the container is objectively likely to hold.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Here, in contrast, the pivotal question is not whether the terms of Policy 3315 are unconstitutionally overbroad or permit some impermissible exercise of officer discretion. Rather, the issue is whether the canisters fell within the scope of the policy\u2019s <em>mandate </em>\u2014 viz., whether the canisters were \u201cclosed containers designed to typically carry identification, cash, valuables, medications or contraband.\u201d <em>Accord, e.g., Keady, </em>236 Or App at 534 (noting and emphasizing distinction between items \u201cdesigned to contain valuables\u201d and those that are \u201coften used to hold valuables\u201d for purposes of applying inventory policy that authorized inspection of the former but not the latter (emphasis omitted)); <em>State v. Swanson, </em>187 Or App 477, 484-85, 68 P3d 265 (2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In resolving that question, we note that this case is unlike most involving the application of a \u201cdesigned to hold\u201d or \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d inventory provision. That is so both because of the content of the operative provision here and because of the character of the closed containers at issue here. With respect to the content of the policy, this is \u2014 we believe \u2014 the first time that the court has encountered a provision requiring an inventory of closed containers \u201cdesigned to <em>typically </em>carry\u201d various items. (Emphasis added.) The significance of the additional adverb is inscrutable, in that, as a practical matter, appellate decisions construing and applying \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d (or \u201cto hold\u201d) inventory provisions have, effectively, understood them to incorporate a \u201ctypically\u201d limitation. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bean, </em>150 Or App 223, 226 n 4, 229, 946 P2d 292 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 448 (1998) (inventory of contents of fanny pack was lawful under policy mandating inventory of closed containers \u201cdesigned for carrying money and/or small valuables on or about the person\u201d). Without such an implicit limitation \u2014 if, for example, \u201cdesigned to hold\u201d provisions could be understood as \u201cdesigned to <em>potentially </em>hold\u201d \u2014 then, because virtually any closed container <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>could </em>hold valuables or contraband, the policy would be impermissibly overbroad. <em>See, e.g., Cordova, </em>250 Or App at 402-04.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The containers at issue \u2014 the canisters \u2014 are also atypical. Many of our \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d/\u201cdesigned to hold\u201d precedents involved either: (1) containers that are classically designed to hold valuables, in that that is their manifest primary <em>purpose </em>\u2014 e.g., fanny packs <em>(Bean, </em>150 Or App at 229);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or (2) more frequently, containers that are designed to contain items other than valuables or species of contraband-\u2014 <em>e.g., </em>a \u201cfish oil capsule container\u201d <em>(Keady, </em>236 Or App at 534 (internal quotation marks omitted)) or a matchbox <em>(State v. Maynard, </em>149 Or App 293, 295, 942 P2d 851 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 448 (1998)). Here, however \u2014 at least on this record\u2014 the canisters did not fall within either of those self-evident categories. Rather, given the limited evidence adduced during the suppression hearing, a reasonable person could not say, with any degree of confidence, what the canisters were, or were not, designed to hold. Certainly, they <em>could contain or carry </em>valuables or medications or contraband \u2014 but that is hardly dispositive, and could well be immaterial, to the \u201cdesigned to typically carry\u201d standard. Further, to the extent that reasonable <em>people </em>\u2014 e.g., officers charged with implementing Policy 3315 \u2014 could differ in their understanding as to the canisters\u2019 intended/\u201cdesigned to\u201d purpose, that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>implicate impermissible discretion, notwithstanding the policy\u2019s (at least ostensibly) objective constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Not surprisingly, none of our precedents is precisely analogous, but <em>Swanson </em>is most similar. In <em>Swanson, </em>we addressed whether, in opening and inspecting the contents of a \u201cpurse accessory kit,\u201d an officer had exceeded the scope of an inventory policy\u2019s mandate that \u201c[pjurses, wallets, fanny packs, backpacks, and other similar items designed to contain valuables shall be opened and their contents shall be inventoried.\u201d 187 Or App at 479-80. In considering that question, we noted that the officer who had conducted the inventory \u201cdid not testify that the * * * container appeared to be <em>designed </em>for carrying valuables or even that he expected to find valuables when he opened the container\u201d and that when he had \u201ccome into contact with those type of containers before * * * he [had] found both valuable and nonvaluable items in them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484 (emphasis in original). With respect to the latter testimony, we observed that the fact that the officer \u201chad previously found both valuable and nonvaluable items in the type of container at issue * * * says little, by itself, about what the container was <em>designed </em>to carry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). We further emphasized that the officer \u201cdid not testify that the container was, or appeared to be, similar to a wallet, purse, coin purse, briefcase, fanny pack, backpack, or other item designed to contain valuables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s conclusion, apparently based on the judge\u2019s personal understanding that women often do use such containers to carry valuables, begs the essential question of whether the container was designed to do so. Without the container in evidence and based solely on [the officer\u2019s] description of it, the trial court lacked a basis for making an implicit finding that the container was \u2018designed to contain valuables.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We return to the uncontroverted facts of this case. Here, as in <em>Swanson, </em>the containers at issue are not in evidence, and the deputy who conducted the inventory did not testify that the canisters were \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d valuables or contraband. Neither in itself is necessarily dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>because, at least in some instances, the purposes for which a container was designed can be circumstantially inferred from, <em>inter alia, </em>structural features of the item. For example, even if there was no testimony that a purse or wallet or coin purse was designed to carry \u2014 or \u201ctypically carry\u201d \u2014 currency or valuables, a court, in resolving a motion to suppress, could certainly so determine. Here, however, there is no evidence that the canisters shared structural features with closed containers commonly and consistently deemed to be \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d identification, cash, valuables, medications, or contraband. Nor is there any evidence that the canisters had features discretely, even if not uniquely, related to such a purpose. To be sure, the canisters were durable and closed tightly \u2014 but the same could be said of myriad, generic closed containers. Further \u2014 and strikingly \u2014 the deputy candidly acknowledged that, in the course of his work as a booking officer, he had never before seen a similar container, and, except for referring to the canisters as being \u201cabout the size of a lipstick tube,\u201d the deputy did not attempt to compare or analogize the canisters to any other containers, much less those designed to carry valuables or contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">In sum, and consistently with <em>Swanson, </em>the record developed at the suppression hearing was inadequate to establish that the canisters at issue here were \u201cclosed containers designed to typically carry identification, cash, valuables, medications or contraband.\u201d Further, even if the record could somehow permit reasonable implementing officers to draw differing inferences as to an \u201cambiguous\u201d closed container\u2019s \u201cdesigned to\u201d purpose, to sustain the inspection of the contents of such an object would interject individual variability and impermissible discretion into the policy\u2019s application. <em>See, e.g., State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 10, 688 P2d 832 (1984) (to be lawful, inventory \u201cmust be conducted pursuant to a properly authorized administrative program, designed and systematically administered <em>so that the inventory involves no exercise of discretion by the law enforcement person directing or taking the </em>inventory\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that the invasion of the canisters\u2014 and, specifically, the canister containing the heroin-related evidence \u2014 was pursuant to a lawful inventory and in denying suppression of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>We turn, finally, to the proper disposition, which is dictated by ORS 135.335(3),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as construed in <em>Tannehill. </em>In <em>Tannehill, </em>the defendant was charged with three counts of third-degree sexual abuse and one count of witness tampering. He filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the three sexual abuse counts as having not been commenced within the applicable statute of limitations, and, after the trial court denied that motion, the defendant entered a conditional guilty plea, pursuant to ORS 135.335(3), to one count of third-degree sexual abuse and one count of witness tampering. 341 Or at 207-08. On appeal, the defendant did not challenge his conviction for witness tampering but did contend that the trial court had erred in holding that the prosecution for third-degree sexual abuse was not time-barred. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s argument as to the statute of limitations, <em>id. </em>at 208-10, and then addressed the proper disposition in light of the defendant\u2019s conditional guilty plea. In particular, the court determined that the defendant was entitled under ORS 135.335(3), if he so chose, to withdraw \u201cthe entire plea rather than only part of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210-11. Accordingly, rather than reversing and remanding only with respect to the conviction for third-degree sexual abuse and affirming the conviction for witness tampering, the Supreme Court remanded the entire case to the circuit court \u201cfor further proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><em>Tannehill </em>is dispositive here. Although we have affirmed the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling with respect to the evidence on which defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of methamphetamine was based, we have also reversed the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling with respect to the heroin-related evidence. As noted, <em>see </em>250 Or App at 588, the conditional plea agreement did not differentiate between those two matters; that is, the conditional plea as to either of those charges was not predicated on the ultimate appellate outcome with respect to the suppression of evidence relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>only to that charge. Because the conditional plea agreement here was, as it was in <em>Tannehill, </em>an integrated whole, the same disposition must obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\"> That evidence included \u201cdime-size plastic baggies\u201d with methamphetamine residue. Upon discovering the baggies, police handcuffed defendant and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the ensuing continuation of the search of defendant\u2019s person yielded a set of digital scales \u201ccommonly used for weighing narcotics\u201d and two glass smoking pipes. Defendant admitted that he had used the baggies to hold his purchases of methamphetamine and had used the scales to confirm the amount of the methamphetamine purchased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> The quoted description, replicating the intake deputy\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, was the only evidence presented to the trial court \u2014 and, thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>only evidence in this record \u2014 as to the canisters\u2019 appearance and function. The canisters themselves were not admitted as exhibits or otherwise proffered for the trial court\u2019s inspection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\"> It appears that that language may he the product of our analysis and holding in <em>State v. Guerrero, </em>214 Or App 14, 162 P3d 1048 (2007), in which we addressed what appears to have been an antecedent \u201cMarion County Sheriffs department\u2019s inmate personal property policy,\u201d id. at 16, which did not \u201cdiscuss! ] what to do with closed containers or expressly authorize[ ] a deputy to open a closed container for any purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 17. In light of the policy\u2019s silence in that regard, we held that the opening and inspection, during the booking/intake process, of a closed leather case (marked \u201cPanasonic light scope\u201d) in the defendant\u2019s possession was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> <em>See, e.g., State v.

Here, however, the predicate facts pertaining to the canisters\u2019 characteristics are uncontroverted, <em>see </em>250 Or App at 586-87, and, for reasons that will become apparent shortly, a remand for reconsideration is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b611-5\"> It is possible that the inclusion of \u201ctypically\u201d was intended to import a further, and disjunctive, basis for conducting an inventory of a closed <em>container </em>\u2014 viz., that the container is \u201cobjectively <em>likely to contain\u201d </em>valuables and contraband. <em>Guerrero, </em>214 Or App at 22 (emphasis added); <em>see State v.
