On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in accepting her waiver of her right to trial by jury when, among other circumstances, defendant exhibited confusion at trial about her surroundings and was not tracking the court\u2019s waiver discussion. A discussion of the pertinent facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. The state concedes that the court should have ordered a competency evaluation under ORS 161.360 and erred in accepting the jury waiver. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
