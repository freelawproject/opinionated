We affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>court\u2019s decision to construe Wilborn\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, as his motion sought to present a new ground <em>for </em>relief <em>from </em>a judgment of conviction. Additionally, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilborn\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, as it was his second such motion and Wilborn failed to first obtain this Court\u2019s authorization to file the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir. 2002). Before a habeas petitioner may file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, the petitioner must obtain an order from this Court authorizing the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Without authorization from this Court, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We consider a Rule 60(b) motion from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion a successive motion if it presents a new ground for relief from a judgment of conviction or attacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (addressing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition). Conversely, we find a Rule 60(b) motion as permissible if \u201cneither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant\u2019s ... conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 125 S.Ct. 2641. For example, we view a Rule 60(b) motion as proper if it: (1) asserts that a federal court\u2019s previous ruling that precluded a merits-determination was in error; or (2) attacks a defect in the federal proceeding\u2019s integrity, such as a fraud upon the court. <em>See id. </em>at 532-35 n. 4-5, 125 S.Ct. 2641.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">This Court has stated that, when a federal habeas court already reached and resolved the merits of a habeas petitioner\u2019s earlier asserted claims, it views a Rule 60(b) motion challenging that decision with particular skepticism. <em>Franqui v. Florida, </em>638 F.3d 1368, 1371 (11th Cir. 2011) (addressing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition). Where the federal habeas court already denied the habeas petition on the merits, an attack based on habeas counsel\u2019s omission of a claim in an original habeas petition ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance for the Court to determine the merits favorably. <em>Id. </em>at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Wilborn\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because it sought to present a new ground for relief from a judgment of conviction. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641. Wilborn asserted that, due to ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel, claims were not raised before the district court, and he would have received relief had these claims been raised. Therefore, Wilborn effectively asked for an opportunity to raise these new claims for relief from judgment of his conviction. <em>See Franqui, </em>638 F.3d at 1371-73. Furthermore, Wil-born did not assert in his Rule 60(b) motion that the federal court\u2019s previous ruling precluding a merits determination was erroneous or attack a defect in the federal proceeding\u2019s integrity, such as a fraud upon the court. Therefore, the district court correctly construed the Rule 60(b) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Before Wilborn could file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, he needed an order from this court authorizing the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Wilborn does not assert that he received this authorization. Therefore, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>correctly dismissed Wilborn\u2019s motion as-successive. Without authorization, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Wilborn\u2019s second or successive motion. <em>See Fams, </em>333 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The district court did not err by construing Wilborn\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate because his motion sought to present a new ground for relief from a judgment of conviction. Additionally, the district court did not err by dismissing Wilborn\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, as it was his second such motion, and Wilborn failed to first obtain this Court\u2019s authorization to file the motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
