After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">A grand jury indicted Gonzalez on five counts, charging her with: (1) one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349; (2) three counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; and (3) one count of aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Because Gonzalez challenges only her conviction for aggravated identity theft on appeal, we summarize only the evidence relevant to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">On December 8, 2015, the government produced Amy Headley as a witness at Gonzalez\u2019s trial. Headley testified that she was previously known as \u201cAmy Elannan\u201d because of an earlier marriage, but had used the name \u201cHeadley\u201d since 1998. She also said she lived in Hialeah, Florida twenty years earlier. The government then asked Headley to examine a check that was dated May 4, 2014. Headley testified that her former name and Hialeah address were printed on the top-left comer of the check. Although the name on the signature line of the check read \u201cAmy M. Elannan,\u201d Headley stated that it was not her signature, and that she had not \u201cused that signature in years.\u201d She observed that the check was made out to an \u201cEvelyn Gonzalez\u201d for $4,000, but said she did not know anyone who went by that name or by \u201cEmelys Gonzalez.\u201d Headley also testified that she did not know the defendant and never authorized the defendant or anyone else to use her name and signature for this particular check. Victoria Spivey, an inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tigator for Bank of America, also testified for the government. She stated there was a $4,000 deposit to Gonzalez\u2019s Bank of America account on May 4, 2014 via an automated teller machine in North Hialeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">After the government finished presenting its evidence, Gonzalez moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. With regard to the aggravated identity theft count, she argued there was not enough evidence to establish that \u201cAmy M. Elannan\u201d was a name that belonged to a specific person. She also asserted acquittal was appropriate under United States v. Mitchell, 518 F.3d 230 (4th Cir. 2008). The district court denied Gonzalez\u2019s Rule 29 motion as to the aggravated identity theft count, noting Headley\u2019s testimony that she previously lived at the address listed on the check and went by the name \u201cAmy Elannan.\u201d The jury later found Gonzalez guilty on all five counts. The district court sentenced her to a total of 25-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues the district court erred when it denied her motion for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to prove the name she used to commit her offense (\u201cAmy Elannan\u201d) belonged to a specific person. Put another way, Gonzalez asserts the government presented identifying information that was too general to identify a specific person. \u201cWe review de novo the denial of a defendant\u2019s properly-preserved motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d United States v. Holmes, 814 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir. 2016). Such a denial will be upheld if, viewing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the government, \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">To sustain a conviction for aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), the government \u201cmust establish that the defendant (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another person; (3) without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in \u00a7 1028A(c),\u201d which includes bank fraud. United States v. Barrington, 648 F.3d 1178, 1192 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c)(5). The statute defines a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Gonzalez argues the government failed to meet its burden because the name and signature of \u201cAmy Elannan\u201d are not sufficiently unique to identify a specific person under Mitchell. Mitchell is a Fourth Circuit case holding that under \u00a7 1028A, \u201ca bare name ... is not likely to be sufficiently unique ... to identify a specific person.\u201d 518 F.3d at 235.. It also concluded that a false driver\u2019s license with a first and last name (\u201cMarcus Jackson\u201d), city of residence, and birth year that all matched a specific person was not sufficient to tie the false license to that person. Id. at 235-36. Even if Mitchell was binding precedent in this Circuit, it would not help Gonzalez here. The government\u2019s evidence showed Gonzalez used not only Headley\u2019s former name and signature, but also Headley\u2019s previous address, to commit bank fraud. At trial, Headley said she was previously known as \u201cAmy Elannan\u201d and used to live at the address listed on the check. She also testified that the \u201cAmy M. Elannan\u201d signature on the check was not hers, and that she never gave anyone permission to use her name and signature for the check. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could conclude that Gonzalez used the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d of a specific person\u2014Amy Headley\u2014to commit bank fraud. In other words, a check with a first name, last name, and address that all match a specific person\u2019s previous identification information contains sufficiently unique identifiers to tie the check to that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Gonzalez also argues the government failed to prove the name \u201cAmy Elannan\u201d belonged to a specific person because Headley stopped using the name \u201cElan-nan\u201d more than sixteen years before the issuance of the check and eight years before the account associated with the check was opened in 2006. She also notes that Headley had not lived at the Hialeah address listed on the check for over twenty years and was not living there when the account was opened. However, nothing in the relevant statute requires the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d to be contemporary or up-to-date. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). The identifying information need only be sufficiently unique \u201cto identify a specific indi- \u2022 vidual.\u201d H. In this case, Headley\u2019s former name and address taken together are sufficiently unique for a reasonable jury to conclude Gonzalez committed bank fraud using identifying information that belonged to a specific person.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
