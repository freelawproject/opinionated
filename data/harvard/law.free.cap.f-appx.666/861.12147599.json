He argues that (1) there was insufficient evidence to sustain his production-of-child-pornography conviction; (2) the district court both erred in refusing to provide a \u201ctheory of defense\u201d jury instruction that he requested and in providing a \u201cconsent\u201d jury instruction proposed by the government; and (3) the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. After careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">Wardlow first argues that his conviction for. production of child pornography must be reversed due to insufficient evidence. At trial, Wardlow requested a judgment of acquittal on this ground, but the district court denied the request. Wardlow\u2019s sufficiency challenge is therefore preserved, and we review the challenge de novo. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>814 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir. 2016). However, in doing so, we must view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See id. </em>If, viewing the evidence in this light, a jury could have reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>found that the evidence supports Ward-low\u2019s conviction, then we must affirm the conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">A conviction for the production of child pornography requires proof that a defendant, among other things, employed, used, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced a minor \u201cto engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a); <em>accord United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1013 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (\u201cSection 2251(a) require[s] the [g]overnment [to] prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one purpose of [the minor\u2019s] sexually explicit conduct was to produce a visual depiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Wardlow asserts that the government failed to prove that he employed, used, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct <em>for the purpose </em>of producing a visual depiction of such conduct. While Wardlow admits that he took pornographic pictures of a minor during sexual encounters with her, he argues that he did not induce the minor to engage in any sexual conduct for the purpose of taking the pictures. According to Wardlow, he was in a romantic relationship with the minor and the pictures were merely incidental to that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the record supports a finding that Wardlow induced the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing the pornographic pictures. In the pictures, the minor was lying down, engaging in sexually suggestive poses. The minor testified at trial that Wardlow made her lie down while he took the pictures. And in taking the pictures, Wardlow focused on the minor\u2019s genital area. Based on this evidence, a jury could have reasonably found that Wardlow induced the minor\u2019s sexually explicit posing for the purpose of producing pornographic pictures. <em>See Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d at 1013 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that pornographic pictures were merely incidental to a sexual encounter where the defendant took purposeful steps to facilitate the pictures).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Wardlow next argues that the district court committed reversible error by (1) refusing to provide a \u201ctheory of defense\u201d jury instruction that he requested and (2) providing a \u201cconsent\u201d jury instruction proposed by the government. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of Wardlow\u2019s request for the \u201ctheory of defense\u201d jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Rutgerson, </em>822 F.3d 1223, 1236 (11th Cir. 2016). \u201cA refusal to incorporate a requested instruction will be reversed only if (1) the requested instruction was substantively correct, (2) the court\u2019s charge to the jury did not cover the gist of the instruction, and (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to provide Wardlow\u2019s \u201ctheory of defense\u201d jury instruction; \u201cthe court\u2019s charge to the jury ... cover[ed] the gist of the instruction.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Wardlow\u2019s instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-14\">As to [the productiori-of-child pornography count in] the [i]ndictment, it is Taylor Jordan Wardlow\u2019s theory of defense that the photographs at issue in this case are the result of, and not the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tive behind, his sexual activity with the minor and, therefore, he did not induce the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct <em>for the purpose </em>of producing a photographic depiction of such conduct. If you find that the photographs were the result of, and not the motive behind, the sexual activity you must find Taylor Jordan Wardlow not guilty as to this [c]ount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Thus, the instruction emphasized that Wardlow could be found guilty of production of child pornography only if he induced the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of taking pictures. The district court\u2019s charge to the jury addressed that same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">The Defendant can be found guilty of this crime only if all the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt ,.. the Defendant employed, used, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction, of the conduct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Indeed, this instruction closely tracked the production-of-child-pornography statute\u2019s \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 language upon which Wardlow\u2019s \u201ctheory of defense\u201d jury instruction relied. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">We review the \u201cconsent\u201d jury instruction challenged by Wardlow \u201cde novo to determine whether the instruction ] misstated the law or misled the jury to the prejudice of\u2019 Wardlow. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we \u201cwill reverse [the] district court ... only if [we are] left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>See United States v. Felts, </em>579 F.3d 1341, 1342-43 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We are not left with \u201ca substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations\u201d here. <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cconsent\u201d jury instruction did not misstate the law or mislead the jury. The instruction noted that, when a defendant is charged with \u201ccommercial sex acts\u201d (i.e., sex trafficking) involving a minor, whether the minor consented to the acts is irrelevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">I further instruct you as a matter of law that minors lack the capacity to consent to unlawful sexual conduct. Therefore, whether the alleged minors involved in this case voluntarily agreed to engage in commercial sex acts has no bearing on the issue of whether the Defendant is guilty of the charges contained in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">This statement was consistent with the sex trafficking statute\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a)\u2014 under which Wardlow was charged. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a) (criminalizing a \u201ccommercial sex act\u201d involving a child, even if the defendant did not use force, fraud, or coercion).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">Finally, Wardlow argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him by limiting his cross-examination of the minor victims. At trial, the district court precluded Wardlow from questioning the minor victims about (1) prostitution activities they engaged in before and after meeting Wardlow and (2) them independent efforts to market themselves on a sex-trafficking website. According to Wardlow, such questioning was relevant to whether he \u201charbor[ed], transported], provide[d], ... [or] maintained]\u201d the minors while they engaged in commercial sex acts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>In assessing a defendant\u2019s claim based on the right to confrontation, we \u201cexamine whether th[e] right was actually violated, then turn to whether th[e] error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt....\u201d <em>See United, States v. Hum, </em>368 F.3d 1359, 1362-63 (11th Cir. 2004), Here, we need not determine whether Wardlow\u2019s right to confrontation was violated because any error the district court may have committed in limiting Wardlow\u2019s cross-examination of the minor victims was harmless. The government offered overwhelming evidence that Wardlow violated \u00a7 1591(a) by engaging in sex trafficking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 750 (11th Cir. 2010) (finding an alleged error harmless \u201cbecause the evidence establishing [the defendant's guilt was overwhelming\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\">. In his principal brief, Wardlow asserts that the district court\u2019s decision to limit his cross-examination of the minors harmed him by preventing him from offering evidence relevant to whether he engaged in sex trafficking. Wardlow does not argue in the brief that the decision affected his convictions for, producing and possessing child pornography. Therefore, Wardlow has abandoned any such argument. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n.8 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
