Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Dalip Basanti appeals from district court orders excluding proposed expert testimony and entering final judgment in favor of the United States. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">On October 28, 2009, Basanti became paralyzed from the chest down when a benign endodermal cyst compressed her spinal cord. Prior to her paralysis, Basanti had sought treatment from doctors at both Salud Family Health Center (\u201cSalud\u201d) and Platte Valley Medical Center (\u201cPVMC\u201d) for various health issues, including back and shoulder pain. Although some of Ba-santi\u2019s symptoms were, in hindsight, likely indicia of an endodermal cyst; none of Ba-santi\u2019s treating physicians made this diagnosis in time to prevent her paralysis. As a result, Basanti brought suit for medical negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Basanti was born in Punjab, India, and \u25a0 her native language is Punjabi. The parties dispute the extent to which Basanti speaks and understands English, but she asserts that she has limited English proficiency (\u201cLEP\u201d). Prior to trial, Basanti sought to admit expert testimony from Dr. Glenn Flores on language issues in healthcare. Specifically, Dr. Flores was retained to testify that the defendants acted below the standard of care and caused Basanti\u2019s injuries by failing to utilize interpretive services to communicate with her during her medical appointments. Basanti retained two other experts, Dr. Laurence Huffman and Dr. David Glaser, to present similar testimony that the defendants had violated the standard of care by treating Basanti without a medical interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Several defendants moved to strike Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony in full, along with any language-related opinions expressed by Dr. Huffman and Dr. Glaser. The district court granted the motion as to Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care and causation opinions. It concluded that Dr. Flores was not qualified to opine on whether the defendants\u2019 failure to use a medical interpreter caused Basanti\u2019s specific injuries. And without any evidence of causation related to this theory, the court determined that Dr. Flores\u2019 opinion on the appropriate standard of care was irrelevant. The district court denied the motion to strike the opinions of Drs. Huffman and Glaser but noted that any testimony on the standard of care for LEP patients would have to overcome the same relevancy issues to be admissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">Basanti\u2019s claims against the individual doctors were tried to a jury, and her claims against the United States were tried simultaneously in a bench trial. Both the jury and the court returned verdicts in favor of the defendants. Basanti timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Basanti contends the district court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Flores\u2019 opinions on causation and standard of care, as well as his generalized testimony as to the adverse effects of language barriers in healthcare. We review a district court order excluding expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 using a two-step process. \u201cWe review de novo whether the district court employed the proper legal standard and performed its gatekeeper role in determining whether to admit or exclude expert testimony.\u201d United States v. Nacchio, 555 F.3d 1234, 1241 (10th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (quotation omitted). We then \u201creview for abuse of discretion the manner in which the district court performs this gatekeeping role.\u201d Id Our review at the second step \u201cis deferential: we will not disturb the ruling unless it is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or manifestly unreasonable, or we are convinced that the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). Basanti does not contend that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in deciding to exclude Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony. Thus, our review proceeds directly to step two.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In applying Rule 702, trial courts act in a \u201cgatekeeping role\u201d to ensure that expert testimony \u201cis not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579, 589, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). As part of this inquiry, district courts must assess whether a witness is qualified \u201cby knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to offer expert testimony. Nacchio, 555 F.3d at 1241 (quotation omitted). If that requirement is met, expert testimony is .admissible if it bears the hallmarks of reliability\u2014it is \u201cbased on sufficient facts or data,\u201d it is \u201cthe product of reliable principles and methods,\u201d and \u201cthe expert has reliably applied [those] principles and methods.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 702. Expert testimony must also be relevant, meaning it must \u201clogically advance a material aspect of the case.\u201d United States v. Garcia, 635 F.3d 472, 476 (10th Cir. 2011) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Basanti contends the district court abused its discretion by concluding that Dr. Flores was not qualified to opine as to specific causation. She argues that the district court improperly focused on Dr. Flores\u2019 qualifications to treat Basanti\u2019s specific condition, rather than on his knowledge and experience as an expert of language issues in healthcare. Basanti suggests that Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony on language issues is applicable to all medical settings, irrespective of the specialty. Relying on Wheeler v. John Deere Co., 936 F.2d 1090 (10th Cir. 1991), she urges that \u201can expert witness is not strictly confined to his area of practice, but may testify concerning related applications; a lack of specialization does not affect the admissibility of the opinion, but only its weight.\u201d Id. at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Basanti\u2019s reliance on Wheeler is misplaced. Not only has this court questioned the continued viability of Wheeler as a pre-Daubert opinion, but it has concluded that \u201cmerely possessing a medical degree is not sufficient to permit a physician to testify concerning any medical-related issue.\u201d Ralston v. Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, Inc., 275 F.3d 965, 970 (10th Cir. 2001). Our decision in Ralston thus directly undermines Basanti\u2019s position that Dr. Flores\u2019 knowledge and experience with language issues qualifies him as an expert in all medical settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Moreover, the district court excluded Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony only after Dr. Flores himself admitted that: (1) he had never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>diagnosed a patient with Basanti\u2019s condition; (2)- he would not be competent to work up an adult patient complaining of Basanti\u2019s symptoms; (3) he did not know whether Basanti\u2019s recorded signs and symptoms were sufficient to diagnose her cyst; (4) he did not know what additional information would have been necessary to diagnose or treat her condition more effectively; and (5) deciding whether an adult patient needs a thoracic MRI falls outside the scope of his practice. The district court found no evidence that Dr. Flores had any familiarity with Basanti\u2019s condition such that he could have offered an informed opinion on whether adequate language services would have resulted in earlier diagnosis of her cyst or prevention of her paralysis. Nor have we uncovered any such evidence in the record. We therefore cannot say that the district court abused its \u201cwide discretion\u201d by concluding that Dr. Flores was unqualified, in the specific circumstances of this case, to opine that the defendants\u2019 failure to use language services caused Basanti\u2019s injuries. United States v. Arney, 248 F.3d 984, 990 (10th Cir. 2001); cfi Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 156, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (\u201c[T]he question before the trial court was specific, not general. The trial court had to decide whether this particular expert had sufficient specialized knowledge to assist the jurors in deciding the particular issues in the case.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Basanti also challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care testimony. The district court concluded that Dr. Flores\u2019 opinion concerning the standard of care for diagnosing and treating LEP patients was irrelevant, absent some evidence that the failure to use an interpreter caused Basanti\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Basanti\u2019s only argument on appeal appears to be that the exclusion of Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care testimony was in error because it was based on the district court\u2019s flawed conclusion that Dr. Flores was not qualified to opine as to specific causation. Because we have determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Dr. Flores\u2019 causation testimony, Basanti\u2019s argument requires us to conclude that the standard of care testimony was also properly excluded. Basanti offers no alternative basis on which to find an abuse of discretion on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Moreover, even if the district court erred in excluding Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care testimony, Basanti cannot show that such error was prejudicial. See Praseuth v. Rubbermaid, Inc., 406 F.3d 1245, \u25a0 1253 (10th Cir. 2005). To find prejudice, we must be able to reasonably conclude that the exclusion of Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care testimony made a difference in the outcome of Basanti\u2019s claims. Id. However, Basanti apparently never attempted to present evidence, apart from Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony, to establish that language issues caused her injuries. Thus, even if the court had admitted Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care opinions, the absence of causation evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dence would have precluded an ultimate finding of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Basanti\u2019s decision not to introduce the testimony of Drs. Huffman and Glaser on the standard of care for treating LEP patients further indicates that she was not prejudiced by the exclusion of Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony on that issue. The district court expressly noted in its order granting defendants\u2019 motion to strike that although Drs. Huffman and Glaser\u2019s testimony was not excluded, it would need to \u201covercome the [same] relevance issues\u201d identified with respect to Dr. Flores\u2019 opinions. Ba-santi therefore had a second opportunity to present causation evidence, both to establish the relevance of Drs. Huffman and Glaser\u2019s standard of care opinions and to support an ultimate finding of liability, but she failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Basanti\u2019s final claim of error is that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Flores\u2019 \u201cgeneralized testimony\u201d on the adverse effects of language barriers on health and healthcare. She asserts that such testimony was relevant, as it would have offered the court a critical lens through which to view Basanti\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We are not persuaded by this argument because there is no indication that the district court\u2019s order excluded Dr. Flores\u2019 generalized testimony. Although the defendants moved to strike Dr. Flores\u2019 testimony in full, the court construed the motion as challenging only his opinions on causation and standard of care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At no point did the district court refer to Dr. Flores\u2019 \u201cgeneralized testimony,\u201d nor did Basanti refer to such testimony in her response to the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"A19\">Basanti does not advance her position by arguing that the generalized testimony was excluded by the district court order because it was \u201cnecessarily intertwined\u201d with the standard of care and causation opinions. If the generalized testimony was encompassed in the other, properly excluded opinions, then that testimony would also have been properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court order and judgment are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">. Basanti named PVMC, multiple individual doctors, and the United States by and through Salud, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(g), as defendants. The United States is the only defendant involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-14\">. The United States did not join the motion, - thus it is unclear whether the district court's order applied to Basanti\u2019s claim against the United States, or whether Basanti properly preserved her objection on appeal. However, because the United States raised this argument only in summary fashion, we decline to consider it. United States v. Hardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1131 (10th Cir. 2002) (\"Arguments raised in a perfunctory manner, such as in a footnote, are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. At oral argument, counsel for Basanti suggested that Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care testimony was encompassed within his generalized testimony, discussed infra, and thus admissible irrespective of the district court\u2019s exclusion of his causation opinions. However, that position misstates the argument presented in Basanti\u2019s opening brief, which addresses the exclusion of Dr. Flores\u2019 standard of care and causation testimony separately from the exclusion of his generalized testimony. To the extent counsel was raising a new argument not clearly presented in the briefs, we will not consider it. See Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. The court construed the motion to strike as challenging only the causation and standard of care opinions after noting the defendants had violated the court\u2019s practice standards by failing to identify with specificity each opinion they were seeking to exclude.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
