McHugh, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b747-24\">David Silver filed this pro se libel and defamation action against Quora, Inc., alleging that the question-and-answer website published disparaging statements about his business practices and caused him to lose millions of dollars in income. Quora moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), asserting immunity from liability under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230 of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d). The district court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuit. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-25\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">Silver is an investment banker, venture capitalist, and author of 33 books on entrepreneurship and finance who resides in New Mexico. Quora operates a question- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>and-answer website at www.quora.com that allows registered users to ask and answer questions on any topic. This lawsuit stems from a question on the website that solicited feedback on Silver: \u201cHas anyone worked with or heard of David Silver at Santa Fe Capital?\u201d R. at 283. The anonymous questioner elaborated, \u201cI am interested in his ability to raise seed funding through his group of angel investors and what it\u2019s like to work with him as a partner/investor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Silver claims two false, disparaging posts in response to this question damaged his reputation and caused him to lose potential clients and book publishers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u2022 On September 7, .2012, Tessa Salt\u00f3n responded, \u201cYour instincts are correct. He is not licensed or accredited any longer. A fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Her post included a link to an article in <em>The Chicago Tribune, </em>which reports on a $23 million damages award against Silver in an investment case. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u2022 On October 16, 2013, Neil MacAskill responded, \u2018You are better off buying lottery tickets. One of our checks to him supposedly got lost so we sent him another. Then he cashed both and never did a thing for us. Said he built a business development plan but never delivered it. Save your money.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Quora\u2019s terms of service require posts to contain real user names, but Silver contends Salt\u00f3n and MacAskill are fictitious people. He was unable to locate Salt\u00f3n on Facebook, Google, or Linkedln, and an individual living in England and bearing MacAskill\u2019s name denied making the controversial post.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Silver sent letters to Quora in December 2014 and August 2015, asking the company to remove the posts. Quora refused, so Silver filed this lawsuit, which asserts a state-law claim for libel and defamation and seeks millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. His third amended complaint alleges that Quora \u201cis wantonly publishing the libelous and defamatory statements of Tessa Salt\u00f3n and Neil MacAskill, knowing full well that they are not members of Quora, which violates [Quora\u2019s] terms and conditions.\u201d R. at 278. It also alleges that \u201csomeone at Quora could have been writing for Tessa Salt\u00f3n and Neil MacAskill, thus actually authoring, or at a minimum, editing\u201d their posts. <em>Id. </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Quora filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on two grounds: (1) it is entitled to immunity from liability under the CDA because Silver\u2019s complaint contains no facts to support his allegation that Quora\u2019s employees \u201ccould\u201d have contributed to the authorship of the posts; and (2) the claim based on Salton\u2019s post is barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The district court granted the motion on immunity grounds, without reaching the statute-of-limitations issue. Silver filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">\u201c[A] defendant may raise an affirmative defense by a motion to dismiss for the failure to . state a claim\u201d under Rule 12(b)(6) when \u201cthe defense appears plainly on the face of the complaint itself.\u201d <em>Miller v. Shell Oil Co., </em>345 F.2d 891, 893 (10th Cir. 1965). We review de novo the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Silver\u2019s claim against Quora, accepting all well-pleaded factual allegations as true. <em>Howard v. Waide, </em>534 F.3d 1227,1242-43 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">Because Silver is proceeding pro se, \u201cwe construe his pleadings liberally.\u201d <em>Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003). But a complaint \u201cthat offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>action\u201d or \u201ctenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d will not suffice. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678,129 S.Ct. 1937,173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). We make some allowances for deficiencies, such as unfamiliarity with pleading requirements, failure to cite appropriate legal authority, and confusion of legal theories. <em>See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). But \u201cthe court cannot take on the responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor will we \u201csupply additional factual allegations to round out a plaintiffs complaint or construct a legal theory on a plaintiffs behalf.\u201d <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170,1173-74 (10th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We must decide whether \u00a7 230 of the CDA applies to this case and provides immunity from liability to Quora. We conclude it does, and we affirm for substantially the same reasons provided in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Section 230 \u201ccreates a federal immunity to any state law cause of action that would hold computer service providers liable for information originating with a third party.\u201d <em>Ben Ezra, Weinstein, &amp; Co. v. Am. Online Inc., </em>206 F.3d 980, 984-85 (10th Cir. 2000). It does so through the interplay of two key provisions. Under \u00a7 230(c)(1), \u201c[n]o provider ... of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(1). And under \u00a7 230(e)(3), \u201c[n]o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 230(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The purpose of this immunity is to \u201cfacilitate the use and development of the Internet by providing certain services an immunity from civil liability arising from content provided by others.\u201d <em>F.T.C. v. Accusearch Inc., </em>570 F.3d 1187, 1195 (10th Cir. 2009); <em>see also </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(b)(2) (\u201cIt is the policy of the United States ... to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation_\u201d). This immunity is not unfettered, however. Section 230(c)(1), quoted above, has three component parts that limit immunity:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">First, only a provider or user of \u201can interactive computer service\u201d can receive immunity. <em>Accusearch, </em>570 F.3d at 1196 (internal quotation marks omitted). An \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d is \u201cany information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer service, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Second, the defendant\u2019s actions as a \u201cpublisher or speaker\u201d must form the basis for liability. <em>Accusearch, </em>570 F.3d at 1196 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 230 protects a publisher from liability for exercising \u201cits editorial and self-regulatory functions.\u201d <em>Ben Ezra, </em>206 F.3d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">Third, immunity is available only when \u201canother information content provider\u201d provided the information at issue. <em>Accu-search, </em>570 F.3d at 1196 (internal quotation marks omitted). An \u201cinformation content provider\u201d is \u201cany person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(f)(3). A service provider must \u201cspecifically encourage[ ] development of what is offensive about the content\u201d to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for the development of offensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>content. <em>Accusearch, </em>570 F.Sd at 1199 (internal quotation marks omitted). This requirement is not satisfied when a typical Internet bulletin board is neutral with respect to the content\u2019s offensiveness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The district court carefully applied the facts of this case to each of these prongs and held that the CDA bars Silver\u2019s libel and defamation claims against Quora. We agree with its assessment. In <em>Accusearch, </em>we described \u201c[t]he prototypical service qualifying for this statutory immunity\u201d as \u201can online messaging board (or bulletin board) on which Internet subscribers post comments and respond to comments posted by others.\u201d 570 F.3d at 1195. Quora fits squarely within this prototype.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Because \u00a7 230 of the CDA provides immunity from liability to Quora, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Silver\u2019s claims under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
