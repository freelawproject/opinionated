No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Becker first contends the district court abused its discretion in admitting eight images of child pornography, despite Becker\u2019s stipulation that his two laptop computers contained child pornography. Becker contends the introduction of this evidence was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">We review for abuse-of-discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. United States v. Dodds, 347 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir. 2003). A district court \u201cmay exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 403. We have said, however, that Rule 403 is an \u201cextraordinary remedy which the district court should invoke sparingly.\u201d Dodds, 347 F.3d at 897 (quotations omitted). In con-\u2019 sidering admissibility under Rule 403, we view \u201cthe evidence in a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d Id. Typically, \u201cthe prosecution is entitled to prove its case by evidence of its own choice,\u201d and \u201ca criminal defendant may not stipulate or admit his way out of the full evidentiary force of the case as the Government chooses to present it.\u201d Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 653, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">The district court abused no discretion in admitting the still images of child pornography. The images not only proved that Becker\u2019s computers actually contained child pornography\u2014a fact to which Becker had stipulated\u2014but also tended to show that Becker knew he was in possession of child pornography and to show his intent to possess child pornography. See United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, 607 F.3d 720, 734 (11th Cir. 2010) (although defendant stipulated that the DVDs contained child pornography, still images from the DVDs \u201calso tended to show that [defendant] knew he was in possession of child pornography, a fact that he did not stipulate\u201d); Dodds, 347 F.3d at 899 (admission of 66 child pornographic images was no abuse of discretion in part because the images tended to show defendant\u2019s knowledge that the images constituted child pornography and that defendant intended to collect such pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The district court also took proper precautions to minimize unfair prejudice by admitting only a small portion of the hundreds of images discovered, cautioning jurors during voir dire that child-pornographic images might be offered into evidence, striking jurors who indicated they could not be fair and impartial or who had religious objections, and by making viewing of the images optional to the jurors. See Alfaro-Moncada, 607 F.3d at 734; Dodds, 347 F.3d at 899. Because we cannot say that the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the images\u2019 probative value, the district court abused no discretion in denying Becker\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">Becker next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. \u201cWe review de novo the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d United States v. Grzybowicz, 747 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir. 2014) (quotations omitted). \u201cA jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">To obtain a conviction for receipt of child pornography, the government must prove, among other things, that the defendant \u201cknowingly receivefd]\u201d child pornography through means affecting interstate commerce, \u201cincluding by computer.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). A person \u201cknowingly\u201d receives child pornography \u201cwhen he intentionally views, acquires, or accepts child pornography on a computer from an outside source.\u201d United States v. Pruitt, 638 F.3d 763, 766 (11th Cir. 2011). Likewise, to prove a defendant \u201cknowingly possessed]\u201d child pornography\u2014for purposes of obtaining a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B)\u2014the government must prove that the defendant knew the files contained an unlawful visual depiction of minors engaging in sexually explicit con-' duct. Alfaro-Moncada, 607 F.3d at 733. \u201c[T]he term \u2018knowingly\u2019 means that the act was performed voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of a mistake or accident.\u201d United States v. Woodruff, 296 F.3d 1041,1047 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Proof of an element of a crime \u201cmay be established through circumstantial evidence or from inferences drawn from the conduct of an individual.\u201d United States v. Utter, 97 F.3d 509, 512 (11th Cir. 1996). For example, \u201c[ejvidence that a person has sought out\u2014searched for\u2014child pornography on the internet and has a computer containing child-pornography images ... can count as circumstantial evidence that a person has \u2018knowingly receive[d]\u2019 child pornography.\u201d Pruitt, 638 F.3d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">As an initial, matter, Becker disputes only whether it was he\u2014and not another person\u2014who knowingly received and possessed the child pornography found on his two laptop computers. That Becker\u2019s computers contained child pornography and that the pornography was received through interstate commerce is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Evidence presented at trial showed that Becker\u2014who had a college degree in computer arts\u2014owned and used extensively the two laptop computers found at his home. This evidence tended to show Becker\u2019s control over the computers where the child pornography was found. On both computers, Becker had downloaded, installed, and run ARES: a file-sharing program used commonly to search for and to download child pornography. In the ARES files and logs, officers found evidence that over 1,000 titles indicative of child pornography had been downloaded and also found search terms associated with child pornography. The government presented evidence of a large volume of pornographic videos and pictures that were stored and accessed regularly on Becker\u2019s laptops. On one computer, these images\u2014which were titled using explicit terms often used to identify child pornography files\u2014were saved in a folder on the desktop labeled with Becker\u2019s first name: \u201cIon.\u201d One of Becker\u2019s laptops also contained a log of Becker\u2019s Skype chat during which Becker commented that his new computer had a really good video card and that the \u201cPorn is sharp. And clear.\u201d On this record, the government presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow the jury to infer that Becker received and possessed knowingly child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Although Becker presented some evidence that he allowed his friends to use his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>computers, nothing evidenced that these friends accessed Becker\u2019s computers with anywhere near the frequency with which the computers were being used to search for, download, and to view child pornography. Moreover, the \u201cjury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence\u201d: the evidence need not \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Cruz-Valdez, 773 F.2d 1541, 1545 (11th Cir. 1985) (en banc); see also United States v. Jiminez, 564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir. 2009) (\u201cthe issue is not whether a , jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The jury was also entitled to disbelieve Becker\u2019s testimony\u2014in which Becker' asserted his innocence and questioned the veracity of his own witnesses\u2019 testimony about the frequency with which they accessed Becker\u2019s computers\u2014and <em>to </em>use Becker\u2019s testimony as substantive evidence of his guilt. See United States v. Williamson, 339 F.3d 1295, 1301 n.14 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201c[W]e are bound by the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, and by its rejection of the inferences raised by the defendant.\u201d United States v. Peters, 403 F.3d 1263, 1268 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could have found Becker guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
