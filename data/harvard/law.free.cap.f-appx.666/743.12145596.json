Matheson, Jr. Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">This appeal concerns a contract and property dispute between neighbors. Cas-co, LLC and McDonald\u2019s Real Estate Company own adjacent real estate and dispute their purported rights and obligations under a Declaration of Reciprocal Easements, Covenants, and Restrictions that was part of a broader real estate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Casco breached two provisions of the Declaration and does not have rights under those provisions. The district court erred, however, in ruling that Casco lost its property rights established in the Declaration. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 in this diversity case, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">A. <em>Factual History</em></p>\n<p id=\"Am5\">1. The Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">JB\u2019s Family Restaurants, Inc. owned Lots 4, 5, and 6 of an area of land in Casper, Wyoming called the Klassen Addition. In 2002, JB\u2019s conveyed to Casco Lots 4 and 6 for $125,000, and JB\u2019s continued to own the adjoining Lot 5. Casco has operated a Quality Inn &amp; Suites on its lots. As part of the transaction, the parties entered into the Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">The Declaration, which Casco drafted and recorded in the Office of the County Clerk of Natrona County, Wyoming, on May 17, 2002, applied to Lots 4, 5, and 6. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-17\">1. New parking lot. Casco, at its sole expense, shall install a new parking lot on real property owned by JB\u2019s prior to removing any of JB\u2019s existing 70 parking spaces<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.Casco will replace and build said parking spaces on JB\u2019s real property to accommodate at least sixteen (16) nine-foot (9\u2019) parking spaces. After such new parking spaces have been installed upon JB\u2019s real property, JB\u2019s shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, snow removal, sealing, and other expenses relative to maintaining the parking lots on JB\u2019s real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-18\">2. Access easement. Attached hereto as Exhibits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d, and by reference made a part hereof, is the legal description of an access easement which JB\u2019s do hereby grant, bargain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>sell, and convey to Casco across JB\u2019s property, which shall be a perpetual access easement until such time as the parties hereto, their successors and assigns, and predecessors in title mutually agree to terminate such access easement. The parties agree that the obligation for snow removal and maintenance and repair of such access easement shall be JB\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\">3. Sign. JB\u2019s have granted to Casco the right to install, repair, and maintain signs on JB\u2019s real property located on the plat attached hereto as Exhibits \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d, and by reference made a part hereof. Such signs shall not exceed the following dimensions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">(a) Sign easement #1 shall not be in excess of 66\u201d high, as measured from the ground to the top of the sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">(b) Total square footage of the two signs shall not exceed the lesser of 300 square feet, or 60% of the total dimensions and sign coverage allowed on Lot 5 by the City of Casper at the time the signs are to be erected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">4. Garbage receptacle. Casco, at its sole expense, shall install, to City\u2019s specifications, a garbage receptacle to be located upon JB\u2019s real property at the location described in the plat attached hereto as Exhibit \u201cB\u201d, prior to removing JB\u2019s existing garbage receptacle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">6. Fences. The parties hereto agree that no fences will be constructed on or within 20\u2019 of the adjoining lot lines between Lots 4, 5, and 6 of the said Klassen Addition, the real property owned by JB\u2019s and Casco without the express written mutual consent of the parties hereto, their successors, or assigns. This restriction shall continue and shall constitute a covenant running with the real property owned by the respective parties hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">6. Parking Spaces. The parties hereto, their successors, assigns, and predecessors in title shall have the unrestricted right to use the parking spaces located upon the parties\u2019 real property legally described as Lots 4, 5, and 6, in the Replat of Klassen Addition, an Addition to the City of Casper, Natrona County, Wyoming. Each of the parties shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the parking spaces located upon its property, including the -snow removal and the maintenance and repair. The parties hereto shall have the right to \u25a0 design\u00f3te handicapped parking on their respective properties. All the parking spaces on the real property owned by Casco and JB\u2019s shall constitute a conveyance of reciprocal easements for this purpose, and shall be a perpetual common easement which may be modified only with the mutual written consent of the parties hereto, their successors, assigns, and predecessors in title. Such parking spaces are set forth in the plat attached as Exhibit \u201cE\u201d hereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">App. at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">When the parties signed the Declaration, JB\u2019s parking spaces and trash receptacle were located in the access easement discussed in the Access Easement Provision. The parties intended for (1) the new parking spaces, discussed in the New Parking Lot Provision, and (2) the future garbage receptacle, discussed in the Garbage Receptacle Provision, to be located outside the access easement. Attached to the Declaration were exhibits of maps showing the intended configurations of Lots 4, 5, and 6 after the Casco redevelopment. For unexplained reasons, Casco never redeveloped the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>2.McDonald\u2019s Redevelopment</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">After purchasing JB\u2019s former property in 2013, McDonald\u2019s planned a redevelopment of its lot, Lot 5. Casco did not consent to McDonald\u2019s redevelopment. Instead, it communicated various objections, the specific nature of which the parties have not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">McDonald\u2019s nevertheless executed its redevelopment plan, making the following changes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">1. It demolished JB\u2019s restaurant and replaced it with a new McDonald\u2019s restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">2. It removed the garbage receptacle on Lot 5 and built a new one in a different location on that same lot. This new location was not the location of the \u201cproposed trash enclosure\u201d depicted in the Declaration\u2019s exhibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">3. It constructed a storage shed next to the new garbage receptacle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">4. Its replacement of the garbage receptacle and construction of a storage shed eliminated two.parking spaces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">5. It installed a new sign, occupying 420.55 square feet out of 600 square feet allotted by the City of Casper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">McDonald\u2019s redevelopment does not interfere with the access easement. McDonald\u2019s has never denied a Casco employee or guest access to the access easement. Nor has Casco identified any employee or guest who has been unable to park on Lot 5. According to Casco, McDonald\u2019s placement of the garbage receptacle and storage shed diminishes the value of Casco\u2019s property by creating aesthetic blights, the nature of which Casco has not explained. Casco also states the redevelopment makes it impossible for large vehicles to park in the lot and has deprived it of two parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">3.Casco\u2019s Proposed Redevelopment</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Following the redevelopment of McDonald\u2019s property, Casco sought to redevelop Lots 4, 5, and 6. Casco presented its plans to McDonald\u2019s. The parties have offered almost no detail on the nature of these plans. At minimum, however, the proposed redevelopment appears to involve (1) changing some aspect of the access easement on Casco\u2019s lots, (2) relocating McDonald\u2019s garbage receptacle in accordance with the Declaration\u2019s exhibits, and (3) installing a new sign on Lot 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">McDonald\u2019s objected to Casco\u2019s proposed reconfiguration, contending the Declaration prohibits Casco from changing the access easement on its lot and from relocating the garbage receptacle on McDonald\u2019s lot. As to Casco\u2019s proposed sign, Casco must apply for City approval to install the sigh. To obtain City approval, it needs McDonald\u2019s, the owner of Lot 5, to sign its application, which McDonald\u2019s has refused to do. Casco asserts McDonald\u2019s conduct has \u201cirreparably limited\u201d the \u201cfuture development\u201d of Casco\u2019s lots without further specifying the nature of this harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">Casco sued McDonald\u2019s in the Wyoming state district court. McDonald\u2019s removed the case to federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">1. Casco\u2019s First Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b767-19\">Casco\u2019s First Amended Complaint sought (a) declaratory relief, (b) specific performance or an injunction, and (c) damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">a. <em>Declaratory relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">Casco\u2019s First Amended Complaint sought a declaratory judgment stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>a. The Declaration is valid, binding and enforceable against McDonald\u2019s;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">b. Casco is entitled to utilize and/or develop the parking spaces as originally defined in the Declaration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">c. Casco is entitled to develop the trash receptacle and accompanying storage shed as originally defined in the Declaration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">d. Casco is entitled to ingress and egress over McDonald\u2019s property as defined in the Declaration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">e. Casco is entitled to utilize McDonald\u2019s property for at least two (2) signs not to exceed the lesser of 300 square feet or 50% of the total dimensions and sign coverage as permitted by the City of Casper; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">f. The actions of McDonald\u2019s, including, but not limited to, the development of the parking lot, relocation of the trash receptacle, installation of the storage shed, and use of excessive signage, have violated the express terms and conditions of the Declaration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">App. at 17 (emphasis removed and capitalization altered).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">b. <em>Breach of contract claim seeking specific performance and an alternative injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Casco also alleged a breach of contract based on (1) McDonald\u2019s failure to \u201crecognize Casco\u2019s right\u201d under the Declaration to \u201cmodify the existing parking lot,\u201d \u201cmodify the location of the existing trash receptacle,\u201d or \u201cutilize McDonald\u2019s property for at least two ... signs not to exceed the lesser of 300 square feet or 50% of the total dimensions and sign coverage as permitted by the City of Casper,\u201d and (2) McDonald\u2019s use of \u201cthe entirety of the sign coverage\u201d and its refusal to \u201creduce its signage to accommodate Casco\u2019s rights under the Declaration.\u201d App. at 18, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">As a remedy for this claim, Casco sought \u201cspecific performance of the Declaration as it relates to\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-15\">(i) Casco\u2019s rights to reconfigure the parking area, (ii) relocate the trash receptacle, (iii) forcing McDonald\u2019s to be solely liable for the cost associated with the relocation of the storage shed, and (iv) forcing McDonald\u2019s to reduce its signage to accommodate Casco\u2019s rights under the Declaration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 18, \u00b6 33 (capitalization altered). In addition to specific performance, Casco sought a permanent injunction restraining McDonald\u2019s \u201cfrom its current conduct and [from] frustrating the Declaration in order to prevent the suffrage [sic] of irreparable injury, loss, harm or damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-17\">c. <em>Damages in the alternative</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-18\">Finally, as an alternative to a declaratory judgment, specific performance, or permanent injunction, Casco sought compensatory damages for McDonald\u2019s alleged breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-19\">2. McDonald\u2019s Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b768-20\">McDonald\u2019s filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-21\">a. The Declaration is insufficiently definite to be enforced with respect to the rights Plaintiff seeks to enforce in its First Amended Complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-22\">b. Casco has no right to alter the McDonald\u2019s parking lot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-23\">c. Casco has no right under the Declaration to a particular number of parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>spaces on McDonald\u2019s property nor does it have any right to parking designed to accommodate oversized vehicles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">d. Casco has no right under the Declaration to move the McDonald\u2019s trash receptacle or storage shed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">e. Paragraph 3 imposes no obligation on McDonald\u2019s, but rather grants Casco two sign easements that Casco may exercise so long as Casco\u2019s signs comply with paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of the Declaration and City of Casper ordinances or regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">f. Casco is in material breaeh of the Declaration as it did not perform its obligations under the Declaration in a timely way, and it violated paragraph 5 of the Declaration by construction of the fence, and accordingly it has lost any purported rights thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 48-49 (capitalization altered).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Alternatively, it alleged Casco \u201cfailed to perform its obligations under paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Declaration,\u201d discharging McDonald\u2019s \u201cfrom any obligation arising under the Declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. McDonald\u2019s accordingly requested \u201cthat judgment be entered declaring that the Declaration has no further force or effect as a result of the lack of performance by Casco of its obligations under the Declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(capitalization altered).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">3. Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">McDonald\u2019s moved for summary judgment on Casco\u2019s claims. Casco cross-moved for summary judgment on its claims and McDonald\u2019s counterclaim. McDonald\u2019s argued the Declaration was indefinite and therefore unenforceable. The parties also disputed whether Casco breached the Declaration and, even if it did, whether it was therefore barred from enforcing its rights under it. The district court granted McDonald\u2019s motion and denied Casco\u2019s motion. It held (1) the Declaration was sufficiently definite and enforceable, and (2) Casco materially breached the Declaration, losing both its contractual and property rights under the Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Osborne v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>798 F.3d 1260, 1266 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In applying this standard, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Osborne, </em>798 F.3d at 1266. \u201cWhere, as here, we are presented with cross-motions for summary judgment, we must view each motion separately, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Fox v. Transam Leasing, Inc., </em>839 F.3d 1209, 1213 (10th Cir. 2016) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">The parties do not dispute that Wyoming law applies. A federal court sitting in diversity is to \u201cascertain and apply the most recent statement of state law by the state\u2019s highest court.\u201d <em>Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. v. Haugen, </em>222 F.3d 1262, 1280 (10th Cir. 2000) (quotations omitted). \u201c[W]e are generally reticent to expand state law without clear guidance from its highest court.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Phelan, </em>9 F.3d 882, 887 (10th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">On appeal, Casco argues the district court erred in concluding it breached the Declaration and therefore lost its right to enforce it. We agree with the district court that Casco breached the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions and can no longer enforce its rights, if any, under those provisions. But the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>court erred in concluding Casco lost all its rights under the Declaration, including the property rights to use the easements established in the Access Easement, Sign, and Parking Spaces Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Our analysis divides the issues between the contract and the property disputes. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">A. <em>Contractual Rights Under the Covenants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The parties dispute their contractual rights and obligations under the Declaration. Below, we conclude (1) the Declaration is sufficiently definite and enforceable, (2) the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions are contractual, and (3) Casco breached its contractual obligation under the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions. We further hold Casco has no right to redevelop parking spaces or remove the garbage receptacle and storage shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">1. The Declaration Is Enforceable</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">On appeal, McDonald\u2019s argues the Declaration is unenforceable because it does not include a time period for performance. Thus, it argues, Casco cannot enforce any rights under the Declaration. Casco contends the Declaration is sufficiently definite and enforceable because it identifies the key terms of the agreement and intentionally excluded a time period for performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Under Wyoming contract law, \u201cit is essential that the mutual assent of the parties to the terms of a contract must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to ascertain what they are.\u201d <em>Roussalis v. Wyo. Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>4 P.3d 209,231 (Wyo. 2000) (quotations omitted). But \u201cit is not necessary that each term be spelled out in minute detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Only \u201cthe essentials of the contract must have been agreed upon and be ascertainable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). This is because \u201c[t]he law does not favor the destruction <em>of </em>contracts on the ground of indefiniteness, and if it be feasible the court will so construe the agreement so as to carry into effect the reasonable intention of the parties if that can be ascertained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">To that end, where contracts are silent as to time period, Wyoming courts have supplied reasonable time frames and enforced the contracts. <em>See Baker v. Speaks, </em>177 P.3d 803, 806 (Wyo. 2008) (holding if \u201cno time for performance is specified in a contract, the law implies performance must be within a reasonable time\u201d (quotations omitted)); <em>Reed v. Wadsworth, </em>553 P.2d 1024, 1032 (Wyo. 1976) (rejecting the argument that a land contract was indefinite because \u201cit was silent as to the time of possession\u201d and noting, \u201cin the absence of a provision as to the time of performance, a reasonable time is implied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">We reject McDonald\u2019s argument that the Declaration is void based on the parties\u2019 failure to specify a time period in the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions. Wyoming law directs courts to supply a reasonable time frame when the contract does not set one. The Declaration is sufficiently definitive and enforceable despite not having a specified time limit in the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions. We will evaluate those provisions under a reasonable time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">2. Contractual Provisions in the Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">The parties refer to the promises made in the Declaration as covenants. Land use covenants are \u201cpromise[s] to do, or to refrain from doing, certain things with respect to real property.\u201d <em>Brumbaugh v. Mikelson Land Co., </em>185 P.3d 695, 701 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(Wyo. 2008); <em>see also Wimer v. Cook, </em>369 P.3d 210, 218 (Wyo. 2016) (stating covenants impose \u201crestrictions or conditions on the use of land\u201d). They are \u201cenforceable in equity against all those who take the estate with notice of them.\u201d <em>Cash v. Granite Springs Retreat Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>248 P.3d 614, 619 (Wyo. 2011) (quotations omitted). Wyoming case law most often speaks of restrictive covenants, which are covenants that \u201crestrict a party\u2019s rights on the land.\u201d <em>Brumbaugh, </em>185 P.3d at 701. But the ease law also recognizes covenants that can be \u201caffirmative ... in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike easements, which create property rights, <em>Seven Lakes Dev. Co. v. Maxson, </em>144 P.3d 1239, 1245 (Wyo. 2006), land use covenants create contractual rights that can be \u201cenforced in equity,\u201d <em>Streets v. J M Land &amp; Developing Co., </em>898 P.2d 377, 380 (Wyo. 1995).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Declaration contains six provisions. Three are land use covenants that create contractual rights and obligations; three created easements. The following are the land use covenants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u2022 the New Parking Lot Provision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u2022 the Garbage Receptacle Provision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u2022 the Fence Provision, which is not at issue on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Below, we evaluate the parties\u2019 purported rights and obligations under the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">3. Casco Breached Its Contractual Obligations by Failing to Replace the Parking Spaces and the Garbage Receptacle</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Casco requests declaratory relief that it has a right to replace the parking lot and the garbage receptacle and that it can remove McDonald\u2019s storage shed. We hold Casco has no rights under the- Declaration to alter the parking lot, dumpster, or storage shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">a. <em>Legal background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">In interpreting the Declaration, our \u201cgoal is to determine and effectuate the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Wimer, </em>369 P.3d at 218 (quotations omitted). \u201cWhere an agreement is in writing and the. language' is clear and unambiguous, the parties\u2019 intent is to be secured from the four corners of the contract.\u201d <em>Olsen v. Kilpatrick, </em>161 P.3d 504, 508 (Wyo. 2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">After we ascertain the terms of a contract, we can determine whether there was a breach. \u201cThe elements for a breach of contract claim consist of a lawfully enforceable contract, an unjustified failure to timely perform all or any part of what is promised therein, and entitlement of injured party to damages.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Tice, </em>595 P.2d 1318,1323 (Wyo. 1979). The question here is whether Casco\u2019s failure to perform within 11 years was unreasonable. If \u201cno time for performance is specified in a contract, the law implies performance must be within a reasonable time, and what is a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>177 P.3d at 806 (quotations omitted). \u201cWhat constitutes a reasonable time in any particular case is a question of fact.\u201d <em>G.C.I., Inc. v. Haught, </em>7 P.3d 906, 909 (Wyo. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">The mandatory language (\u201cshall\u201d) in the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Provisions established that Casco had an obligation to replace and install a parking lot and garbage receptacle. It breached those provisions by failing to perform over an 11-year period. It can no longer assert any purported rights under those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">First, the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions imposed obligations on Casco. The New Parking Lot Provision provided, \u201cCasco, at its sole expense, shall install a new parking lot on real property owned by JB\u2019s prior to removing any of JB\u2019s existing 70 parking spaces.\u201d App. at 28. The Garbage Receptacle Provision provided, \u201cCasco, at its sole expense, shall install ... a garbage receptacle ... prior to removing JB\u2019s existing garbage receptacle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Casco argues it committed no breach because the two provisions created rights, not obligations. It argues that \u201cthe Declaration does not require Casco (a) to construct a new parking lot or (b) to relocate the existing garbage receptacle by a date certain.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 13. Instead, Casco contends, \u201cthe Declaration only provides that, before Casco may exercise a certain right, it must first complete a related task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, Casco reads the Declaration as giving it the option but not the duty to redevelop the lots. McDonald\u2019s, in contrast, argues the two provisions required Casco to both (1) install parking spaces and a garbage receptacle, and then (2) remove the existing ones. We agree with McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The provisions provided, \u201cCasco ... shall install [a new parking lot or garbage receptacle] ... prior to removing [the old parking lot or garbage receptacle.]\u201d App. at 28. These provisions plainly expressed mandatory language temporally sequencing two obligations\u2014\u201cshall [1] install ... prior to [2] removing.\u201d It includes no optional or conditional language giving Casco the right to remove old items if it installs new ones first. Rather, the contract required Casco to both \u201cinstall\u201d new items and then \u201cremove\u201d old ones.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Second, Casco breached the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions by failing to perform in 11 years. We agree with the district court that the 11-year delay was unreasonable based on the undisputed facts. By Casco\u2019s own admission, when the parties entered the Declaration, \u201cJB\u2019s parking spaces and trash receptacle sat within the access easements. In order to fully utilize the access easements, Casco would be required to remove parking spaces and the trash receptacle.\u201d App. at 131 (capitalization altered). Eleven years later, Casco had failed to do so, compromising the utility of the access easement throughout that entire period.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Casco has failed to cite any record evidence justifying its failure to perform. <em>See Reynolds, </em>595 P.2d at 1323 (stating a breach of contract occurs when there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201can unjustified failure to timely perform\u201d). Casco instead attacks the district court\u2019s ruling by contending the contract creates rights but not obligations, an argument we rejected above. Casco\u2019s failure to present facts justifying the delay amounts to a failure to create a genuine dispute of material facts. Without any evidence justifying the 11-year delay, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the delay was unreasonable. Put differently, a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for Casco based on the undisputed facts. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>see also G.C.I., </em>7 P.3d at 909 (affirming a finding that a failure to repair a home, as required under a settlement agreement, within one year of entering that agreement was unreasonable). We therefore hold Casco breached the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Third, Casco can no longer assert any purported rights related to the parking lot and garbage receptacle. As stated, the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions created obligations\u2014not rights\u2014for Casco to redevelop the lots. In a separate argument, Casco contends McDonald\u2019s breached the Declaration by reducing the number of parking spaces and limiting access to large vehicles, which was not \u201cconsistent with the development plan contemplated by the Declaration and depicted in detail by its incorporated exhibits.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9. In other words, Casco attempts to derive contractual rights from the Declaration\u2019s exhibits that diagram the intended layout of the lots after Casco\u2019s redevelopment. McDonald\u2019s argues that the doctrine of laches prevents Casco from redeveloping the lots consistent with .the Declaration\u2019s exhibits because Casco failed to assert its contractual rights for 11 years. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Under the equitable doctrine of laches, a party cannot assert a right when there was (1) an \u201cunreasonabl[e] delay in asserting a legal right\u201d and (2) \u201cthe delay has worked injustice, prejudice, or disadvantage to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Casco has failed to present <em>facts </em>justifying its failure to assert its purported contractual rights in an 11-year span. Further, it is undisputed that Cas-co\u2019s failure deprived McDonald\u2019s of the . benefits contemplated in the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions. In other words, Casco\u2019s unreasonable delay prejudiced McDonald\u2019s. We conclude the doctrine of laches bars Casco from asserting its contractual rights, if any, derived from the Declaration\u2019s exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">In sum, Casco breached the New Parking Lot and Garbage R\u00e9ceptacle Provisions, and the doctrine of laches prevents it from asserting any contractual rights that remain under the Declaration and its exhibits. Because we have resolved the question at hand\u2014whether Casco can redevelop the lots\u2014we need not address whether Casco substantially breached the Declaration. Further, addressing the substantial breach question would not affect the status of Casco\u2019s property rights in the easement because, as explained below, (1) the Wyoming Supreme Court has not recognized breach of contract as a method to terminate easements, and (2) the Declaration states the access and parking easements are perpetual and cannot be termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>nated without the parties\u2019 mutual consent. Aplt. App. at 28-29.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">B. <em>Property Rights in the Declaration</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">Three provisions in the Declaration created easements: (1) the Access Easement Provision, (2) the Sign Provision, and (3) the Parking Spaces Provision. Casco contends it did not lose its easement rights because Wyoming law does not recognize breach of contract as terminating an easement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">1. Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">An easement is an \u201cinterest in land [that] entitles the easement holder to a limited use or enjoyment over another person\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Seven Lakes Dev. Co., </em>144 P.3d at 1245. Easements have the potential to run with the land and last in perpetuity. <em>Brumbaugh, </em>185 P.3d at 701 (\u201cCovenants may also create easements. Such covenants are typically deemed to be appurtenant and run with the land.\u201d); Jon W. Bruce and James W. Ely, Jr., The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land \u00a7 10:1, Westlaw (database updated Sept. 2016) (\u201cEasements frequently are created to endure forever.\u201d). Courts and treatises recognize a limited number of methods to terminate an easement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Wyoming Supreme Court has recognized at least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>following termination methods: (1) merger, <em>Davidson Land Co., LLC v. Davidson, </em>247 P.3d 67, 75 (Wyo. 2011); (2) misuse, <em>Stephens v. Lavitt, </em>239 P.3d 634, 640 (Wyo. 2010); (3) adverse possession, <em>Mueller v. Hoblyn, </em>887 P.2d 500, 505 (Wyo. 1994); and (4) abandonment, id; <em>Carney v. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>757 P.2d 556, 562 (Wyo. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The district court erred in concluding Casco lost its property rights under the Declaration. The easement was not terminated through a method recognized by the Wyoming Supreme Court. Although we interpret an easement by applying principles of contract construction, <em>Lozier v. Blattland Invs., LLC, </em>100 P.3d 380, 384 (Wyo. 2004), McDonald\u2019s has cited no case in which any court, let alone the Wyoming Supreme Court, recognized breach of contract as a termination method. Nor has McDonald\u2019s argued another termination method applies. We therefore decline to render a novel application of Wyoming law without guidance from the Wyoming Supreme Court. <em>Taylor, </em>9 F.3d at 887 (\u201c[W]e are generally reticent to expand state law without clear guidance from its highest court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In addition, the Declaration states the access and reciprocal parking easements are \u201cperpetual\u201d and cannot be modified or terminated without the parties\u2019 mutual consent. App. at 28-29. This undermines McDonald\u2019s argument that a breach of contract can extinguish the easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We hold Casco maintains its rights to utilize the easements established in the Access Easement, Sign, and Parking Spaces Provisions of the Declaration. Because the district court did not address the scope of the parties\u2019 property interests, we do not address the issue on appeal. Instead, we hold Casco did not lose its rights under the easements in the Declaration and remand to the district court to address any remaining issues related to the easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">For the reasons 'stated, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings. We (1) affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Casco breached the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions, (2) affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Casco cannot alter the parking lot, storage shed, or garbage receptacle, (3) reverse the district court\u2019s ruling that Casco lost its property rights under the Declaration, and (4) remand for the district court to address the sign easement and any other remaining issues related to the easements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

First, Casco's president stated in his affidavit that \"[i]n order to fully utilize the granted access easements, Casco <em>would be required </em>to relocate JB\u2019s existing trash receptacle and remove some of [ ]JB\u2019s existing ... parking spaces.\" App. at 149, \u00b6 15 (emphasis added and capitalization altered). Second, our interpretation follows the rule of construction that \"any ambiguity ... is construed against the drafter.\u201d <em>Collins v. Finnell, </em>29 P.3d 93, 100 (Wyo. 2001). The drafter here was Casco, and if there were ambiguity in the two provisions, we would construe it against Casco and conclude the Declaration obligated it to redevelop the new parking lot and garbage receptacle. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\">. <em>Mullinnix LLC v.

McDonald\u2019s contends Casco\u2019s obligation to perforin under the New Parking Lot and Garbage Receptacle Provisions was the consideration for JB\u2019s to enter into the Declaration and grant the easements. Thus, McDonald's argues, Casco\u2019s failure to perform under those provisions \"resulted in the absence of consideration to JB's.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 12 (stating \"JB's and McDonald\u2019s received no consideration at all\u201d due to Casco\u2019s breach). We disagree with McDonald's for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">First, McDonald's does not mention that the Declaration was part of a broader real estate transaction in which Casco paid $125,000 to JB's. Casco's payment and promises to replace the parking lot and garbage receptacle were sufficient consideration to form the contract and acquire the access and sign easements. Casco's later failure to perform breached the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Second, to the extent McDonald\u2019s argument is that Casco\u2019s failure to perform was a substantial breach, we explain below that Wyoming courts have not recognized breach of contract as a method to terminate easements.
