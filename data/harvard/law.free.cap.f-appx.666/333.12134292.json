Defendants-Appellants, a group of jailers, moved to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity and the district court denied their motions. Because the district court failed to address the jailers\u2019 qualified immunity defense in its denial, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order to the extent it failed to address this defense and REMAND for reconsideration of whether each defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On March 13, 2015, Plaintiff-Appellee Samuel Randle filed the instant action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Defendants-Appellants, 17 individual members of the Limestone County Jail staff (the jailers), alleging, that while he was detained at the jail, the jailers were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Randle alleged that, as a side effect of medication prescribed to him at the jail, he suffered from priapism<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while detained, which ultimately rendered him permanently impotent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">On May 8, 2015, in two separate motions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the jailers moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Both motions argued that the jailers were \u201centitled to qualified immunity.\u201d They also claimed that a \u201c[hjeightened pleading\u201d standard applies to a plaintiffs complaint when defendants raise qualified immunity and that, under this standard, Randle failed to state a claim for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. On January 28, 2016, the magistrate judge recommended denying both motions to dismiss. After recognizing that the jailers raised a qualified immunity defense, the magistrate judge\u2019s report asserted that \u201cthere is no plausible basis for [the jailers\u2019] continued insistence on requiring heightened pleading in the qualified immunity context.\u201d The report then cursorily concluded that Randle had sufficiently pleaded a \u00a7 1983 claim and stated that \u201c[Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 8(a)(2) does not contemplate a court\u2019s passing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>merits of a litigant\u2019s claim at the pleading stage,\u201d quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 585, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Without further explanation, the report recommended the motions to dismiss be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The jailers objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and argued, among other things, that the magistrate judge had applied the wrong pleading standard to Ran-dle\u2019s claim. They asserted that by virtue of their qualified immunity defense, Randle faced a \u201c[hjeightened pleading\u201d standard. They urged that \u201capplying the correct standard shows that the [jailers] [we]re entitled to dismissal on qualified immunity grounds.\u201d The jailers also argued that each jailer\u2019s entitlement to qualified immunity must be considered on an individual basis rather than collectively. On March 31, 2016, the district court issued an order rejecting all of the jailers\u2019 objections. The district court first concluded that a heightened pleading standard did not apply to Randle\u2019s claims. The district court next overruled the jailers\u2019 objection that they were entitled to qualified immunity because this objection \u201chinge[d] on the assumption that the Magistrate Judge applied the wrong pleading standard, which he did not.\u201d The district court stated it was overruling the jailers\u2019 qualified immunity objection \u201cbecause Randle pled factual allegations that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d The district court accordingly accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in full and ordered that the jailers\u2019 motions to dismiss be denied. The jailers timely appealed, arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY MUST BE DECIDED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">As an initial matter, we establish our jurisdiction over this appeal. The action before us is an interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of two motions to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds. A denial of qualified immunity, as well as a failure to address the issue of qualified immunity, is immediately appealable \u201c[because immunity is \u2018effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Backe v. LeBlanc, </em>691 F.3d 645, 648 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526-27, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). But our jurisdiction of this appeal is limited to <em>de novo </em>review of the \u201cpurely legal question of whether \u2018the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that [the jailers] are not entitled to qualified immunity on a given set of facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir. 2006) (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 347-48 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc)). Our jurisdiction does not extend to factual disputes and we must accept all of Randle\u2019s well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Morgan v. Swanson, </em>659 F.3d 359, 370 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Neither party disputes the scope of our jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. With these limits in mind we turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Qualified immunity shields \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions\u201d from civil liability for claims under federal law \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 349 (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). \u201c[Qualified immunity constitutes an <em>\u2018immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 323 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806). Accordingly, \u201c[qualified im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>munity questions should be resolved \u2018at the earliest possible stage in litigation,\u2019\u201d usually before discovery. <em>Porter v. Epps, </em>659 F.3d 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 232, 129 S.Ct. <em>808, </em>172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009)); <em>see also Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (citing cases in which this instruction has been given). Resolving the applicability of qualified immunity as early as possible serves to protect officials not only from unwarranted liability but also from \u201ccostly, time-consuming, and intrusive\u201d pre-trial discovery. <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">But here, when the district court denied the jailers\u2019 motions to dismiss, it did not determine the applicability of the jailers\u2019 asserted qualified immunity defense. Rather the district court focused on the jailers\u2019 argument that a heightened pleading standard applied to Randle\u2019s claims, and, after explaining that such a standard didn\u2019t apply, concluded that Ran-dle sufficiently pleaded his claims and thus the motions to dismiss should be denied. The district court\u2019s sole mention of the issue of qualified immunity was to say that the jailers\u2019 argument on this point was rendered moot because no heightened pleading standard applied to Randle\u2019s claims. Likewise, the magistrate judge\u2019s report\u2014adopted in full by the district court\u2014also perfunctorily dismissed the jailers\u2019 asserted qualified immunity defense after concluding that Randle had satisfied his pleading burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The district court\u2019s failure to address the question of qualified immunity violated the tenet that \u201c[qjualified immunity questions should be resolved \u2018at the earliest possible stage in the litigation.\u2019\u201d <em>Porter, </em>659 F.3d at 445 (quoting <em>Pearson, 555 </em>U.S. at 232, 129 S.Ct. 808). Regardless of the pleading standard applicable to Randle\u2019s claims, the district court was required to address whether the jailers were entitled to qualified immunity because the jailers asserted this defense in both their motions to dismiss and their objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. By failing to address qualified immunity, the district court\u2019s order undercuts the doctrine of qualified immunity\u2019s goal of shielding public officials from \u201cunwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn out lawsuit.\u201d <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, 135 F.3d 320, 325 </em>(5th Cir. 1998) (quoting <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991)). As a result, the jailers will likely be exposed to \u201ccostly, time-consuming, and intrusive\u201d pre-trial discovery before Randle is required to demonstrate that his allegations defeat the jailers\u2019 qualified immunity defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648. For these reasons, we conclude that the district court erred by failing to address the jailers\u2019 qualified immunity defense when denying their motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Having concluded that the district court erred by denying the jailers\u2019 motions to dismiss without addressing their de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>fense of qualified immunity, we now decline to decide the applicability of qualified immunity in the first instance on appeal. \u201cIt is the general rule ... that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d <em>Humphries v. Elliott Co., </em>760 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976)). The district court is best equipped to assess in the first instance whether the jailers are entitled to qualified immunity, as well as the corollary question of whether limited discovery is necessary to determine whether any or all of the jailers are entitled to qualified immunity. We leave it to the district court to consider in the first instance whether each jailer is entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Zapata v. Melson, </em>750 F.3d 481, 486 n.3 (5th Cir. 2014) (declining to rule on whether defendants were entitled to qualified immunity when the district court had failed to do so); <em>Helton v. Clements, </em>787 F.2d 1016, 1017 (5th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order to the extent it failed to address qualified immunity and REMAND to the district court for reconsideration of whether each defendant is entitled to qualified immunity</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. In addition to his claim against the jailers, Randle also brought claims against Limestone County, the jail physician who treated him, the physician\u2019s medical practice group, and a nurse employed by the Limestone County Jail. However, none of those defendants is a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. Priapism is a \"[pjersistent erection of the penis, accompanied by pain and tenderness, resulting from a pathologic condition rather than sexual desire.\u201d <em>Priapism, </em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 720430, Westlaw (database updated Nov. 2014). Priapism is a known side effect of trazodone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. The original complaint referred to several of the jailers as \"John Doe\u201d because Randle did not know their names at the time of filing. After referral from the district court, a magistrate judge granted Randle expedited discovery of all jail records related to his detention in order to identify the true names of these defendants, and Randle subsequently amended his complaint to include these names. The records also revealed that the jail had an additional nurse on staff during Randle's detention, and Randle\u2019s amended complaint added this nurse as a defendant. Other than this limited discovery, no discovery has taken place in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">.One defendant filed her motion to dismiss separately from the other jailers. The magistrate judge, and later the district court, considered the two motions together because of the similarity of Randle\u2019s allegations with respect to the single defendant and the rest of the jailers and the fact that the two motions to dismiss were nearly identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\">. While the district court\u2019s order did not explicitly allow any discovery, discovery is the next logical step in the litigation process following the denial of a motion to dismiss. And the magistrate judge\u2019s report explicitly references the need for discovery before \"passing on the merits\u201d of Randle's claim. Therefore the district court's denial of the motions to dismiss, if left undisturbed, is likely to lead to discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. Nor does the district court\u2019s order satisfy the narrow exception to the general rule that qualified immunity should be decided as early in the litigation as possible. Under this exception, \"a district court may defer its qualified immunity ruling if further factual development is necessary to ascertain the availability of [the qualified immunity] defense.\u201d <em>Hinojosa v. Livingston, </em>807 F.3d 657, 664 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648). But in order to properly defer the decision on quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>fied immunity, the district court must follow the \u201ccareful\" two-step procedure that we have established. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648). First, it must \u201cdetermine \u2018that the plaintiffs pleadings assert facts which, if true, would overcome the defense of qualified immunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648). Second, if the district court finds a plaintiff has so pleaded, it can then \u201cdefer its qualified immunity ruling and order limited discovery if \u2018the court remains unable to rule on the immunity defense without further clarification of the facts.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Backe, </em>691 F.3d at 648). Here, the district court did not complete either step of this procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b357-21\">. We note that on remand, each defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity must be considered on an <em>individual </em>basis. <em>See Meadours v. Ermel, </em>483 F.3d 417, 421-22 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
