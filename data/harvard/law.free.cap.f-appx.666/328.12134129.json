On appeal, Margetis and Baron argue that the award cannot stand because Defendants-Appellees failed to comply with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of Rule 11(c)(2). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in its treatment of that issue, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Proceeding pro se, John Margetis and Alan Baron (together, Plaintiffs) filed the instant suit on December 4, 2012, naming as defendants a United States district court judge, a United States magistrate judge, two employees of the United States Marshals Service, and twenty unidentified individuals (collectively, Defendants). Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants individually and in conspiracy with one another defamed Plaintiffs, intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon them, and deprived them of their constitutional rights. After receiving notice of the suit, Defendants\u2019 counsel told Margetis that Plaintiffs\u2019 suit was barred because Defendants were protected by immunity and that Defendants would ' seek sanctions if Plaintiffs proceeded with their suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, asserting that the district court lacked jurisdiction over certain of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, that Plaintiffs failed to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>claim for relief, and that Defendants were immune from suit. On September 18, 2013, a magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal of all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice. The magistrate judge also recommended that a show-cause hearing be held to determine whether sanctions should \u201cbe imposed [against Plaintiffs] for filing an unjustified, vitreous and frivolous lawsuit.\u201d The magistrate judge\u2019s report notified the parties that \u201c[w]ithin fourteen (14) days after service ... any party may serve and file written objections to ... [his] recommendation\u201d and that a party\u2019s \u201c[fjailure to file written objections\u201d would bar that party \u201cfrom <em>de novo </em>review by the district court ... and from appellate review ... except on grounds of plain error or manifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On September 18, 2018, Defendants served on Plaintiffs (but did not file) a copy of a motion for sanctions challenging Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, stating that the motion would \u201cnot be filed or presented to the [District] Court for consideration until the 21-day waiting period prescribed by [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 11(c)(2) has passed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs did not voluntarily dismiss their complaint (or otherwise attempt to correct it) within the 21-day period after service. Instead, on September 30, Plaintiffs timely objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, reaffirming their position that their complaint was meritorious.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 18, Defendants filed their motion for sanctions, requesting, among other things, an order holding Plaintiffs \u201cjointly and severally liable for the full amount of [Plaintiffs\u2019] attorney\u2019s fees in this case\u201d under Rule 11. Plaintiffs filed a response to that motion on November 15 and a sur-reply on December 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">On January 10, 2014, the district court, after \u201cma[king] a <em>de novo </em>review of the objections raised by Plaintiffs,\u201d adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice. That same day, the district court set Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions for hearing on February 11. After granting Plaintiffs two continuances, the district court held a hearing on Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions on March 21. The hearing lasted more than five hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On May 19, 2014, Plaintiffs filed \u201csupplemental objections\u201d to Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions, arguing (for the first time) that Defendants violated the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of Rule 11(c)(2) by serving their motion for sanctions after their motion to dismiss was \u201cfiled and litigated.\u201d The district court subsequently granted Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions, finding (among other things) that Plaintiffs violated Rule 11 by \u201cfiling a complaint with an improper purpose and without any evidentiary or legal basis\u201d and that monetary sanctions were necessary to deter Plaintiffs \u201cfrom continuing to pursue these allegations.\u201d With regard to- Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csafe harbor\u201d argument, the district court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cPlaintiffs failed to raise this argument during the ample time in which they had to respond to the motion for sanctions and at the hearing on March 21, 2014,\u201d but nonetheless considered and rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 argument on the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the district court, Defendants complied with Rule 11(c)(2) by filing their motion to dismiss 30 days after serving it, and during that time, \u201cPlaintiffs continued to pursue their claims by filing an objection to the [magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation] rather than withdrawing any of their claims.\u201d Defendants subsequently filed a fee application, which the district court granted, awarding Defendants $25,000 in fees. Plaintiffs timely appealed, raising only the narrow issue of whether Defendants complied with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of Rule 11(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We \u201capply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990); <em>see also Whitehead v. Food Max of Miss., Inc., </em>332 F.3d 796, 802 (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc). We apply the \u201cnecessarily very deferential\u201d abuse of discretion standard to a district court\u2019s determination under Rule 11 for two reasons. <em>Whitehead, </em>332 F.3d at 802. First, the district court \u201cis better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal standard mandated by Rule 11.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Lulirama Ltd. v. Axcess Broad. Servs., Inc., </em>128 F.3d 872, 884 (5th Cir. 1997)). Second, the district court \u201cis independently responsible for maintaining the integrity of judicial proceedings in [its] court and, concomitantly, must be accorded the necessary authority\u201d to deter conduct that undermines those proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">III. NO ABUSE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions under Rule 11 should have been denied because it was served and filed after Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss had been litigated and after the magistrate judge had issued his report recommending that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims be dismissed with prejudice. According to Plaintiffs, after receiving the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissal \u201cwas but a perfunctory task for the district court.\u201d Thus, Plaintiffs argue, they were deprived of \u201cany meaningful opportunity ,. to withdraw or correct their Complaint,\u201d in contravention of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of Rule 11(c)(2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Rule 11(c)(2) requires that a party serve a motion for sanctions on the opposing party at least 21 days before it is filed with the district court. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2); <em>see also Elliott v. Tilton, </em>64 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir. 1995). If, and only if, \u201cthe challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial\u201d is not \u201cwithdrawn or appropriately corrected\u201d within the 21-day period may the motion then \u201cbe filed or ... presented to the court.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2). Thus, Rule 11(c)(2) creates a period of \u201csafe harbor\u201d whereby parties can avoid sanctions by withdrawing or correcting the challenged document or position after receiving the motion for sanctions. <em>See Elliott, </em>64 F.3d at 216. Because this period of \u201csafe harbor\u201d is dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>on the ability to withdraw or correct the challenged document or contention, it follows that \u201ca party cannot delay serving its Rule 11 motion until conclusion of the case (or judicial rejection of the offending contention).\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1993 amendment; <em>see also Tompkins v. Cyr, </em>202 F.3d 770, 788 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding sanctions properly denied where Rule 11 motion filed after trial\u2019s conclusion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that point, there is nothing left for the opposing party to withdraw or correct, and the \u201cpolicies and procedural protections\u201d provided by Rule 11(c)(2) cannot be given effect. 5A Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1337.2 (3d ed. .2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Here, Defendants served their motion for sanctions challenging Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on September 18, 2013, and filed it on October 18, 2013\u2014more than 21 days later. Although the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint five days before Defendants served their motion for sanctions, the district court did not adopt that recommendation until January 10, 2014\u2014several months later. Thus, Plaintiffs could have voluntarily dismissed their complaint at any point during 30-day period between service and filing of Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i); <em>see also Thomas v. Phillips, </em>83 Fed.Appx. 661, 661-62 (5th Cir. 2003) (finding that plaintiff still \u201chad an absolute right to have his suit dismissed\u201d under Rule 41(a)(1), despite magistrate judge s prior recommendation that plaintiffs complaint be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted). Indeed, Plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation ensured that it remained just that\u2014a recommendation\u2014which the district court was free to \u201caccept, reject, or modify\u201d after <em>de novo </em>-review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>864 F.2d 1219, 1222 (5th Cir. 1989) (per curiam) (recognizing that <em>de novo </em>review requires an independent \u201cdetermination based upon the record ... unrestrained by the findings and conclusion of the magistrate\u201d). Given that Plaintiffs could have formally or informally disavowed their claims during the 21-day period after Defendants served their motion, but instead elected to continue pursuing their claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csafe harbor\u201d argument. <em>See Elliott, </em>64 F.3d at 216 (recognizing that purpose of Rule 11(c)(2) is to provide \u201can opportunity to withdraw or correct the offending contention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-18\">. Plaintiffs had previously sued Defendants a few months prior, and Defendants\u2019 counsel had then told Plaintiffs that Defendants were immune from suit and warned that, should Plaintiffs file another suit against Defendants, Defendants would seek sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">. The \"safe harbor\u201d provision of Rule 11(c)(2) provides that a motion for sanctions \"must be served under Rule 5 [which provides the rules for service of pleadings], but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service\u201d of the motion for sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">. Under the district court's local rules, Plaintiffs, as pro se litigants, were exempt from electronic filing and service requirements. <em>See </em>E.D. Tex. Civ. R. 5(a)(1)(B). Thus, Plaintiffs were served with the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation by mail, which added three days to the 14-day time period for objecting specified in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(C), 6(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\">. On appeal, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs forfeited their \"safe harbor\u201d argument by not raising it until after the district court heard Defendants' motion for sanctions. Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Plaintiffs' claims on the merits, \"we do not need to address the [forfeiture] issue.\u201d <em>Risher v. Aldridge, </em>889 F.2d 592, 596 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\">. Other than setting this outer limit on the timeliness of service, Rule 11 does not specify when a motion for sanctions must be brought, The drafters of Rule 11 left that question for \"resolution on a case-by-case basis, considering the particular circumstances involved.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1993 amendment. Plaintiffs do not argue on appeal (and did not argue in the district court) that Defendants' motion for sanctions was untimely under the particular circumstances of the case, but instead argue only that Defendants motion for sanctions violated the outer limit of timeliness set by Rule 11(c)(2). Thus, Plaintiffs waived any argument that Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions was otherwise untimely under the particular circumstances of the case. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); <em>see also Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (\u201cAlthough pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
