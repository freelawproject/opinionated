But this is not so. The first count in the petition is, in reality what is known as a partnership bill \u2014 an equitable remedy whereby, either before or after dissolution, a partner may procure protection of the partnership property, an account, and a distribution of its assets. These forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>relief are just what plaintiff seeks in his count.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_N\">A. W. Goldsmith for motion; John Weld, contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The making of the Casualty Company a party to this count and asking an injunction against it does not alter the case any, as the injunction here is but incidental to the main relief, and in line with the main object of the action, viz., the distribution of the alleged partnership assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
