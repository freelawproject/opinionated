It is true they argue they can not replevin because they have sold the old hearse and cannot restore it. But that is not a finality to their rights. Radel agreed to sign notes and give a chattel mortgage. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>is a breach of his contract, for which a suit for damages may be had at once, and the measure of recovery would be the price of the hearse sold and delivered to him. See Stephenson v. Repp, 47 O. S., 551.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJt\">B. B.
