We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">The trial court found or the record supports the following facts. In 1994, the then-owners of a gasoline station in North Hampton leased it to respondent DownEast Energy Corporation (DownEast). In 1999, the Trust acquired the property subject to DownEast\u2019s long-term lease. Attorney Simmons, who was counsel for the Trust in the trial court, and his father and brother are the sole beneficiaries of the Trust. In 2001, DownEast assigned its lease to respondent Alliance Energy, LLC (Alliance), which continues to operate the gasoline station.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Shortly after the beginning of its lease, DownEast replaced the existing gasoline tanks. The old tanks were leaking, and had contaminated the surrounding soil and groundwater. DownEast paid for the clean-up and brought suit for reimbursement from the then-owners. After the Trust purchased the property, it intervened to defend against the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">In January 2006, the parties participated in mediation, resulting in the Trust\u2019s agreement to pay DownEast $70,000. The Trust tendered a check in the amount of $70,000, but wrote on the check \u201cSeventy and no thousand dollars.\u201d Concerned that this language would affect the check\u2019s negotiability, DownEast returned it to the Trust, and requested a replacement check. In May 2006, counsel for the Trust notified DownEast that it was disavowing the settlement because DownEast had allegedly \u201cconcealed\u201d contamination of the property in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>DownEast moved to enforce the settlement, seeking $70,000 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The Superior Court (Fitzgerald, J.) granted DownEast\u2019s motion. The Trust, however, continued to refuse to comply with the settlement agreement. DownEast moved for contempt and costs. The trial court held a hearing on DownEast\u2019s motion, at which neither the trustee nor counsel for the Trust appeared. The court found the Trust in contempt, and ordered it to pay the settlement and DownEast\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and interest, and ordered the arrest and incarceration of the trustee if the Trust did not pay. The Trust then honored the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Also in May 2006, the Trust filed the present lawsuit against DownEast, alleging that DownEast had discharged gasoline on the property in 2001. In March 2008, the Trust moved to amend the writ to add Alliance as a defendant, alleging that there was another discharge of gasoline on the property in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In August 2008, the trial court held a structuring conference. Prior to the conference, counsel for Alliance filed a partial stipulation regarding alternative dispute resolution. While counsel for DownEast and Alliance had conferred and reached an agreement about a proposed mediation schedule, they were unable to reach counsel for the Trust, despite several attempts. In the stipulation, DownEast and Alliance proposed alternative dispute resolution before an experienced mediator during the week of January 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">At the structuring conference, the trial court set a deadline of April 30, 2009, for the parties to complete discovery, and scheduled jury selection to begin on June 22, 2009. The parties indicated that they would arrange for private mediation. The Trust thereafter agreed to use the mediator that DownEast and Alliance suggested, and mediation was scheduled for December 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">On October 28,2008, counsel for the Trust emailed counsel for DownEast and Alliance, indicating that he was not prepared to engage in the mediation because discovery was incomplete. He proposed that the mediation be rescheduled sometime after the trial court\u2019s deadline for the completion of discovery. DownEast and Alliance proposed continuing the mediation until March 2009, and informed the Trust that if an agreement could not be reached on a date in March, Alliance would ask the court to set a date. The Trust then agreed to mediate in March, and the mediator confirmed mediation would occur on March 11, 2009. The mediator asked the parties to file mediation summaries between five and seven days before the mediation. DownEast and Alliance each prepared and filed mediation statements and provided copies to the Trust. The Trust did not file a mediation statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Also on October 28,2008, counsel for the Trust sent an eviction notice to the sheriffs office seeking to evict Alliance from the property. The grounds for eviction were the same as those contained in the Trust\u2019s pending suit against DownEast and Alliance. In November 2008, Alliance commenced an equity action against the Trust challenging the eviction. In January 2009, the Superior Court (Nadeau, J.) enjoined the Trust from attempting to evict Alliance and consolidated Alliance\u2019s equity action with the Trust\u2019s civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">At approximately 4:00 p.m. on March 6, 2009, five days before the scheduled mediation, counsel for the Trust contacted counsel for DownEast and Alliance by email, notifying them that he was not prepared to participate in the mediation session:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">[P]lease be advised that we are not prepared to engage in Mediation at this time. This is so because discovery has not been completed.... It simply makes <em>no </em>sense to attempt to engage in Mediation when you have essentially completed your discovery and ours is far from complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">We will have to reschedule after we receive your information and all discovery is complete. Please contact [the mediator\u2019s office and advise him of same and confirm that you have done so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Counsel for Alliance immediately replied that the Trust\u2019s position was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that they had already continued the mediation once at the Trust\u2019s request. He pointed out that \u201c[i]t is rare that all discovery is completed by the time of mediation,\u201d that Alliance had \u201cinvested a significant amount of time in getting prepared for the mediation and arranging for client representatives to be present,\u201d and that Alliance planned to attend as scheduled. Counsel for the Trust responded that the Trust \u201cha[s] not deposed even one ... witness []\u201d and added that his father was unable to attend because of medical reasons. He concluded by stating, \u201cwe will <em>not </em>be in attendance on Wednesday .... Please notify [the mediator] as soon as you can and confirm that you have done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Counsel for Affiance responded that the Trust had \u201cknown about this mediation for months . . . [and] had ample opportunity to take the depositions ... before now,\u201d and that Trust counsel\u2019s father\u2019s unavailability was irrelevant because his brother, not his father, was the trustee. He then asked Trust\u2019s counsel to reconsider and informed him that if the Trust refused to appear and negotiate in good faith, Alliance would be forced \u201cto pursue the remedies provided by the superior court rules.\u201d He closed by writing, \u201cEither way, please let me hear from you by 9:00 Monday morning.\u201d At about 4:00 p.m. on Monday, March 9, counsel for the Trust replied, \u201cThe Trust\u2019s position is unchanged with regard to the Mediation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Counsel for the Trust then called the mediator\u2019s office and left a voicemail \u201calert[ing] him that the mediation could not go forward as the Trust had not taken the required depositions,\u201d and sent the mediator\u2019s paralegal an email to the same effect. In it, he stated that he had asked counsel for DownEast and Alliance to notify the mediator, and that he was \u201cconcerned that they ha[d] not.\u201d He further stated, \u201cAs a courtesy to [the mediator], I want to be sure that he understands that we are unable to participate\u201d at the mediation session. No mediation occurred on March 11, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The Trust claimed that it could not depose John Peters, Steven Hall, and Frederick Hostrop before the mediation. In January 2007, DownEast provided the Trust with interrogatories identifying Peters and Hall as witnesses, and in April 2008 disclosed Hostrop as one of its experts. The Trust did not, however, attempt to depose of any of these witnesses between April 2008 and January 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In October 2008, DownEast\u2019s counsel offered to make Hall available for deposition on November 21, 2008, and in November, he offered to make Hostrop available for deposition on December 5 or 9, 2008. The Trust did not respond to these offers, and on November 14, DownEast\u2019s counsel asked counsel for the Trust if he wanted to depose Hall on November 21. Trust\u2019s counsel replied that November 21 \u201cdoes not work\u201d and that he would be in touch to suggest other dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Trust\u2019s counsel then emailed counsel for DownEast on December 22, 2008, seeking to depose Hall and Peters \u201cafter mid-January\u201d 2009, when he returned from vacation. DownEast\u2019s counsel informed him that he would be away, and sought to schedule the depositions after February 9. Trust\u2019s counsel did not respond, and on January 14, 2009, DownEast\u2019s counsel reminded him that he would be away from January 16 through February 9, and again offered to schedule the depositions to occur after he returned. He asked Trust\u2019s counsel to contact him before he left for vacation, or to speak with his secretary in his absence to make arrangements. Trust\u2019s counsel did not respond to this email to schedule depositions of Hall or Peters for nearly two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">On January 19, 2009, Trust\u2019s counsel emailed Alliance\u2019s counsel requesting dates for Hostrop\u2019s deposition. Alliance\u2019s counsel responded that he was uncomfortable scheduling the deposition of DownEast\u2019s expert, but offered to contact Hostrop so that DownEast\u2019s counsel could confirm a deposition date while on vacation. Alliance provided the Trust with four dates in February, and Trust\u2019s counsel replied that he needed \u201ctime to review and assimilate\u201d interrogatory answers and documents he had received from DownEast and rejected the dates as \u201coverly optimistic and on the early side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>On January 27, 2009, Trust\u2019s counsel emailed DownEast\u2019s counsel requesting dates \u201cin the late-February, early March timeframe\u201d to depose Hall and Peters. The parties eventually agreed to take these depositions on March 24 and 25, 2009. On February 22, 2009, Trust\u2019s counsel requested dates for Hostrop\u2019s deposition, and Alliance\u2019s counsel provided him with twelve dates in March. Two of the offered dates were before the scheduled March 11 mediation, but the Trust selected March 16 and 17 to depose Hostrop.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\">On March 12 and 20, 2009, DownEast and Alliance, respectively, moved for sanctions, alleging the Trust failed to attend mediation and requesting that the trial court dismiss the Trust\u2019s writ. In its motion, Alliance referred to the Trust\u2019s scheduling delays, the settlement dispute in the prior case, and the eviction notice. The Trust objected, addressing only the rescheduling of the mediation session. The trial court granted the motion after finding that \u201c[a]n award of attorney fees on behalf of [DownEast and Alliance] as a result of the failed mediation would be an insufficient remedy given the [Trust]\u2019s overall conduct in this case.\u201d The trial court based this conclusion upon the Trust\u2019s \u201cunilateral refusal to participate in an agreed upon mediation,\u201d the Trust\u2019s past misconduct with respect to the property, and the Trust\u2019s attempt to evict Alliance before the case was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The Trust moved for reconsideration, which the trial court denied, finding that the Trust\u2019s request was \u201ctoo little, too late, for both procedural and substantive reasons.\u201d The trial court stated that much of the information the Trust provided in its motion \u201cshould have been filed in response to motions entered by [DownEast and Alliance],\u201d and none of the new exhibits caused the trial court to conclude it erred in dismissing the cases. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>I. Motion for Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">On appeal, the Trust argues that its attempt to reschedule the mediation session was an inadequate basis for dismissal. Specifically, the Trust argues that Superior Court Rule 170, which provides for a court-sponsored alternative dispute resolution program, does not apply because the trial court did not order the parties to participate in the mediation. Thus, the Trust argues, the trial court erred by basing its dismissal on the Trust\u2019s refusal to participate in the mediation. The Trust also argues that its conduct in this case did not warrant dismissal and the trial court erred in failing to consider less severe sanctions. DownEast and Alliance counter that Rule 170 applies, and the dismissal was proper because the Trust\u2019s failure to attend the mediation was a violation of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">We first address the Trust\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in applying the sanctions contained in Superior Court Rule 170. As with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>other question of law, we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the Superior Court Rules <em>de novo. Martinez v. Nicholson, </em>154 N.H. 397, 398 (2006). When interpreting a Superior Court Rule, as with a rule of evidence, a statute or administrative rule, we will first look to the plain meaning of the words. <em>Cf State v. Holmes, </em>159 N.H. 173, 175 (2009) (rule of evidence); <em>Vector Mktg. Corp. v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>156 N.H. 781, 783 (2008) (administrative rule); <em>Appeal of Pennichuck Water Works, </em>160 N.H. 18, 27 (2010) (statute). We look first to the language of the rule itself, and where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used. <em>Cf. Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 300 (1994) (interpreting statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Rule 170 provides that \u201c[a]ll writs of summons . . . shall be assigned to ADR [alternative dispute resolution].\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 170(A)(1). The rule also sets forth certain categories of civil and equity cases that are exempt from the rule. SUPER. Ct. R. 170(A)(2). The Trust\u2019s writ does not fall within any of those exceptions; thus, Rule 170 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The Trust argues that because the trial court did not order mediation pursuant to Rule 170 and the parties agreed to a private mediation, Rule 170 does not apply. Rule 170 provides that the parties \u201cshall confer and select an ADR process... and a neutral third party to conduct the process.\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 170(B)(1). The parties may select a neutral \u201cfrom the court lists of approved neutrals,\u201d Super. Ct. R. 170(B)(2), or, if they cannot agree, the \u201ccourt shall designate a neutral,\u201d Super. Ct. R. 170(B)(3). Alternatively, \u201c[p]arties may select a neutral who is not on the court\u2019s lists of approved neutrals if [they] agree on the choice of the neutral.\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 170(B)(3)(d). Here, because the parties acted pursuant to Rule 170 by choosing to engage in private mediation and retaining a mediator, Rule 170 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The Trust further argues that Rule 170 does not apply because certain technical requirements were not complied with. Specifically, the parties did not file a stipulation to ADR, or a certificate of readiness as required by the rule. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. R. 170(C)(1)(c), (D)(2). The record shows that Alliance, after consulting with DownEast, filed a partial stipulation, selecting mediation as the parties\u2019 ADR method, choosing a mediator, setting forth the disputed issues, and proposing a mediation schedule. The Trust did not agree to the proposed mediation schedule even though counsel for DownEast and Alliance \u201cmade several attempts to confer with [Trust]\u2019s counsel but [were] unsuccessful.\u201d In addition, DownEast and Alliance both filed summaries with the mediator, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Trust failed to do. We are not persuaded that the Trust\u2019s own failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 170 precluded the trial court from enforcing its sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Trust also argues that it did not refuse to participate in mediation, \u201crather it attempted to reschedule it.\u201d The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201ccounsel for [the Trust] unilaterally indicated that he would not participate in the scheduled mediation and in fact did not do so.\u201d The Trust argues that it attempted to reschedule the mediation by contacting the mediator and counsel for DownEast and Alliance. Although Rule 170 allows a mediator to reschedule the ADR session \u201cupon [the] request of a party for good cause shown,\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 170(D)(2), that is not what the Trust did. When counsel for the Trust wrote to counsel for DownEast and Alliance on March 6 telling them that mediation would have to be rescheduled after the completion of all the discovery, he instructed them to \u201ccontact [the mediator\u2019s office and advise him of same and confirm that you have done so.\u201d After counsel for Alliance replied that this was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d counsel for the Trust responded that he would <em>\u201cnot </em>be in attendance on Wednesday\u201d and again instructed Alliance\u2019s counsel to \u201cnotify [the mediator] as soon as you can and confirm that you have done so.\u201d Counsel for the Trust then emailed the mediator\u2019s paralegal and explained that he was \u201cunable to participate\u201d in the scheduled mediation. Trust\u2019s counsel never submitted a request to the mediator that the ADR session be rescheduled; rather, he notified opposing counsel that it would not attend and instructed them to notify the mediator. The Trust\u2019s statements to DownEast and Alliance that it would not attend the mediation session, and its failure to submit a request to the mediator to reschedule it, amounted to a refusal to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">We now address the Trust\u2019s argument that its conduct did not warrant dismissal and the trial court failed to consider lesser sanctions. Rule 170(F) provides for sanctions \u201c[i]f a party or a party\u2019s counsel fails without good cause to appear at an ADR session scheduled pursuant to this rule.\u201d \u201cThe consequence is any sanction that is just under the circumstances,\u201d including dismissal. <em>Id.; Lamarche v. McCarthy, </em>158 N.H. 197, 205 (2008). The imposition of a sanction is a matter left largely to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Lamarche, </em>158 N.H. at 205. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision, we will sustain its findings and rulings unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by error of law. <em>Hair Excitement v. L\u2019Oreal U.S.A., </em>158 N.H. 363, 370 (2009). We will not overturn its determination absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>To show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the Trust must demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of its case. <em>Yoder v. Town of Middleton, </em>152 N.H. 363, 368 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\">Contrary to the Trust\u2019s contentions, the trial court considered lesser sanctions. In its order, the trial court specifically found that \u201c[a]n award of attorney fees on behalf of [DownEast and Alliance] as a result of the failed mediation would be an insufficient remedy given the [Trust]\u2019s overall conduct in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">We also disagree with the Trust that its overall conduct did not warrant dismissal. The trial court listed \u201cseveral factors that point to the conclusion that only complete dismissal is warranted,\u201d including the Trust\u2019s having \u201cbeen found by this Court in the past to have been guilty of misconduct with respect to this same property\u201d; the Trust\u2019s attempt \u201cto evict Alliance ... before the underlying case was resolved\u201d; and the Trust\u2019s \u201cfailure to engage in timely discovery.\u201d The Trust argues that the trial court improperly considered these factors, erred in engaging in a premature analysis of the merits of its case, and improperly applied the doctrine of unclean hands. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">First, the Trust argues that the trial court erroneously considered its misconduct in the prior settlement. The Trust asserts that it learned of a continuing gasoline contamination on the property after the settlement agreement, and, therefore, the Trust acted in good faith in challenging the settlement. The record, however, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the Trust refused to pay the $70,000 settlement to DownEast \u201cbefore [it] had any basis for arguing that the remediation was not accomplished properly.\u201d Indeed, as noted above, the Trust refused to pay the settlement until the trial court ordered the arrest of its principal. The Trust\u2019s conduct in that case was relevant in the trial court\u2019s consideration of sanctions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Next, the Trust argues the trial court improperly relied upon its attempts to evict Alliance. The trial court noted that the eviction petition \u201cforced Alliance to bring the second law suit... to retain possession of the property which it was entitled to occupy under a written lease.\u201d Thus, the trial court reasoned, the eviction petition was improper because \u201c[t]here was no active gasoline spillage ongoing when [it] was brought.\u201d The Trust argues that it had the right as a landlord to evict a tenant who it believed had violated the terms of its lease, and that it was not trying to circumvent the judicial process because its \u201c[w]rit... did not seek a declaration that Alliance was in breach of the lease, nor did it seek the remedy of eviction.\u201d The Trust\u2019s second amended writ, however, contains two counts against Alliance for breach of the lease agreement. In addition, the Trust\u2019s eviction petition was so closely related to the underlying writ in this case that the trial court consolidated the two actions. Therefore, the record supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201ca serious question raised with respect to the propriety of attempting to evict Alliance . . . before the underlying case was resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Next, the Trust argues the trial court \u201cgot its facts wrong in concluding that the Trust failed to engage in timely discovery\u201d because it completed its depositions before the court\u2019s discovery deadline. The Trust asserts that but for \u201ca two-month vacation-induced delay by DownEast\u2019s counsel, those depositions would have been scheduled in January or February, 2009.\u201d Counsel for the Trust explains that he \u201cintended to take the depositions of [DownEast and Alliance\u2019s] witnesses in January, 2009, . . . but [his] plans were thwarted when those depositions could not be scheduled until mid-March, 2009.\u201d The record does not support this claim, but reveals that the Trust had ample opportunity to conduct depositions before March 11, 2009, yet failed to do so. As of March 2008, when the Trust added Alliance as a defendant, it had not taken a single deposition. Furthermore, the Trust took no depositions between the time of the structuring conference in August 2008 and March 2009. The Trust asserts that it needed the depositions of key witnesses, including Hall, Hostrop and Peters, in order to participate meaningfully in mediation. The Trust knew of all three of these witnesses as of April 2008, and was aware in October 2008 that the mediation was scheduled for March 2009, yet made no attempts to schedule any depositions until December 22, 2008. Thus, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Trust did not timely take the depositions it needed to meaningfully participate in mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The Trust also argues that the trial court rationalized its decision to dismiss the case \u201cby dismissively and incorrectly characterizing its merit and value.\u201d The Trust points to the court\u2019s language in its order that the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services \u201cnever ordered a costly remediation,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his is not a case where the [Trust] has been made to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars on clean-up costs.\u201d In fact, at an in-chambers conference in April 2009, the Trust conceded these points when Trust\u2019s counsel represented to the court that it did not contend that there were any releases of gasoline since the Trust\u2019s purchase of the property, other than in 2001 and 2005. Trust\u2019s counsel also confirmed that the department of environmental services was monitoring the site and had never ordered that there be an excavation and removal of contaminated soil or treatment of contaminated water. There is no indication that the trial court prejudged the merits of the Trust\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We finally address the Trust\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly raised, <em>sua sponte, </em>the doctrine of \u201cunclean hands.\u201d The Trust argues that the doctrine of \u201cunclean hands\u201d is an equitable doctrine and should not be applied in an action at law. In its order dismissing the Trust\u2019s case, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>court stated, \u201cthis is not a case of [the Trust] having \u2018clean hands\u2019 throughout.\u201d We do not read the trial court\u2019s reference to unclean hands as applying the doctrine; rather, it is a way of describing the Trust\u2019s overall conduct throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Thus, we conclude that the trial court properly considered all of these factors, and given the aggravating nature of the factors, the trial court was within its discretion to dismiss. Because the Trust unilaterally refused to attend the mediation, we cannot conclude that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in imposing the sanction of dismissal. <em>Lamarche, </em>158 N.H. at 205; <em>Yoder, </em>152 N.H. at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>II. Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The Trust argues that the trial court erroneously denied its motion for reconsideration. In denying the Trust\u2019s motion, the trial court reasoned that \u201cmuch of th[e] information [the Trust submitted in support of its motion] should have been filed in response to motions entered by [DownEast and Alliance].\u201d The Trust argues that DownEast\u2019s and Alliance\u2019s motions for sanctions focused only upon the mediation issue and not the discovery delays, settlement dispute or eviction notice. While the Trust agrees that Alliance\u2019s motion for sanctions referred to those other issues, it contends that \u201cthose references were supplied simply as background context.\u201d Therefore, it argues that the trial court erred in rejecting the Trust\u2019s arguments in response to those issues as being untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Whether to receive further evidence on a motion for reconsideration rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Farris v. Daigle, </em>139 N.H. 453, 454 (1995). We review the trial court\u2019s ruling for an unsustainable exercise of discretion and will not overturn it unless the Trust can show the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of its case. <em>Garand v. Town of Exeter, </em>159 N.H. 136, 145-46 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, Alliance filed a thirteen-page motion for sanctions with twenty exhibits totaling over ninety pages to show that the Trust\u2019s contention that it tried in good faith to reschedule the mediation was without merit. In its motion, Alliance referred to the contempt order in the prior settlement case and attached a copy of the contempt order as an exhibit, referred to the Trust\u2019s eviction action and attached a copy of the eviction action as an exhibit to its motion, and referred to the discovery delays and attached several emails documenting the delays as exhibits. In response, the Trust filed two, three-page objections, addressing only the rescheduling of the mediation session. After the trial court dismissed its case, the Trust filed a nine-page motion for reconsideration with thirty-nine pages of exhibits, setting forth seven reasons why its motion should be granted. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>court considered these new materials, but \u201cnone . . . caused it to conclude that it was in error in dismissing these cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">[6] The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Trust had ample opportunity to respond to the original motions for sanctions and its inclusion of the materials in support of its motion for reconsideration was untimely. Furthermore, the trial court considered the materials before denying the Trust\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in denying the Trust\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Farris, </em>139 N.H. at 454; <em>Garand, </em>159 N.H. at 145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
