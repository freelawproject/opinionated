RSA 265-A:4-:16 (Supp. 2009) comprise the statutory scheme relating to the implied consent of motor vehicle drivers to submit to blood alcohol testing. Pursuant to RSA 265-A:7, I, when the police extract a sample of blood from a person arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol for the purpose of performing a chemical test to determine blood alcohol content, the police must extract a sufficient quantity of blood to allow two tests to be conducted. Additionally, the testing laboratory must retain for thirty days \u201ca quantity of said sample sufficient for another test, which quantity shall be made available to the [arrested person] or his or her counsel upon request.\u201d RSA 265-A:7,1. Under RSA 265-A:7, II, when the police capture the arrested person\u2019s breath, the sample must be \u201csufficient to allow an equivalent additional test\u201d to be conducted. RSA 265-A:8,1(a) mandates that the person be informed of his or her right to \u201ca similar test or tests made by a person of his or her own choosing.\u201d If law enforcement fails to comply with the prerequisites to tests set forth in RSA 265-A:8, the test administered at law enforcement\u2019s direction is inadmissible. RSA 265-A:8, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">As amended by HB 1146, RSA 265-A:8, 1(a) would give the arrested person the right to have additional blood or urine tests by a person of his or her own choosing, instead of the right to have \u201csimilar test or tests\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>conducted. Additionally, as amended by HB 1146, RSA 265-A:7, II would no longer require that a second sample of the arrested person\u2019s breath be collected or preserved, but would mandate that the person \u201cbe given a reasonable opportunity to arrange for an alternative chemical test.\u201d HB 1146 would leave the remaining requirements of RSA 265-A:7 and RSA 265-A:8 unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We have been asked to opine upon two questions. First, whether enactment of HB 1146 would violate the Due Process Clause of the Federal or State Constitution, and second, whether enactment of HB 1146 would \u201cviolate any other provisions\u201d of the Federal or State Constitution. Historically, we have declined to answer general inquiries on constitutional infirmity and, in keeping with that practice, we respectfully decline to answer the second question. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Weirs Beach), </em>134 N.H. 711, 717 (1991). We turn, therefore, to the first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We first address this question under the State Constitution, citing federal opinions only for guidance. <em>See State n Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). In assessing a defendant\u2019s due process claim under the State Constitution, we look to the principles of fundamental fairness. <em>State v. Hearns, </em>151 N.H. 226, 238 (2004); <em>see </em>N.H. CONST., pt. I, art. 15. \u201c[T]his standard of fairness . . . require[s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). Towards this end, due process \u201cimposes a duty on the State to preserve evidence at least in those circumstances where its exculpatory value is apparent and comparable evidence is unavailable.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. 583, 596 (1989) (opinion of Johnson, J.); <em>see Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In <em>State v. Cornelius, </em>122 N.H. 925, 928-31 (1982), a majority of the court (King, C.J., and Batchelder and Douglas, JJ.) ruled that when the police choose to administer a breath test, it is unconstitutional for the State not to take and preserve a second breath sample. The primary rationale for the majority\u2019s ruling \u201cwas that due process was violated because the police were able to control a defendant\u2019s access to a second sample through then-unbridled discretion in selecting the type of test to be administered.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. at 592 (opinion of Souter and Thayer, JJ.); <em>see State v. Martin, </em>125 N.H. 672, 676 (1984). By choosing the breath test, the police could choose the \u201cevidentiary technique that [was] solely and completely in control of the prosecution despite the fact that other courses permitting independent analysis by the defendants [were] available.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>122 N.H. at 929 (Batchelder, J., and King, C.J., dissenting). The ability of the police to do this \u201cunderminefd] the integrity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>fact-finding process\u201d and, therefore, resulted in a process that was fundamentally unfair and violative of due process. <em>Id. </em>at 929-30 (Batchelder, J., and King, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The statutory scheme, as amended by HB 1146, would be similar to that which existed when <em>Cornelius </em>was decided, and, therefore, raises the same constitutional concerns that the <em>Cornelius </em>majority identified. When <em>Cornelius </em>was decided, the statutory scheme required the State to take and preserve a second blood sample, but did not require the State to take and preserve a second breath sample. <em>See </em>RSA 265:86 (1982) (repealed 2006). Specifically, RSA 265:86 then in effect provided that any person to whom RSA 265:84 (1982) (repealed 2006) applied had the right \u201cat his own expense to have a similar test or tests made by any person of his own choosing\u201d; however, the statute required that only blood and urine samples \u201cbe of sufficient quantity to allow 2 tests\u201d and that the testing laboratory keep such samples for another test for thirty days. Similarly, the statutory scheme as amended by HB 1146 gives the arrested person the right to have \u201cadditional blood or urine tests\u201d by a person of his or her own choosing and no longer requires that a second sample of the arrested person\u2019s breath be collected or preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The State argues that <em>Cornelius </em>should be overruled because, since it was decided, \u201cfacts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.\u201d <em>Alonzi v. Northeast Generation Servs. Co., </em>156 N.H. 656, 660 (2008) (quotation omitted). Specifically, the State notes that the State now uses much improved technology to measure blood alcohol content. The State contends;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">[Ujnlike the breath analyses that were being performed when this Court previously addressed the issue of due process and the availability of separate breath samples, the current procedure involves the analysis of two separate breath samples by the testing instrument (called \u201creplicate testing\u201d), as well as internal and external tests of the instrument itself. Unless all of the internal accuracy criteria are met, the instrument will not provide a reported value. The replicate testing and built-in safeguards in the instrument itself make having the additional sample superfluous in protecting a [driving while intoxicated] defendant\u2019s right to due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Additionally, the State observes, the department of safety has promulgated new rules to ensure the \u201ccontinued accuracy and reliability\u201d of the technology now used to capture breath samples, as well as rules pertaining to instrument operators. Moreover, the State argues that after <em>Cornelius </em>was decided, New Hampshire became the only state that requires preser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>vation of a second breath sample. Because only one state requires this, according to the State, only one manufacturer makes the instrument that captures and preserves a breath sample, and only one company makes the silica gel tubes used for capturing samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The State also asserts that the second breath sample requirement has prevented New Hampshire \u201cfrom staying current with emerging technology,\u201d such as models that test each of a subject\u2019s breath samples with two different technologies. For all of these reasons, the State contends that requiring the capture and preservation of a suspect\u2019s breath sample for independent testing is no longer required by due process. <em>See Moss v. Superior Court, </em>857 P.2d 400, 404-05 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993) (holding that because of the reliability and accuracy of the model used by the State to test breath samples, neither due process nor fundamental fairness required the State to provide defendants with breath samples), <em>review denied, </em>868 P.2d 318 (Ariz. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We are not persuaded that either technological advances or increased administrative oversight of the breath testing process have robbed <em>Cornelius </em>\u201cof significant application or justification.\u201d <em>Alonzi, </em>156 N.H. at 660 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe ultimate <em>Cornelius </em>holding advanced two primary reasons why due process requires preservation of a second sample of breath in light of the statutory requirement of preserving a second blood or urine sample.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. at 587 (opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). First, \u201cthe technology existed for taking such a sample and the cost of it was reasonable,\u201d and second, \u201cthe prosecution, by choosing to take a breath sample..., could opt for the only evidentiary technique solely and completely in its control despite the statute\u2019s requirement that the State preserve second samples of blood or urine when police chose to administer either of those tests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587-88 (opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). These reasons are as compelling now as they were when <em>Cornelius </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">As when <em>Cornelius </em>was issued, the technology still exists for taking and preserving a second breath sample. The State has not contended that the cost is unreasonable. Further, the statutory scheme, as amended by HB 1146, like the scheme at issue in <em>Cornelius, </em>vests the police with the sole discretion to choose which of the three bodily substances will be examined. <em>See Cornelius, </em>122 N.H. at 929 (Batchelder, J., and King, C.J., dissenting). As in <em>Cornelius, </em>\u201c[t]he State\u2019s discretion in choosing the only test method which [does] not require a second sample undermine[s] the integrity of the fact-finding process,\u201d and renders that process fundamentally unfair. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. at 588 (opinion of Brock, C.J., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Batchelder, J.). Accordingly, we believe that the statutory scheme, as amended by HB 1146, suffers from the same constitutional infirmities as the scheme at issue in <em>Cornelius.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The State further contends that \u201ceven with the proposed elimination of the captured sample, ... New Hampshire law would still require that an arrestee be given a reasonable opportunity to have a test of his or her blood or urine taken for independent testing.\u201d We are not persuaded that the right to an independent test of one\u2019s blood or urine diminishes the unconstitutionality of HB 1146. <em>See id. </em>(opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>two justices observed that suspects \u201cface numerous practical difficulties\u201d in obtaining an independent test. <em>Id. </em>at 587 (opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). \u2018While in police custody, the suspect [has] ... to locate an available, licensed technician capable of promptly performing a second test, no matter what time of day or night.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). HB 1146 does nothing to alleviate these concerns. Given the current statutory scheme, we fear that the right of a suspect to have timely independent testing of his blood or urine is merely illusory. <em>But see </em>Vermont Stat. Ann. tit. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1203 (Supp. 2009), 1203a (2007) (requiring law enforcement to make arrangements for independent blood draw and state agency to maintain sample, and allowing medical facilities to be reimbursed for cost of blood draw).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">While we recognize that technological advances may well obviate the need to capture and preserve a second breath sample, we note that no legislative findings have been rendered in that regard. Moreover, in light of the apparent absence of realistic access to additional testing, we are reluctant to conclude that the proposed breath testing is substantially without risk of error. Thus, \u201c[w]e are of the opinion that the dictates of basic fairness require the employment of the technology currently in place which preserves second samples of breath, blood, and urine.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. at 588 (opinion of Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J.). For all of the above reasons, therefore, we conclude HB 1146, which would eliminate the requirement that a second breath sample be preserved, violates the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Because we find HB 1146 unconstitutional under the State Constitution, we need not address in detail whether it violates the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution. We observe, however, that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 488-91, upheld the constitutionality of a statute that did not require that a second breath sample be preserved. Based upon this precedent, likely HB 1146 would pass muster under the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution. We decline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>however, to adopt the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Trombetta </em>when interpreting the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We therefore answer question one in the affirmative as it pertains to the State Constitution and respectfully decline to answer question one as it pertains to the Federal Constitution and question two.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-6\">John T. Broderick, Jr.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ae4\">James E. Duggan</judges>\n<judges id=\"A3i\">Carol Ann Conboy</judges>\n<author id=\"b239-7\">OPINION OF JUSTICES DALIANIS AND HICKS</author>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Under the current statutory scheme, when the police capture the breath of a person arrested for driving under the influence for the purpose of testing it for blood alcohol content, the sample must be \u201csufficient to allow an equivalent additional test\u201d to be conducted, ESA 265-A:7, II (Supp. 2009), and the person must be informed of his or her right to \u201ca similar test or tests made by a person of his or her own choosing,\u201d RSA 265-A:8,1(a). House Bill (HB) 1146 proposes to eliminate the requirement that the breath sample be sufficient to allow for an equivalent additional test to be conducted. HB 1146 also proposes to eliminate the requirement that the person be informed of his or her right to have a \u201csimilar test\u201d conducted. Under HB 1146, a person arrested for driving under the influence would have the right only to have \u201cadditional blood or urine tests\u201d conducted by a person of his or her own choosing and the \u201creasonable opportunity to arrange for an alternative chemical test.\u201d Pursuant to HB 1146, the law will no longer require that a second sample of the person\u2019s breath be collected or preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Question (1) asks whether HB 1146 would violate the Due Process Clause of the State or Federal Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we answer question (1) in the negative. Like our colleagues, we respectfully decline to answer question (2). <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Weir Beach), </em>134 N.H. 711, 717 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">We begin by addressing question (1) under the State Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1982). We agree with our colleagues, for the reasons they propound, that the statutory scheme, as amended by HB 1146, would be similar to that which existed when the court decided <em>State v. Cornelius, </em>122 N.H. 925 (1982), and, therefore, raises the same constitutional concerns as the majority in that case identified. Unlike our colleagues, however, we are persuaded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>State\u2019s argument that technological advances have robbed <em>Cornelius </em>\u201cof significant application or justification.\u201d <em>Alonzi v. Northeast Generation Servs. Co., </em>156 N.H. 656, 660 (2008) (quotation omitted). We agree with the State that given these technological advances, the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution no longer requires the capture and preservation of a suspect\u2019s breath sample for independent testing. Accordingly, we believe that <em>Cornelius </em>is no longer good law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we find Arizona law instructive. Arizona, like New Hampshire, used to require the capture and preservation of a suspect\u2019s breath for independent analysis. <em>See Baca v. Smith, </em>604 P.2d 617, 620 (Ariz. 1979). As breath-testing technology has advanced, Arizona courts have modified due process requirements. <em>Mack v. Cruikshank, </em>2 P.3d 100, 104-05 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1999) (citing cases), <em>review denied </em>(Ariz. 2000). While in <em>Baca, </em>604 P.2d at 620, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that due process required the state to take and preserve a second sample when the test sample is destroyed, later Arizona court decisions have ruled that due process is satisfied as long as the second sample is \u201creasonably reliable,\u201d <em>State v. Harrison, </em>755 P.2d 1172, 1174 (Ariz. Ct. App.), <em>review denied </em>(Ariz. 1988), <em>and disapproved of on other grounds by State v. Velasco, </em>799 P.2d 821 (Ariz. 1990), and that no second sample is required when the suspect is offered a choice between a replicate breath test with no preserved sample and a blood test at state expense with a preserved blood sample, <em>State ex rel. Dean v. City Court, </em>789 P.2d 180, 184 (Ariz. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In 1993, in response to a statutory amendment, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that because of the reliability and accuracy of replicate testing by an Intoxilyzer 5000, which is the predecessor to the model used in New Hampshire, due process and fundamental fairness no longer required the state to capture and preserve a second breath sample. <em>Moss v. Superior Court, </em>857 P.2d 400, 404-05 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993), <em>review denied, </em>868 P.2d 318 (Ariz. 1994). The <em>Moss </em>court observed that \u201c[a]s the technological development of the testing equipment used increases in sophistication and, concomitantly, in reliability \u2014 from ... the GCI Mark IV Intoximeter used in <em>Baca </em>to the Intoxilyzer 5000 used in <em>Dean... </em>\u2014 the demonstrable value of an extra breath sample as the unique means of impeaching test results correspondingly wanes in inverse proportion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404. Unlike prior instruments for testing the blood alcohol content of a suspect\u2019s breath, \u201c[t]he Intoxilyzer 5000 is a very accurate and reliable testing method with built-in safeguards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. It is even \u201cmore accurate than the independent test methods used to analyze the silica gel sample or secondary sample.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the sophisticated technology of the Intoxilyzer 5000 and the replicate testing procedures, the court opined that it was extremely unlikely that preserved samples would be exculpatory. Id.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>see California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489 (1984). The court ruled that given the accuracy and reliability of the Intoxilyzer 5000, secondary breath samples \u201cno longer add anything meaningful to the opportunity to present a defense,\u201d and are no longer required by due process. <em>Moss, </em>857 P.2d at 405 (quotation omitted); <em>see Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 485.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b241-6\"><em>Michael A.
