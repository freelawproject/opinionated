On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress; (2) denying his motion for a mistrial when a redacted portion of his interrogation was played to the jury; (3) permitting the State to ask him whether one of the complainants was lying; and (4) denying his motion to find a child witness incompetent to testify. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">\"Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found or the record supports the following. From 2004 to 2006, the defendant lived in Nashua with his former wife and two children, C.P. and A.P. In 2006, the couple separated, and the children moved with their mother to upstate New York to live with their grandmother. The children\u2019s mother began to date another man whom the children started to call \u201cDad.\u201d One evening at the dinner table, C.P. and A.P. told their grandmother that they had been sexually assaulted by the defendant. The children\u2019s mother promptly reported this disclosure to New York authorities, sought a protective order against the defendant, and petitioned for full custody of the children in New York. The New York State police referred the case to the Nashua police.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In June 2007, a Nashua police detective called the defendant and asked him to come to the police station for an interview. The detective told the defendant that there was no active warrant for his arrest. The defendant, who had moved to Georgia to live with his mother, declined the request, stating that he did not have the money to travel to Nashua. In July, the detective renewed his interview request upon learning that the defendant would be in New York to attend a protective order hearing concerning the alleged assault of C.P. and A.P. Eventually, the defendant agreed to come to Nashua.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">On July 11, after the hearing in New York, the defendant and his mother arrived at the Nashua police station. The police directed the defendant to a waiting room, permitted him to watch television, and served him a soda. The investigating officer, with whom the defendant had spoken on the phone, introduced himself to the defendant and led him to an interview room. Although the Nashua police already had obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was not so informed before the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The defendant was told that the interview would be audio- and video-recorded, and was then advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966). He stated that he understood his rights but wanted to waive them and to speak with the detective. He also signed a waiver form. The detective proceeded to question the defendant about his personal history, children, and relationship with his wife. After approximately two hours, the detective directed the interview to the alleged sexual assault of C.P. and A.P. He explained that forensic examiners had interviewed the two children about the assaults and determined that \u201c[C.P.] and [A.P.] are telling the truth.\u201d He next told the defendant that his children missed him and that he needed to repair his relationship with the children. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">[DETECTIVE:] If I saw two children that were distraught by this, destroyed by this, hurt very badly by this, OK, I wouldn\u2019t be here talking to you. OK? I wouldn\u2019t be here trying to work things with you. OK? Because that\u2019s a different source, different scenario, different story. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re dealing with here. OK? This is a very simple matter. OK? A very simple thing. OK? What you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you. OK? I know [your] mom\u2019s here, OK? Um, and I know your mom is very protective of you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">[DEFENDANT:] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">[DETECTIVE:] Ok. Um, what you tell me in here, OK, doesn\u2019t have to go to her. But I need you to be honest with me so that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>can move past and move forward and keep going. OK? ... Um, and I\u2019m not bull... ting ya. I haven\u2019t bull... t you all, any of the time. I\u2019m telling you the straight up truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">After this exchange, the detective asked the defendant to discuss the specific events giving rise to the allegations of sexual assault. When the defendant was not immediately forthcoming, the detective interrupted to remind the defendant that the children had told the truth. The detective then said that he needed to hear the defendant admit that the children were telling the truth \u201cbefore I can say hey, you know what? This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It\u2019s all done. It\u2019s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it\u2019s over.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the detective again stated, \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t tell me the scenario, that, you know, what happened and what was going through your mind at the time, OK, we can\u2019t get [you] any counseling to fix the problem if you can\u2019t give us some clue as to what the problem was.\u201d The defendant then admitted to sexually assaulting C.P. and A.P. and the detective arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Before trial, the defendant filed several motions relevant to this appeal. He first moved to suppress his oral statements, arguing they were involuntary under the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and New Hampshire Constitutions. The State objected, arguing that there was \u201cno evidence that the defendant\u2019s will was overwrought [sic] by any comment that was made\u201d by the detective. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">After a hearing, the defendant argued that A.P., who was then five years old, was not competent to testify because A.P. did not appreciate the consequences of lying. The trial court disagreed, ruling that A.P had demonstrated \u201csufficient capacity to observe, remember, and narrate, as well as to understand the duty to tell the truth.\u201d She was found competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The defendant moved to sever the trials on the indictments concerning the two children. The trial court granted this motion, resulting in separate trials. Because of the severance, the parties agreed to redact the transcript of the defendant\u2019s confession to omit any reference to the acts of sexual assault against A.P. at the trial for the sexual assault of C.P. These passages were blacked out with a marker. The parties also agreed to redact the video-recording of the confession by muting the sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The trial involving C.P. occurred first. During the detective\u2019s testimony, the prosecution played the redacted video-recording and gave the jury the redacted transcript. At one point during the videotape, the defendant objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecution had not properly redacted the videotape and that the jury heard \u201cwith [A.P.] at least twice.\u201d Based upon this statement, the defendant contended that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>jury would infer that the defendant assaulted A.P., not just C.P. as alleged, and that the defendant discussed this assault in the redacted portions of the interrogation. The State maintained that the jury had heard nothing prejudicial and that the jury would infer only that A.P. may have witnessed the assault. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">During his case, the defendant introduced evidence that his ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend had assaulted C.P. The defense pointed to the fact that C.P. called the new boyfriend \u201cDad.\u201d The defense also elicited from C.P. that the boyfriend had shown C.P. his penis and \u201cdoes nice things when he shows [C.P.] his penis.\u201d Further, the defendant testified that he had never assaulted C.P.; he recanted his confession. He testified that the detective\u2019s assertion that a forensic examiner had found his children to be truthful led him to believe that everyone would think he was guilty. For this reason, the detective\u2019s promise that he would only have to attend counseling if he confessed sounded attractive, and, therefore, he confessed. Upon cross-examination, the State asked the defendant whether C.P. was lying. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the question impermissibly forced the defendant to judge the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the defendant to respond. After two days of trial, the jury convicted the defendant of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, 1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Approximately one month later, the trial for the alleged sexual assault of A.P. was held. The defendant testified he had never assaulted A.P. and again recanted his confession. The jury, however, found the defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, 1(1), and two counts of felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:3 III.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The defendant appealed his convictions involving C.P. and A.P. separately. Because both cases are interrelated and challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The defendant argues that his statements to the police were involuntary, and, therefore, their admission at both trials violated his due process rights under the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST, amend XIV. We first address the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o subject shall be . . . compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself\u2019 and guarantees every citizen due process of law. N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. For a statement to be admissible at trial, the State must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary. <em>State v. Rezk, </em>150 N.H. 483, 486 (2004). Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact for the trial court to determine. <em>State v. Hammond, </em>144 N.H. 401, 404 (1999). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination unless the manifest weight of the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State is to the contrary. <em>Rezk, </em>150 N.H. at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The focus of our voluntariness inquiry is \u201cwhether the actions of an individual are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u201d <em>Hammond, </em>144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted); <em>State v. Damiano, </em>124 N.H. 742, 747 (1984). The decision to confess \u201cmust be freely self-determined.\u201d <em>In re Wesley B., </em>145 N.H. 428, 430 (2000) (quotation omitted). A confession cannot be \u201cthe product of a will overborne by police tactics, or of a mind incapable of a conscious choice.\u201d <em>Hammond, </em>144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted). Generally, we make a determination of voluntariness in light of \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Here, the defendant argues that his confession was involuntary because the interviewing detective made impermissible promises of confidentiality and leniency, respectively. The detective told the defendant that \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.\u201d Later, the detective stated, \u201c[g]et a little counseling and . . . it\u2019s over,\u201d implying, according to the defendant, that if he confessed \u201che would only have to do counseling and that he would see his children\u201d; \u201che would not have to go to jail.\u201d The defendant contends that these promises \u201cwere so irresistible they rendered [his] confession involuntary.\u201d The State counters that the detective\u2019s statements were not promises of confidentiality or leniency. Moreover, relying principally upon <em>Rezk, </em>the State argues that \u201c[i]n light of the totality of the circumstances,\u201d including the detective\u2019s statements, \u201cthe trial court correctly found . . . that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In <em>Rezk, </em>we employed a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether a defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary where a state agent had made an impermissible promise that was neither a promise of confidentiality nor a promise of immunity from prosecution. <em>Rezk, </em>150 N.H. at 488. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, the existence of a promise made to the defendant is not dispositive. Rather, all the facts must be examined and their nuances assessed to determine whether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an influence on the defendant that his will was overborne.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). To aid in this determination, we identified five factors that courts have considered, including: \u201c(1) the nature of the promise; (2) the context in which it was made; (3) the characteristics of the individual defendant; (4) whether the defendant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and (5) whether counsel was present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we stated that \u201ccourts must give qualitative, rather than quantitative weight to the promise\u201d when analyzing the impact a promise has on overbearing a defendant\u2019s will. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cEven a single factor may inevitably lead to a conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect\u2019s will was overborne and the confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The totality of the circumstances test, however, does not apply to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity from prosecution. <em>State v. McDermott, </em>131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989) (\u201cA confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality or a promise of immunity is involuntary and coerced under the State Constitution.\u201d); <em>see Rezk, </em>150 N.H. at 487-88 (recognizing <em>McDermott\u2019s per se </em>rule as to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity even though <em>McDermott </em>cited the totality of the circumstances test).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In <em>McDermott, </em>we held a defendant\u2019s confession involuntary where a federal drug enforcement agent made an impermissible promise of confidentiality. <em>McDermott, </em>131 N.H. at 501. The agent told the defendant that information he provided about a murder \u201cwould not leave the office,\u201d that the DEA \u201csimply needed the information ... to avoid surprises\u201d at trial, and that the DEA would never obtain cooperation from informants if it prosecuted them with the information they provided. <em>Id. </em>at 499 (quotations omitted). He further told the defendant that his statements would not be used against him because he had never received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>We agreed with the trial court that these statements constituted impermissible promises of confidentiality and held the resulting confession involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 501. We reasoned that \u201cto allow the government to revoke its promise after obtaining incriminating information obtained in reliance on that promise would be to sanction governmental deception in a manner violating due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Our holding in <em>Rezk </em>did not supplant <em>McDermott\u2019s per se </em>rule in favor of a totality of the circumstances test for promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution. <em>See Rezk, </em>150 N.H. at 487-88. In <em>Rezk, </em>we acknowledged that <em>McDermott </em>found such promises \u201ccategorically different\u201d and \u201climited our <em>per se </em>rule of involuntariness to promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487 (quotation omitted). For all other promises or threats, we examine the totality of the circumstances to determine \u201cwhether, in making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>promise, the police exerted such an influence on the defendant that his will was overborne.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. For example, in <em>Rezk, </em>we analyzed the effect of a police officer\u2019s promise of leniency on the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession under a totality of the circumstances test. <em>Id. </em>at 488-91. There, the defendant asked the interviewing officer \u201cwhat was in it for him\u201d if he cooperated. <em>Id. </em>at 485 (quotation omitted). The officer promised to not charge the defendant with the armed robberies that he allegedly committed two months previously and not to charge his associate. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the officer promised to charge the defendant only with the crimes he perpetrated the night of his arrest. <em>Id. </em>We held the resulting confessions involuntary because they \u201cwere induced by specific promises of leniency,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 491, that had \u201cthe likelihood of stripping the defendant of his capacity for self-determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489 (quotation and brackets omitted). The police officer \u201cdid more than merely exhort the defendant to be truthful\u201d or promise to recommend leniency to the prosecutor if the defendant confessed. <em>Id. </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">With these standards in mind, we analyze first whether the interviewing officer made an impermissible promise of confidentiality when he stated \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you\u201d and \u201cwhat you tell me in here, OK, doesn\u2019t have to go to [your mother].\u201d The State urges us to uphold the trial court\u2019s finding that while these statements \u201csuggest an atmosphere of confidentiality,\u201d they \u201ccould not reasonably be interpreted as a promise of confidentiality\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. In support of this finding, the trial court noted that the defendant: (1) knew of the allegations of sexual assault; (2) indicated that he would turn himself in if an arrest warrant were issued; (8) knew that his former wife was seeking a restraining order and had driven to a hearing in New York concerning that order with his mother; and (4) traveled voluntarily to the Nashua police station. Therefore, the trial court reasoned, \u201cit would have been naive of the defendant to believe that what he told [the detective] would remain solely between him and [the detective]\u201d because the defendant\u2019s mother inevitably would learn of the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the detective\u2019s statements merely \u201csuggested an atmosphere of confidentiality,\u201d however, is against the manifest weight of the evidence. By focusing solely upon the context of the defendant\u2019s statements, the trial court failed to properly consider the plain meaning of the detective\u2019s statement. <em>See Rezk, </em>150 N.H. at 487-91 (analyzing the plain meaning of the officer\u2019s statements in addition to the nature and context of the statement to determine that specific promises of leniency were made); <em>see also Knight v. State, </em>850 A.2d 1179, 1189 (Md. 2004) (requiring that a court first objectively determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>interrogating officer made an explicit or implicit threat, promise, or inducement). The detective\u2019s statement \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you\u201d can reasonably be interpreted only one way \u2014 that what the defendant told the detective would be kept confidential. It is a promise of confidentiality. The detective\u2019s subsequent statement that \u201cwhat you tell me in here, OK, doesn\u2019t have to go to [your mother]\u201d is a further confirmation of this promise of confidentiality. The fact that the defendant knew of the allegations of sexual assault against him, that he voluntarily traveled to the Nashua police station, and that his mother likely knew of the assault allegations does not change the plain meaning of the detective\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Moreover, the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality here is almost identical to the promise of confidentiality made in <em>McDermott. See McDermott, </em>131 N.H. at 497-99. In <em>McDermott, </em>the agent promised \u201cthat the information [the defendant] provided would not leave the office,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 499 (quotation omitted), just as here the detective promised, \u201c[w]hat you tell me... can stay between me and you.\u201d The State attempts to distinguish <em>McDermott, </em>arguing that the detective here never implied or told \u201cthe defendant that his statements would not be used against him criminally,\u201d as did the agent in <em>McDermott. See id. </em>at 499. To the contrary, however, that is the exact implication of the detective\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.\u201d Indeed, the detective followed up this promise with the statement, \u201cThis is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It\u2019s all done. It\u2019s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it\u2019s over,\u201d further indicating that the defendant would not be prosecuted criminally and only required counseling. The detective\u2019s warning two hours earlier that \u201c[ajnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d fulfilling the <em>Miranda </em>requirements, did not vitiate the detective\u2019s later promise of confidentiality. The trial court erred in finding that the detective\u2019s statement was not a promise of confidentiality. <em>See McDermott, </em>131 N.H. at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The State contends that even if the detective made a promise of confidentiality, the defendant did not rely upon it; therefore, his confession was voluntary. For a confession to be involuntary, we have stated that an interrogator\u2019s promise must induce or cause the defendant to confess. <em>State v. Carroll, </em>138 N.H. 687, 693 (1994); <em>see McDermott, </em>131 N.H. at 501 (noting that a confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary). Here, the trial court found that \u201cthere is no indication that the defendant\u2019s decision to confess was based upon [the detective\u2019s] statements\u201d because, in part, the defendant did not confess \u201cimmediately after\u201d the detective\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not rely upon the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Within ten minutes of the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality, the defendant admitted to the sexual assault of C.P. and then A.P. He had not made a single inculpatory statement during the previous two hours of the interview. Further, the majority of the intervening time is occupied by the detective talking and making statements such as, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear bull... t. You know what, I, I don\u2019t. I, cause to be honest, if you bull... t me, then I may change my impression of you and I may change my view of what happened, OK?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Carroll. </em>In <em>Carroll, </em>the defendant was interviewed by a police officer and under pointed questioning admitted to stabbing the pregnant wife of one of his co-conspirators for payment. <em>Carroll, </em>138 N.H. at 689, 693. After these admissions, the defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to prison,\u201d to which the officer replied, \u201cThen tell us the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692 (quotation omitted). The defendant then made further admissions. <em>Id. </em>We held that the officer\u2019s statement did not induce the defendant\u2019s confession; he had already confessed to several criminal acts and the same factors that motivated his earlier admissions, particularly his mother\u2019s exhortations, induced his later admissions. <em>Id. </em>at 693. In contrast, here the defendant did not confess until after the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s confession here was not motivated by other factors, such as a private actor exhorting him to tell the truth or overwhelming physical evidence of his guilt. <em>See, e.g., id.; United States v. Guarno, </em>819 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir. 1987) (defendant confessed because overwhelmed by evidence police had amassed). The trial court erred in finding that the officer\u2019s statements did not induce the defendant to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Because the interviewing detective made a promise of confidentiality that the defendant relied upon, we hold that the defendant\u2019s resulting statement was involuntary. <em>See McDermott, </em>131 N.H. at 501. The trial court\u2019s contrary determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence as viewed in the light most favorable to the State. In light of our ruling that the defendant\u2019s confessions were involuntary under the State Constitution, we need not address his arguments under the Federal Constitution. <em>See Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 231-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The defendant next argues that, during the trial for the alleged assaults of C.P., the trial court erred in permitting the State to ask the defendant, during cross-examination, if the complainant was \u201clying.\u201d <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Lopez, </em>156 N.H. 416, 423-24 (2007). At trial, the defendant took the stand and testified that he did not commit the alleged assaults. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Q. You heard [C.P.] testify today, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">Q. Did you commit these crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">A. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Later, on cross-examination, the State asked, \u201cAnd so today when your son, [C.P.], testified that [the defendant] made me put his penis in my mouth, he was lying? Yes or no?\u201d Before the defendant could answer, his counsel objected, arguing that the question inadmissibly forced the defendant to opine on the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection, and required the defendant to answer. The prosecutor then renewed his question and the defendant responded, \u2018Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">We agree that these questions violated Lopez\u2019s \u201cbroad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>156 N.H. at 424 (rejecting a case-by-case approach in favor of a broad prohibition). In <em>Lopez, </em>we found that the trial court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to ask the defendant \u201cwhether other witnesses had lied to the jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 423, just as the court erred here in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant whether his son had lied. We reasoned that \u201csuch questioning interferes with the jury\u2019s obligation to determine the credibility of witnesses, and is not probative in that it requires a witness to testify to things outside of her or his knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, held that \u201cpermitting the prosecutor to ask the defendant to opine upon the credibility of other witnesses [is] error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The State invites us to limit <em>Lopez </em>by creating an exception when a defendant has opened the door by testifying about the veracity of another witness on direct examination. <em>See, e.g., Daniel v. State, </em>78 P.3d 890, 904 (Nev. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1045 (2004). The State contends that \u201ca defendant is not prejudiced by a question\u201d about another witness\u2019s credibility \u201c[w]here, as here, the entire defense, including the direct examination of the defendant, is built upon the affirmative accusation that a victim-witness is lying.\u201d A minority of six states have adopted this exception. <em>See, e.g., State v. Pilot, </em>595 N.W.2d 511, 518 (Minn. 1999) (approving questions as to whether a witness was lying where \u201cthe focus of the defense was that the state\u2019s witnesses were lying and that the evidence against him was fabricated as part of a vast conspiracy to convict him of a crime he did not commit\u201d). We, however, decline the State\u2019s invitation to join them. As we stated in <em>Lopez, </em>\u201cwe are persuaded by the majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>jurisdictions that have considered the issue that rather than a case-by-case approach, a broad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses is the better law.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>156 N.H. at 423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant to comment upon the credibility of another witness. The State asserts this error was harmless. Because we reverse and remand based upon the improperly admitted confession, we need not engage in further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court at his first trial erred in denying a mistrial after the jury heard testimony that should have been redacted and erred at the second trial in finding A.P. competent to testify. In light of our reversal on other grounds, we need not address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
