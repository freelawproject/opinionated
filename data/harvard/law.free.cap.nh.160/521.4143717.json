Cardone Revocable Trust, Wesley Cardone, Trustee (hereinafter the Trust), appeals from orders of the superior court denying its motions for entry of judgment and partial summary judgment, while granting respondent Linda K. Cardone\u2019s motion to strike confession of judgment and her cross-motion for summary judgment. We affirm in part, vacate in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">The following facts were either found by the trial court or are undisputed. The Trust was established by Cardone\u2019s mother, Anna, who is now deceased. In June 1998, Cardone used funds that the Trust made available to purchase a condominium in Manchester from Robert and Jeanne Sullivan. The conveyance was completed with a condominium warranty deed to Cardone, which included the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>This conveyance to the said Linda K. Cardone (Grantee) is conditional and she may hold the within premises for so long as she does not in any way pledge, alienate, or in any way hypothecate any interest in the within conveyed premises to any person or entity, nor make any attempt to do so, nor permit any person or entity to exercise a lien or attachment against the within described [premises] until June 12, 2008. Should this condition and covenant be in any way violated or any attempt be made by the said grantee to violate the within condition, the title in the within [premises] shall without further act or action, revert to the Anna H. Cardone Revocable living trust. The Trustee of the said Trust, may in his/her sole discretion modify, release or discharge the within condition in writing, under seal to be recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The deed was signed by the Sullivans, by Anna Cardone as \u201cexecuting] the within deed for the purposes therein contained,\u201d and by Linda Cardone as \u201caccepting] the provisions ... of this deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The following June, Cardone executed a mortgage on the condominium in favor of John R. Cook, in the amount of $11,400, as security for a debt that she owed him. At various times, the City of Manchester imposed liens on the condominium for unpaid property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the summer of 2006, Cardone was medically incapacitated and hospitalized; in July, the Hillsborough County Probate Court appointed her sister, Kathleen Holmes, as guardian over her person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In August, the Trust filed a petition to quiet title against Cardone and Cook, alleging that Cardone was \u201cin breach of the covenant, condition and reverter contained in the conveyance instrument.\u201d The petition sought to divest Cardone of her ownership and interest in the condominium, and also sought a declaration that any purported security interest, mortgage, or encumbrance claimed by Cook in the condominium was \u201cnull and void.\u201d Counsel retained by Holmes subsequently filed a confession of judgment for Cardone, thereby waiving her right to file an answer and defenses to the Trust\u2019s petition. In January 2007, the Trust moved for entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In February, new counsel for Cardone, whose guardianship of her person had been terminated by the probate court two months earlier, moved to strike the earlier confession of judgment and objected to the Trust\u2019s motion for entry of judgment. The trial court denied the Trust\u2019s motion and granted Cardone\u2019s motion to strike. The Trust then filed a motion to enter judgment <em>pro confesso, </em>and a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s earlier orders. Cardone objected and filed an answer to the Trust\u2019s original petition to quiet title. The trial court subsequently denied the Trust\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In June, the Trust unsuccessfully moved for partial summary judgment. In denying the motion, the Superior Court (McGuire, J.) noted that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding both the intent of the parties in creating a condition subsequent, and whether it was breached. The Trust sought and received a conditional default and a final default judgment against Cook, leaving Cardone as the sole active respondent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In August 2008, the Trust renewed its motion for partial summary judgment. Cardone objected, and the Superior Court (Smukler, J.) denied the motion in February 2009. In March 2009, Cardone moved for entry of judgment. The Superior Court (Smukler, J.) treated her motion as a cross-motion for summary judgment and granted it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The Trust contends that the trial court erred: (1) in denying its January 2007 motion for entry of judgment and granting Cardone\u2019s February 2007 motion to strike confession of judgment; and (2) in denying its August 2008 motion for partial summary judgment and granting Cardone\u2019s March 2009 cross-motion for summary judgment. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The Trust first contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for entry of judgment and in granting Cardone\u2019s motion to strike confession of judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">A trial court has discretion in deciding whether to strike a confession of judgment, and we will not disturb its ruling unless the court erred as a matter of law or engaged in an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Hanover Inv. Corp. v. Town of Hanover, </em>142 N.H. 812, 813 (1998); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining \u201cunsustainable exercise of discretion\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The Trust argues that Cardone\u2019s filings, or lack thereof, which culminated in her motion to strike confession of judgment, violated Superior Court Rules 56 (withdrawal of records from court files), 131 (bill taken <em>pro confesso </em>if defendant neglects to enter appearance on the return day, or neglects to file plea, answer, or demurrer within the time proscribed), and 133 (requirements concerning the answer to a bill and defenses asserted). Cardone contends that none of those rules applies to this case. Assuming, without deciding, that these rules do apply, we cannot say that the trial court erred as a matter of law or unsustainably exercised its discretion in striking the confession of judgment. In denying the Trust\u2019s subsequent motions for entry of judgment <em>pro confesso </em>and for reconsideration, the trial court found that Cardone \u201cha[d] demonstrated good cause and that justice require[d] that the confession of judgment be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The Preface to the Superior Court Rules states: \u201cAs good cause appears and as justice may require, the court may waive the application of any rule.\u201d The trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to waive its rules, and we will not reverse its decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Donnelly v. Eastman, </em>149 N.H. 631, 633 (2003). In contexts other than those involving statutes of limitations, we have emphasized justice over procedural technicalities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Here, the record is clear that when the Trust filed its petition to quiet title against Cardone in August 2006, she was medically incapacitated, hospitalized, and subject to a full guardianship over her person and estate. The guardianship over her person remained in effect until December 12 of that year. In response to the petition, counsel retained by Cardone\u2019s guardian filed a confession of judgment indicating that the guardian had reviewed the Trust\u2019s petition, and that the filing attorney represented the guardian, not Cardone. In Cardone\u2019s motion to strike the confession of judgment, filed after the guardianship over her person was terminated, she objected to the \u201cconfession . . . purportedly entered on her behalf,\u201d and stated that she did \u201cnot believe that her interests ha[d] been protected and desirefd] to fully contest th[e] matter, through her own counsel, absent the prior restraints of the guardianship.\u201d In January 2007, the Trust moved for entry of judgment based upon the confession of judgment. In her objection, Cardone stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">[My] interests were not fully and adequately represented by counsel whom [my] guardian retained inasmuch as that counsel did not take steps to oppose the Petition to Quiet Title in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">... [I] was medically incapacitated until at least October of 2006 and therefore could not be consulted regarding [my] position on the Petition to Quiet Title against [me].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">... The Guardian ... had a conflict of interest inasmuch as she is a beneficiary under the ... Trust and, as such, stands to profit in the event that ownership of the real property reverts to the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">... [My] interests were never adequately represented here and, therefore, the court should not enter final judgment against [me] but should maintain this matter on the active docket for adjudication at the appropriate time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The trial court denied the Trust\u2019s motion for entry of judgment and granted Cardone\u2019s motion to strike. The Trust then filed a motion to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>judgment <em>pro confesso, </em>and a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s earlier orders. Cardone objected and filed an answer to the Trust\u2019s original petition to quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In its order denying the Trust\u2019s motions to enter judgment <em>pro confesso </em>and for reconsideration of its earlier orders, the trial court noted Cardone\u2019s incapacitation and the failure of the attorney retained by the guardian to take any steps to oppose the petition to quiet title. In balancing the assumed violations of the superior court rules with the factual circumstances presented to the trial court, we cannot say that it erred as a matter of law or engaged in an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The Trust further argues that had the trial court used the \u201cseven-prong test\u201d referenced in <em>McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, </em>83 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir. 1996), to determine whether a default judgment should be lifted, it would have found that Cardone had failed to establish that either good cause or justice required waiving the application of the superior court rules. The \u201ctest\u201d in <em>McKinnon </em>was a set of \u201cgeneral guidelines that . . . warranted] consideration by a [federal] district court in determining whether a default judgment should be lifted\u201d pursuant to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. <em>McKinnon, </em>83 F.3d at 503. We note that the First Circuit acknowledged that good cause is a \u201cmutable standard, varying from situation to situation,\u201d and that \u201c[n]o precise formula is suggested, for each case necessarily turns on its own unique facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that the Trust argues that we should apply the seven-prong test here, we decline to do so. The First Circuit\u2019s interpretation of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure concerning a default judgment is simply not applicable in this case. <em>Cf. Zola v. Kelley, </em>149 N.H. 648, 653 (2003) (interpretation of Federal Rule of Evidence in United States Supreme Court opinion not binding on our interpretation of New Hampshire Rule of Evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Finally, the Trust, citing no authority, argues that its rights to \u201cappropriate legal and meaningful remedies . . . including] appellate rights\u201d under the State and Federal Constitutions have been abridged. Judicial review is not warranted for complaints regarding adverse rulings without developed legal argument, and neither passing reference to constitutional claims nor casual invocations of constitutional rights without support by legal argument or authority warrants extended consideration. We therefore decline to address this argument further. <em>See Radziewicz v. Town of Hudson, </em>159 N.H. 313, 318 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We affirm the trial court orders denying the Trust\u2019s motion for entry of judgment and granting Cardone\u2019s motion to strike confession of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"> The Trust next contends that the trial court erred in denying its August 2008 renewed motion for partial summary judgment and in granting Cardone\u2019s March 2009 cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment by considering the affidavits and other evidence, and the inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If this review does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, <em>i.e., </em>facts that would affect the outcome of the litigation, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm. We review the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Beckles v. Madden, </em>160 N.H. 118, 122-23 (2010) (citations and quotation omitted). Our decision in this case turns on our interpretation of the language in the condominium warranty deed, which we review <em>de novo. See Duxbury-Fox v. Shakhnovich, </em>159 N.H. 275, 279 (2009) (interpretation of deeds in a quiet title dispute ultimately to be resolved by this court); <em>LeBaron v. Wight, </em>156 N.H. 583, 585 (2007) (proper interpretation of a contract, such as a deed, is a question of law for this court). Our determination of disputed deeds is based upon the parties\u2019 intentions, as best deciphered by construing the deed\u2019s language from the position of the parties at the time of the conveyance and in light of surrounding circumstances. <em>See Duxbury-Fox, </em>159 N.H. at 279. Formalistic requirements in real estate conveyancing have largely given way to effectuating the manifest intent of the parties, absent contrary public policy or statute. <em>Red Hill Outing Club v. Hammond, </em>143 N.H. 284, 286 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> We first turn to the Trust\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying its August 2008 renewed motion for partial summary judgment. In its order, the trial court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">The provision of the deed at issue in this case states that, if . . . Cardone breaches certain restrictions, then the property shall without further act or action, revert to the .. . [T]rust. As stated in [Cardone\u2019s] objection, conditions subsequent are strictly construed and, where ambiguous, are construed against forfeiture. This condition subsequent claims that, upon the happening of a particular event, the property will revert to the Trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">(Quotation, citation, and emphasis omitted.) Both the trial court and Cardone rely upon <em>Red Hill Outing Club v. Hammond </em>for the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>that \u201cconditions subsequent are strictly construed and, where ambiguous, are construed against forfeiture.\u201d We agree, and reiterate what we stated in <em>Red Hill Outing Club:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">The construction of deeds is an issue of law for this court. The general rule in interpreting a deed is to determine the parties\u2019 intent at the time of conveyance in light of the surrounding circumstances. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">We are not convinced, however, that we should apply the general rule of construction to conditions subsequent. The grantor of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent shall have his exact legal right, but no more. To defeat an estate of his own creation, he must bring the grantee clearly within its letter. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent is a conveyance of land in which the grantor expressly retains the right of re-entry upon breach of a stated condition, the exercise of which results in a forfeiture of estate for the grantee. Because of the drastic consequence of a breach, we have traditionally viewed conditions subsequent with disfavor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The passage of time has failed to increase the social value of conditions subsequent. Unlike restrictive covenants, conditions subsequent continue to be viewed with disfavor because of their potential to cause a forfeiture of land. We disagree with the defendants that the consequences of a forfeiture are no greater than those of specific performance of a contract or an attachment on property. A forfeiture by nature is a drastic remedy because in most cases it is widely disproportionate to the breach. In addition, restricted use of the land for a potentially indefinite duration substantially diminishes the land\u2019s marketability and development, ultimately to the detriment of the community. Neither specific performance, an equitable remedy at the court\u2019s discretion, nor attachment, applied to secure payment of judgment should a plaintiff prevail, evokes the hardships associated with a condition subsequent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">The overwhelming majority of courts in other jurisdictions also have continued to strictly construe conditions subsequent in deeds with regard to their capacity to work a forfeiture. Our position conforms to the great weight of authority from our sister States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Our decision today does not abrogate the guiding rule that the intent of the parties to a deed is to be determined and effectuated when possible. When it is a condition subsequent that must be construed, however, the rule of strict construction operates to confine the determination of intent to the face of the deed and resolve all ambiguities against forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 286-88 (citations, quotations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In the condominium warranty deed, the condition subsequent reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">This conveyance to the said Linda K. Cardone (Grantee) is conditional and she may hold the within premises for so long as she does not in any way pledge, alienate, or in any way hypothecate any interest in the within conveyed premises to any person or entity, nor make any attempt to do so, nor permit any person or entity to exercise a lien or attachment against the within described [premises] until June 12, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The deed also delineates the consequence if the condition subsequent were to be breached:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Should this condition and covenant be in any way violated or any attempt be made by the said grantee to violate the within condition, the title in the within [premises] shall without further act or action, revert to the Anna H. Cardone Revocable living trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The target of our strict construction of a condition subsequent is the condition or triggering event, and not the consequence of the same. <em>See </em>1 R. Powell, Powell on Real Property \u00a7 13.05[2], at 13-50 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., 2010) (courts narrowly interpret the language and surrounding facts to see if the triggering event has occurred); <em>Red Hill Outing Club, </em>143 N.H. at 288 (affirming trial court\u2019s strict construction of condition subsequent\u2019s triggering event, and not consequences of alleged breach); <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 473 (unabridged ed. 2002) (defining \u201ccondition subsequent\u201d as \u201ca condition whose fulfillment invalidates or modifies an estate, right, or contract previously vested or in effect\u201d); BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 334 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201ccondition subsequent\u201d as \u201cA condition that, if it occurs, will bring something else to an end; an event the existence of which, by agreement of the parties, discharges a duty of performance that has arisen.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Here, the trial court strictly construed the delineated consequence, and found that the use of the term \u201crevert\u201d resulted either in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>impossibility or an ambiguity. It erred in so doing. Instead, the trial court\u2019s strict construction analysis should have focused upon and made findings as to whether Cardone had breached the condition subsequent \u2014 specifically, did she \u201cin any way pledge, alienate, or in any way hypothecate any interest in the within conveyed premises to any person or entity, [or] make any attempt to do so, [or] permit any person or entity to exercise a lien or attachment against the within described [premises before] June 12, 2008.\u201d In its earlier denial of the Trust\u2019s initial motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court found that genuine issues of material fact existed on the question of breach. In her brief, Cardone argues that none of her actions with regard to the condominium breached the terms of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">For the purpose of this analysis only, we assume, without deciding, that Cardone\u2019s actions did constitute a breach of the condition subsequent. As such, we turn to an analysis of the consequence delineated in the condominium warranty deed \u2014 that \u201cthe title in the within [premises] shall without further act or action, revert to the Anna H. Cardone Revocable living trust.\u201d In doing so, we are not constrained by strict construction. Instead, we look to the general rule and construe the deed based on the parties\u2019 intentions gleaned from construing the language of the deed from as nearly as possible the position of the parties at the time of the conveyance and in light of surrounding circumstances. <em>Duxbury-Fox, </em>159 N.H. at 279. We remain mindful that formalistic requirements in real estate conveyancing have largely given way to effectuating the manifest intent of the parties, absent contrary public policy or statute. <em>Red Hill Outing Club, </em>143 N.H. at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Cardone argues that use of the term \u201crevert\u201d in the deed, and the consequent \u201capparent intent ... to return the property to the trust,\u201d created \u201ca stark ambiguity\u201d because the Trust had never previously owned or possessed the condominium. The trial court denied the Trust\u2019s renewed motion for partial summary judgment because it found that use of the term \u201crevert\u201d resulted either in an impossibility or an ambiguity, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">The [Trust] asserts that it would boggle the legal minds across the country as to how to make the language of any transfer instrument any more clear than the one that is present here. If the Trust is correct \u2014 the instrument is not ambiguous \u2014 it nevertheless is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. By definition, it would be impossible for the property to revert to the Trust because the Trust never owned the property. If, however, the deed is ambiguous, the ultimate result remains the same. Because the court construes an ambiguous condition subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>against forfeiture, the court will not interpret the reverter provision as some other permissible transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">(Quotation and citations omitted.) We disagree that use of the term \u201crevert\u201d here causes either an impossibility or ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">If we were to read the term \u201crevert\u201d in isolation and in an overly technical sense, we agree that the title to the condominium could not \u201crevert\u201d to the Trust, as the Trust had not previously owned the property. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1943 (definition of \u201crevert\u201d includes \u201cto return to the proprietor or his heirs or assigns after the termination of a particular estate or reversion granted by him\u201d); BLACK\u2019S Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1284 (definition of \u201cpossibility of reverter\u201d includes \u201ca future interest retained by a grantor after conveying a fee simple determinable, so that the grantee\u2019s estate terminates automatically and reverts to the grantor if the terminating event ever occurs\u201d). Given such a reading, the term \u201crevert\u201d might either lead to confusion or refer to a legal impossibility in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">As previously detailed, however, we are not guided by such an overly technical reading when construing the consequence delineated in the condominium warranty deed. Here, the language of the clause (\u201cShould this condition ... be in any way violated . . . the title in the within [premises] shall without further act or action, revert to the Anna H. Cardone Revocable living trust\u201d) makes clear that the intent of the parties was for title to the condominium to transfer to the Trust if the condition were breached. Having specifically named the Trust, nothing in the language of the clause indicates any intent for the title to transfer to either the Sullivans or their estate. As such, use of the term \u201crevert\u201d was an unfortunate, but by no means a fatal, choice of words. <em>See, e.g., Hiller v. Loring, </em>136 A. 350, 351 (Me. 1927) (in the interpretation of a will, where language used is inapt, crude, imperfect, or of doubtful meaning, the language is subordinated to the intention of the testator, and the term \u201c \u2018revert\u2019 may be construed as \u2018go to\u2019 or \u2018pass to,\u2019 regardless of the fact that the taker has no prior interest in the property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> Nor does any such confusion, or legal impossibility, create ambiguity in the clause itself. <em>See Lassonde v. Stanton, </em>157 N.H. 582, 594 (2008) (lack of precision in contract clause does not create ambiguity). Instead, \u201c[a]mbiguity exists only when the parties could reasonably disagree as to a clause\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, even if we were to decide that the term \u201crevert\u201d rendered the clause in the deed ambiguous, the surrounding circumstances all point to the Trust as the intended recipient of the title to the condominium if the condition is breached.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Where the agreement\u2019s language is ambiguous, it must be determined what the parties, under an objective standard, mutually understood the ambiguous language to mean. In applying the objective standard, a court should examine the contract as a whole, the circumstances surrounding execution and the object intended by the agreement, while keeping in mind the goal of giving effect to the intention of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><em>Found, for Seacoast Health v. HCA Health Servs. of </em>N.H., 157 N.H. 487, 501 (2008) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Here, the record is clear that the Trust provided Cardone with the funds to purchase the condominium from the Sullivans. The condominium warranty deed was signed by Cardone\u2019s mother (the trustor), the Sullivans, and Cardone. Cardone read and agreed to the language of the deed. In her deposition, Cardone stated that she understood that the condominium would return to the Trust if she violated any of the conditions in the deed. Kevin Sullivan, co-executor of his parents\u2019 estates, filed an affidavit stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">To the best of my knowledge and belief, it was [the Sullivans\u2019] understanding that this paragraph meant exactly what it said in that the condominium unit title would transfer to the trust automatically if the conditions or the restrictions described in the deed were violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Indeed, Cardone acknowledges in her brief that \u201c[t]he apparent intent of the deed [was] to return the property to the trust.\u201d We do not believe that the language of the clause can be reasonably read to mean anything but that title to the condominium should transfer to the Trust if the condition were to be breached. Consequently, we vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of the Trust\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Finally, we turn to the Trust\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in granting Cardone\u2019s March 2009 cross-motion for summary judgment. In granting the cross-motion, the trial court stated: \u201cCardone has established that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Here, the trial court first reiterated the earlier analysis concerning impossibility or ambiguity that it had employed in denying the Trust\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment. For the reasons explained above, we disagree with that analysis. The trial court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">[T]he deed language [of \u201crevert\u201d] could be characterized as creating either a reversionary interest or an executory interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>... Because forfeiture is a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d in either scenario, the court will interpret a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest no differently than a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Thus, because the language purporting to create a fee simple determinable subject to executory interest in this case is ambiguous, the court will interpret it against forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We need not decide whether the terminology used in the deed is more appropriately deemed a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In either case, our analysis of the term \u201crevert\u201d is the same. Specifically, the language of the clause makes clear that the parties\u2019 intent was for title to the condominium to transfer to the Trust if Cardone violated the terms of the deed. The Trust having been specifically named, nothing in the language of the clause indicates any intent that title transfer to either the Sullivans or their estate. While use of the term \u201crevert\u201d was unfortunate, it was by no means a fatal choice of words. Nor does the term \u201crevert\u201d create ambiguity in the clause itself, as we do not believe that the language of the clause can be reasonably read to mean anything but that title to the condominium should transfer to the Trust if Cardone violates the terms of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In sum, we affirm the trial court orders denying the Trust\u2019s motion for entry of judgment and granting Cardone\u2019s motion to strike confession of judgment; we vacate the trial court\u2019s order denying the Trust\u2019s August 2008 renewed motion for partial summary judgment; we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting Cardone\u2019s March 2009 cross-motion for summary judgment; and we remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; reversed in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b585-8\">Dalianis, Duggan, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
