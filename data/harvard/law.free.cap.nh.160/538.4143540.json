Morse, be suspended from the practice of law for two years. We order that the respondent be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Morse has stipulated to, and we accept, the following facts. <em>See Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. 299, 300 (2009); Sup. Ct. R. 37A(III)(c)(5). Morse, an attorney licensed in New Hampshire since 1972, represented Bertha Mclnnes in a guardianship action. On September 12, 1998, Mclnnes died. Her estate was valued at $461,500. In her will, Mclnnes named her niece, Ruth Ann Mize, as executrix. Mize resides in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">On September 22,1998, Morse filed an appearance on behalf of Mize and a petition for estate administration in the Rockingham County Probate Court. The court approved both the petition and a bond in the amount of $350,000. On November 25,1998, the court ordered Morse to file an estate inventory by February 21,1999, and an accounting by November 24,1999. The court required Morse to file a yearly accounting until he completed a final accounting for the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">\n<em>A. The Inventory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">Morse failed to file the inventory by the court\u2019s deadline. He filed four petitions to extend the deadline, alleging each time that he could not complete the inventory \u201cuntil the final account in the Guardianship of Bertha Mclnnes ... has been completed and [Mize] receives the guardianship Estate.\u201d The court granted these petitions. Finally, in September 1999, approximately seven months after the first deadline, Morse filed the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">\n<em>B. The First Accounting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">Morse also failed to file the first accounting by November 24, 1999. On February 23, 2000, the court placed the case in default, assessed a $25.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>default fee, and warned Mize that the court would issue a citation if she failed to file the accounting within thirty days. Morse filed two petitions to extend the deadline, claiming that \u201c[t]his is a complex Estate with a number of personal property assets that have been sold or transferred\u201d and that he needed \u201cadditional time to complete\u201d the first accounting. The court granted these petitions. Finally, on June 23, 2000, approximately seven months after the deadline, Morse filed the first accounting and a petition to make interim distributions to the three residuary legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>C. The Second Accounting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The second accounting was due on November 24, 2000. Morse failed to meet this deadline, and, over a period of more than two years, filed twelve petitions to extend the deadline. At various times, Morse claimed that: (1) the estate was \u201ccomplex . . . with a number of assets\u201d so he needed additional time to complete tax returns for the estate; (2) \u201c[t]he Estate has recently learned that it owns certain shares of Avaya, Inc., common stock\u201d that must be sold before the final accounting; and (3) \u201c[t]here is one antique item in the possession of Skinner, Inc. which is awaiting sale at auction.\u201d Morse also claimed that he had prepared the second accounting for Mize\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The court granted most of the petitions. The court cited Mize for her failure to timely file the second accounting, but did not issue a finding of contempt on the condition that she file the accounting no later than May 1, 2002. On November 25,2002, the court granted Morse\u2019s eleventh petition to extend the deadline but prohibited any further extensions. By order dated February 10, 2003, the court notified Mize that Morse had failed to file the second accounting, and scheduled a hearing for April 7, 2003, requiring Mize to personally appear and explain why she had failed to file the second accounting. The court later continued the hearing to April 21, 2003. Four days later, the court issued an order stating that, based upon Morse\u2019s \u201cassurance that he will file a final account no later than May 23, 2003, no finding is entered nor sanction is presently imposed. <em>... No further postponements shall issue.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Mize wrote a letter to the court, dated May 21, 2003, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">Morse assured me that he would handle the details to settle the Estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">It has been 5 long years of numerous phone calls and letters trying to settle these matters. [Morse] never returns my calls, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>making it necessary for me to make numerous calls until he is in and available.... It seems to me that 5 years is much too long for an Estate to be settled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">When I received your order... I was embarrassed and angry. The three recipients of the bulk of the Estate are in the later years of their lives, 84, 90, and 91. They have looked to me to see that my aunt\u2019s will would be carried out. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">I called [Morse] as soon as I got your notice. He assured me that he would have everything wrapped up by the deadline you have set. He also told me that he would be sending me papers that I needed to sign. On Monday of this week, I called his office to see why I hadn\u2019t received anything. He said he hadn\u2019t gotten it finished and promised to overnight the papers to me, to arrive at my home on Wednesday, May 21st. The papers never arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">It is my understanding that he is to meet with you on Friday, May 23rd. I am sending you this letter, overnight, in the hopes that you will receive this before you meet with [Morse].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Please advise me what I need to do to finish this long process and make the final payments to those entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Mize also wrote an undated letter to Morse, which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">[B]oth my husband and I have tried repeatedly over the past four months to reach you by phone, to no avail. We have left messages asking that you return our calls and while all of the numbers that you can reach us at have answering services if we are busy or away, we have had no response to any of our messages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">When I spoke with you last, you told me that you would be filing the final taxes on the Mclnnes Estate the following Monday. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">I realize there have been some circumstances that have slowed down the process of settling this Estate, including your losing your receptionist. However, I have made you aware of my concern that one uncle who was to receive an inheritance from this Estate has already passed away and the three women remaining who benefit from this Estate, are of advanced age. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">By this letter and a copy being sent to the Rockingham Probate Court, I am requesting that I be completely informed of the status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of this file immediately. If the taxes have not been filed, please explain why they haven\u2019t. If they have been filed, when were they filed and has the State approved the filing? What, if anything, is preventing the final closure of this Estate? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">I am expecting to hear from you immediately, upon receipt of this letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Morse failed to file the accounting by May 23,2003, and, on June 12,2003, the court ordered Mize to personally appear at a hearing to \u201cshow cause why he/she should not be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly for the failure and neglect to comply with\u201d the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Morse sent a proposed second accounting to Mize. He sent a copy to the court on June 23, 2003, and expressed his belief that Mize would send the signed original to the court. Morse paid a $50.00 citation fee, and anticipated that, based upon his submissions, the court would not hold a hearing, and left on a vacation. However, contrary to Morse\u2019s expectations, Mize appeared at the June 23 hearing. The court issued an order the day after the hearing, which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">Mize reported that her non-compliance with the April 25, 2003 order ... is the result of her attorney\u2019s failure to discharge his duties to her. She has attempted to contact him to secure answers to questions that she would like to have clarified before she executes documentation that he has prepared and forwarded to her. The questions she detailed to the court seemed reasonable. The court does not apprehend why her attorney has not reasonably responded.... [Morse previously] took responsibility for the delayed administration and gave assurance that he would be able to readily comply with the May 23, 2003 deadline for a <em>final </em>account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The court ordered Mize to submit a final account no later than July 31, 2003. Mize terminated Morse and hired Attorney Charles F. Tucker to represent the estate. On July 18, Attorney Tucker filed a motion to accept interim accounting and for an extension of time to finalize the estate, enclosing the second accounting prepared by Morse; both requests were granted by the court. Shortly thereafter, Mize retained Attorney Andrea L. Sennott, of Robinson, Boesch, Sennott &amp; Aeschliman, P.A., to represent the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">\n<em>D. Tax Returns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">In the proposed second accounting that Morse submitted to the court, he indicated that he had filed all federal and state income tax returns for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>last year of Mclnnes\u2019s life and for her estate. Morse also informed Mize that he had filed tax returns and that the estate could expect to receive a significant tax refund. In a letter to the court, Morse stated that the Estate was \u201cawaiting refunds from the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d As an addendum to this account, Morse attached his legal bill for the first account; a time entry in the bill, dated April 15,1999, stated \u201cPrepare 1998 Fm 1040,\u201d and indicated that he spent 1.5 hours on this return, at a rate of $120 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">After Mize terminated him, Morse failed to disclose that he had not filed the tax returns. In a letter to the estate\u2019s legatees, Tucker\u2019s paralegal wrote that Morse \u201cis still awaiting tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service and from the State of New Hampshire, which he estimates may be in excess of $15,000.00.\u201d Morse submitted a legal bill to the estate for the second accounting in which he stated that he prepared state and federal taxes for the estate. However, the estate file from Morse contained no executed tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Attorney Sennott filed a final accounting for the estate on October 30, 2003. Attorney William S. Boesch, also of Robinson, Boesch, Sennott &amp; Aeschliman, contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and was informed that no tax returns had been filed for Mclnnes or the estate. After receiving the necessary tax returns from Attorney Boesch, the IRS declined to issue a $579 refund for Mclnnes\u2019s personal tax return because it was filed too late. The IRS assessed the estate penalties and late interest for tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001. Attorney Boesch finally resolved the outstanding tax issues with the IRS in August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>E. The File Transfer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">After June 23, 2003, Morse agreed to transfer the file for the estate to Mize\u2019s new attorney. On October 3, after making repeated requests, and receiving assurances from Morse that he would transfer the file, Sennott\u2019s paralegal sent an email to Mize in which she stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">It is with much regret that I have to inform you that... [Morse] still hasn\u2019t gotten the file to us. I\u2019ve tried daily. I\u2019ve made appointments with him to pick it up and he calls and cancels at the last minute because he\u2019s out of paper, the copier isn\u2019t working, or one excuse after another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Three days later, Morse transferred the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">In a letter to Morse dated September 5, 2003, the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) asked for additional information to process a tax return it had received for the Mclnnes estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Subsequently, Morse received another letter from the DRA informing him that, because he had failed to send the requested documentation, it made an audit adjustment based on its file. Although the letter stated that Morse had until November 17 to voice his disagreement with the adjustment, Morse failed to respond or to notify successor counsel of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The estate was closed in March 2004, and, as a result of Morse\u2019s failure to adequately close out the estate, it incurred approximately $8,000 in legal fees to successor counsel, in addition to fees paid to Morse.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>II. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Mize filed a complaint against Morse with the Attorney Discipline Office. Disciplinary counsel filed charges against Morse, alleging that he failed to complete the estate administration and provide a copy of the estate file to successor counsel in a timely fashion, and made false assertions to the court with respect to the estate\u2019s tax returns. A Hearing Panel was appointed on May 15, 2008. Although Morse initially claimed that he had prepared the returns for Mize\u2019s signature and that he \u201cretained copies for [his] file,\u201d at the hearing before the Panel, he disclosed for the first time a set of unfiled tax returns for the estate that contained handwritten entries. He explained at the hearing that he would have filed the tax returns had Mize not terminated him. At the hearing, disciplinary counsel argued that the Hearing Panel should disbar Morse.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The Hearing Panel recommended that Morse be suspended for two years from the practice of law, with conditions for reinstatement. It concluded that he violated the following New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.1 (Competence); 1.3 (Diligence); 1.16(d) (Return of the File); 3.3(a)(1) (Candor to the Tribunal); and 8.4(c) (Dishonesty). The Hearing Panel determined that the violations of Rules 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4(c) were the most serious. The Hearing Panel concluded that \u201csuspension was the baseline sanction in this case,\u201d relying upon Section 6.12 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1992) (hereafter Standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The Hearing Panel found the following aggravating factors: (1) a prior disciplinary offense, which \u201cbore marked similarities to the violations in this case,\u201d and for which Morse was disciplined while representing the estate in this case; (2) that Morse submitted false evidence and statements, and committed other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process; (3) that he refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; (4) that Mize and the legatees were vulnerable because they were \u201celderly and/or infirm and in need of the assets from the estate\u201d; (5) that Morse had substantial experience in the practice of law; and (6) that he was indifferent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>to making restitution. The Hearing Panel determined that the following were mitigating factors: (1) that Morse lacked a selfish motive; (2) that he had a good reputation \u201cin his community and by people who have worked for him;\u201d and (3) that he showed \u201cremorse and regret for his professional failings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Disciplinary counsel requested oral argument before the PCC on the sanction, and argued that Morse should be disbarred. The PCC, however, recommended a two-year suspension from the practice of law with conditions for reinstatement. The PCC determined that Morse \u201cviolated duties to his client, the court and his profession^]... misrepresented the status of his client\u2019s case to the client and the court, and did not cooperate promptly with subsequent counsel.\u201d The PCC found that while Morse was grossly negligent, \u201cthere is no evidence that he acted with any intent to do harm to anyone or with any intent to benefit himself.\u201d Although the PCC concluded that Morse caused emotional and financial injuries to his client, it determined that those injuries \u201cdid not rise to the level of \u2018serious\u2019 injury as described in the [Standards].\u201d Accordingly, relying upon section 6.12 of the STANDARDS, the PCC determined that the baseline sanction for Morse was suspension. After considering the aggravating and mitigating factors relied upon by the Hearing Panel, the PCC \u201cfound an insufficient basis for elevating the sanction to disbarment\u201d because: (1) Morse did not act with a selfish motive; (2) there was no \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d; (3) Morse has a positive reputation in the community and has practiced law for over thirty years; and (4) after considering \u201cother cases in which similar circumstances were presented... [the PCC] found no basis for inconsistently imposing... disbarment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Disciplinary counsel moved to reconsider, arguing that the PCC \u201cmisapprehended ... critical legal principles\u201d and that, in light of those principles, disbarment was the appropriate sanction. The PCC granted that motion, but voted to reaffirm its previous decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We retain the ultimate authority to determine the sanction for a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct. <em>Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 303. When determining whether to impose the ultimate sanction of disbarment, we focus not on punishing the offender, but on protecting the public, maintaining public confidence in the bar, preserving the integrity of the legal profession, and preventing similar conduct in the future. <em>Id. </em>We consider the case on its own facts and circumstances in deciding the sanction. <em>Id. </em>The sanction we impose must take into account the severity of the misconduct. <em>Coffey\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. 503, 513 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We look to the Standards for guidance. <em>See Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>156 N.H. 613, 621 (2007). Under the Standards, we consider the following factors when imposing sanctions: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 303; Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3.0. We first categorize the respondent\u2019s misconduct and identify the baseline sanction. <em>Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 303. After determining the sanction, we then consider the effect of any aggravating or mitigating factors on the ultimate sanction. <em>Id. </em>Where there are multiple misconduct charges, \u201cthe sanction imposed should at least be consistent with the sanction for the most serious instance of misconduct among a number of violations; it might well be and generally should be greater than the sanction for the most serious misconduct.\u201d <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. 285, 306 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We first review the duties that Morse violated. According to the PCC, the misrepresentations to the court and to Mize with respect to the tax returns were the most serious violations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Next, we consider Morse\u2019s mental state at the time of his violations, which may be one of intent, knowledge, or negligence. <em>Grew\u2019s Case, </em>156 N.H. 361, 366 (2007). The volitional nature of the acts, and not the external pressures that could potentially have hindered his judgment, is relevant. <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. at 307. The PCC concluded that Morse acted with gross negligence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> The STANDARDS define negligence as \u201cthe failure of a lawyer to heed a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, which failure is a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in the situation.\u201d STANDARDS, <em>supra </em>at 9. By contrast, \u201c[ijntent is the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result,\u201d and \u201cKnowledge is the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\u201d STANDARDS, <em>supra </em>at 9 (quotation omitted). Here, Morse admitted that, when he submitted the second accounting to the court and to Mize, he knew that he had not filed the tax returns. Although, as the PCC concluded, Morse may not have acted with an intent to harm anyone or to benefit himself, we conclude that he acted intentionally when he made these false statements. <em>See Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> We next consider the actual or potential injury flowing from Morse\u2019s conduct. The STANDARDS define injury as \u201charm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe level of injury can range from \u2018serious\u2019 injury to \u2018little or no\u2019 injury.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>at 9. Although the PCC acknowledged that Morse\u2019s actions caused emotional and financial injuries to his client, it determined that those injuries \u201cdid not rise to the level of \u2018serious\u2019 injury as described in the Standards.\u201d We disagree. At a minimum, Morse\u2019s misconduct caused substantial harm to Mize, the estate, and its legatees. The estate paid approximately $8,000 in legal fees to successor counsel, in addition to fees paid to Morse for his incomplete work with respect to the tax returns. The IRS declined to issue a $579 refund because the tax return for the last year of Mclnnes\u2019s life was filed more than three years late, and assessed penalties and interest for tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001. The estate paid $1,849.68 for Mize to appear in person on June 23,2003, because of Morse\u2019s failure to file the second accounting on time. In fact, Mize made \u201cseveral trips to the east coast[ ] specifically for this matter\u201d and stated that she suffered emotional stress as a result of Morse\u2019s misconduct. Because both Mize and the legatees were elderly, the length of time it took to close the estate was particularly harmful. Finally, Morse\u2019s lies to the tribunal and to Mize caused great harm to the court, his client, and to the profession; as we have stated, \u201cno single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie.\u201d <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. 359, 369 (2006). For these reasons, we conclude that Morse\u2019s actions caused serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Sections 6.11 and 6.12 of the STANDARDS provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, with the intent to deceive the court, makes a false statement, submits a false document, or improperly withholds material information, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a party, or causes a significant or potentially significant adverse effect on the legal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows that false statements or documents are being submitted to the court or that material information is improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and causes injury or potential injury to a party to the legal proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Morse caused serious injury to Mize, the estate, and its legatees. <em>See Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 304. He lied to his client and to the tribunal. As officers of the court, attorneys are prohibited from making false statements of material fact to a tribunal. <em>See </em>N.H. R. PROF. CONDUCT 3.3(a)(1). \u201cThe confidence of judges to rely with certainty upon the word of attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>forms the very bedrock of our judicial system.\u201d <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>146 N.H. 466, 467 (2001) (quotation omitted). We conclude that the baseline sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Finally, we consider the aggravating and mitigating factors. The PCC found the following aggravating factors: (1) Morse\u2019s prior, similar disciplinary offense; (2) his submission of false evidence and statements and deceptive practices during the disciplinary process; (3) his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; (4) the vulnerability of Mize and the legatees; (5) Morse\u2019s substantial legal experience; and (6) his indifference to making restitution. <em>See </em>STANDARDS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.22 (a), (e)-(j). We agree that these aggravating factors apply. As mitigating factors, the PCC found that Morse: (1) lacked a selfish motive; (2) had a good reputation in the community and among his employees; and (3) showed remorse and regret. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32 (b), (g), (1). We also agree that these mitigating factors apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">However, we conclude that Morse\u2019s deliberate lies require no less a sanction than disbarment. <em>See Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. at 369 (stating that \u201cattorney misconduct involving dishonesty justifies disbarment\u201d). \u201cThe privilege of practicing law does not come without the concomitant responsibilities of truth, candor and honesty. Lawyering involves a public trust and requires an unswerving allegiance to honesty and integrity.\u201d <em>Bosse\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. 128, 131 (2007) (citation and quotation omitted). Having considered both the aggravating and mitigating factors, we conclude that the sanction of suspension would be \u201cinsufficient to protect the public and preserve the integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. at 309. Moreover, disbarment has been imposed for similar misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Basbanes\u2019 Case, </em>141 N.H. 1, 8 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Based upon the above, we find that disbarment is the appropriate sanction, and order the respondent to reimburse the attorney discipline system for all expenses incurred in the investigation and enforcement of discipline in this case.
