We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">The following facts appear in the trial court\u2019s order on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment. M&amp;M owns and operates a Domino\u2019s Pizza franchise located in a strip mall at 61 Crystal Avenue in Derry. Centercorp Retail Properties, Inc. owns the property and is M&amp;M\u2019s commercial landlord. In November 2002, Nathaniel Box, an M&amp;M employee, slipped and fell behind the premises. During the evening dinner rush, M&amp;M required its delivery employees to park behind the mall and enter through the rear door of the pizzeria. In compliance with this policy, after returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>from a pizza delivery, Box parked near the rear door to the pizzeria. While walking around the front of his vehicle, he slipped and fell on ice and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Box sued Centercorp and other parties, but did not sue M&amp;M. Following mediation, Centercorp settled with Box. One Beacon, Centercorp\u2019s insurer and subrogee, paid Box $185,000 to release his claims against Centercorp. Although One Beacon invited M&amp;M to attend the mediation, M&amp;M declined to do so. Subsequently, One Beacon brought suit against M&amp;M, seeking indemnification for payments it made to Box on behalf of Centercorp. M&amp;M moved for summary judgment, and One Beacon filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted judgment in favor of One Beacon. The trial court denied M&amp;M\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">When reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>S. N.H. Med. Ctr. v. Hayes, </em>159 N.H. 711, 715 (2010). If this review does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, <em>i.e., </em>facts that would affect the outcome of the litigation, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">M&amp;M raises two arguments on appeal: (1) that its lease with Centercorp did not require it to indemnify One Beacon for Box\u2019s injuries; and (2) that, although M&amp;M did not attend the mediation between Centercorp and Box, M&amp;M did not waive its right to challenge the subsequent settlement. We address each of M&amp;M\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">First, M&amp;M argues that section seventeen of the lease does not require it to indemnify One Beacon for Box\u2019s injuries because they occurred outside the pizzeria, and neither Box\u2019s, nor M&amp;M\u2019s, action involved the use or operation of the premises at the time of his injury. One Beacon counters that indemnification is required under section seventeen because: (1) Box\u2019s delivery work was an integral part of M&amp;M\u2019s pizza operations; (2) Box was employed by M&amp;M; (3) Box was acting within the scope of his employment when he was injured; and (4) Box parked behind the rear entrance pursuant to M&amp;M policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The interpretation of the language of a lease, like any contract language, is ultimately an issue for the court to decide. <em>Cf. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. Laighton Homes, </em>153 N.H. 485, 487 (2006); <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. AMSCO, </em>153 N.H. 28, 34 (2005) (\u2018When there is an express contract for indemnity, the rights of the surety are not to be determined by general indemnity principles, but by the letter of the contract for indemnification.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Because the interpretation of a contract is a question of law, we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation <em>de novo. In the Matter of Taber-McCarthy &amp; McCarthy, </em>160 N.H. 112, 115 (2010). When interpreting a written agreement, we give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, considering the circumstances and the context in which the agreement was negotiated, and reading the document as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"> Absent ambiguity, we determine the parties\u2019 intent from the plain meaning of the language used in the contract. <em>Id. </em>The words and phrases used by the parties will be assigned their common meaning, and we will ascertain the intended purpose of the contract based upon the meaning that would be given to it by a reasonable person. <em>Found, for Seacoast Health v. HCA Health Servs. of N.H., </em>157 N.H. 487, 492 (2008). We construe express indemnity agreements narrowly, <em>Dunn v. CLD Paving, </em>140 N.H. 120, 122 (1995), particularly when they purport to shift responsibility for an entity\u2019s negligence to another. <em>Merrimack School Dist. v. Nat'l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. 9, 12 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Section seventeen of the lease provides that M&amp;M must \u201cindemnify and save [Centercorp] harmless from and against any and all liability and damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, and from and against any and all suits, claims and demands of any kind or nature ... growing out of the condition, maintenance, repair, alteration, use, occupation or operation of the leased premises.\u201d We have interpreted the phrase \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 as synonymous with \u201carising out of.\u201d <em>Pro Con Constr. v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>147 N.H. 470, 472 (2002); <em>see also Philbrick v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 389, 391 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In <em>Pro Con, </em>we examined a commercial general liability policy, which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">WHO IS AN INSURED is amended to include as an insured any person or organization for whom you are performing operations if you and such person or organization have agreed in a contract or agreement that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on your policy. Such person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-9\"><em>Pro Con, </em>147 N.H. at 471. In <em>Pro Con, </em>we reasoned that, \u201cto warrant coverage arising out of [the] ongoing operations performed for Pro Con, the ongoing operations need not have been the proximate cause of the injuries but the causal connection between the two must be more than tenuous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472; <em>see also Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group., </em>136 N.H. 433, 439 (1992). In other words, \u201csome causal nexus must link [the] ongoing operations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the injuries.\u201d <em>Pro Con, </em>147 N.H. at 472. \u201cWhile the causal connection need not be \u2018proximate\u2019 as that term is used in the more demanding evidentiaryarea of tort law, the causal connection must still exist.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Applying this standard, the trial court here concluded that \u201cBox\u2019s delivery mission and the location where he parked his car . . . were\u201d governed by the indemnification provision because they were \u201ccircumstances \u2018growing out of the . . . use, occupation or operation of the leased premises.\u2019 \u201d We agree. According to the lease, M&amp;M used the premises as \u201ca bakery, store, and carry-out for pizza and related foods and beverages and those items customarily sold ... in a Domino\u2019s Pizza store and for all other operations necessary or incidental to the conduct of its business.\u201d Given that the pizzeria offered delivery services to its customers, \u201c[t]he delivery of pizza and related products\u201d was \u201can operation \u2018necessary or incidental to the conduct\u2019 \u201d of the pizzeria. When Box was injured, he had parked his vehicle behind the mall pursuant to M&amp;M policy, and was going back into the pizzeria to continue delivering pizzas. Accordingly, we agree that the nexus between the pizzeria\u2019s operations and Box\u2019s injuries trigger the broad indemnification provision of the lease agreement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">M&amp;M, pointing to other lease provisions, contends that they \u201ceffectively set out a comprehensive liability scheme where M&amp;M is responsible for anything imaginable occurring within the leased premises while Centercorp retains responsibility for liability outside the leased premises.\u201d Specifically, M&amp;M relies upon the preamble to the lease, which defines the leased premises as \u201ca portion of the premises located at 61 Crystal Ave., Derry, NH 03038, the leased premises consisting of 1,088 Sq. Ft. +/-.\u201d M&amp;M also highlights other lease provisions, which require Centercorp to provide snow and ice removal and general maintenance in certain common areas, and the insurance provision of the lease, which only requires M&amp;M to obtain liability insurance \u201c \u2018on the leased premises.\u2019 \u201d One Beacon counters that these other provisions in the lease do not modify the plain language of section seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The trial court rejected M&amp;M\u2019s argument that \u201cother provisions of the [ljease foreclose [its] indemnification liability.\u201d As noted by the trial court, even though the lease required M&amp;M to retain \u201c[c]omprehensive liability insurance on the leased premises and the Facilities thereon,\u201d the broad and unambiguous language of the indemnity clause still required M&amp;M to indemnify Centercorp for \u201cliability and damages, costs and expenses . . . growing out of the condition, maintenance, repair, alteration, use, occupation or operation of the premises.\u201d We decline to dismiss the broad language of \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 as \u201cmere surplusage.\u201d <em>See Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Brown Co., </em>120 N.H. 620, 623 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Similarly, even though other lease provisions require Centercorp to maintain certain common areas, these independent obligations do not eliminate M&amp;M\u2019s obligation to indemnify Centercorp. <em>See Tanguay v. Marston, </em>127 N.H. 572, 578 (1986). We have noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">a lessor and lessee in a lease of commercial real estate may agree on which party will maintain the leased premises and which party will be hable for injuries caused by improper failure to maintain. Both parties to the commercial lease must be free to make their own bargain. We recognize that a lease of commercial real estate is in many ways much like any other commercial contract, where we allow the parties to assign risks and obligations between themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We next consider M&amp;M\u2019s argument that One Beacon never offered M&amp;M the opportunity to approve the settlement or defend the case, contrary to <em>Morrissette v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>114 N.H. 384, 388 (1974). M&amp;M asks us to remand this case to the trial court and to require One Beacon to prove Centercorp\u2019s actual liability to Box. One Beacon, however, maintains that the principles of <em>Morrissette </em>do not apply to express contractual indemnification agreements such as the lease, and, alternatively, that, pursuant to <em>Morrissette, </em>its letter requesting M&amp;M\u2019s presence at the mediation provided M&amp;M with notice and an opportunity to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u201cA right to indemnity arises where one is legally required to pay an obligation for which another is primarily liable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387 (quotation and brackets omitted). In New Hampshire, \u201can indemnitee\u2019s unilateral acts of settlement, albeit reasonable and undertaken in good faith, cannot bind the indemnitor; notice and an opportunity to defend are the indispensable due process satisfying elements.\u201d <em>Coco v. Jaskunas, </em>159 N.H. 515, 520 (2009) (quotation and brackets omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hile a prejudgment payment in settlement does not extinguish a right of indemnity, the [third-party plaintiff] must show that the settlement was made under legal compulsion, rather than as a mere volunteer, for indemnity is not available for payment voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">If the indemnitor approves the settlement or defends unsuccessfully against the original claim, he cannot later question the indemnitee\u2019s liability to the original claimant. If the indemnitor declines to take either course, then the indemnitee will only be required to show <em>potential liability </em>to the original plaintiff in order to support his claim over against the indemnitor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the event that no offer is made to the indemnitor to either approve or defend, then the indemnitee should have the burden of showing actual liability to the original plaintiff.\u201d <em>Morrissette, </em>114 N.H. at 389 (citations omitted). Thus, absent notice and the opportunity to defend, One Beacon must demonstrate Centercorp\u2019s actual liability to Box; however, if M&amp;M received notice and an opportunity to defend, then One Beacon need only show Centercorp\u2019s potential liability to Box. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Counsel for Centercorp sent a letter, dated July 19, 2007, to M&amp;M, indicating that Box\u2019s lawsuit against Centercorp was scheduled for mediation on August 8. In the letter, Centercorp asked M&amp;M to \u201cattend with authority to contribute money toward the settlement of this case.\u201d Centercorp asserted that, under the lease, M&amp;M \u201cis contractually required to indemnify Centercorp for its legal costs and damages incurred in defending this case.\u201d Centercorp also notified M&amp;M that it \u201cintend[ed] to bring a third party action against [M&amp;M] to seek recovery of any amounts it is required to pay .. . Box.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In its order on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Despite being notified of the conference at which Centercorp and its subrogee, One Beacon, settled the responsibilities as among the parties to the underlying personal injury suit, M&amp;M declined to appear at or participate in that conference. M&amp;M thus passed up its opportunity to dispute the amount offered to Box, and must therefore indemnify Centercorp and its subrogee One Beacon for the full amount paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">We agree with the trial court that, based upon the facts before us, One Beacon\u2019s letter to M&amp;M gave M&amp;M sufficient notice and an opportunity to defend the suit against Box. However, the trial court erred when it ruled that M&amp;M was therefore required to indemnify One Beacon \u201cfor the full amount paid,\u201d because the trial court failed to require One Beacon to demonstrate Centercorp\u2019s potential liability to Box. <em>See id. </em>On remand, the trial court should apply the standard set forth in <em>Momssette </em>and determine whether One Beacon has demonstrated Centercorp\u2019s potential liability to Box. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">One Beacon argues that the principles outlined in <em>Momssette </em>do not apply to express indemnification agreements, such as the lease at issue here. Specifically, One Beacon argues that <em>\u201cMomssette </em>involved a common law or implied indemnification,\u201d and that \u201cthe notice standards it enunciates have never been applied in a contractual indemnification scenario like the one in this case.\u201d However, we did not limit our decision in <em>Momssette </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>implied indemnification, and we see no reason why we should do so here. Indeed, we have applied the standards set forth in <em>Morrissette </em>in the context of an express statutory requirement for the defendant to defend the plaintiffs\u2019 deed \u201cagainst the lawful claims and demands of all persons\u201d pursuant to RSA 477:27. <em>Coco, </em>159 N.H. at 519 (emphasis omitted). We also note that, in attempting to distinguish express and implied indemnification with respect to the applicability of the <em>Morrissette </em>standard, One Beacon cites no authority in which another court has made such a distinction, and we have found none. <em>See Casey v. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>2005 WL 1150228, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. May 16, 2005) (noting that requiring notice and an opportunity to defend \u201cappear[s] to apply regardless of whether . . . indemnification arises in the context of a contractual provision or in the context of a claim based on common law equitable principles\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">Given this result, we need not address the parties\u2019 remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b697-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
