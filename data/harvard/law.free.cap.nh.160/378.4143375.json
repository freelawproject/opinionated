We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The record evidences the following facts. Clare, as trustee of the Horizon Realty Trust, is one of the developers of the Thurston\u2019s Landing subdivision in Hudson. On August 9, 2000, the Town of Hudson Planning Board (planning board) approved the Thurston\u2019s Landing West subdivision, but required a performance bond of $81,705 for improvements to Bush Hill Road at its intersection with Flying Rock Road. On September 8, 2000, Horizon Realty Trust paid the Town $81,705, which was used to create and fund a separate Town account (the Bush Hill Road account). On February 7, 2005, the Town paid ABB-Kin &amp; Sons, Inc. $1,500 from the Bush Hill Road account to conduct drill tests on Bush Hill Road to determine the subsurface materials needed for the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On March 4, 2005, Town Engineer Tom Sommers proposed certain improvements to address \u201ca less than adequate sight distance most specifically in the northerly direction looking from Flying Rock Road without increasing the vehicle speed on Bush Hill Road.\u201d Sommers noted that funding was available from the Bush Hill Road account, \u201cwhich was paid by the Thurstons [sic] Landing developer and specifically marked for this improvement,\u201d and which had grown to $86,910 due to accrued interest. The board of selectmen unanimously approved the proposed improvements at a meeting on March 22, 2005. The improvements included smoothing down a \u201cknob in the right of way area\u201d and slightly raising Bush Hill Road at its lowest section. The board of selectmen noted, in connection with the proposal to raise the section of Bush Hill Road, that \u201c[t]he Highway Department is going to be grinding and repaving that area, so they can elevate that by approximately <em>Vz-1 </em>foot.\u201d As to the financing for these improvements, the selectmen noted: \u201cFunding is available from the developer of Thurston\u2019s West, a requirement of the planning process. Any remaining funds will be used for some paving and resurfacing in that general area.\u201d The timing of the Bush Hill Road improvements was subject to the relocation of a utility pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">At some point in 2006, Clare inquired about the status of his performance bond. The Town responded, by letter dated November 15, 2006, that the bond was \u201cbeing used to complete improvements to the subject intersection.\u201d The letter explained that the project, originally scheduled for 2005 but postponed to 2006, would be completed in the spring of 2007 due to third-party delays in the utility work.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">An email sent by Road Agent Kevin Burns on July 17, 2007, requested that the Town\u2019s Engineering Division execute a purchase order \u201cfor the Bush Hill Road improvements,\u201d which \u201cwork was done under the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Town Wide Paving Project.\u201d The purchase order to Brox Industries, also dated July 17, 2007, showed a deduction of $89,153.95 from the Bush Hill Road account, with the description:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">THURSTONS [sic] LANDING WEST BOND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">BUSH HILL ROAD IMPROVEMENTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">BUSH HILL ROAD PAVEMENT COMPLE [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">This payment was supported by two field reports from Brox Industries, one reporting, \u201cReclaimed and grade[d] 33,141 Square Yards of pavement &amp; fine graded\u201d on Bush Hill Road as part of the town-wide paving project between July 5 and July 12,2007, and the second reporting, \u201cPLACED <em>%\" </em>Binder\u201d at the same location on July 12,13, and 16, 2007. Brox Industries\u2019 paperwork indicated that the cost for the Bush Hill Road paving work consisted of $55,014.06 for reclaiming and grading, and $196,672.49 for placement of binder. Of the $251,686.55 paid by the Town for the work, $89,153.95 came from the Bush Hill Road account. The check exhausting the Bush Hill Road account was dated August 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">In a letter dated August 6, 2007, Clare\u2019s attorney inquired about the status of the performance bond posted \u201cfor improvements to the Flying Rock Road/ Bush Hill Road intersection.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cMore than 6 years have now passed since my client posted this bond. The Town has recently repaved Bush Hill Road. It does not appear that any of my client\u2019s funds were used for improvements to the intersection for which they were allocated.\u201d Clare requested that the planning board review the matter at its next meeting and return to him any bond funds and accrued interest. On August 23,2007, Clare\u2019s counsel again wrote to the Town Planner requesting that the matter be scheduled for planning board review.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The Town responded by letter dated August 24,2007, reporting that the funds had been encumbered in February 2005, and were spent in part for the 2005 ABB-Kin drill tests, with the remainder spent in July 2007, when \u201cthe Town of Hudson contracted with Brox Industries in the amount [of] $89,153.95 to construct road improvements to Bush Hill Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">By letter dated August 27,2007, Clare\u2019s counsel expressed his disagreement with the Town\u2019s position, writing, \u2018Your letter [of August 24, 2007] indicates that the bond funds were spent on general road maintenance, including the recent paving done by Brox Industries in July, 2007. Unfortunately, you did not provide me with any accounting of the Town\u2019s expenditure of my client\u2019s money.\u201d Clare appealed the Town\u2019s August 24, 2007 response to the Hudson Community Development Department and to the zoning board of adjustment. Both the department and the zoning board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>declined to review the appeal. <em>See </em>RSA 676:5, III (2008) (decisions regarding innovative land use controls may not be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment); RSA 674:21,1(m) (Supp. 2009) (\u201cinnovative land use controls\u201d include impact fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On October 1, 2007, Clare formally applied to the planning board for release of his performance bond. In a memorandum in support of his application, he asserted that \u201c[t]he Town did not perform the proposed improvements to the Bush Hill Road/Flying Rock Road intersection,\u201d and that his \u201cbond was not used for its intended purpose within 6 years from the date that it was posted, as required by RSA 674:21(IV)(e).\u201d On October 10, 2007, the planning board voted to deny his application, finding that the bond was properly encumbered and properly spent in accordance with the relevant provisions of the zoning ordinance. The superior court upheld the planning board\u2019s decision in an order dated February 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">On appeal, Clare contends that the superior court erred in declining to order the return of his bond fund, arguing that the Town violated RSA 674:21, V(c) and (e) by expending the bond fund for a purpose other than the capital improvement for which it was collected. Specifically, he asserts that the bond fund was spent to underwrite the Town\u2019s annual road maintenance work, rather than the sight distance improvement project at the Bush Hill Road/Flying Rock Road intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s decision is deferential. We will uphold its decision on appeal unless it is unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous.\u201d <em>Ferson-Lake, LLC v. City of Nashua, </em>159 N.H. 524, 526 (2009) (citations omitted); <em>see also Summa Humma Enters. v. Town of Tilton, </em>151 N.H. 75, 79 (2004). \u201cSuperior court review of planning board decisions is equally limited. The superior court is obligated to treat the factual findings of the planning board as <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable and cannot set aside its decision absent unreasonableness or an identified error of law.\u201d <em>Ferson-Lake, </em>159 N.H. at 526 (citation omitted). \u201cThe review by the superior court is not to determine whether it agrees with the planning board\u2019s findings, but to determine whether there is evidence upon which they could have been reasonably based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he appealing party must demonstrate that an error of law was committed or must persuade the trial court by the balance of probabilities that the board\u2019s decision was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Feins v. Town of Wilmot, </em>154 N.H. 715, 717 (2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We note first that Clare concedes in his brief that his \u201cbond fund was encumbered for the purpose for which it had been collected within six years from the date it was paid, as required by RSA 674:21, V(e).\u201d He has therefore waived his argument as to the timeliness of the Town\u2019s action to encumber his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>We therefore address Clare\u2019s arguments regarding impact fee accounting requirements. RSA 674:21, V provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">As used in this section \u201cimpact fee\u201d means a fee or assessment imposed upon development, including subdivision, building construction or other land use change, in order to help meet the needs occasioned by that development for the construction or improvement of capital facilities owned or operated by the municipality, including . . . public road systems and rights-of-way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">RSA 674:21, V(c), the provision upon which Clare principally relies, further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">Any impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the municipality\u2019s general fund, may be spent upon order of the municipal governing body,... and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected, or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs which the fee was collected to meet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The limitations on impact fees are set forth in RSA 674:21, V(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">The amount of any [impact] fee shall be a proportional share of municipal capital improvement costs which is reasonably related to the capital needs created by the development, and to the benefits accruing to the development from the capital improvements financed by the fee. Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by impact fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Clare asserts that his bond fund was not used for the \u201ccapital improvements for which it was collected,\u201d but rather for the \u201c[upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures\u201d; that is, upgrading the surface of Bush Hill Road. Thus, he argues, he is entitled to return of his bond fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">The trial court concluded otherwise, finding that the certified record supported the planning board\u2019s finding that the bond fund was used to improve Bush Hill Road, specifically by reclaiming and paving it, and, therefore, \u201cthe planning board reasonably concluded that [Clare\u2019s] performance bond had been used solely for the capital improvement for which it had been collected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Clare contests the trial court\u2019s findings in two principal respects. First, he questions the timing of the Town\u2019s payment of the impact fee fund to Brox Industries, which occurred two days after he reiterated his request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>for return of his fund and approximately seven years after he had deposited the fund with the Town. We cannot say that the trial court acted unreasonably in upholding the payment, however, where the paving work took place in July 2007 and the payment occurred August 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Second, Clare disputes the trial court\u2019s finding that the bond fund was used for its specified purpose. He asserts that the fund was used for town-wide road improvements. The Town argued before the trial court that Clare ultimately received the sight distance improvement for which his impact fee had been collected, despite the Town\u2019s \u201cadmittedly not correctly accounting for it,\u201d and that it would be nonsensical to require the Town to refund Clare\u2019s bond fund after the subject work had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The certified record contains a memorandum dated October 3,2007, from Kevin Burns, the Town\u2019s Road Agent, to the Town\u2019s counsel, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">This price [including the $89,153.95 from the bond fund] so far is only the money paid to Brox. It does not cover [the Town\u2019s] in house labor, equipment and material cost for the road realignment and site [sic] distance improvements. Nor does it include the cost of finish pavement that will [be] completed in July 2008 at an estimated cost of an additional $100,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The unknown costs cited in this memorandum were subsequently calculated and submitted to the trial court outside of the certified record, in a \u201cdetailed breakdown of the Highway Department\u2019s cost related to the Bush Hill Road and the Flying Rock Road intersection improvement project.\u201d The trial court initially denied the parties\u2019 joint motion to expand the certified record to include this document, but subsequently acknowledged its submission as an appendix to the Town\u2019s request for findings of fact and rulings of law. Although neither party appeals the trial court\u2019s initial denial of the parties\u2019 joint request to expand the record, both parties have included the document in the appendices to their briefs on appeal. In view of the fact that the document was before the trial court for its consideration, and both parties deem it relevant to our analysis, we consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The document, a letter from Burns to Town counsel detailing the Town\u2019s costs related to the subject improvements, is marked \u201cREVISED\u201d and dated May 1,2008. It reports total expenditures in excess of $116,582.59. Of this, the Town\u2019s cost for work at the intersection itself was $62,585.54. This amount includes: labor costs; equipment costs; paving materials, such as gravel; the cost of painting traffic lines in the intersection; a $1,500 payment to ABB-Kin and Sons for test drilling (presumably the amount paid out of the Bush Hill Road account in 2005); and a payment to Brox Industries of $21,440 to reclaim, fine grade, compact and pave a section limited to 650 feet of Bush Hill Road and twenty-five feet of Flying Rock Road. The letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>further indicates that $53,997.05 was paid to Brox Industries for reclaiming and repaving an additional 1,700 feet of Bush Hill Road, which the Town considered to be \u201cincluded with the intent of this project,\u201d a cost exclusive of the Town\u2019s labor and equipment costs expended in the road repaving. Thus, the Town\u2019s own documentation, produced after the filing of Clare\u2019s lawsuit and after the Town\u2019s exhaustion of the bond fund, indicates that the Town paid Brox Industries only a total of $75,437.05 for work at the subject intersection and along the relevant portion of Bush Hill Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The Town maintained accurate records of the petitioner\u2019s account, including deposits of interest, up until August 2007. At that time, the entire amount remaining in the account, $89,153.95, was transferred to Brox Industries. The Town\u2019s own records, however, reflect that only $75,437.05 was actually attributable to Brox Industries\u2019 work on the relevant portion of Bush Hill Road and its intersection with Flying Rock Road. The difference between the sum the Town paid out of the bond fund and the amount Brox earned for the relevant work amounts to $13,716.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Before the trial court, the Town argued that, since Clare had received the benefit for which the bond fund was required, the Town\u2019s improper accounting should not result in a windfall for him. The Town explained that it expended far more than $13,716.90 to complete the necessary improvements, to Clare\u2019s benefit. On appeal, the Town argues that \u201c[i]t was not the trial [cjourt\u2019s job to review the Planning Board\u2019s Certified Records with an eye towards making a de novo conclusion on whether the collected impact exaction funds had been used for the specific project for which they had been paid to the Town,\u201d but rather to evaluate whether there was evidence to support the planning board\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Town cites the correct legal standard for the trial court\u2019s review of a planning board\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>RSA 677:15. Here, however, the issue presented requires us to assess whether the record supports the conclusion that the Town complied with the statutory accounting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u201cThe interpretation and application of statutes present questions of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Upton v. Town of Hopkinton, </em>157 N.H. 115, 118 (2008). \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. When examining the language of a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118-19 (citation omitted). \u201cWhile we first look to the plain meaning of words to interpret statutes, it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish.\u201d <em>Simonsen v. Town of Derry, </em>145 N.H. 382, 386 (2000) (quotations omitted). \u201cUnless we find statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>language to be ambiguous, we will not examine legislative history. In construing a statute, we will neither consider what the legislature might have said nor add words that it did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Monahan-Fortin Properties v. Town of Hudson, </em>148 N.H. 769, 771 (2002) (citation omitted). These same rules of construction apply to zoning ordinances. <em>Upton, </em>157 N.H. at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u201cWhile [RSA 674:21] authorizes municipalities to impose impact fees, it comprehensively regulates the municipality\u2019s implementation of such fees.\u201d <em>Simonsen, </em>145 N.H. at 386. \u201cFor example, the statute regulates the amount and uses of such fees, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(a), specifies procedures for assessing and collecting such fees, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(d), and provides for both an appeal process, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(f), and a waiver process, <em>see </em>RSA 674:21, V(g).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. RSA 674:21, V(c) requires that \u201c[a]ny impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the municipality\u2019s general fund ... and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected.\u201d By imposing this requirement, as well as the requirement in RSA 674:21, V(a) that the impact fee not be used for construction or improvements not occasioned by the development, the legislature has established that towns are not entitled to collect and expend impact fees for purposes other than those for which they were collected. <em>Cf. Upton, </em>157 N.H. at 120 (discussing relationship between municipal improvements and the proportional cost to be borne by the developer\u2019s impact fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"> Moreover, the legislature has mandated specific bookkeeping procedures for impact fees: \u201cAny impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the municipality\u2019s general fund, may be spent upon order of the municipal governing body, [and] shall be exempt from all provisions of RSA 32 relative to limitation and expenditure of town moneys.\u201d RSA 674:21, V(c). This provision makes clear that the impact fee funds and Town funds are not fungible. In view of these explicit statutory requirements, we conclude that the Town was not authorized to pay the full $89,153.95 from the Bush Hill Road account to Brox Industries, when only $75,437.05 was actually attributable to the work for which the impact fee was collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The Town\u2019s handling of the bond fund, however, does not require repayment of the entire fund to Clare. The record reflects that $75,437.05 was, in fact, attributable to Brox Industries\u2019 work on the relevant portions of Bush Hill Road and Flying Rock Road. We note that Clare\u2019s assertion that no sight distance improvements occurred was rebutted by the factual findings of the planning board, which were affirmed by the trial court. Further, we agree with the trial court and the planning board that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>reclamation and paving work is properly included within \u201ccapital improvements for which [the bond fund] was collected.\u201d The board of selectmen determined in 2005, when they adopted the proposed sight distance improvement plans, that paving would be among the improvements funded by the use of the bond fund. Moreover, the approved plans themselves described significant paving-related modifications, including regrading to lower a knob in the right of way and to elevate the lowest portion of Bush Hill Road. We accordingly affirm the decision of the trial court upholding the planning board to the extent that Clare is not entitled to the return of $75,437.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">As to the remaining $13,716.90 of the bond fund that the Town paid to Brox Industries, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision. Given the lack of adequate accounting, required by statute, there was no reasonable basis upon which the planning board could have found that this portion of the bond fund was spent for the purpose for which it was collected. Accordingly, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See Ferson-Lake, LLC, </em>159 N.H. at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
