Schwartz, appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) that he pay restitution in the amount of $36,389.36 and denying his motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The record supports the following facts. On the evening of February 9, 2008, the defendant went with his friend Michael Stewart to a club in Laconia called the Funky Monkey. Stewart was drinking heavily and using methadone. Sometime during the evening, the defendant became angry when Stewart said something about him in the presence of one or more police officers. The defendant accused Stewart of \u201cdiming him out\u201d by revealing information that could get him into trouble. The defendant left the club without Stewart, but Stewart called him on his cell phone and asked if he could have a ride home. Stewart believed that he left the club near closing time, in the early morning hours of February 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">A short time later, Joseph Hurd, a friend of the defendant, went to a Cumberland Farms store in Meredith with his girlfriend, Crystal Johnson. Hurd testified that he saw the defendant in the store and the defendant offered him and his girlfriend a ride to her house. Hurd testified that when he got into the defendant\u2019s pickup, he saw Stewart sitting in the front seat. He looked \u201cpretty beat up,\u201d and Hurd asked him what had happened, but Stewart did not answer. The defendant then replied that he and Stewart got into a fight \u201cbecause [Stewart] ratted [me] out about something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">As the defendant began driving, he and Stewart argued. The defendant asked Stewart, \u201c[D]o you want me to kick your ass again?\u201d When the defendant made a wrong turn, Hurd asked to be let out. The defendant stopped and let Hurd and his girlfriend out. As Hurd was walking away, he heard the truck\u2019s doors open and when he looked back he saw the defendant standing by the passenger side of the vehicle. Hurd saw Stewart on the ground and heard him yelling \u201cas if he wanted me to go back.\u201d Nonetheless, Hurd kept walking because he \u201cjust wanted to avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>whole scene.\u201d Hurd testified that he did not see the defendant punch Stewart but, he said, \u201cit happened ... I know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Sometime later, Stewart was picked up by one of Hurd\u2019s relatives who took him to the Meredith police station. Officer Wood testified that the left side of Stewart\u2019s face was swollen and that he had blood all over his face and shirt. Stewart told the officer that after he left the Funky Monkey he was beaten in an alley by two men in a silver truck. He later told Wood the men were in a white car.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Stewart was taken to the emergency room at Lakes Region General Hospital. He told the physician who treated him that he had been assaulted outside the Laconia Clinic by strangers who kicked him in the face and abdomen. A police officer at the hospital, Officer Marquis, noted that Stewart was missing teeth, had lacerations and what appeared to be \u201cboot marks\u201d on his face. Stewart had suffered a displaced fracture of his jaw and facial lacerations that required stitches. He subsequently underwent two operations to repair the damage to his jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">While at the hospital, Stewart told Officer Marquis that he had been beaten by two males who alighted from a silver Saab. A few days later, Stewart told Marquis that he had been attacked at the Cumberland Farms store in Meredith. A surveillance video from the store in the early morning hours of February 10 showed the defendant, Hurd and his girlfriend, and the defendant\u2019s truck in the store\u2019s parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">During an interview with the police on March 5, the defendant admitted that he had been angry with Stewart the night they were together at the Funky Monkey. When asked about the assault, he said that Stewart struck him and that he was merely defending himself. He denied punching Stewart and stated that he could not have struck Stewart as described because he did not have any cuts on his hands. The police disclosed that the surveillance video from Cumberland Farms showed the defendant was wearing gloves, which would explain the absence of cuts. When the police told the defendant there was a witness who saw the assault, he said, \u201c[the] witness must be lying.\u201d Stewart testified at trial that he remembered the defendant opening the passenger door of the truck and throwing him in the snowbank, and that he was covered in blood and \u201cpretty much [left] for dead.\u201d He claimed, however, that he could not remember who hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The defendant was charged with one count of second degree assault, alleging that he caused bodily injury to Stewart by striking or stomping him repeatedly \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,\u201d and one count of simple assault, alleging that the defendant caused unprivileged physical contact to Stewart by hitting him. Following a trial, a jury acquitted the defendant of second degree assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>but convicted him of simple assault. As part of his sentence he was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $36,389.36. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him to pay restitution for breaking Stewart\u2019s jaw when the simple assault charge of which he was convicted did not allege that he caused bodily injury or that he hit Stewart in the face. Specifically, he contends that the State failed to prove the requisite causal connection between the simple assault of which he was convicted and the damages for which it sought restitution. The defendant further argues that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss the simple assault charge based upon insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201cDetermining the appropriate restitution amount is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Eno, </em>143 N.H. 465, 470 (1999); <em>see </em>RSA 651:63,1 (2007) (\u201cAny offender may be sentenced to make restitution in an amount determined by the court.\u201d). \u201cIf the factual basis for restitution is disputed, however, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the loss or damage is causally connected to the offense and bears a significant relationship to the offense.\u201d <em>Eno, </em>143 N.H. at 470 (quotation omitted). In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we accept its factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Shannon, </em>155 N.H. 135, 137 (2007). Our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions is <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Courts are to presume that a defendant responsible for a victim\u2019s loss will pay restitution. <em>See id. </em>at 138-39. As set forth in RSA chapter 651 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2009), \u201c[Restitution by the offender can serve to reinforce the offender\u2019s sense of responsibility for the offense, to provide the offender the opportunity to pay his debt to society and to the victim in a constructive manner, and to ease the burden of the victim as a result of the criminal act.\u201d RSA 651:61-a, I. \u201cRestitution\u201d is defined as \u201cmoney . . . provided by the offender to compensate a victim for economic loss.\u201d RSA 651:62, V. \u201cOffender\u201d is defined as \u201cany person convicted of a criminal. .. act.\u201d RSA 651:62, IV. \u201cVictim\u201d is defined as \u201ca person . . . who suffers economic loss as a result of an offender\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d RSA 651:62, VI. \u201cEconomic loss\u201d is defined as \u201cout-of-pocket losses or other expenses incurred as a direct result of a criminal offense, including: (a) Reasonable charges incurred for reasonably needed products, services and accommodations, including but not limited to charges for medical and dental care.\u201d RSA 651:62, 111(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The defendant argues that \u201cbecause the ability to award restitution is strictly circumscribed by the factual allegations in the charging docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ment on which the defendant was convicted,\u201d the trial court erred in ordering him to pay restitution. This argument, however, misconstrues the statutory requirements for awarding restitution. Restitution is not an element of the offense. Rather, it is \u201cmoney... provided by the offender to compensate a victim for economic loss.\u201d RSA 651:62, V. Here, the defendant was convicted of causing unprivileged physical contact to Stewart by hitting him. Stewart suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct whereby he incurred medical bills for treatment of his broken jaw. The record supports a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the physical injuries suffered by Stewart were causally connected to the fact that the defendant hit him. <em>See State v. Armstrong, </em>151 N.H. 686, 687 (2005) (defendant may be held liable for economic losses directly resulting from factual allegations that support the conduct covered by the conviction). Further, and on the record before us, there is no credible evidence that Stewart incurred his injuries in any other manner than being hit by the defendant. We hold that the trial court did not err in sentencing the defendant to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the simple assault charge based upon insufficient evidence. \u201cTo prevail . . . , the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>150 N.H. 416, 424 (2003). \u2018When the evidence is solely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder this standard, however, we still consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and examine each evidentiary item in context, not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe proper analysis is not whether every possible conclusion has been excluded but, rather, whether other <em>rational </em>conclusions based on the evidence have been excluded.\u201d <em>State v. Tayag, </em>159 N.H. 21, 24 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant argues that because no one testified that he hit Stewart, he may have been assaulted by someone else or may have sustained injuries in a drunken fall. We do not agree that those are other rational conclusions supported by the evidence in the record. As the trial court reasoned in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, despite the lack of direct evidence of physical contact between the defendant and Stewart, \u201clooking at the record as a whole, including the injuries, the statements made by [the defendant] that were heard and recounted by Mr. Hurd... and the totality of the record, there is circumstantial evidence that if accepted by the jury, if credibility issues are resolved in favor of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>and if the evidence is taken in [a] light. . . favorable to the State\u201d would allow a jury to find that the State proved all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, we hold that the only rational conclusion is that the defendant caused unprivileged physical contact to Stewart by hitting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-6\">Dalianis, Duggan, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
