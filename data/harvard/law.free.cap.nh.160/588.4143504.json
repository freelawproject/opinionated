The Division argues that: (1) the PELRB lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter; and (2) the PELRB erred by inserting terms in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement that the parties did not intend. Because we hold that the PELRB erred in its decision that the Division\u2019s actions were inconsistent with the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, we reverse without reaching the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The following facts appear in the administrative record. The Association, which is the exclusive representative for New Hampshire State Troopers below the rank of sergeant, and the Division were parties to a collective bargaining agreement, effective from July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2009. The agreement governs grievance procedures, overtime, and sick leave. It provides that troopers may use their sick leave for illness, injury, medical appointments and death in the immediate family. A trooper must request the use of sick leave and provide a reason for his or her absence. If the Division suspects that a trooper is using sick leave for absences not authorized by the collective bargaining agreement, the Division may require a \u201ccertificate\u201d from a physician or other health care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The agreement also includes provisions regarding \u201ccall back\u201d and \u201cstandby status\u201d of troopers. A \u201ccall back\u201d occurs when an off-duty trooper is \u201ccalled back\u201d to work after a shift has concluded or prior to the start of a shift without prior notice. In that situation, the trooper must be paid for working a minimum of four hours. When a trooper is on \u201cstandby status,\u201d however, the Division requires the trooper to be available for \u201cimmediate return to duty, under conditions which do not allow the employee reasonable use of the time waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">In December 2007, Trooper Brian Doyle received his annual performance review. In the category of attendance/punctuality, Doyle was rated as \u201cMeeting Expectations.\u201d However, his supervisor indicated in the comments that Doyle \u201cused 92.0 hours of Sick Leave over the course of 12 work days,\u201d and the \u201cmajority were one day leaves occurring at the beginning of the weekend or on the weekend.\u201d Doyle was also rated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cMeeting Expectations\u201d in the category of dependability, but his supervisor noted in the comments that he failed to respond to two call backs. His evaluation stated, \u201cAlthough . . . Doyle\u2019s stance on this subject can not be deemed as unacceptable, it should be weighted when making future decisions in promotions and reassignments. As time progresses one would hope that... Doyle\u2019s dedication would improve to a more acceptable level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In February 2008, Trooper Christopher St. Cyr received his annual performance evaluation. His supervisor concluded that his attendance and punctuality were \u201cBelow Expectations,\u201d and wrote that St. Cyr used \u201ca total of 116 hours,\u201d including 36 hours of sick-dependent time, which was characterized as \u201chigh.\u201d St. Cyr also received a \u201cmemo of counsel\u201d about his \u201cexcessive/unscheduled absences.\u201d In the memo, his supervisor noted that his sick leave in 2006 exceeded the norm and that his last unscheduled leave day \u201ctook place on a Sunday during a snow storm,\u201d which \u201chinder[ed] the operations of the Troop and the level of service ... to the motoring public.\u201d For all future sick leave, St. Cyr was required to speak with an on duty supervisor or troop commander to request time off and obtain a physician\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The Association filed two unfair labor practice charges with the PELRB on behalf of Doyle and St. Cyr, which were consolidated by agreement. The Association argued that the Division committed unfair labor practices when it criticized Doyle for being unavailable for immediate call back during his off-duty hours, and when it criticized Doyle and St. Cyr \u201cfor using sick time under circumstances consistent with the requirements of\u2019 the collective bargaining agreement. The Division denied the allegations and argued that the PELRB lacked jurisdiction because rules promulgated by the New Hampshire Division of Personnel, not the collective bargaining agreement, dictate the requirements for performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The PELRB determined that it had jurisdiction because the Association alleged the Division committed an unfair labor practice by breaching the collective bargaining agreement in violation of RSA 273-A:5, 1(h). It then concluded that the Division erroneously included negative comments in the troopers\u2019 personnel files because it had not previously invoked the physician\u2019s certificate requirement in the agreement. The PELRB found that \u201cDoyle was making a reasonable use of his time and acting in compliance with the provisions of [the collective bargaining agreement]... even though such use prevented him from responding to the call backs in these two instances.\u201d The PELRB ordered the Division to remove all negative references to the troopers\u2019 use of sick leave and Doyle\u2019s failure to respond to the two call backs from their personnel files and to cease and desist from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>administering the collective bargaining agreement in a manner inconsistent with its decision. The Division moved for a rehearing, which the PELRB denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We first address the Division\u2019s argument that the PELRB lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the Division argues that while the collective bargaining agreement establishes how and at what rate sick leave is accumulated, and when it may be used, it does not preclude the Division from commenting on sick leave usage in performance evaluations. The Division also argues that the PELRB lacked jurisdiction because the claims arose from performance evaluations, which are required by RSA 21-1:42, XIII (Supp. 2009). Finally, the Division contends that the PELRB lacked jurisdiction because performance evaluations are essential to the management and supervision of troopers. The Association counters that the PELRB had jurisdiction because the performance evaluations and memoranda of counseling involved the Division\u2019s administration of contract terms set forth in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">When reviewing a decision of the PELRB, we defer to its findings of facts, and, absent an erroneous ruling of law, we will not set aside its decision unless the appealing party demonstrates by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the decision is unjust or unreasonable. <em>Appeal of State Employees\u2019 Assoc. of </em>N.H., 158 N.H. 258, 260 (2009). The PELRB has primary jurisdiction of all unfair labor practices, including the breach of a collective bargaining agreement by a public employer. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:5, 1(h), :6,I. In deciding whether an unfair labor practice has been committed, the PELRB must first examine the terms of the collective bargaining agreement to determine whether it has been breached. <em>See Appeal of City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H. 289, 294 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Although the parties characterize the issue before us as one of subject matter jurisdiction, we believe that, instead, the dispute requires us to determine whether the PELRB correctly interpreted the collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the issue is whether the PELRB correctly interpreted Articles VII and XI of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We begin by examining the language of the collective bargaining agreement, as it reflects the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Appeal of Nashua Police Comm\u2019n, </em>149 N.H. 688, 690 (2003). \u201cThis intent is determined from the agreement taken as a whole, and by construing its terms according to the common meaning of their words and phrases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, including whether a provision or clause is ambiguous, is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Id. </em>Our review is <em>de novo. City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Article XI, Sick Leave, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">11.2 An employee may utilize[] his/her sick leave allowance for absences due to illness, injury, or exposure to contagious diseases endangering the health of other employees when requested by the attending physician, medical and dental appointments with prior approval, or death in the employee\u2019s immediate family and shall be deducted from his/her allowance on the basis of workdays and not calendar days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">11.3 To utilize his/her sick leave, the employee must file a written application with the [Division] specifying the basis for the request. Employees shall be notified as to the approval or denial of their leave requests within a reasonable time. If denied, upon request, the [Division] shall state the reason(s) for any denial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">11.4 An employee may be required by the [Division] to furnish the [Division] with a certificate from the attending physician or other licensed health care practitioner when, for reasonable cause, the [Division] believes that the employee\u2019s use of sick leave does not conform to the reasons and requirements for sick leave use set forth in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">Article VII, Overtime, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">7.3 Employees called back to work without prior notice on the same day after once leaving work or before the next regular starting time, shall be guaranteed a minimum of not less than four (4) hours compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">7.5 Standby:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">Any employee who is required by the [Division] to be available for immediate return to duty, under conditions which do not allow the employee reasonable use of the time waiting to be called back to duty for his or her own purposes, shall be deemed to be in standby status. Time in standby status shall be considered time worked for regular compensation and overtime compensation purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>By its plain language, the collective bargaining agreement permits employees to accrue sick leave and utilize it up to the maximum rate allowed. It also provides that troopers who are called back to work are entitled to additional compensation for their time. Nothing in the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement, however, precludes the Division from commenting on these topics during troopers\u2019 performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">Moreover, pursuant to Article II of the collective bargaining agreement, the Division \u201cretains all rights to manage, direct and control its operations,\u201d including \u201c[d]irecting and supervising employees\u201d; \u201c[a]ppointing, promoting, transferring, assigning, demoting, suspending, and discharging employees\u201d; and \u201c[maintaining the efficiency of governmental operations.\u201d These rights are \u201csubject to the provisions of law, personnel regulations and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d including RSA 21-1:42, XIII and the rules promulgated by the division of personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">RSA 21-1:42, XIII establishes a performance evaluation system for all classified employees, with the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">(a) All full-time classified employees shall be evaluated on a regular basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">(b) Evaluations shall be in writing and shall be conducted at least annually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">(c) Evaluations shall be conducted by an employee\u2019s immediate supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">(d) Evaluations shall be based upon specific written performance expectations or criteria developed for the position in question and employees shall be made aware of these performance expectations in advance of any evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">(e) The evaluation format shall include a narrative summary on the employee\u2019s performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">(f) Employees shall be permitted to participate in the evaluation process, shall be given a copy of their evaluation, and shall have an opportunity to comment, in writing, on their evaluation, and such comments will be included in the employee\u2019s permanent record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">(g) Employees shall have a right to nonconcur, in writing, with their evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>(h) Employees shall certify, in writing, that they have reviewed their evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">(i) Evaluation reports shall be reviewed by the supervisor of the official completing the evaluation who shall concur or nonconcur in writing with each evaluation report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The division of personnel rules require supervisors, when conducting performance evaluations, to indicate whether each employee meets or falls below expectations in attendance. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. RULES, Per 801.03(a)(1), 801.04(a)(1), and 801.05(a)(1). Because the Division\u2019s comments on the troopers\u2019 attendance and dependability are authorized under the plain language of Article II of the collective bargaining agreement, RSA 21-1:42, XIII and by administrative rule, the PELRB erred in construing the collective bargaining agreement as prohibiting the Division\u2019s actions. We therefore reverse the PELRB\u2019s ruling that the Division breached the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
