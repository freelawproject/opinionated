He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and in its instructions to the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The record evidences the following facts. On August 31, 2007, the defendant accompanied his fiancee, Robyn Forward, to the Twin State Speedway in Claremont. Forward drove their vehicle, a rented 2007 Mustang, because she was a licensed driver, whereas the defendant was an habitual offender whose license had been revoked. Forward parked the Mustang in the parking lot, but subsequently permitted the defendant to drive it in a \u201cspectator race,\u201d a race open to non-professional drivers. The defendant drove the car to the pit and onto the track, where he participated in the race. After the race, the defendant returned to the pit area, where he created a \u201csmoke show\u201d by spinning the tires to produce a smoke cloud. Because smoke shows are not permitted at the racetrack, the defendant\u2019s actions drew the attention of the racetrack staff and of a police officer patrolling the grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Pit director Gary Baker approached the Mustang during the smoke show and asked the defendant to turn off the car and give him the keys. Baker noted that the defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, that he appeared to slur his speech, and that he smelled of alcohol. When the defendant refused to get out of the car, Baker left to find a police officer. As Officer Shawn Hallock responded to the smoke show on foot, the defendant began to drive away from the pit and into the parking lot. Officer Hallock pursued the car on foot for a short distance before radioing Captain Colby Casey for assistance. Baker and Hallock saw the car proceed through the parking lot area before they lost sight of it. Forward and the defendant then left the racetrack as they had come: Forward was driving and the defendant was her passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Captain Casey, driving a cruiser, caught up with the Mustang and stopped it about a quarter mile from the racetrack. He noted that the passenger, the defendant, appeared intoxicated and smelled of alcohol. He arrested the defendant based upon the information provided by Officer Hallock and information regarding the defendant\u2019s habitual offender status provided by dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Prior to trial, the State filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude all testimony of any witness\u2019s subjective belief as to whether the Speedway\u2019s parking lot constitutes a \u201cway.\u201d The defendant objected, arguing that because the State must prove every element of the offense, it must establish the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d as to the \u201cway\u201d element of the habitual offender charge. The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>concluding that the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d applied only to the defendant\u2019s status as an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">At trial, the defense stipulated to the defendant\u2019s status as an habitual offender, and to his knowledge of that status. The defense argued that the defendant had limited his driving to a staging area of the Speedway track, and, therefore, the surface he drove on was not a \u201cway.\u201d The State contended that the defendant had driven in the Speedway parking lot, which falls within the legal definition of a \u201cway.\u201d The court\u2019s jury instructions, consistent with its ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Normally, the matter of intention or the defendant\u2019s mental state is something that you would have to decide. In these cases, however, Mr. Riendeau\u2019s intent is not an issue as the parties have stipulated as to this element of the offense with respect to the charge of operating a motor vehicle after being certified as a habitual offender and Mr. Riendeau\u2019s intent or mental state is not an element of the charge of driving while intoxicated... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">The definition of the crime... of operating a motor vehicle after having been certified as a motor vehicle habitual offender has multiple elements. You need only consider two elements of this offense in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation. Thus, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Randy Riendeau, drove a motor vehicle and that he did so on a way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">The parties, as I have previously advised you, have stipulated as to the other elements of this offense, namely that Mr. Riendeau knew he was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle upon the ways of New Hampshire, having been certified a habitual offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">The State is not required to prove that the defendant drove a motor vehicle on a surface that you qualified under the law as a way. [sic] The State is required to prove the knowing element only to the actual operation of the vehicle; that is, that the defendant was aware he was driving a motor vehicle and that [he] was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of his status as a habitual offender. The defendant does not have to know that the vehicle he is driving is on a surface that is defined by New Hampshire law as a way for the State to satisfy its burden of proof. The State need only satisfy you with respect to the existence of a way, that the surface upon which the defendant was driving is, in fact, a way under New Hampshire law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The State, further, is not required to prove that the defendant intended to use the surface upon which he was driving in a manner consistent with a way, as defined by the law. All you need consider is whether the surface upon which the defendant was driving was, in fact, a way. \u201cWay\u201d is defined, for purposes of the habitual offender charge, in pertinent part, as a public or private parking lot which is maintained primarily for the benefit of paying customers. \u201cParking lot\u201d is defined as an area used for the parking of motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We note that, although the defendant was charged with both driving after certification as an habitual offender and driving while intoxicated, the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>addressed \u201cthe <em>mens rea </em>argument as it relate[d] to the habitual offender charge only.\u201d The parties\u2019 briefs also focus exclusively on this issue. We therefore deem waived any argument regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state involved in the DWI charge. <em>See, e.g., State v. Blackmer, </em>149 N.H. 47, 49 (2003) (issues not fully briefed for review are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred, both in its ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and in its jury instructions, when it interpreted the habitual offender statute as not requiring the State to prove the defendant knew that the area he was driving on was a \u201cway.\u201d He asserts that the State must prove the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d as to the \u201cway\u201d element of the habitual offender charge for two reasons: first, because the \u201cway\u201d element is a material element of the offense to which a <em>mens rea </em>must apply; and second, because the policies and purposes underlying the habitual offender statute justify applying the mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d to the \u201cway\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The State responds that the only element of the habitual offender charge to which the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d has been applied by this court is the defendant\u2019s status as an habitual offender. It argues that to apply the <em>mens rea </em>requirement to the \u201cway\u201d element would contravene the purpose of the statute because it would place the risk posed by habitual offenders upon those who travel the ways of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">We consider issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. State v. McMillan, </em>158 N.H. 753, 757 (2009). We are the final arbiter of the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute as a whole. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOur task is to construe Criminal Code provisions according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice. In doing so, we look first to the plain language of the statute to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">RSA 262:23, I (Supp. 2009) provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle on the ways of this state while an order of the director or the court prohibiting such driving remains in effect.\u201d The statute thus does not specify any <em>mens rea </em>requirement. \u201cHowever, the failure of the legislature to provide for the specific culpable mental state required for a crime does not mean that the statute is necessarily unenforceable.\u201d <em>State v. Stratton, </em>132 N.H. 451, 457 (1989). To support conviction for a felony, New Hampshire law requires proof that a person acted either \u201cpurposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.\u201d RSA 626:2, I (2007). However, \u201c[n]either knowledge nor recklessness nor negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense ... is an element of such offense, unless the law so provides.\u201d RSA 626:2, V. \u201cWhen the culpable state of mind has been omitted from a statute, the State must prove the existence of the mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.\u201d <em>Stratton, </em>132 N.H. at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> We first determine whether the \u201cway\u201d element is a \u201cmaterial element\u201d of the habitual offender charge. <em>See, e.g., State v. Demmons, </em>137 N.H. 716, 719 (1993) (\u201cculpability applies only to material elements\u201d). RSA 625:11, IV (2007) defines \u201cmaterial element of an offense\u201d as \u201can element that does not relate exclusively to the statute of limitations, jurisdiction, venue or to any other matter similarly unrelated to (1) the harm sought to be prevented by the definition of the offense, or (2) any justification or excuse for the prescribed conduct.\u201d \u201cThe primary purpose of the habitual offender statute is to foster safety on the highways.\u201d <em>State v. Dean, </em>115 N.H. 520, 524 (1975). The \u201cway\u201d element therefore is directly related to \u201cthe harm sought to be prevented by the definition of the offense,\u201d and we accordingly conclude that it is a \u201cmaterial element\u201d of the habitual offender charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">While we agree with the defendant that the \u201cway\u201d element is a material element of the offense, we do not agree with either of the two rationales he uses to argue that the materiality of the \u201cway\u201d element requires application of the \u201cknowingly\u201d <em>mens rea. </em>First, the defendant relies upon the following statement from <em>State v. Baker, </em>135 N.H. 447, 449 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(1992): \u201cTo prove that the defendant acted knowingly, the State had to prove knowledge as to all material elements.\u201d However, that quotation is only half of a sentence which reads in full: \u201cTo prove that the defendant acted knowingly, the State had to prove knowledge as to all material elements, RSA 626:2, I, or, in other words, that he knowingly operated a vehicle while the habitual offender prohibition was still in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This formulation is consistent with our repeated articulation of the elements of the habitual offender charge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">A conviction on the charge of operation after certification as an habitual offender requires proof of three elements: (1) that an habitual offender order barring the defendant from driving a motor vehicle was in force; (2) that the defendant drove a motor vehicle on the ways of this State while that order remained in effect; and (3) that the defendant did so with knowledge of his status as an habitual offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>State v. Crotty, </em>134 N.H. 706, 710 (1991) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Gauntt, </em>154 N.H. 204, 207 (2006); <em>State v. LeBaron, </em>148 N.H. 226, 229 (2002). The only element to which we applied the mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d in cases of driving after certification, including <em>Baker, </em>is the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his status as an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Similarly unavailing is the defendant\u2019s assertion that RSA 626:2, I, requires application of the same mental state to all material elements of this offense. RSA 626:2, I, provides in pertinent part, \u201cWhen the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for its commission, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such culpability shall apply to all the material elements, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.\u201d This provision is inapplicable on its face, since the law defining the offense at issue, RSA 262:23,1, does not prescribe the kind of culpability that is sufficient for its commission. The defendant\u2019s attempt to read this provision as embodying \u201ca general principle favoring consistency in the application of a mental state to the several elements defining a single crime\u201d does not dictate our result. Rather, we apply our well-settled precedent: \u201cWhere a specific mental state is not provided for the offense, we read RSA 626:2,1, as requiring proof of a culpable mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.\u201d <em>State v. Ayer, </em>136 N.H. 191, 193 (1992) (quotations, brackets and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Accordingly, we must determine the \u201cculpable mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.\u201d <em>State v. Aldrich, </em>124 N.H. 43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>47 (1983). The State asserts that the purposes of the habitual offender statute are best served by declining to require any mental state for the \u201cway\u201d element. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that \u201cknowingly\u201d is the appropriate culpable mental state applicable to the \u201cway\u201d element. We agree with the State that to impose the requirement of the \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state to the \u201cway\u201d element would be contrary to the purpose of the statute. <em>See McMillan, </em>158 N.H. at 760. The legislature has expressed the purpose of the habitual offender statute in RSA 262:18 (2004), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">It is hereby declared to be the policy of New Hampshire:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">I. To provide maximum safety for all persons who travel or otherwise use the ways of the state; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">II. To deny the privilege of driving motor vehicles on such ways to persons who by their conduct and record have demonstrated their indifference for the safety and welfare of others and their disrespect for the laws of the state, the orders of her court and the statutorily required acts of her administrative agencies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">III. To discourage repetition of criminal acts by individuals against the peace and dignity of the state and her political subdivisions and to impose increased and added deprivation of the privilege to drive motor vehicles upon habitual offenders who have been convicted repeatedly of violations of traffic laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Thus, we have stated that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the habitual offender statute is to foster safety by removing irresponsible drivers from the highways of the State.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>132 N.H. 587, 592 (1989) (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Canney, </em>132 N.H. 189, 192 (1989) (describing the habitual offender statute, in part, as \u201cpart of a statutory scheme enacted to promote maximum safety on this State\u2019s roadways\u201d); <em>State v. Ward, </em>118 N.H. 874, 878 (1978) (same); <em>Dean, </em>115 N.H. at 524 (\u201cthe penalty imposed upon an habitual offender is primarily for the protection of the public in removing from the highways an operator who is a dangerous and persistent offender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">This purpose is achieved only if the habitual offender is prohibited from driving on a way of this State at any time, regardless of whether he recognizes it as a way or not. <em>Cf. McMillan, </em>158 N.H. at 761. \u201cTo hold otherwise would ignore the purpose of the statute. We do not believe the legislature intended such a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is because the risk to the public is the same whether or not the defendant knows that the surface on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>he is driving is a \u201cway.\u201d Simply put, an habitual offender who believes himself to be driving on private turf, but who is in fact driving on a road surface that falls within the statutory definition of a \u201cway,\u201d creates the same risk sought to be prevented as an habitual offender who knows that he is driving on a \u201cway.\u201d <em>See State v. Osgood, </em>135 N.H. 436, 438 (1992) (\u201cThe danger to the public occurs when an habitual offender places a motor vehicle... in motion on the highway.\u201d (quotation and citation omitted)). \u201cWe therefore cannot conclude it was an unsustainable exercise of discretion to refuse the defendant\u2019s requested instruction.\u201d <em>McMillan, </em>158 N.H. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The defendant\u2019s comparison of the habitual offender offense to the lesser offense of driving after suspension or revocation codified at RSA 263:64 (Supp. 2009) does not alter our analysis. The defendant points out that RSA 263:64 prohibits driving without regard as to whether the driving takes place on a \u201cway\u201d or elsewhere, and argues that such reflects a legislative intent to more narrowly define the more serious habitual offender offense. He reasons that, as we have required proof of the <em>mens rea </em>\u201cknowingly\u201d as to the habitual offender status element, we should do the same for the \u201cway\u201d element. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> \u201c[D]riving after suspension or revocation under RSA 263:64 is related as a lesser-included offense to operating as an habitual offender under RSA 262:23.\u201d <em>State v. Moses, </em>128 N.H. 617, 621 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">Conviction of the misdemeanor offense of driving after suspension or revocation requires proof: (1) that the defendant\u2019s license to drive had been suspended or revoked; (2) that the defendant drove a motor vehicle after such suspension; and (3) that the defendant did so with knowledge of the revocation or suspension of his license to drive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\"><em>State v. Watkins, </em>148 N.H. 760, 766 (2002) (quotations and citation omitted). \u201cThus, both the greater and lesser offenses have a knowledge requirement\u201d as to the status element, be it the lesser status of license suspension or revocation, or the greater status of certification as an habitual offender. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause an habitual offender order not to drive is a form of judicial revocation,\u201d <em>Moses, </em>128 N.H. at 621, an habitual offender who drives on any terrain in the state, regardless of its status as a way or not, is in violation of RSA 263:64. Moreover, RSA 262:23 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">in any case in which the accused is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked, or is charged with driving without a license, the court before hearing such charge shall determine whether such person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>has been held an habitual offender and by reason of such holding is barred from driving a motor vehicle on the ways of this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Thus, the legislature has mandated that a defendant is subject to a greater penalty upon a finding of recidivism (the habitual offender certification) and driving on a surface where the public has a greater likelihood of being injured (the \u201cway\u201d element).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We remain unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that application of the \u201cknowingly\u201d <em>mens rea </em>to the \u201cway\u201d element would serve to deter habitual offenders from driving on the ways of the state. We agree that a defendant cannot be deterred from an activity he is unaware that he is undertaking. <em>See Aldrich, </em>124 N.H. at 49. However, while deterrence is the third of the three stated purposes of the habitual offender statute, <em>see </em>RSA 262:18, the first and \u201cprimary purpose of the habitual offender statute is to foster safety by removing irresponsible drivers from the highways of the State.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>132 N.H. at 592 (quotations and citations omitted). This purpose is best served by interpreting the statute as prohibiting the action itself \u2014 driving on a \u201cway\u201d \u2014 irrespective of the defendant\u2019s awareness of his presence on a \u201cway.\u201d Our interpretation is further supported by the second stated purpose of the statute: \u201cTo deny the privilege of driving motor vehicles on such ways to persons who by their conduct and record have demonstrated their indifference for the safety and welfare of others and their disrespect for the laws of the state.\u201d RSA 262:18, II. To find otherwise would permit defendants who have \u201cdemonstrated their indifference for the safety and welfare of others\u201d to elude punishment by asserting that they were unaware that they were driving on a \u201cway.\u201d Requiring an habitual offender defendant, rather than the public, to bear the risk that the surface on which the defendant is driving constitutes a \u201cway\u201d also serves to discourage such a defendant from operating a motor vehicle at all (as is prohibited under RSA 263:64). We accordingly conclude that interpreting the statute as not requiring proof of a <em>mens rea </em>for the \u201cway\u201d element best fulfills the aims of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> The defendant\u2019s remaining argument, concerning ignorance of the law versus ignorance of fact, can be addressed briefly. It is well-established that \u201c[i]gnorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d <em>Stratton, </em>132 N.H. at 457; <em>cf. </em>RSA 626:3, II (2007) (effect of mistake of law). The defendant\u2019s arguments throughout have therefore centered upon his ignorance of fact; that is, that the surface on which he drove was a \u201cpublic or private parking lot which is maintained primarily for the benefit of paying customers,\u201d fitting the statutory definition of a \u201cway.\u201d RSA 259:125,1 (Supp. 2009). The defendant argues that he drove on the race track\u2019s staging area rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>a parking lot, and in the alternative, that such was his understanding of the character of the surface on which he drove. His first argument presents a question of fact, and the defendant does not assert a lack of evidence to support the jury\u2019s implicit finding that he drove on a parking lot. His alternative argument is moot because we hold today that RSA 262:23 does not require that a defendant recognize that he is driving on a \u201cway\u201d; as to the \u201cway\u201d element, the State need prove only that the defendant did in fact drive on a \u201cway\u201d as defined by the statute. The trial court\u2019s jury instructions required that the State establish \u201cthat the surface upon which the defendant was driving is, in fact, a way under New Hampshire law.\u201d This charge was accurate, and did not constitute an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
