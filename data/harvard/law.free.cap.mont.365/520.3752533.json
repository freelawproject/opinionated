They request that this Court rule that the Attorney General and the Secretary of State did not comply with their responsibilities under law when they failed to act to bar 1-166 from appearing on the general election ballot. 1-166 is a ballot initiative that would establish that the policy of the State of Montana is that corporations are not entitled to constitutional rights and are not persons. It \u201ccharges\u201d elected officials to implement the policy in part by acting to prohibit corporate political campaign spending and to limit political spending in elections. It further \u201ccharges\u201dMontana\u2019s congressional delegation with proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution establishing that corporations are not human beings entitled to constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AGG\">\u00b62 The Montana Constitution, Art. Ill, sec. 4, empowers the people to enact laws by initiative on all matters except appropriations and local or special laws. Proponents of an initiative must gather a sufficient number of signatures on petitions that support placing the matter on the ballot. Prior to gathering signatures the proponents must submit to the Secretary of State the proposed text of the ballot issue along with a draft statement of the purpose of the initiative and a separate statement of the implications of a vote for or against the issue. The Secretary of State must submit the measure to the Legislative Services Division for review and thereafter to the Attorney General for review. Upon review by Legislative Services and upon approval of the Attorney General, the Secretary of State then notifies the proponents of the measure, who may begin gathering signatures. Section 13-27-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b63 The Attorney General\u2019s review is limited to determining the sufficiency of the ballot statements and a review of the ballot issue for legal sufficiency. Section 13-27-312, MCA. The statements must explain the purpose of the measure in 100 words or less and the implications of votes for or against, in 25 words or less. Section 13-27-312(2), MCA. The Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency review determines whether the proposal complies with the applicable statutory and constitutional requirements. The legal sufficiency review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>specifically \u201cdoes not include consideration of the substantive legality of the issue if approved by the voters.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b64 In the case of 1-166, the Secretary of State received the proposal and submitted it to Legislative Services and then to the Attorney General for review. The Attorney General revised the proponents\u2019 statement of purpose but otherwise notified the Secretary of State that the proposal met the required legal sufficiency review. Upon notification by the Attorney General the Secretary of State notified the proponents of 1-166 that they could begin gathering signatures, as provided in \u00a713-27-202. MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b65 The current petitioners, opponents of 1-166, contend that the ballot statements do not comply with law and that the Attorney General should not have approved them. They also contend that the initiative itself is unlawful on several grounds including that it is a resolution and not a law; that it improperly amends the Montana Constitution; and that it improperly directs elected representatives how to vote. They sued under \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA, which allows opponents of a ballot issue to contest the adequacy of the explanatory statements and of the Attorney General\u2019s determination of legal sufficiency. They seek no other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b66  As previously explained, the Attorney General\u2019s review for legal sufficiency is limited by law to determining whether the petition for a ballot issue complies with the statutory and constitutional requirements \u201cgoverning submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d It does not include consideration \u201cof the substantive legality of the issue if approved by the voters.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA. However, the petitioners in this case seek to have this Court require that the Attorney General undertake precisely the substantive legal review that is excluded by law. By statute, the Attorney General had no power to review the substantive legality of 1-166. The petition does not allege nor does this Court find that the petition was legally insufficient as to the requirements for submission of a proposed ballot issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b67  We have reviewed the explanatory statements that were approved by the Attorney General. Section 13-27-312(4), MCA, requires that the statements of purpose and of the implication of a vote must be \u201ctrue and impartial\u201d and must be in \u201ceasily understood language and may not be arguments or written so as to create prejudice for or against the issue.\u201d The petitioners request that this Court either reject the statements approved by the Attorney General, or re-write them. Upon review of the statements we determine that they meet the requirements of \u00a713-27-312(2) and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b68 Petitioners have not requested any other relief, <em>see e.g. Harper v. Waltermire, </em>213 Mont. 425, 691 P.2d 826 (1984), and we decline to consider any such issues not properly pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b69 For the reasons stated above, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">DATED this 10th day of August, 2012.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b547-7\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b610 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision to reject the petition in this case and to allow 1-166 to appear on the November 2012 general election ballot. I also concur in the Court\u2019s determination that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot language fairly represents the text of the measure and therefore meets the requirements of \u00a713-27-312(2) and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b611 The key issue is whether the petition states a claim that may be entertained in a pre-election original proceeding before this Court. While striving to give liberal construction to constitutional and statutory initiative and referendum provisions in order \u201cto maintain the maximum power in the people,\u201d the Court previously has invalidated proposed ballot issues that are beyond the power that the people reserved to themselves in Article III, Sections 4 and 5, of the Montana Constitution. <em>Chouteau County v. Grossman, </em>172 Mont. 373, 378, 563 P.2d 1125, 1128 (1977) (invalidating county referendum proposal that concerned an administrative rather than legislative function); <em>Harper, </em>213 Mont. at 428-29, 691 P.2d at 828-29 (invalidating initiative that proposed a legislative resolution compelling the legislature to reach a specific result).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b612 Since those cases were decided, the legislature has acted several times over the years to clarify when legal challenges may keep an initiative or referendum off the ballot. Section 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA, under which the petition in this case was filed, now makes clear that this Court has original jurisdiction to review \u201cthe attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in an action brought pursuant to 13-27-316.\u201dUnder \u00a713-27-316(2), MCA, Petitioners here have requested the Court to alter the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statements and to overrule his determination that the petition is legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b613 Consistent with its obligation to construe the statutes to promote, rather than to curtail, the people\u2019s right of direct democracy, the Court interprets the Attorney General\u2019s \u2018legal sufficiency\u201d review authority narrowly. Thus, the Court refuses to read \u00a7 13-27-312(7), MCA, as conferring power on the Attorney General to reject a citizen-initiated ballot measure for constitutional deficiency. (Opinion, \u00b6 6.) The Dissent argues that the Attorney General has power to declare a proposed initiative or referendum facially unconstitutional and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>prohibit its placement on the ballot. (Dissent, \u00b6 40.) While I believe that it is the judicial branch of government, not the executive, that determines whether a ballot measure is facially unconstitutional, I do not confine my decision in this case to the Court\u2019s rationale that the petitioners simply failed to request the proper form of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b614 TW]hen the legislature has prescribed a specific process for a court challenge to a ballot measure, we have refused to intervene prior to the election if that process was not followed.\u201d <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 95, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455 (Baker, J., concurring and dissenting) (citing <em>State ex rel. Mont. Citizens for the Preservation of Citizens\u2019Rights v. Waltermire, </em>224 Mont. 273, 278, 729 P.2d 1283, 1286 (1986)). In contrast to the law at the time <em>Harper </em>and <em>Grossman </em>were decided, the statutes now reflect a clear preference to defer ruling on the constitutionality of a proposed initiative petition until <em>after </em>the results of the election at which it is submitted to the voters. The governing statutes expressly preserve \u201cthe right to challenge a ballot issue enacted by a vote of the people.\u201d Section 3-2-202(5), MCA. <em>See also </em>\u00a713-27-316(6), MCA (\u2018This section does not limit the right to challenge a constitutional defect in the substance of an issue <em>approved by a vote of the people.\u201d). </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b615 Petitioners\u2019 claim that 1-166 is beyond the power of initiative and referendum challenges an alleged constitutional defect in the substance of the measure. Whether or not the Court possesses original jurisdiction in a proper proceeding to invalidate a proposed ballot measure prior to the election (\u00a73-2-202(1), MCA), I would hold in this case that Petitioners\u2019 challenge to 1-166 does not meet the Court\u2019s own requirements for discretionary exercise of its original jurisdiction (M. R. App. P. 14(2) and (4)) and must await the final election results in November. At that time, if the measure is approved by the voters, Petitioners may proceed by filing a complaint for declaratory judgment in district court and by pursuing the \u201cnormal appeal process\u201d in this Court. M. R. App. P. 14(4). That process is better suited for the development and informed consideration of constitutional questions such as those raised in the petition. I do not read the Court\u2019s decision today to foreclose such a challenge if the measure is approved in the general election.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b548-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Abh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b616 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to deny relief. I agree, rather, with the arguments of Petitioners and would order the Secretary of State not to place 1-166 on the 2012 general election ballot or, if the ballots have already been printed with the measure, not to count the votes. <em>See Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, 365 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>92, 278 P.3d 455. Before detailing my legal analysis, I have three observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">I. Contempt</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b617 First, aside from the fatal legal problem plaguing 1-166 (discussed below), this initiative is, at bottom, simply a feel-good exercise exhibiting contempt for the federal government and, particularly, the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Obviously, corporations are not \u2018human beings,\u201d and the fact that Montana voters may (or may not) have heartburn with the notion of corporations as \u201cpersons\u201d imbued with constitutional rights is largely irrelevant. Make no mistake, I share the pain of my fellow Montanans. <em>See Western </em>Tradition, \u00b6 132 (Nelson, J., dissenting). And if Montana wants to change its laws to provide that corporations are not persons and are without constitutional rights, it certainly can do that. But the 1-166 exercise-at least that portion of the initiative directing Montana\u2019s elected and appointed officials how to act at the <em>state </em>level-is not going to alter these concepts at the federal level or in our sister states. Indeed, I suspect that amending Montana\u2019s laws in this fashion would put Montana corporations at a distinct disadvantage in interstate commerce and, likely, cause Montana businesses to incorporate elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b618 The fact is that corporations are \u201cpersons\u201d imbued with certain constitutional rights because the Supreme Court has said so. <em>First Natl. Bank v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 780 n. 15, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 1418 n. 15 (1978) (\u201cIt has been settled for almost a century that corporations are persons within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d); <em>but see Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 822-23, 98 S. Ct. at 1439-40 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The 1-166 exercise, even if adopted, is not going to change that. Likewise, the Supreme Court has also said, unequivocally, that the protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution extend to corporations, <em>Citizens United v. </em>FEC,_U.S. _, 130 S. Ct. 876, 899-900 (2010) (citing numerous cases dating back as far as the 1950s), and that the government cannot prohibit corporations from making independent expenditures to influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>elections and ballot issues, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 886, 913. Again, the 1-166 exercise, even if adopted, is not going to change that. \u00b619 Montana challenged the applicability of <em>Citizens United </em>to Montana in the <em>Western Tradition </em>case, citing Montana\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d experience with political corruption and its 1912 Corrupt Practices Act. But Montana lost-summarily, no less:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">The question presented in this case is whether the holding of <em>Citizens United </em>applies to the Montana state law. There can be no serious doubt that it does. See U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Montana\u2019s arguments in support of the judgment below either were already rejected in <em>Citizens United, </em>or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Am. Tradition, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2491. Thus, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Western </em>Tradition-prominently cited at \u00a72(4) of I-166-is not the law of this State. And for the text of 1-166 to imply, as it clearly does, that Montana\u2019s \u201cuniqueness\u201dargument and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Western Tradition </em>are still in play is patently false and misleading. The Supreme Court in <em>American Tradition </em>unequivocally rejected Montana\u2019s \u201cuniqueness\u201d argument, the applicability of Montana\u2019s Corrupt Practices Act, and this Court\u2019s decision to the contrary. The Supreme Court held that <em>Citizens United </em>applies to Montana. <em>Citizens United </em>states that j[c]orporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to foster.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 900 (internal quotation marks omitted). Like it or not, this is the law of the land and Montana is going to have to comply with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">II. False Promises</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b620 Second, and a point seemingly lost on those promoting the 1-166 exercise, the Supreme Court did not rely on corporate \u201cpersonhood\u201d in its decision in <em>Citizen United. </em>Rather, the Supreme Court relied on the propositions, first, that expenditures (by a person or an organization) on political communication are a form of \u201cspeech,\u201d and second, that \u201ccitizens [have the right] to inquire, <em>to hear, </em>to speak, and to use information to reach consensus.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898 (emphasis added). It should be noted that these propositions were not created in <em>Citizens United. </em>Rather, they can be traced to <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam), and <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 98 S. Ct. 1407. Notably, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Bellotti </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>[t]he court below framed the principal question in this case as whether and to what extent corporations have First Amendment rights. We believe that the court posed the wrong question. The Constitution often protects interests broader than those of the party seeking their vindication. The First Amendment, in particular, serves significant societal interests. The proper question therefore is not whether corporations \u2018have\u201d First Amendment rights and, if so, whether they are coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be whether [the statute at issue] abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">435 U.S. at 775-76, 98 S. Ct. at 1415. <em>The Bellotti </em>Court stated further that \u201c[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual,\u201d 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S. Ct. at 1416, and that \u2018the First Amendment <em>goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit government from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw,\u201d </em>435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b621 Hence, the Supreme Court broke no new ground in <em>Citizens United </em>when it defined the constitutional protection of speech from the perspective of the listener. \u2018tl]t is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes,\u201d and the First Amendment does not allow \u201cthe exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899. Quite the contrary, the First Amendment protects the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899, and prohibits restrictions on political speech based on the speaker\u2019s identity, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 902-03. Because voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources, it is a violation of the First Amendment to control expression by distinguishing among different speakers and the subjects upon which they may speak. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898-99. The Supreme Court held that this country\u2019s law and tradition require more expression, not less, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911, and that \u201c[w]hen Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command <em>where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, </em>it uses censorship to control thought,\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00b622 It is undoubtedly easier to sell the proposition that corporations are not \u2018human beings\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d than it would be to persuade the electorate that the government may, in fact, restrict the sources from which voters may get their information. Yet, in terms of what these two actually accomplish, there is a world of difference. It is apparent that adoption of the <em>latter </em>proposition (by Congress and three-fourths of the state legislatures) is what\u2019s needed to overturn <em>Bellotti </em>and <em>Citizens United. </em>Any amendment designed to negate these precedents would need to exclude corporate expenditures from the definition of protected \u201cspeech\u201d under the First Amendment. Adopting the <em>former </em>proposition that corporations are not \u201cpersons,\u201d in contrast, accomplishes absolutely nothing for First Amendment purposes-apart from wasting the electorate\u2019s time and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b623 Viewed in the context of what <em>Citizens United </em>actually held, therefore, it is evident that this initiative, as presently written, is little more than a source of false hope for many voters and an illegal-mot to mention futile-attempt to end-run the <em>Citizens United </em>decision. As with Montana\u2019s first attempt to do that, I suspect that if the 1-166 exercise remains on the ballot and is challenged before the Supreme Court, it will suffer the same summary rejection as did this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Western Tradition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b624 Charging Montana\u2019s congressional delegation with the obligation of offering an amendment to the United States Constitution to, among other things, overturn <em>Citizens United </em>is an equally misguided feelgood exercise in contempt. Realistically, in today\u2019s political climate, a proposal to amend the federal Constitution (a nearly impossible task under the most favorable circumstances) in order to overturn a Supreme Court decision that is wildly popular with at least one of the major political parties, with one of the major fringe parties, and, most importantly, with the very corporations that already effectively control Congress has less of a chance at success than the proverbial snowball has of surviving in Hades. It (the constitutional amendment) is not going to happen, and the attorneys and public officials promoting the 1-166 exercise would have to candidly admit that. Leading voters to think otherwise is not only disingenuous, but just plain silly. An arguably more productive focus would be on strengthening the disclosure laws. If voters have the right to obtain information from diverse sources in order to make informed choices, as the Supreme Court has said, then they also have a corresponding right to know who is providing the information and the ability to judge the credibility, motives, and agenda of the speaker. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u00b625 Even assuming, for the sake of discussion, that a federal constitutional amendment were to be adopted, such an amendment would necessarily have to amend the First Amendment itself-er even \u201crepeal\u201dit, as was done to the Eighteenth Amendment. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. XXI, \u00a7 1 (\u2018The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.\u201d). The First Amendment, adopted in 1791, protects five freedoms: religion, speech, the press, to peaceably assemble, and to petition for redress of grievances. Important for our purposes here, it provides that \u2018Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d So, if the object of the 1-166 exercise is to have Congress and the states change this provision so as not only to permit restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures, but also to \u201caccomplish a level playing field in election spending\u201d <em>(see </em>1-166, \u00a73(1)), then it will be necessary to make significant revisions to the First Amendment\u2019s currently broad and unqualified protection of\u2018freedom of speech.\u2019Tersonally, I like the First Amendment the way it is, and I would not want anyone-especially a politically polarized and dysfunctional Congress-tinkering with it. God only knows what might come out of that effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">III. Petitioners\u2019 Hypocrisy</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b626 As for my third observation, Petitioners\u2019 challenge, while legally sound, would be more palatable if it were not so palpably hypocritical. As the 2011 session of the Montana Legislature demonstrated time and again, there are some in that esteemed body who apparently believe it is part of their job descriptions to propose or adopt resolutions and bills<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (and issue press releases and other pronouncements) which effectively thumb Montana\u2019s nose at the federal government and federal law. <em>See Western Tradition, </em>\u00b6 71 (Nelson, J., dissenting). Most thinking Montanans view this grandstanding for what it actually is: political pandering which accomplishes nothing substantive and which wastes the valuable state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>resources and limited time of the elected officials involved. Yet, here we are in court with Petitioners rising up in righteous indignation against the same sort of 1-166 exercise. Apparently there is no shame. But then, to be right, the law does not require contrition or regret. As noted, Petitioners are legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b627 Petitioners advance five meritorious arguments: 1-166 is a resolution, not a law; 1-166 requires elected officials to vote in a particular predetermined manner; 1-166 is a resolution compelling Montana\u2019s congressional delegation to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution; 1-166 contains more than one subject; and the statements prepared or approved by the Attorney General do not meet the requirements of law. I am satisfied, however, that the first argument is sufficient to resolve this case. The 1-166 exercise facially violates Article III, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. My analysis below is focused on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">IV. 1-166 Does Not Comply with Constitutional Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b628 As this Court recently stated, pre-election judicial review of initiatives should not be routinely conducted, so as to protect and preserve the rights which Montanans have reserved to themselves to change the laws or the Constitution through the initiative process. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 59, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. However, this Court reserves the right to declare patently defective measures invalid. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 59 (citing <em>State ex rel. Steen v. Murray, </em>144 Mont. 61, 69, 394 P.2d 761, 765 (1964), <em>State ex rel. Harper v. Waltermire, </em>213 Mont. 425, 428, 691 P.2d 826, 828 (1984), <em>Harper v. Greely, </em>234 Mont. 259, 268, 763 P.2d 650, 656 (1988), and <em>Cobb v. State, </em>278 Mont. 307, 311, 924 P.2d 268, 270 (1996)). Indeed, we have held that where a measure is facially defective, placing it on the ballot does nothing to protect voters\u2019 rights and instead \u201ccreates a sham out of the voting process by conveying the false appearance that a vote on the measure counts for something, when in fact the measure is invalid regardless of how the electors vote.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b629 First and foremost, the 1-166 exercise (the complete text of which is attached at the end of this Dissent) does not propose the enactment of any law. Indeed, as the Attorney General readily and repeatedly concedes, the 1-166 exercise is framed in terms of stating a \u201cpolicy\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201dand then \u201cdirect[ing]\u201dand \u201ccharging]\u201dMontana\u2019s elected and appointed officials with \u201cpromoting]\u201d and \u201ccarrying out\u201d that policy and philosophy. <em>See </em>1-166, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4. The policy and philosophy dictate that \u201ccorporations are not human beings with constitutional rights,\u201d that corporations should be prohibited \u2018from making contributions to or expenditures on the campaigns of candidates or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ballot issues,\u201d and that there should be \u201ca level playing field in election spending.\u201d 1-166, \u00a73. As already noted, these propositions contradict well-settled federal constitutional law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the initiative charges Montana\u2019s congressional delegation with \u201cproposing a joint resolution offering an amendment\u201d to the federal Constitution which establishes that corporations are not human beings with constitutional rights, which establishes that corporate campaign contributions and expenditures may be prohibited, and which achieves \u201ca level playing field in election spending.\u201d In sum, the 1-166 exercise does not enact new law or repeal existing law-mor does it even <em>purport </em>to do so. Rather, it simply charges elected and appointed officials at the <em>state </em>level with violating the law already established by the Supreme Court and our congressional delegation at the <em>federal </em>level with pursuing a course of conduct that is not only misguided, but also virtually certain to fail. The 1-166 exercise, even if adopted, cannot change federal law; it does not change state law; and it does not change the law of any sister state. Rather, the 1-166 exercise simply does into the wind what most Montana children learn to avoid early in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b630 More to the point, Article III, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution reserves to the people of this State the right to \u201cenact <em>laws </em>by initiative on all matters except appropriations of money and local or special laws.\u201d A \u2018law\u201d is \u201ca solemn expression of the will of the supreme power of the state.\u201d Section 1-1-101, MCA. \u2018The will of the supreme power is expressed by: (1) the constitution; (2) statutes.\u201d Section 1-1-102, MCA. Whereas a \u201cpolicy\u201d represents \u2018ft]he general principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs,\u201d the \u2018law\u201d represents the actual \u201cregime that orders human activities and relations through systematic application of the force of politically organized society.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1178 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999). \u2018The organic law is the constitution of government and is altogether written. Other written laws are denominated statutes. The written law of this state is therefore contained in its constitution and statutes and in the constitution and statutes of the United States.\u201d Section 1-1-105, MCA. Statutes which create and affect corporations are public statutes. Section 1-1-106, MCA. The Code also recognizes the decisions of this country\u2019s courts as law. Sections 1-1-107, -108, -109, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u00b631 As noted already, Article III, Section 4 reserves to the people the right to enact <em>laws </em>by citizen initiative. Clearly, Montana\u2019s blackletter law does not define law\u201das including \u201cpolicies\u201d and \u201cphilosophies\u201dthat one party or special interest group may wish the government and elected officials to pursue. Article III, Section 4 does not empower the people to pass policies or enact philosophies, or to direct governmental officials to pursue such policies or philosophies-setting aside the fact that, here, such direction is to actually violate established federal constitutional law and precedent. The power to enact laws by the initiative process does not include the power to enact what amounts to a legislative resolution. <em>Harper, </em>213 Mont. at 429, 691 P.2d at 828-29. And, charitably speaking, that is all the I-166 exercise is-a feel-good expression of contempt directed against the federal government and federal constitutional law. Even if enacted, the 1-166 exercise would not be a law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b632 The Attorney General offers the meager assertion that 1-166 could be read as enacting \u201ca statutory policy statement, not merely a resolution,\u201d and that \u201c[s]tatutory policy statements occur throughout the Code.\u201d The Attorney General cites \u00a7 2-15-142, MCA, as an example.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 2-15-142, MCA, however, was not enacted by citizen initiative. It was enacted by the Legislature itself. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 2003, ch. 568, \u00a72. In making this argument, the Attorney General fails to recognize that the issue here is not whether <em>the Legislature </em>has the power to enact \u201cstatutory policy statements.\u201d It is whether citizens have that power in the form of citizen initiatives. Plainly, they do not. Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a74. Their power is limited to enacting laws,\u201d not \u201cstatutory policy statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b633 Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that the 1-166 exercise constitutes the proposal of a law,\u201d there is another fundamental problem that condemns the initiative to obvious facial unconstitutionality. It is a firmly established principle of law that a statute or law\u201d is void on its face if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden. No person should be required to speculate as to whether his contemplated course of action may be subject to criminal penalties. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 202, \u00b6 29, 300 Mont. 499, 5 P.3d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00b634 Here, the problem is manifest. First, if an elected or appointed public official violates 1-166 as \u2018law,\u201d then that person can be prosecuted for a misdemeanor crime. <em>See </em>1-166, \u00a78 (stating that the initiative is \u2018Intended to be codified as an integral part of Title 13 and the provisions of Title 13 apply to\u201d the initiative); \u00a7 13-35-103, MCA (stating that \u201c[a] person who knowingly violates a provision of the election laws of this state for which no other penalty is specified is guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d). Second, and more problematic, it is not reasonably clear what 1-166, as \u2018law,\u201d would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b635 Under \u00a73(1) of the initiative, in order to effectuate the policy and philosophy that corporations (a) are not human beings (no court has ever said they were), (b) are not entitled to constitutional rights (the Supreme Court has said they are), and (c) should not be permitted to make campaign contributions or expenditures for or against candidates and ballot issues (the Supreme Court has said they may), elected and appointed officials in Montana are \u201ccharged to promote actions that accomplish a level playing field in election spending.\u201d Some \u201cgeneral\u201d directives then follow at \u00a73(2) which are in the nature of policy statements-and nearly all of which, again, have been rejected by the Supreme Court. For example, these policy statements include that money is not speech; that constitutional rights belong to human beings, not corporations; that corporate use of wealth is corrosive and distorting; that there should be a level playing field in campaign spending; and that there should be limits on \u2018large\u201d contributions to or expenditures for the benefit of any campaign by any source. If the 1-166 exercise were to be construed as an actual \u2018law,\u201dhow would any public official of ordinary intelligence have fair notice that his or her contemplated act (or failure to act) is unlawful, so that he or she could avoid violating the law and being subjected to possible criminal sanctions? The public official\u2019s task in this regard is virtually impossible. At the outset, in order to comply with the supposed 1-166 \u2018law,\u201d the public official will have to violate extant federal law, as already discussed. Then, the public official will have to make sense of I-166\u2019s amorphous and vague terms, phrases, and conceptsdncluding \u2018level playing field,\u201d \u2018large\u201d contributions and expenditures, and \u201cpromoting\u201d actions that accomplish the stated policies. 1-166 provides no guidelines, no definitions, and no parameters. What, for example, is too \u2018large\u201d a campaign contribution? $300? $10,000? $5, 000,000? Maybe $300 is too large in Teton County, but $5,000,000 is not too large in Yellowstone County. Who knows? And, what, exactly, is the official supposed to do about a too \u2018large\u201d campaign contribution? How, exactly, is the public official to \u2018level the playing field\u201d and reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201ccorrosive and distorting\u201d effects of \u2018immense\u201d aggregations of corporate wealth?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b636 Assuming 1-166 to be a Taw,\u201da public official who fails to correctly interpret these terms may be subject to prosecution for the offense of failing to \u201cpromote\u201d I-166\u2019s policy. Likewise, if a member of Montana\u2019s congressional delegation does not encourage and promote the futile constitutional amendment heretofore discussed, the offending senator or representative may be charged with a misdemeanor. But is anyone4;he Attorney General included-really naive enough to believe this could happen? Good grief! It is ludicrous in the extreme to argue that 1-166, as Taw,\u201d would give any public official fair notice of what he or she is supposed to do or not do. While 1-166, as Taw,\u201d may direct people how to think-a dubious proposition in its own right-it gives them no fair notice at all of how to <em>act </em>in a fashion so as to avoid the criminal penalties that may result from its violation. Thus, even if the 1-166 exercise is deemed a proposed Taw\u201d for purposes of saving it under Article III, Section 4, the initiative is facially, unalterably, and inseverably void for constitutional vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b637 I understand the frustration with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Citizens United. </em>I understand the frustration with the ability of corporate America to control elections and legislative and executive branches of state and federal government. And I understand the frustration with the certain knowledge that soon corporate America will be in control of the judicial branch of government as well. However, shooting popcorn at a brick wall will accomplish nothing, even if it makes one feel good. Those who aim to change the situation are going to have to get a different gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b638 In sum, this Court reserves the right to declare patently defective measures invalid. <em>See Reichert, </em>\u00b6 59, and cases cited therein. Indeed, we have very recently held that placing a facially defective measure on the ballot does nothing to protect voters\u2019 rights and instead creates a sham out of the voting process by conveying the false appearance that a vote on the measure counts for something, when in fact the measure is invalid regardless of how the electors vote. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 59. That is the case here. The 1-166 exercise is a sham; it is nothing but an exercise in feel-good contempt of the federal government and federal law. The proposed initiative does not seek to enact Taw.\u201d It seeks, rather, to enact unenforceable political policies and philosophies. Therefore, the 1-166 exercise cannot constitutionally be proposed as a ballot measure under Article III, Section 4 of Montana\u2019s Constitution. And even if, assuming for the sake argument, the 1-166 exercise is deemed to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>proposed \u2018law,\u201d the \u2018law\u201d is facially, unalterably, and inseverably void for constitutional vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">V. The Court\u2019s Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b639 As a final matter, I note my disagreement with the Court\u2019s conclusion that we cannot grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b640 The Court concludes that the Attorney General\u2019s \u2018legal sufficiency\u201d determination is limited under \u00a713-27-312(7), MCA, to a non-substantive review of the ballot language. Opinion, \u00b6 6. To the contrary, the plain language of this statute defines \u2018legal sufficiency\u201d to mean \u201cthat the petition complies with statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d As discussed above, the problem here is that the citizen-initiative process is available under Article III, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution <em>only </em>to enact \u2018laws.\u201dMont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a74(1) (\u2018The people may enact <em>laws </em>by initiative on all matters except appropriations of money and local or special laws.\u201d (emphasis added)). This constitutional process is not available to have the people enact \u201cpolicies\u201d and philosophies and to charge public officials with encouraging misguided, impossible, and (at least under federal law) patently illegal acts. All that the 1-166 exercise purports to do is (1) set forth a policy and (2) direct elected and appointed officials to promote that policy. <em>See </em>1-166, \u00a7\u00a73,4. Accordingly, the 1-166 exercise <em>on its face </em>does not \u201ccompl[y] with ... constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors,\u201d and the Attorney General should have rejected the measure as being facially unconstitutional under \u00a713-27-312(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b641 Presumably, under the Court\u2019s approach, if some group got sufficient signatures to put on the ballot an initiative which adopted a policy and philosophy that, contrary to <em>Loving v. </em>Va., 388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817 (1967), Caucasians should not inter-marry with Native Americans or African Americans and which charged state and local officials with working diligently to carry out that policy, then, so long as the Attorney General found no fault with the ballot language, this patently and facially unconstitutional measure would have to be put to the vote. I cannot agree with such a cabined and absurd interpretation of \u00a713-27-312(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b642 Based on the foregoing, I would grant the Petitioners\u2019 petition and order the Secretary of State not to place 1-166 on the 2012 general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>election ballot or, if the ballots have already been printed with the measure, not to count the votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b643 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">BALLOT LANGUAGE FOR INITIATIVE NO. 166 (1-166)</p>\n<p id=\"AJX\">INITIATIVE NO. 166</p>\n<p id=\"ApL\">A LAW PROPOSED BY INITIATIVE PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"A9d\">Ballot Initiative 1-166 establishes a state policy that corporations are not entitled to constitutional rights because they are not human beings, and charges Montana elected and appointed officials, state and federal, to implement that policy.

Attorney General, </em>2011MT 328, upheld Montana's 1912 prohibition on corporate contributions to and expenditures on candidate campaigns, stating in its opinion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">(a) examples of well-financed corruption involving corporate money abound in Montana;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">(b) the corporate power that can be exerted with unlimited corporate political spending is still a vital interest to the people of Montana;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">(c) corporate independent spending on Montana ballot issues has far exceeded spending from other sources;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">(d) unlimited corporate money into candidate elections would irrevocably change the dynamic of local Montana political office races;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">(e) with the Infusion of unlimited corporate money In support of or opposition to a targeted candidate, the average citizen candidate In Montana would be unable to compete against the corporate-sponsored candidate, and Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have made their modest election contributions meaningfully count, would be effectively shut out of the process; and</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">(f) clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations creates a dominating impact on the Montana political process and inevitably minimizes the impact of individual Montana citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>NEW SECTION.
