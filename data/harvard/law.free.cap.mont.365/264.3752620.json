We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">\u00b62 The sole issue is whether the District Court erred by dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b63 Miller was convicted of the deliberate homicide of his brother-in-law, Lamar Windham (Windham), after a jury trial. Miller appealed, and we affirmed his conviction. <em>State v. Miller, </em>2009 MT 314N, 352 Mont. 553, 218 P.3d 500 (table). The facts of the case are detailed in that opinion, and we review only those facts necessary to resolve the issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b64 On June 25, 2006, Miller attended his wife\u2019s funeral in Browning and rode back to Great Falls with Windham in Windham\u2019s van. The next day, Windham and Miller picked up A1 Johnson (Johnson), a recent acquaintance of Miller\u2019s and new acquaintance of Windham\u2019s. The three men drank alcohol and drove around town, eventually parking at the Rainbow Dam Overlook of the Giant Springs area. Johnson remained in the van due to sickness, but he observed Windham and Miller arguing as they walked down a trail leading to the river and dam. Less than an hour later, Miller returned alone, sweating and out of breath, and he got into the driver\u2019s seat of Windham\u2019s van. Johnson inquired about Windham\u2019s whereabouts, and Miller responded with conflicting stories. Johnson talked Miller into waiting for Windham and looking for him. After an hour and a half, Miller said he would take Johnson home and come back to look for Windham. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b65 In the following days, Miller told different stories about what had happened to Windham. Miller continued to use Windham\u2019s van. Windham\u2019s family became concerned and contacted Johnson, who told them about what had happened at Giant Springs. Miller and Johnson drove to Giant Springs with Windham\u2019s family to search for Windham. Family members testified that Miller did not seem to be looking hard to find Windham. After failing to find Windham, the group went to police. While Johnson related his observations, Miller left before speaking to police. On July 18, 2006, law enforcement conducted a search of the area and found Windham\u2019s body on the river bottom below the cliff at the Rainbow Scenic Overlook. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b66 Miller was arrested and interviewed by law enforcement. He was charged with deliberate homicide and convicted by a jury in November 2007. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13. On appeal, Miller raised four issues to this Court: whether the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss for speedy trial violation, whether the district court properly instructed the jury on witness credibility, whether the district court properly denied his motion to compel the mental health care records of a witness, and whether prosecutors committed plain error in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>closing arguments. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b67 Following his appeal, Miller filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court alleging his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because counsel: failed to object to the State\u2019s use of PowerPoint presentations during opening and closing arguments and failed to request that the PowerPoint presentations be entered into the record; failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and rebuttal; failed to impeach Johnson; failed to impeach witness Ray Little Youngman; and failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments made during Miller\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. Miller also argued that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on direct appeal constituted ineffective assistance. The court ordered that Miller be appointed counsel, but later vacated that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b68 The District Court dismissed Miller\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, reasoning that Miller had exhausted his remedy of appeal and that his ineffectiveness claims were record-based assertions which he did or reasonably could have raised on appeal. Miller requests that we reverse the dismissal of his petition and remand, grant an evidentiary hearing, and order appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b69 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Hammer v. State, </em>2008 MT 342, \u00b6 9, 346 Mont. 279, 194 P.3d 699 (citing <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861). Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact that are reviewed de novo. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err by dismissing Miller\u2019s postconviction petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b611 Miller argues that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise claims of ineffective assistance against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>trial counsel in the direct appeal. He argues the District Court erred in dismissing his claims against his appellate counsel as procedurally barred because he could not have raised such claims in his direct appeal. The State concedes that Miller\u2019s claims against his appellate counsel were not procedurally barred and should have been addressed on their merits, but argues the record is sufficient for this Court to resolve Miller\u2019s claims and that a remand is unnecessary. The State argues that appellate counsel\u2019s performance \u201cwas not deficient because there is no underlying merit to Miller\u2019s claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.\u201d Although district courts generally undertake initial consideration of ineffectiveness claims, <em>see Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 42, 293 Mont. 60, 973 P.2d 233, we agree -with the State that the record is sufficient to permit review of the merits of the trial claims underlying Miller\u2019s appellate claims, making remand unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b612 The right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>St. Germain v. State, </em>2012 MT 86, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 494, 276 P.3d 886. \u201cThe right to counsel on appeal includes the right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 408, 942 P.2d 674, 692 (1997) (citing <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387,396,105 S. Ct. 830,836 (1985)), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Whitlow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b613 This Court reviews claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel like those of trial counsel. <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 37, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889). We analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims by using the two-part test enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. \u201cUnder this test, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 8 (citation omitted). In evaluating whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the first prong, \u201cwe must determine whether counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms and all the circumstances.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14). Under the second prong, \u201cthe defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal citation omitted). In the context of a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>against appellate counsel, we .have stated the standard as \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\u201d <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 31, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753 (citation omitted). A defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted). If an insufficient showing is made on one prong of the test, we do not need to address the other prong. <em>Baca v. State, </em>2008 MT 371, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 474, 197 P.3d 948 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11). \u00b614 \u201cWe observe that counsel has no constitutional obligation to raise every non-frivolous issue on appeal. The presumption of effective assistance of counsel will be overcome only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented.\u201d <em>Dubray, </em>\u00b6 31 (citations omitted). \u201cA petitioner for post-conviction relief must prove by a preponderance of evidence that he or she is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). \u201cA defendant bears a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d <em>Baca </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">A. Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b615 Miller challenges his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s vouching for Johnson\u2019s credibility and to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Miller had lied. In his direct appeal, Miller\u2019s appellate counsel raised these claims in the context of an argument requesting plain error review, as trial counsel had failed to object. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 28. While we ultimately declined to exercise plain error review, we considered the claims and concluded that the prosecutor had not erred, noting \u201cthe prosecutors did not simply offer a personal opinion regarding Johnson\u2019s credibility, but properly argued that Johnson\u2019s conduct, as opposed to Miller\u2019s, showed that Johnson was credible. Similarly, we find nothing unacceptable about the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion during closing that Miller lied when he stated he had only gone a little way down the trail. The prosecutor was drawing an inference from the DNA evidence gathered from a beer can found further down the trail where the confrontation likely took place.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 30. We again determine that there is no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">B. PowerPoint Presentations</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b616 The State utilized PowerPoint presentations in its opening and closing arguments. After the jury had rendered its verdict, Miller\u2019s trial counsel requested orally, followed by a written motion, that the PowerPoint presentations be entered into the record, noting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>State had not moved for their admission. Counsel acknowledged he had no objection to them, but argued they should be included for purposes of having an accurate record. The District Court denied the motion \u201cdue to the lack of a contemporaneous pre-verdict objection at trial and due to the lack of any specific showing of actual or potential prejudice or error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b617 Miller simply argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to either object to the State\u2019s use of the presentations or timely request that they be entered into the record was ineffective assistance. However, he has not demonstrated how counsel\u2019s inaction, even if improper, has prejudiced him. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. Thus, the claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">C. Credibility of Witness A1 Johnson \u00b618 Miller alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to impeach Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding his drinking, the parking lot where the van was parked, Johnson\u2019s sleeping, and the van keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">1. Drinking</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b619 Johnson testified that the entire group had been drinking on the day in question, but that he had drunk only two or three beers. Later in his testimony, Johnson acknowledged he had drunk three or four beers. Noting Johnson\u2019s inconsistent statements, including an earlier interview in which Johnson said he had four or five beers, Miller argues his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to impeach Johnson\u2019s testimony by the \u201cfive beer\u201d statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b620 However, Miller\u2019s trial counsel emphasized Johnson\u2019s drinking. During cross-examination of Officer David Phillips, lead detective at the time of Windham\u2019s death, defense counsel asked, \u201cyou earlier testified that [Johnson] said he drank a substantial amount of alcohol, correct?\u201d Phillips responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d In the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor said that Johnson had testified he \u201conly drank five beers,\u201d to which defense counsel responded in argument, \u201cNow, the State says, ah, he [Johnson] only had five or six beers.\u201d These statements correspond to the number which Miller emphasizes in his argument. Therefore, we conclude there was no prejudice to Miller occasioned by counsel\u2019s failure to further emphasize Johnson\u2019s conflicting testimony about how much he drank that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">2. Parking lot</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">\u00b621 The Giant Springs area has two parking lots, described at trial as the \u201clower\u201d (Rainbow) and \u201cupper\u201d (Lewis and Clark) lots. Johnson testified that Windham had parked his van in the lower lot. Miller argues his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to impeach Johnson\u2019s trial testimony with his prior statements that they had parked in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>upper lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b622 Miller\u2019s counsel asked Johnson during cross-examination if he recalled making a statement to law enforcement that they had parked at the upper lot, rather than the lower lot. Johnson affirmed, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d When cross-examining Officer Phillips, Miller\u2019s counsel focused on the fact that Miller knew they had parked in the lower lot, but J ohnson did not. In closing argument, Miller\u2019s counsel used the issue to argue that Johnson was confused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Mr. A1 Johnson, who they want to use, A1 Johnson told Phillips, even though he said on the stand that it was the lower parking lot, he told Phillips in a taped interview and Detective Phillips said that, that they were at the upper parking lot, not the lower. Who\u2019s confused here?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The record demonstrates that Miller\u2019s counsel used Johnson\u2019s inconsistent statements to Miller\u2019s advantage, and we conclude that Miller\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">3. Johnson sleeping</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b623 Johnson testified that Miller and Windham were arguing and that, when they got out of the van, Windham said \u201che ought to whip Mr. Miller\u2019s ass.\u201d Johnson testified that the men were gesturing and cursing at each other as they were walking down an embankment, and then Johnson lost sight of them. Johnson said that he lay down on the mattress in the van for about 30 to 45 minutes, but did not sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u00b624 Miller recites a police interview in which Johnson stated he slept for one hour and forty-five minutes, and another in which he said he slept for two hours. Miller alleges his trial counsel was ineffective for not impeaching Johnson\u2019s story with these inconsistencies. However, we agree with the State that Miller\u2019s trial counsel did so. During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Johnson, the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">Q. Okay. So at that point you didn\u2019t hear them? Did you fall asleep in the van?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">Q. If the transcript of the police officer interview of you indicates that you said, in fact, that you did fall asleep, would that be, do you recall saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">A. No, sir. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\">THE WITNESS: My recollection, I don\u2019t remember falling asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">[Trial Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Q. Do you remember making that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Q. You don\u2019t remember telling the officer you went to sleep for an hour, an hour and 45 minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Further, during cross-examination of Officer Phillips, Miller\u2019s counsel obtained Officer Phillips\u2019 confirmation that Johnson had told him \u201che was sleeping for that hour and 45 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b625 Miller\u2019s trial counsel demonstrated the inconsistencies in Johnson\u2019s statements about sleeping and thus did not render ineffective assistance on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">4. Keys</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\u00b626 Johnson testified that Miller returned to the van alone, got into the driver\u2019s seat of the van, and said \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d When the prosecutor asked Johnson whether he saw Miller put the key in the van to start it, Johnson answered, \u201cI don\u2019t remember the key\u201d and testified he did not think the keys were in the ignition when Miller returned to the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">\u00b627 Miller argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Johnson\u2019s testimony with prior inconsistent statements on this issue. However, trial counsel did so. On cross-examination, Miller\u2019s trial counsel asked Johnson as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">Q. Okay. Do you recall-now, you testified about the keys in the ignition, do you recall that, where they were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">A. I believe they were out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">Q. You believe they were out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-16\">Q. Okay. Do you recall when you were interviewed by the police officers telling them that the keys were still in the ignition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS5\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-17\">Q. Do you recall telling them that you could see them hanging down from the ignition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-18\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-19\">Q. I want to approach you again, Mr. Johnson. Do you recall this part of the interview right there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-20\">A. Of course not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-21\">Q. You don\u2019t remember telling them they were just in the ignition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-22\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-23\">Q. Right-hand steering column?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>A. No.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">During Miller\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Phillips, Phillips acknowledged that Johnson told him the keys were in the ignition of the van. Further, during closing argument, Miller\u2019s counsel emphasized Johnson\u2019s inconsistencies about the keys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">Let\u2019s talk about the key. Oh, the key that my client, the State wants to say, knocked [Windham] out or whatever he did and then takes the key off leaving the whole entire key ring. Why anyone would do that who knows. And then comes back with that key.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">And Mr. Johnson testified in court, I didn\u2019t think the key was in the ignition. But what did he tell Detective Phillips in his interview a year and a half ago? A1 Johnson said the key was in the ignition. You see the pictures. You can understand why someone might separate their keys because of the condition of that, the wires hanging down, the ignition hanging down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">I submit to you what A1 Johnson said originally was accurate. That\u2019s where the key was. There\u2019s no magic key, there\u2019s no evidence that my client committed anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We conclude Miller\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness on this ground is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">D. Credibility of Witness Ray Little Youngman</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b628 Miller claims his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach the testimony of Ray Little Youngman, Windham\u2019s stepson, on two issues. On the first, Youngman testified that Miller had given various accounts about Windham\u2019s whereabouts. Specifically, Youngman testified that Miller had said Windham \u201cwas at the Missouri swimming. And then [Miller] told me that [Windham] swam way out there and they never did see him after that.\u201d Miller had also offered that Windham was \u201cwith some ladies,\u201d and Windham may have gone out of state with one of the ladies. However, when asked where this conversation with Miller occurred, Youngman gave inconsistent answers, saying it occurred in a house and also in a van.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">\u00b629 Miller\u2019s trial counsel recognized this issue and challenged Youngman\u2019s testimony. During counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Youngman, Youngman stated, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t in the house.... It was in the van.\u201d Counsel clarified, \u201cIn the van?\u201d Youngman responded, \u2018Yeah. When he was, when we all start questioning him was in the van,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>explaining that there were six people in the van. Counsel asked: \u201cAnd all six of you would have heard those conversations; is that correct?\u201d Youngman affirmed, \u2018Yeah.\u201d Thereafter, counsel impeached Youngman\u2019s testimony about Miller\u2019s stories in the van during cross-examination of Mary Griffin, Youngman\u2019s aunt. Griffin was one of the family members in the van. During counsel\u2019s cross-examination, Griffin testified that she did not remember any discussions with Miller in the van. Counsel further inquired, \u201cAnd you said that [Miller] was pretty quiet the whole time; is that correct?\u201d She responded, \u2018Yeah. Usually [Miller] ain\u2019t quiet. But at that time he was.\u201d Counsel asked, \u201cWhile you guys were driving up, did [Miller] make statements where [Windham] was?\u201d to which Griffin responded, \u201cNo. He just sat in the back.\u201d Counsel asked, \u201cDid he make any statements about [Windham] swimming or anything like that?\u201d Griffin responded, \u201cHuh-uh. I didn\u2019t hear him.\u201d Counsel asked, \u201cAnd you would have heard him if he had said something?\u201d Griffin responded, \u2018Yeah. Because we were all in the van together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b630 During closing argument, counsel emphasized this discrepancy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Now, [Youngman] testified that while in the van with Eva, with [Griffin], Eva\u2019s husband and other individuals that Max Miller made four or five different stories about what happened at the dam. Curiously, every other witness that the State called that was in that van, a room smaller than this jury box did not recall those statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">I submit to you that there is a happy meal being sold here, but it\u2019s by the Government. They are throwing whatever it takes up in the hopes that you will take something from there and convict my client of a crime he did not commit. I ask you to consider all that testimony and how it is so unlikely that that would be said and no one else would hear it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">I submit to you that it was completely fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b631 On the second issue, Miller claimed his trial counsel failed to challenge Youngman\u2019s testimony that Miller had given misdirection to the family when searching for Windham. Youngman testified that, during the search: \u201c[Miller], he hadn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t help us, he was standing on the hill just directly, you know, directing us where they was at and where ... Miller thought [Windham] was.\u201d Asked whether he thought Miller was telling him to change directions, Youngman replied, \u201cyeah, when we was going opposite of east, he, [Miller] told us that it was further down. So that\u2019s going down east more of the, of Giant Springs. And then where they found my dad, Lamar Windham, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that\u2019s where we almost found him. We was maybe like 30, I don\u2019t know, 20 feet away from his body. If we would have walked a little further we would have found [Windham].\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you walk further?\u201d Youngman replied, \u201cBecause [Miller] was hollering saying it was down, further down east more from the dam.\u201d \u00b632 However, counsel did challenge Youngman\u2019s testimony through his cross-examination of Griffin, obtaining her testimony that Miller had not yelled down at Youngman and the other family members. Counsel clarified, \u201cAnd [Miller] never was yelling down at [Youngman and other family members] down below?\u201d Griffin reiterated, \u201cNo, he was not.\u201d Further, counsel referenced the issue in closing argument, arguing that even though \u201cthe State wants to have you believe that Max Miller was directing them away from where the body was found,\u201d the evidence revealed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b633 We agree with the State that Miller\u2019s trial counsel impeached Youngman\u2019s testimony through cross-examination of Griffin and emphasized these discrepancies in closing argument. There is no merit to Miller\u2019s claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to impeach Youngman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">E. Prosecutor\u2019s Argument opposing Miller\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b634 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Miller\u2019s trial counsel moved to dismiss based on insufficient evidence, arguing that the State had not produced evidence showing Miller had committed a homicide. The State responded by recounting the evidence to the contrary, including the testimony of a forensic pathologist, Dr. Walter Kemp. The District Court denied Miller\u2019s motion, and Miller claims his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Kemp\u2019s testimony because Kemp had testified that Windham\u2019s manner of death was \u201cundetermined.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State responds that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not objectionable, and alternatively, even if objectionable, Miller suffered no prejudice because the denial of the motion was premised on more than just Dr. Kemp\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b635 The District Court cited the following evidence in denying Miller\u2019s motion: Miller was at the scene; was the last person to see Windham alive; had the opportunity to cause Windham\u2019s death; argued with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Windham immediately preceding Windham\u2019s death; after Windham\u2019s disappearance returned to the van sweating, nervous and in a hurry to leave the scene; did not report Windham\u2019s disappearance to law enforcement; gave differing accounts of what happened to Windham; gave an interview to law enforcement that was not honest, which could lead to an inference he was concealing Windham\u2019s death; and exhibited suspicious or erratic conduct after Windham\u2019s disappearance that could indicate consciousness of guilt. The District Court did not mention Kemp\u2019s testimony in denying Miller\u2019s motion, but merely referenced forensic evidence in a general manner: \u201cThen we get to the forensic evidence which is indeterminate alone, but due to the light most favorable with the State and when considered with other circumstantial evidence could reasonably be consistent with a criminal homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b636 We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Kemp\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial, and we need not address the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56. The claim is without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b637  Miller\u2019s claims against his trial counsel are without merit, and thus, he cannot state a claim of ineffectiveness against his appellate counsel for failing to raise ineffectiveness claims against his trial counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b638 Affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b299-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> The Office of the State Public Defender moved to vacate the order appointing counsel on the ground that appointment was premature under \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, because the court had not yet received and reviewed the State\u2019s response. The court subsequently vacated its order compelling the appointment of counsel and denied the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-12\"> A sidebar conference with the court was held at this juncture about proper use of prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> Kemp testified that Windham\u2019s death was caused by blunt force injuries to the head and neck. On cross-examination, Kemp testified that he viewed the manner of death to be \u201cundetermined.\u201d He testified that it was possible Windham\u2019s death was accidental, but he also testified that he could not rule out that the death was a suicide or homicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\"> Miller also claims his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to allegedly inflammatory remarks made in the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. Miller cites a case for authority, <em>U.S. v. Rusmisel, </em>716 F.2d 301 (5th Cir. 1983), but he has not advanced a cogent argument as required by \u00a7 46-21-104(2), MCA, see <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 33, and M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). <em>See DuBray, </em>\u00b6 26. Miller has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s trial objection would have been proper and that the court likely would have sustained the objection.\u201d <em>See Rogers, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Accordingly, Miller has not demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he suffered any prejudice therefrom. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. He also cites cases for the proposition that trial attorneys are ineffective for failing to request an instruction regarding lesser included offenses, but does not provide a supported argument. These claims fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\"> Although the District Court denied Miller\u2019s petition on procedural grounds, we conclude that it reached the right result, though for the wrong reason. <em>See State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
