Redding (Redding) asks this Court, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14, to exercise supervisory control over the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, and to conclude it was error for the District Court to grant partial summary judgment to Defendants Timothy Janiak; Anderson ZurMuehlen &amp; Co., P.C.; Ray E. Petersen; and Rick Ahmann (collectively \u201cAZ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b62 For the purposes of this Opinion, the facts are not materially disputed. Redding is a 76 year old widow<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with a high school education. Redding worked the majority of her adult life on family ranches. In 2004, Redding sold her ranch for approximately 3.3 million dollars. Seeking to avoid tax liability on the sale, and provide income for life for herself and her son, Redding sought advice from her accountant, Timothy Janiak (Janiak).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u00b63 Janiak, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), had been Redding\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>accountant for approximately 20 years and was a shareholder at the accounting firm Anderson ZurMuehlen &amp; Co. (\u201cAnderson\u201d). Janiak assisted Redding in the sale of her ranch, and Redding sought his advice to invest the proceeds of the sale. To help Redding achieve her financial goals, Janiak steered Redding to a company called Anderson ZurMuehlen Real Estate and Business Brokerage, LLC, d/b/a Acquiron.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b64 Acquiron was a subsidiary of Anderson, formed with Rick Ahmann (Ahmann), a real estate broker. Ray E. Petersen (Petersen), a CPA and former shareholder at Anderson, was Anderson\u2019s representative in Acquiron. Acquiron sold Tenants-In-Common investments (TICs) to clients of Anderson. A TIC investment is, generally speaking, a joint investment in real property, in this case commercial property, where each owner owns an undivided share of the property. The TICs involved in Redding\u2019s case were initially owned by DBSI Housing, Inc. (DBSI) or one of its hundreds of affiliates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alm\">\u00b65 DBSI would acquire title to real property then sell the same property in shares to a number of investors. DBSI would then require the new owners to execute several agreements, including a lease agreement with DBSI in which the owners leased the property back to DBSI as \u201cmaster tenant,\u201d and a TIC agreement with the other owners. The owners also assumed a pro rata share of the debt DBSI incurred in acquiring the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b66 DBSI, as \u201cmaster tenant,\u201d would then lease the properties to commercial tenants, acting as a property manager for the owners. DBSI would pay the expenses of operating each property. According to the \u201cNNN Plus Lease\u201d summary provided by DBSI to potential investors, Redding and the other owners did not have to invest \u201cthe personal time and effort involved in operating the property and in dealing with multiple tenants.\u201d Rather, as DBSI advertized, \u201cthe management responsibilities of the TICs will simply consist of dealing with the NNN PLUS Lessee and receiving and depositing a monthly lease payment from the Lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b67 In return for the owners\u2019 investment, DBSI promised a 6% - 7% per year rate of return on each owner\u2019s investment, with annual increases of approximately 3%. These promised returns were from the lease payments DBSI collected on the properties. DBSI would keep any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>profits above the promised rate of return to investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b68 Ultimately, Redding purchased four DBSI TICs via 1031 exchanges in 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1031 exchanges allowed Redding to avoid tax liability on the sale of her ranch, and, in theory, the newly purchased properties would provide the income she sought. Redding\u2019s purchases were brokered by Acquiron. Using the proceeds of the ranch sale and other assets, Redding paid approximately $4.6 million for the properties, which includes approximately $2.2 million cash and $2.4 million of assumed debt on the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b69 DBSI\u2019s scheme collapsed and it stopped making payments to investors in 2008, and filed for bankruptcy. In response to petitions from the states of Idaho and Montana, the bankruptcy court appointed an examiner to investigate the finances of DBSI and its various affiliates. The examiner found that DBSI was running a Ponzi scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b610 In a related complaint brought by the bankruptcy trustee against DBSI\u2019s Idaho attorneys, the trustee alleged that, \u201c[i]n November 2008 ... [t]ens of thousands of [DBSI] investors learned that they had lost everything. The docket of the Bankruptcy Court is crowded with letters from individual investors telling of lost savings accumulated in some cases through the efforts of generations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b611 After the colossal collapse of DBSI, Redding sued AZ in 2009<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging: (1) unlawful sale of securities; (2) negligence; (3) negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>misrepresentation; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) breach of contract; and (6) tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Redding sought damages in the amount of $4,635,485.51, plus additional amounts for punitive damages, emotional distress, loss of established course of life, and consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b612 Redding moved for summary judgment on several issues, however the only issue relevant here is \u201c[w]hether or not the DBSI TICs sold to [Redding] are securities under the Securities Act of Montana[.]\u201d AZ also moved for summary judgment on the same issue. After briefing, the District Court found the DBSI TICs were not securities under Montana law. In an August 9, 2011, order, the District Court found that \u201cRedding did not engage in a common enterprise,\u201d an essential element of an investment contract (i.e. a security), because she \u201cdid not share the risks of the investment with other investors because she agreed upon a contractually set return on her investment.\u201d The District Court stated the \u201ckeystone\u201d of a common enterprise is \u201crisk and fluctuation with the return on the investment.\u201d Because Redding \u201cwanted \u2018zero risk[,]\u2019 \u201d the District Court found the TICs were not securities under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b613 On September 23, 2011, Redding filed her Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control (\u201cPetition\u201d). AZ moved to stay the proceedings in District Court, pending the outcome of Redding\u2019s Petition. The District Court granted AZ\u2019s motion over Redding\u2019s objection. Redding\u2019s Petition presents one issue, we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in holding that the TICs at issue are not securities under the Securities Act of Montana?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b615 Before reaching the merits of Redding\u2019s Petition, we must determine whether the exercise of supervisory control is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">A. Is Supervisory Control Appropriate?</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\u00b616  By virtue of Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution, this Court has \u201cgeneral supervisory control over all other courts.\u201d Stores <em>v. Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court, </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 5,. 361 Mont. 279, 259 P.3d 754. Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for extraordinary circumstances. <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5. We consider the propriety of supervisory control on a case-by-case basis. <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">\u00b617 Rule 14(3) of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure governs petitions for writs of supervisory control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">The supreme court has supervisory control over all other courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>and may, on a case-by-case basis, supervise another court by way of a writ of supervisory control. Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy and is sometimes justified when urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when one or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">(a) The other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">(b) Constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">(c) The other court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b618 \u201cThis Court will assume supervisory control of a district court to direct the course of litigation where the district court is proceeding based upon a mistake of law, which if uncorrected, would cause significant injustice for which an appeal is an inadequate remedy. <em>Truman v. Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court, </em>2003 MT 91, \u00b6 13, 315 Mont. 165, 68 P.3d 654. Judicial economy and inevitable procedural entanglements are appropriate reasons to exercise supervisory control where a mistake of law will affect virtually all aspects of the case: the costs, the course of discovery, settlement negotiations, and the trial itself. <em>Truman, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 6. In such cases, any verdict rendered would be \u201cquestionable\u201d and would inevitably lead to further costs and litigation. <em>Truman, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b619 Redding argues that supervisory control is appropriate because the District Court\u2019s order is a clear mistake of law, and is in direct conflict with the precedent of the United States Supreme Court and the opinions of the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (formerly known as National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)). If allowed to stand, Redding argues the ruling will create an \u201cenvironment ripe for securities fraud\u201d in Montana, and supervisory control is required to prevent significant injustice to Redding and all citizens of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">\u00b620 AZ appeared for the District Court, and argues that supervisory control is inappropriate because the appeal process is an adequate remedy. At oral argument, AZ also argued that exercising supervisory control in this case will \u201copen the floodgates\u201d of interlocutory appeals and lead to the granting of innumerable petitions for writs of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u00b621 We first address AZ\u2019s \u201cfloodgate\u201d argument. AZ is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>incorrect, as this Court\u2019s publicly available statistics show.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 2011,58 petitions for writs of supervisory control were filed; 7 were granted. The highest number of granted petitions for writs of supervisory control in recent years was 12 out of 50 in 2009. The lowest number (in the publicly available statistics) was 1 out of 33 in 2006. The floodgates have simply not opened. This argument is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b622 On the merits of Redding\u2019s petition, we find that exercising supervisory control is appropriate in this case. There appear to be no facts in dispute that are material to the contested legal issue-whether the TICs constitute securities under Montana law. Like <em>Truman, Stokes, </em>and other cases in which we have exercised supervisory control, this is an issue of law that drives how the case proceeds through trial. Resolution of the issue will avoid the \u201ccosts and delay associated with the full re-trial almost certain to result if the district court\u2019s interpretation of the statute is set aside.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 8. If incorrect, the District Court\u2019s ruling would deny Redding, and others similarly situated,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the protections of the Securities Act of Montana. Redding\u2019s cause of action for unlawful sale of securities would be forfeited, along with the specific remedies that accompany such a claim, including rescission and damages allowable under the Act. This in turn would affect all aspects of Redding\u2019s remaining case. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling would cause a significant injustice for which an appeal is an inadequate remedy, and that justice requires this Court to exercise supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">B. Did the District Court err in holding that the TICs at issue are not securities under the Securities Act of Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b623 The Securities Act of Montana, \u00a7 30-10-101, MCA, et. seq. (the Act), regulates the sale of securities to the citizens of Montana. A primary goal of the Act is to \u201cprotect the investor, persons engaged in securities transactions, and the public interest[.]\u201d Section 30-10-102(1), MCA. The Act is heavily based on its federal counterparts, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>fundamental purpose of those acts is \u201cto eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market.\u201d <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b624 The Act defines \u201csecurity\u201d quite broadly. Section 30-10-103(22), MCA; <em>State v. Duncan, </em>181 Mont. 382, 393, 593 P.2d 1026, 1033 (1979). Such a broad definition is in harmony with federal securities law, which recognizes \u201cthe virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity, especially in the creation of\u2018countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits[.]\u2019 <em>\u201d Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>494 U.S. 56, 60-61 (1990). Congress \u201cdetermined that the best way to achieve its goal of protecting investors was to define the term \u2018security\u2019 in sufficiently broad and general terms so as to ... encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.\u201d <em>Reves, </em>494 U.S. at 61 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b625  Under the Act, securities include \u201cinvestment contracts].\u201d Section 30-10-103(22)(xii), MCA. Under Montana law, an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d is \u201c \u2018an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 392-93, 593 P.2d at 1032-33 (quoting <em>Forman, </em>421 U.S. at 852). In order to be considered an investment contract (and thereby a security) under the Act, the following elements must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">1) an investment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">2) in a common venture;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">3) with reasonable expectation of profits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">4) derived through the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\"><em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 392, 593 P.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b626 Only two elements are at issue in this case-common venture and entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The parties do not dispute that Redding has satisfied both the investment and reasonable expectation of profits elements. We address each of the disputed elements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">1. Common Venture</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u00b627 Commonality can be established several ways. Some courts use the horizontal commonality approach, while others use a form of vertical commonality. The federal circuit courts are currently split on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>which form of commonality is the best approach. We will discuss each below.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b628 Horizontal commonality focuses on the relationship between the investors. It is \u201cthe \u2018pooling\u2019 of investors\u2019 funds as a result of which the individual investors share all the risks and benefits of the business enterprise.\u201d <em>SEC v. ETS Payphones, Inc., </em>300 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir. 2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, SEC v. Edwards, </em>540 U.S. 389 (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Third Circuit describes horizontal commonality as \u201cpooling of investors\u2019 contributions and distribution of profits and losses on a pro-rata basis among investors.\u201d <em>SEC v. Infinity Group Co., </em>212 F.3d 180, 188 (3rd Cir. 2000). The First Circuit has \u201cendorsed\u201d the suggestion that \u201cPonzi schemes typically satisfy the horizontal commonality standard.\u201d <em>SEC v. SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d 42, 51 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b629 Vertical commonality focuses on the relationship between the investor and the promoter of the investment. It takes two forms-either broad or narrow. Broad vertical commonality requires \u201cthat the investors are dependent upon the expertise or efforts of the investment promoter for their returns.\u201d <em>ETS Payphones, </em>300 F.3d at 1284. Narrow vertical commonality, as adopted by the Ninth Circuit, requires that \u201cthe fortunes of investors are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or third parties.\u201d <em>Hector v. Wiens, </em>533 F.2d 429, 433 (9th Cir. 1976). Under narrow vertical commonality, \u201cwhere an investor\u2019s avoidance of loss depends on the promoter\u2019s \u2018sound management and continued solvency,\u2019 a common enterprise exists.\u201d <em>SEC v. Eurobond Exchange, Ltd., </em>13 F.3d 1334, 1340 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b630 The United States Supreme Court has not settled this split amongst the circuits. <em>See Mordaunt v. Incomco, </em>469 U.S. 1115 (1985) (Burger, C.J., and White and Brennan, J.J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); <em>SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d at 49 (discussing the \u201cdisarray as to the legal rules associated with the ascertainment of a common enterprise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b631 Montana has not expressly adopted any of these tests for common venture. We have found that when income to the investors depends upon the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d selling a final product, a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>venture exists. <em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 391, 593 P.2d at 1032. In other words, the common venture element is met when return on an investment is dependent on the efforts of the \u201centerprise\u201d to generate it. <em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 391, 593 P.2d at 1032. This appears to be broad vertical commonality.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b632 This case requires us to adopt a method for determining what fulfills the common venture requirement. In doing so, we keep in mind that one of the foremost purposes of the Act is to protect the investing public. <em>See Knowles v. State ex rel. Lindeen, </em>2009 MT 415, \u00b6 1, 353 Mont. 507, 222 P.3d 595. We also keep in mind the remedial purposes behind the Act, which require the Act to be broadly construed to effectuate its purpose. <em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 393, 593 P.3d at 1033. Finally, we again note the need for flexibility to address \u201cthe virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity\u201d to devise ever more complex schemes of using others\u2019 money on the promise, many times an illusory one, of profits. <em>Reves, </em>494 U.S. at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b633  With these premises in mind, we conclude that for the purposes of the Act, a common venture can be established by satisfying the elements of any of the above discussed methods - either horizontal, broad vertical, or narrow vertical commonality. This approach best satisfies the purposes of the Act and will allow for flexibility to address any manner of new-fangled schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b634 We now turn to the District Court\u2019s finding that no common venture existed \u201cbetween Redding and DBSI.\u201d It found that \u201c[examining the three different methods of common enterprise [horizontal, and broad and narrow vertical commonality] reveals that the keystone is for risk and fluctuation with the return on the investment.\u201d Because Redding \u201cdid not share the risks of the investment with other investors because she agreed upon a contractually set return on her investment[,]\u201d the District Court found horizontal commonality was not met. Vertical commonality was not met because the District Court found \u201cRedding was set to collect a contractually agreed upon return whether it was a month in which DBSI collected an abundance of rent or a month with very little rent.\u201d In sum, because DBSI promised Redding a certain amount of income, no common venture existed, and therefore the TICs could not be securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b635  The District Court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding common venture are in conflict with United States Supreme Court precedent and simply incorrect. In <em>Edwards, </em>the United States Supreme Court was tasked with deciding \u201cwhether a moneymaking scheme is excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>from the term \u2018investment contract\u2019 simply because the scheme offered a contractual entitlement to a fixed, rather than variable, return.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>540 U.S. at 391. The Court unanimously held that \u201can investment scheme promising a fixed rate of return can be an \u2018investment contract\u2019 and thus a \u2018security\u2019 subject to federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>540 U.S. at 397. Any other holding would allow \u201cunscrupulous marketers of investments [to] evade the securities laws by picking a rate of return to promise.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>540 U.S. at 394-95. The Court also noted that \u201cinvestments pitched as low-risk (such as those offering a \u2018guaranteed\u2019 fixed return) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud, including older and less sophisticated investors.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>540 U.S. at 394. The District Court\u2019s reliance on a promised rate of return as dispositive of common venture (and thus dispositive of security) was error and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b636  Contrary to the District Court\u2019s analysis, the \u201ckeystone\u201d regarding common venture is not \u201crisk and fluctuation with the return on the investment.\u201d It is the relationship between either the investors themselves (horizontal commonality) or the investors and the promoter or third parties (vertical commonality) that is crucial. For horizontal commonality, a court must consider whether (1) the investors\u2019 assets were \u201cpooled,\u201d and (2) whether the investors shared in the profits and losses of the enterprise on a pro-rata basis (i.e. proportionate to each investor\u2019s contribution). <em>SG, Inc., </em>265 F.3d at 50-51; <em>Infinity Group, </em>212 F.3d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b637  For broad vertical commonality, a court must consider whether the investors\u2019 profits (the return on investment)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are dependent upon the expertise or efforts of the promoter. <em>ETS Payphones, </em>300 F.3d at 1284. The thrust of this test is \u201cthat the investors have no desire to perform the chores necessary for a return!,]\u201d but rather depend upon the efficacy of the promoter for the return on the investment. <em>SEC v. Unique Financial Concepts, Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1195, 1199-1200 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b638  Finally, for narrow vertical commonality, a court must consider whether the investors\u2019 fortunes are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts <em>and success </em>of the promoter or a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>party. <em>Brodt v. Bache &amp; Co., </em>595 F.2d 459, 460 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 476, 482 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1973) (emphasis added). Here, more is required than just a link between investor profits and the <em>efforts </em>of the promoter. Narrow vertical commonality requires the success or failure of the investor to be linked to the success or failure of the promoter-\u2018there is no common enterprise unless there is some direct relation between the success or failure of the promoter and that of his investors.\u201d <em>Mordaunt v. Incomco, </em>686 F.2d 815 (9th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1115 (1985). Neither vertical commonality approach requires pooling of investor funds or sharing of profits and losses on a pro-rata basis. <em>Unique Financial Concepts, </em>196 F.3d at 1199 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b639 Turning to the present case, we conclude DBSI\u2019s TIC investment scheme was a common venture under any measure. We first analyze horizontal commonality, and find that both elements are present. There is no question here that investor funds were pooled. The resources of several investors, including Redding, were pooled to purchase a given property, and each investor owned a certain percentage of the property based upon the amount invested. There is also no question that the investors each shared in the profits and losses according to their contribution to the investment. If the investment made money, each investor received a rate of return (6% or 7% per year, plus an annual 3% increase) on their pro-rata share of the investment. Likewise, each investor stood to lose some or all of their pro-rata share of the investment should the venture fail. The fact that Redding was promised a certain percentage return and still owns her interest in some of the properties does not mean she stood to lose nothing. To conclude otherwise ignores the reality of what Redding and others who invested with DBSI face-some or all of their investments are now essentially worthless. These two things-the pooling of assets and the pro-rata sharing of profit or loss-are all that is required for horizontal commonality. <em>SG, Inc., </em>265 F.3d at 50-51; <em>Infinity Group, </em>212 F.3d at 188-89. DBSI\u2019s scheme meets both, thus there was a common venture. Additionally, we note that because DBSI was allegedly a Ponzi scheme, that alone may also satisfy horizontal commonality. <em>SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b640 We next analyze broad vertical commonality. Again, there is no question that investors\u2019 returns were dependent upon the expertise or efforts of DBSI. It is clear from the lease agreement that DBSI was to do all the \u201cchores necessary for a return.\u201d <em>Unique Financial Concepts, </em>196 F.3d at 1199-1200. Redding simply purchased her shares in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>property, and indeed was <em>required </em>to lease the property back to DBSI as \u201cmaster tenant\u201d and property manager. She did not invest \u201cthe personal time and effort involved in operating the property and in dealing with multiple tenants.\u201d Redding and the other investors had no responsibility to generate any profit; that was DBSI\u2019s job as \u201cmaster tenant.\u201d The investors gave DBSI money, and in return it was DBSI that promised to generate profit. It was up to DBSI to secure tenants for the property, and it was the rent generated from these tenants that provided the return to Redding and other investors. Without DBSI\u2019s effort and expertise renting and managing the property, the investors would get no return. Thus, broad vertical commonality is satisfied. \u00b641 Finally, we analyze narrow vertical commonality. For essentially the same reasons broad vertical commonality exists, narrow vertical commonality also exists.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is obvious that there is a direct relation between the success or failure of DBSI and the success or failure of Redding and the other investors. If DBSI did not rent and manage the property successfully, the investment would fail - the investors\u2019 avoidance of loss was dependent on DBSI\u2019s sound management and continued solvency. AZ acknowledges as much, stating \u201calmost every lessee such as Redding is reliant upon the commercial lessor\u2019s [DBSI\u2019s] ability to manage the property.\u201d While AZ is correct that this alone does not make the TICs in question securities, it does satisfy narrow vertical commonality.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b642  We conclude that the TICs in question were common ventures under any commonality analysis. Therefore, we proceed to analyze the fourth prong of the <em>Duncan </em>test - the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">2. Entrepreneurial or Managerial Efforts of Others</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b643 <em>Duncan </em>requires that the profits expected in prong 3 of the test be \u201cderived through the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 392, 593 P.2d at 1032. This differs from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Howey </em>test, where the profits were to derive \u201csolely from the efforts of the promoter or third party.\u201d <em>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946). Montana has not required rigid conformity with the \u201csolely\u201d requirement. Indeed, \u201csolely\u201d was purposefully left out of our test. <em>Duncan, </em>181 Mont. at 392, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>593 P.2d at 1032 (discussing criticism of the requirement and the language used by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Forman </em>which \u201ceffectively deletes the strict \u2018solely\u2019 requirement from the test.\u201d). The Circuit Courts of Appeal have also declined to \u201cgive literal meaning to the word \u2018solely\u2019 in this context[.]\u201d <em>SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d at 55. Therefore, the requirement that profits be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others is generally satisfied so long as \u201c \u2018the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d at 55 (quoting <em>Turner Enterprises, </em>474 F.2d at 482.).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b644 Before we analyze this element, it must be noted that the TICs in question in Redding\u2019s case are \u201caffiliate TICs\u201d meaning that the investors purchased the property from DBSI and leased it back to DBSI, or a DBSI affiliate, who served as the \u201cmaster tenant.\u201d These differ from \u201cnon-affiliate TICs\u201d where investors purchase the property from a promoter then contract with a property or asset manager who is not the promoter, nor an affiliate of the promoter to operate the investment. In a non-affiliate TIC investment, the promoter\u2019s role ends upon the completion of the purchase. The \u201cefforts of others\u201d analysis for non-affiliate TICs may differ from the analysis here. <em>See </em>David Rich, Student Author, <em>Betting the Farm: The TIC Turf War and Why TICs Constitute Investment Contracts Under Federal Securities Laws, </em>1 Wm. &amp; Mary Bus. L. Rev. 451 (2010). Circuit Courts of Appeal have looked to both pre-purchase efforts (of the promoter) and post-purchase efforts (of the third party property or asset manager) to satisfy this prong of the <em>Howey </em>test, reaching differing conclusions. <em>See SEC v. Life Partners, Inc., 87 </em>F.3d 536 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (pre-purchase efforts alone will not suffice; absent substantial post-purchase efforts by promoter or a third party, this prong is not met), <em>compare with SEC v. Mutual Benefits Corp., </em>408 F.3d 737 (11th Cir. 2005) (efforts of others may be satisfied by pre- or post-purchase efforts of the promoter or third party). Because DBSI was both the promoter and the property manager, we need not engage in this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b645 The focus in this case is on the amount of control retained by Redding and the other investors and whether or not that control was illusory. Not surprisingly, the Circuit Courts of Appeal are split on this issue. The Eleventh and Fifth Circuits look to the written agreements between the parties. <em>Albanese v. Florida National Bank of Orlando, </em>823 F.2d 408 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404 (5th Cir. 1981). The Eleventh Circuit has found \u201cthe crucial inquiry is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>amount of control that the investors retain under their written agreements.\u201d <em>Albanese, </em>823 F.2d at 410 (citing <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 423-24.). \u201cIf the investor retains the ability to control the profitability of his investment, the agreement is no security. <em>\"Albanese, </em>823 F.2d at 410. However, even if the written agreement offers substantial control to the investor, if that control is illusory, the \u201cefforts of others\u201d element can still be met. <em>Albanese, </em>823 F.2d at 412. \u00b646 In contrast, the Second Circuit looks to the \u201creality of the parties\u2019 positions\u201d and evaluates \u201cwhether \u2018the reasonable expectation was one of significant investor control.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>529 F.3d 83, 85 (2d Cir. 2008). If there is a reasonable expectation of significant investor control, the protection of securities laws is not needed. <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 88. It is for the \u201cpassive investor\u201d that the securities laws were enacted. <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 88; <em>SEC v. Aqua-Sonic Products Corp., 687 </em>F.2d 577, 585 (2d Cir. 1982). Thus, despite what the written agreements say on their face, if the promoter sought out and expected passive investors, this element may be met. <em>Aqua-Sonic, 687 </em>F.2d at 584. Under this approach, \u201c \u2018[w]hat matters more than the form of an investment scheme is the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d that it represents. The question is whether an investor, as a result of the investment agreement itself <em>or the factual circumstances that surround it, </em>is left unable to exercise meaningful control over his investment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 90 <em>(quoting Robinson v. Glynn, </em>349 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir. 2003)) (emphasis in <em>Leonard).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b647 The District Court did not make any findings on this issue because it concluded \u201cDBSI providing essential managerial efforts is irrelevant because Redding did not invest in a common enterprise.\u201d However, the issue was briefed by the parties. Redding argued that this element was met. AZ argued that Redding could not meet this element because Redding retained the rights to (1) \u201cterminate DBSI as the master tenant;\u201d (2) \u201csell the property;\u201d (3) re-enter \u201cthe leased premises for the purpose of making inspections, repairs, alterations or additions as the Tenant in Common group might deem necessary;\u201d and (4) a \u201clien against DBSI for rent damages or other payments.\u201d Further, AZ argued that Redding was expected to \u201cengage in conference calls, sign documentation and participate in assessing DBSI\u2019s performance as the Master Tenant.\u201d AZ argued that Redding exercised this control by participating in at least one conference call, and more importantly, terminating DBSI as \u201cmaster tenant\u201d on two properties. Finally, AZ argued that Redding did not look to DBSI to produce profits, but rather to the property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u00b648 We are not persuaded by AZ\u2019s arguments. We agree with the reasoning of the Second and Fourth Circuits, and we will look to the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d of the situation and the investor\u2019s ability to <em>meaningfully </em>control the investment. Leonard, 529 F.3d at 89-90; <em>Robinson, </em>349 F.3d at 170. We will not confine this inquiry to a review of the organizational documents alone, but rather inquire into the amount of actual control the investor was expected to exercise <em>in reality. Leonard, </em>529 F.3d 89-90. This approach best serves the purposes of the Act, and will allow for the flexibility required to adapt to the ever evolving schemes \u201cdevised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\u201d <em>Howey, </em>328 U.S. at 299. Again, the question is \u201c \u2018whether [the] investor, as a result of the investment agreement itself <em>or the factual circumstances that surround it, </em>is left unable to exercise meaningful control over his [or her] investment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 90 (quoting <em>Robinson, </em>349 F.3d at 170) (emphasis in <em>Leonard).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b649 In Redding\u2019s case, we conclude that in reality DBSI sought out passive investors and that Redding, regardless of the rights she retained in the written agreements, was not expected to exercise any meaningful control over her investment, nor did she expect to exercise meaningful control over her investment. Indeed, AZ acknowledges that \u201cRedding did not want to directly manage the day to day affairs of any property she would purchase.\u201d Nothing better illustrates Redding\u2019s lack of managerial control than the \u201cNNN Plus Lease\u201d summary, declaring that Redding and the other owners did not have to invest \u201cthe personal time and effort involved in operating the property and in dealing with multiple tenants.\u201d Rather, as DBSI advertized, \u201cthe management responsibilities of the TICs will simply consist of dealing with the NNN PLUS Lessee and receiving and depositing a monthly lease payment from the Lessee.\u201d Additionally, that Redding played no role in \u201cshaping the organizational agreements\u201d casts doubt as to whether she was expected to have significant control over the enterprise. <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 90. Moreover, the parties do not dispute that, other than her ranch, Redding had no experience in owning and managing commercial properties. AZ does not point to any facts in the record that would suggest Redding\u2019s practical ability to take over and manage four large commercial properties. <em>Leonard, </em>529 F.3d at 90. And while Redding and the other investors terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>DBSI as \u201cmaster tenant\u201d on two of the properties,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it can hardly be said that the investors were <em>expected </em>to do so. The expectations were just the opposite-DBSI was to directly manage the day to day affairs of the property for Redding. That was the entire point of the written agreements between Redding and DBSI. Terminating DBSI once it was in default is not meaningful control of the property or the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b650 Even were we to accept AZ\u2019s argument that Redding had the ability to control her investment via certain rights retained under the written agreements, a review of the documents themselves shows that any control Redding was granted under the documents was not meaningful, but was illusory. AZ makes much of the fact that Redding could terminate DBSI as \u201cmaster tenant.\u201d However, the process to terminate DBSI was nearly impossible. Redding alone could not terminate DBSI. A majority vote of all the owners was required. Then, termination was \u201ceffective only when\u201d DBSI was relieved from all obligations to the property and \u201cindemnified by a majority in percentage ownership ... against any and all claims, actions, costs, damages, liabilities, deficiencies or expenses\u201d relating to the property. Additionally, to sell the property or hire a new property manager, a unanimous vote of all the owners was required. A TIC can have as many as 35 owners,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> none necessarily residing in the same geographic area, and any one owner could thwart the others\u2019 attempt to sell the property or hire a new property manager. This does not demonstrate that Redding had meaningful control over her investment. As for the right of re-entry and the right to a lien against DBSI, these rights do not evidence a meaningful right to control the profitability of her investment, nor does signing documents and participating in one conference call.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b651  We conclude that the efforts made by DBSI are the undeniably significant ones-the essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise. <em>SG, Ltd., </em>265 F.3d at 55. The written documents themselves indicate that Redding was not expected to exercise any meaningful control over her investment, nor did AZ present evidence that she expected to exercise meaningful control over her investment. Because DBSI\u2019s efforts were the significant ones, Redding was dependent on DBSI\u2019s entrepreneurial and managerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>efforts to generate profit. The final element of the <em>Duncan </em>test is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">3. Were the TICs Securities in 2004?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b652 Finally, we address AZ\u2019s argument that the TICs were not securities in 2004. AZ argues repeatedly that a security \u201cexists at the time it is sold or not at all,\u201d hence because the TICs were not securities in 2004, they cannot be securities now. To support this argument, AZ states that \u201cguidance from the IRS [Rev. Proc. 2002-22, 2002-1 C.B. 733] showed that these properties were not securities and there was no guidance from the SEC on the subject[.]\u201d AZ, however, has not shown that in 2004 the IRS, or anyone else, believed that TICs were <em>not </em>securities. Rev. Proc. 2002-22 simply provides guidance for TIC sponsors and owners to avoid having TICs classified as partnerships. It does not say TICs are not securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b653 In fact, materials which AZ submitted in its Table of Appendices on appeal and upon which AZ relied for its contention that the TICs here were not securities in 2004, actually establish that these TICs <em>would have been considered securities in 2004, </em>under the circumstances presented here. The September 2004 Moffat Thomas opinion letter directed to FOR 1031LLC (a DBSI affiliate), addressing the question of whether a TIC constituted a security under federal law as of 2004, was submitted to the District Court by AZ when it moved for summary judgment. The letter exhaustively analyzes the case law as of 2004 on the security question. Repeatedly, the opinion letter states that as long as the investor in question is experienced and knowledgeable in owning and operating developed income-producing property-and certain other factors are met-it can be assumed that the TICs are not securities. Summarizing <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>the opinion letter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">[T]he [Williamson] court concluded the venture would not involve a security <em>unless </em>the plaintiffs could show that... (2) the partner or venturer is so inexperienced or unknowledgeable in business affairs that he or she is incapable of intelligently exercising his or her partnership or venture powers; or (3) the partner or venturer is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or management ability of the promoter or manager that he or she cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership or venture powers.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b654 It is undisputed that Redding had no experience in or knowledge concerning the operation of developed income-producing property. Further, she had no meaningful partnership powers, as we explain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 49-51. Therefore, under the language lifted from AZ\u2019s tendered authority, it is clear that as of 2004, these circumstances would have compelled a finding that this transaction qualified as a security transaction. Further buttressing this conclusion is one of AZ\u2019s own experts, who was employed by \u201ca major TIC sponsor who sold TICs as a security\u201d in May of 2004, several months prior to the time Redding purchased her TICs. Given these facts, we do not accept AZ\u2019s argument that the TICs were not securities in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b655  Our holding that the TICs are securities is based on the documents Redding reviewed and executed in 2004, the contents of which have not changed, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions. The TICs Redding purchased were securities in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b656 Based on the tests and principles of law discussed above, the TICs here are securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b657 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Redding\u2019s Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b658 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s August 9, 2011, Order granting partial summary judgment to AZ is REVERSED.
