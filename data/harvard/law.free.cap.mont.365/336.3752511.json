We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">\u00b62 This case concerns whether Robison is allowed to claim a deduction on his Montana income taxes for certain mileage as a business travel expense. The facts that follow are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">\u00b63 Robison resides in Billings, Montana. He was employed by Unit Drilling Company (Unit) as a rig hand on oil rigs in the Big Piney/Pinedale area of western Wyoming. When Robison began working in the Big Piney/Pinedale area in 2005, he did not know how long his employment there would last-for example, 1 week, or 5 years, or longer. Robison also did not know that his employment there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>be for a specific limited duration; for example, he did not know at the outset that his employment there would terminate in 8 months. Robison said \u201cOil rigs are designed to move. That\u2019s the principle that allows us to do what we do. We rig up on a location. Once our hole is drilled, we have to move to the next one. No telling where that will be.\u201d Robison also stated that Billings is a good place to live because it is central to several oil fields. As STAB found, it is \u201cuncontroverted\u201d that Robison \u201cnever knew how long he would be employed at any one site.\u201d In reality, Robison was employed in the same Big Piney/Pinedale area for over 3 years, from March of 2005 to early October of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b64 While so employed, Robison worked a 7-day-on, 7-day-off schedule. As his mileage logs reflect, he would drive his personal vehicle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from his residence in Billings to a camp (provided and maintained by Unit for its workers) in the Big Piney/Pinedale area. Then, during the 7 days he worked, he would drive from the camp to an oil rig (or rigs) and back, until finally, at the end of the 7-day-on schedule, Robison would drive from the rig location back to his residence in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b65 Robison claimed this mileage as a business travel expense during tax years 2005-2008, and deducted it accordingly. In total, Robison claimed $78,812 in business travel expenses for the 2005-2008 tax years. Robison was audited by the DOR in 2009 after \u201creporting significant amounts of unreimbursed employee business expenses claimed for extended periods.\u201d The audit determined that Robison\u2019s employment was indefinite, making his \u201ctax home\u201d the Big Piney/Pinedale area of Wyoming; thus, the claimed business expenses were actually personal commuting expenses and therefore disallowed. DOR determined additional tax liability for the 2005-2008 tax years of approximately $7,000, including penalties and interest. It appears that interest continues to accrue on the balance the DOR claims is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b66 Robison requested informal review by the DOR. The Field Unit Audit Manager determined the initial audit was correct. Robison then appealed to the DOR\u2019s Office of Dispute Resolution (ODR). After a full evidentiary hearing, the ODR hearing examiner issued a lengthy and well-reasoned order affirming the audit determination. The hearing examiner found Robison\u2019s employment in Wyoming was indefinite, not temporary. Because Robison\u2019s employment was indefinite, his \u201ctax home\u201d for purposes of the business travel expense deduction was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Big Piney/Pinedale area of Wyoming, not Billings, Montana, his place of residence. Therefore, none of the $78,812 claimed was allowed as a business travel expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b67 Robison then appealed to STAB. The STAB appeal was confined to the ODR\u2019s order, transcript, and exhibits. After review, STAB reversed the decision of the ODR and found Robison\u2019s employment was temporary, that his \u201ctax home\u201d was in Billings, and that all his business travel expenses were allowable deductions. To reach this conclusion, STAB found that Robison\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d was Billings (based upon its reading of <em>Coombs v. Commissioner, </em>608 F.2d 1269, 1275 (9th Cir. 1979)), and that Robison \u201cwas not located in Wyoming for over a year, but actually made numerous seven-day temporary business trips to Wyoming.\u201d STAB also separately determined that \u201c[bjecause the law is unclear, and can be subject to multiple interpretations,\u201d even if the deductions were not allowed, the \u201ccase is not an appropriate one for the imposition of penalties and interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b68 The DOR then filed a petition for judicial review in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. After briefing by the parties, the District Court reversed STAB\u2019s determination and reinstated the decision of the ODR hearing examiner. It found that STAB \u201cmisapprehended the effect of [the] evidence and misapplied pertinent case law\u201d in determining that Robison\u2019s employment was temporary and that his \u201ctax home\u201d was in Billings, Montana. The District Court also found STAB erred as a matter of law when it suggested, in a footnote, that if Robison\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d was in Wyoming, Montana could not impose state income tax on him, and when it found that DOR should not impose penalties and interest upon Robison.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b69 Robison then obtained appellate counsel and filed the present, timely appeal. Robison appeals only the \u201cdeductibility of certain business-related travel, lodging, and meal expenses[.]\u201d He does not appeal the District Court\u2019s determination that STAB erred in suggesting Montana could not impose income tax on him, nor does he appeal imposition of penalties and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b610 A district court reviews a STAB decision to determine whether STAB\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether STAB correctly interpreted the law. <em>Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. State, </em>2011 MT 141, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 39, 255 P.3d 171. A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trier of fact misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>record leaves the reviewing court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Micone v. Department of Public Health and Human Services, </em>2011 MT 178, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 258, 258 P.3d 403. We apply the same standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing STAB\u2019s decision. <em>Puget Sound, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>O\u2019Neill v. Department of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, 49 P.3d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b611 Before we discuss the issues in this case, we begin by laying out the legal framework we must consider in a case such as Robison\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">\u00b612  Tax deductions are a matter of legislative grace and it is the taxpayer\u2019s burden to clearly demonstrate the right to the claimed deduction. <em>INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); <em>Baitis v. Department of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 17, \u00b6 28, 319 Mont. 292, 83 P.3d 1278; <em>GBN, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, </em>249 Mont. 261, 266, 815 P.2d 595, 597 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b613 Under Montana law, in computing net income,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deductions are generally those permitted by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 161 and 211. Section 15-30-2131(l)(a), MCA. A deduction is generally allowed for all ordinary and necessary business expenses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Montana has specifically adopted this provision of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>Magnuson v. Montana State Board of Equalization, </em>162 Mont. 393, 395, 513 P.2d 1, 3 (1973). Included in ordinary and necessary business expenses are \u201ctraveling expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business[.]\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(a)(1). Such travelling expenses are deductible if the taxpayer can prove the expenses are: 1) reasonable and necessary; 2) incurred while away from home; and 3) incurred in the pursuit of a trade or business. <em>Commissioner v. Flowers, </em>326 U.S. 465, 470 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b614  In contrast, it is well settled that unless specifically provided by law, expenses incurred in commuting to and from work are not deductible, but rather are personal expenses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(a); <em>Flowers, </em>326 U.S. at 469-70; <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1275-76; <em>Sanders v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Commissioner, </em>439 F.2d 296, 297 (9th Cir. 1971). \u201cIf, for personal reasons, one chooses to live far from the place of employment, the resulting travel costs are nondeductible, personal expenses.\u201d <em>Kasun v. United States, </em>671 F.2d 1059, 1061 (7th Cir. 1982). For travel expenses to be deductible, it is \u201c \u2018the job, not the taxpayer's pattern of living, [that] must require the travel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061 (quoting <em>Commissioner v. Peurifoy, </em>254 F.2d 483, 486 (4th Cir. 1957), <em>aff'd, </em>358 U.S. 59 (1958) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b615 Robison\u2019s case concerns the second prong of the test annunciated in Flowers-was Robison \u201caway from home\u201d while working in Wyoming? To answer this question, we must consider two distinct, yet inevitably intertwined concepts - temporary or indefinite employment and a taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The nature of Robison\u2019s employment will determine the location of his \u201ctax home.\u201d As discussed in detail below, if Robison\u2019s employment in Wyoming was temporary, his tax home would be his residence in Billings and his business travel expenses are deductible. However, if Robison\u2019s employment in Wyoming was indefinite, his \u201ctax home\u201d is his principal place of business (the Big Piney/Pinedale area of Wyoming) and his business travel expenses are disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Nature of Robison\u2019s Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b616 One exception to the general rule that commuting expenses are non-deductible is when the taxpayer travels to a temporary, as opposed to indefinite, job. <em>Peurifoy v. Commissioner, </em>358 U.S. 59, 60 (1958); <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061; <em>Sanders, </em>439 F.2d at 298. \u201c[I]t is not reasonable to expect people to move to a distant location when a job is foreseeably of limited duration. If, on the other hand, the prospect is that the work will continue for an indefinite or substantially long period of time, the travel expenses are not deductible.\u201d <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b617  Employment is temporary when, at the time the job commences, termination is foreseeable within a short period. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1060-61. In 1992, Congress modified 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 to define the \u201cshort period\u201d language, adding that \u201c[f]or purposes of [the travel expense deduction], the taxpayer shall not be treated as being temporarily away from home during any period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162; Pub. L. No. 102-486, \u00a7 1938, 106 Stat. 2776, 3033 (1992). Thus, for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>employment is generally temporary when it lasts for less than one year. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1062; <em>Boone v. United States, </em>482 F.2d 417, 420 (5th Cir. 1973). A taxpayer is generally allowed to deduct travel expenses related to temporary employment. <em>See Peurifoy, </em>358 U.S. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b618  Employment is indefinite when the length of the employment is indeterminate. <em>Boone, </em>482 F.2d at 419. \u201c[E]mployment which merely lacks permanence is indefinite unless termination is foreseeable within a short period of time.\u201d <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061. A taxpayer is not allowed to deduct business travel expenses related to indefinite employment. <em>See Peurifoy, </em>358 U.S. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b619 Of particular interest in Robison\u2019s case is the treatment of quite similar employment - work in the construction industry. In <em>Kasun, </em>a construction worker argued his employment was temporary because he was not told how long his job would last. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1060. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, instead finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[W]ork in the construction industry is, by its very nature, impermanent. Workers move from job to job and often must seek employment at some distance from their homes. Courts have not, however, found that these characteristics distinguish construction work from other forms of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1062 (internal citations omitted). The <em>Kasun </em>court refused to create an exception to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262 for construction workers. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1062 n. 5. Rather, it found that construction workers, just like \u201csuburban or exurban commuters,\u201d must pay their own commuting expenses. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1062-63. \u00b620 Similarly, in <em>Commissioner v. Peurifoy, </em>construction workers argued their employment was temporary because \u201cthey were not guaranteed a job for any specific period nor were they told by the employer how long the work was expected to last.\u201d <em>Peurifoy, </em>254 F.2d at 485. The Fourth Circuit found that this demonstrated indefinite or impermanent employment, not temporary employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">Work in the heavy construction industry, by its very nature, has a degree of impermanence. Employment is usually for each job only and lasts no longer than the need at that project for the particular skill of the individual employee. Upon many of the larger projects, however, such need, and the actual employment of an individual, may last for several, even many, years. Other projects may be of comparatively short duration. It is also a characteristic of the industry, as shown in the stipulations in this case, that upon larger construction projects outside the larger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>metropolitan centers, the local supply of the necessary skills must be greatly augmented by workers coming from other places. Work in the industry, therefore, is, to some extent, transient as well as impermanent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">Construction workers are not the only ones, however, who find it necessary or profitable to move or seek employment from place to place, and the Tax Court, in its opinion in these cases, recognizes that the transient and impermanent aspect of work in heavy construction does not itself distinguish construction work from other employment or hold the answer to our problem. Indeed these characteristics of the industry tend to strip from a remote residence elements essential to its status as the sole 'tax home.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOi\"><em>Peurifoy, </em>254 F.2d at 486. Accordingly, \u201cfhjowever justified [a taxpayer] may be from a subjective or personal point of view in maintaining a residence away from his post of duty, his travel and maintenance expense at his post of duty is not an ordinary and necessary business expense within the meaning of 23(a)(1)(A) [now 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162] if the employment is of substantial or indefinite duration.\u201d <em>Peurifoy, </em>254 F.2d at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The \u201cTax Home\u201d Concept</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b621 The location of a taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d determines whether his business travel expenses were incurred \u201caway from home\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162. For the purposes of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162, the term \u201ctax home\u201d does not mean \u201chome\u201d in the ordinary or common sense of the word. <em>Henderson v. Commissioner, </em>143 F.3d 497, 499 (9th Cir. 1998). A taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d is not necessarily the place he or she lives (i.e. house, residence, abode, etc.). When a regularly employed taxpayer maintains his personal residence within the general area of his employment, his \u201ctax home\u201d will be his personal residence. <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1275. However, when a taxpayer accepts employment either permanently <em>or for an indefinite period of time </em>away from his personal residence, his \u201ctax home\u201d will shift to the new location - the vicinity of his new principal place of business. <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1275-76 (emphasis added). In this later situation, \u201cthe decision to retain a former residence is a personal choice, and the expenses of traveling to and from that residence are non-deductible personal expenses.\u201d <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b622 With this framework in mind, we now turn to Robison\u2019s case. Robison appears to argue that his employment in Wyoming was at all times temporary. However, he also alternately argues that for a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>his employment was temporary, but then became indefinite. Therefore, he argues the first year of his business travel expenses should be allowed. The DOR argues the District Court correctly concluded that at all times Robison\u2019s employment was indefinite, making none of his business travel expenses deductable.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b623  In reversing STAB, the District Court determined that Robison\u2019s employment was \u201cindefinite ... not temporary.\u201d We agree. Just like the construction workers in <em>Kasun </em>and Peurifoy, Robison did not know his employment would terminate in a short period of time. Rather, he was never told how long his work in Wyoming would last. This undoubtedly makes his employment indefinite. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1062; <em>Peurifoy, </em>254 F.2d at 486-87. It is true that Robison\u2019s employment lacked permanence, but that alone does not make his employment temporary. <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061. Employment is only temporary if \u201ctermination is foreseeable within a short period of time.\u201d <em>Kasun, </em>671 F.2d at 1061. Further bolstering the conclusion that Robison\u2019s employment was indefinite is the language of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162-\u201cthe taxpayer shall not be treated as being temporarily away from home during any period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year.\u201d Robison was employed in the same Big Piney/Pinedale area of Wyoming for over 3 years, well beyond the 1 year limitation in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b624  The language of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 also precludes <em>any </em>of Robison\u2019s business travel expenses from being deductable. The statute clearly states that \u201cthe taxpayer shall not be treated as being temporarily away from home during <em>any </em>period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 (emphasis added). Thus, Robison is not considered as being temporarily away from home during any of his 3-plus years of employment in Wyoming because his employment period exceeded 1 year. Contrary to Robison\u2019s argument, this is not a case where Robison was told his employment was to be terminated within a short period of time only to have his employment extended. <em>See generally </em>Rev. Rul. 93-86, 1993-2 C.B. 71. It is undisputed that, from the beginning, Robison \u201cnever knew\u201d the length of his employment. His employment was indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b625 The District Court also found that STAB incorrectly interpreted <em>Coombs </em>to hold that a taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d is his residence. We again agree. <em>Coombs </em>does not stand for the proposition that a taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d is his residence, only that in certain circumstances it <em>can </em>be. As applicable to Robison\u2019s case, however, <em>Coombs </em>clearly states that when a taxpayer accepts employment either permanently <em>or for an indefinite </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>period of time </em>away from his personal residence, his \u201ctax home\u201d will shift to the new location - the vicinity of his new principal place of business. <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1275-76 (emphasis added). This is precisely what Robison did-he took indefinite employment away from his personal residence. His \u201ctax home\u201d for the purposes of the business travel expense deduction consequently shifted to the Big Piney/Pinedale area of Wyoming. As a result, \u201cthe decision to retain a former residence is a personal choice, and the expenses of traveling to and from that residence are non-deductible personal expenses.\u201d <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1276. Additionally, because his \u201ctax home\u201d for the purposes of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 was the Big Piney/Pinedale area, the expenses of traveling from camp to each drill site cannot be differentiated from any other worker\u2019s normal commuting expenses. These commuting expenses are not deductable. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(a); <em>Flowers, </em>326 U.S. at 469-70; <em>Coombs, </em>608 F.2d at 1275-76; <em>Sanders, </em>439 F.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b626 Finally, Robison raises several arguments that were not raised below, such as lodging and meal expenses.
