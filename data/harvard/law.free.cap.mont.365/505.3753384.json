After chatting online and looking at her online profile, which included K.M.\u2019s picture and age, Ariegwe gave K.M. his phone number. K.M. called Ariegwe, and on January 17,2003, the two of them met in person and an alleged sexual encounter occurred. Shortly after the incident K.M. called her friend R.K. to tell her about it, stating that she had had sex with a 32-year-old man. Unknown to either of the girls, the phone conversation was inadvertently recorded on an answering machine at R.K\u2019s house. The tape of the conversation was preserved and is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AjG\">\u00b66 Ariegwe was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (2001), attempted sexual intercourse without consent, a felony in violation of \u00a745-4-103 and 45-5-503, MCA (2001), and unlawful transactions with children, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a745-5-623(l)(c), MCA (2001). A jury trial was held in early March 2004, at which Dr. Janet Merrill (Dr. Merrill), a licensed psychologist who had examined K.M., testified on behalf of the State without objection from Ariegwe\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\u00b67 During his opening statement, Ariegwe\u2019s counsel told the jury about the taped conversation between the girls and implied that the jury would get to listen to the recording of it during trial. However, defense counsel never offered the tape into evidence. He later noted the omission in his closing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">\u00b68 On March 4, 2004, Ariegwe was convicted of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful transactions with a minor, and acquitted of sexual intercourse without consent. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 13, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. Ariegwe appealed the conviction and sentence, and this Court affirmed the conviction and reversed and remanded the restitution portion of the sentence. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b69 Through counsel, Ariegwe petitioned for PCR, raising several arguments. Those presented for appeal are whether Ariegwe received ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) when his trial counsel failed to object to the testimony of Dr. Merrill and failed to introduce into evidence the recorded conversation between K.M. and R.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b610 An evidentiary hearing on Ariegwe\u2019s PCR petition was held on March 17, 2011. At the hearing, both parties were represented by counsel and presented evidence, including the testimony of Ariegwe\u2019s trial counsel. After the hearing, the court requested submission of the recorded phone conversation and listened to it. On June 29, 2011, the District Court issued the Order denying Ariegwe\u2019s petition for PCR. The court determined that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to Dr. Merrill\u2019s expert testimony or failure to introduce the recorded conversation into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b611 Ariegwe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u00b612 \u201c[This Court] review[s] a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>2012 MT 131, \u00b6 9, 365 Mont. 264, 280 P.3d 272 (quoting <em>Hammer v. State, </em>2008 MT 342, \u00b6 9, 346 Mont. 279, 194 P.3d 699). \u201cA petitioner for post-conviction relief must prove by a preponderance of evidence that he or she is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 15, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u00b613 \u2018Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact [which this Court reviews] de novo.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">\u00b614 <em>Issue: Did the District Court err when it denied Ariegwe\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">\u00b615 Under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 12. \u2018The right to counsel on appeal includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are reviewed using the two-part test described in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), where \u2018the defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>St. Germain v. State, </em>2012 MT 86, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 494, 276 P.3d 886).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b616 In assessing whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the first prong, we \u201cdetermine whether counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms and all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting Si. <em>Germain, </em>\u00b6 10). \u201cUnder the second prong, \u2018the defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u2019 <em>\u201dMiller, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11) (internal citation omitted). In order to prevail, the defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b617 Ariegwe denied there was sexual contact between him and K.M., while K.M. firmly maintained that there was forcible sexual contact, including penetration. Ariegwe asserts that the physical evidence was not conclusive and therefore the case came down to the credibility of the witnesses. Thus, he argues on appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony regarding the credibility of K.M. and failing to introduce into evidence the recorded conversation between K.M. and R.K. The State counters that Ariegwe failed to demonstrate that his counsel was deficient or that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance. We review each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"Aorr\">\u00b618 A. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b619 Dr. Merrill testified without objection from Ariegwe\u2019s attorney that K.M. suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and that her diagnosis was consistent with that of a teenager who had been sexually abused. Ariegwe contends that Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it inappropriately bolstered K.M.\u2019s credibility by \u201cplac[ing] an aura of scientific authority\u201d over KM.\u2019s allegations, when the credibility of the alleged victim should have been exclusively within the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b620 We have held that expert testimony concerning the credibility of an alleged victim is generally improper because it invades the province of the jury. <em>State v. Harris, </em>247 Mont. 405, 409-10, 808 P.2d 453, 455 (1991). An exception exists in certain cases involving the sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of a minor child. <em>Harris, </em>247 Mont. at 410, 808 P.2d at 455. However, we held in <em>State v. Hensley, </em>250 Mont. 478, 482, 821 P.2d 1029, 1031-32 (1991), that where an alleged victim was sixteen years of age and competent to testify, it was error to admit expert testimony regarding the credibility of the alleged victim. Here, K.M. was sixteen years old and competent when she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b621 Ariegwe argues that his counsel should have objected to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony under <em>Hensley, </em>and that his failure to do so establishes that he did not know or understand the law. He contends that Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted due to the danger of unfair prejudice, and that it bolstered K.M.\u2019s credibility while not providing the jury with any new information. The State argues that Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony did not directly comment on K.M.\u2019s credibility, was not offered to bolster KM.\u2019s credibility, and that no reasonable probability exists that the outcome would have been different had Dr. Merrill not testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b622 Assuming for the sake of argument that Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony concerning the credibility of K.M.\u2019s story was erroneously admitted under <em>Hensley, </em>this does not end the IAC inquiry. Ariegwe\u2019s burden of proof under the <em>Strickland </em>test is two-fold. First, Ariegwe must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Second, he must show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, in that a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different had his counsel objected to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 13. In making this determination, the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury must be considered, as required by <em>Strickland. State v. Wing, </em>2008 MT 218, \u00b6 43, 344 Mont. 243, 188 P.3d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b623 Ariegwe vigorously argues that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient, but he does not address the second prong-whether he was prejudiced due to a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had his counsel objected to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony. If either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test is not met, then the IAC inquiry can end. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 68, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. We conclude Ariegwe has failed to satisfy the prejudice prong because we cannot conclude that, but for the failure of Ariegwe\u2019s counsel to obj ect to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony, the result of Ariegwe\u2019s trial would have been different. <em>See Wing, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b624 The case against Ariegwe was supported by substantial evidence in addition to K.M.\u2019s testimony, including fibers found on KM.\u2019s underwear from a unique blanket owned by Ariegwe and the presence of amylase on the inside of K.M.\u2019s underwear. This evidence is notable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>because Ariegwe insisted that KM.\u2019 s pants were never removed during their encounter. In addition, photographic evidence buttressed KM.\u2019s version of events, as did the testimony of R.K. and K.M.\u2019s father. Moreover, the jury was still obligated to assess the credibility of K.M., and it had the discretion to accept or reject Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony in its entirety. <em>See State v. Geyman, </em>224 Mont. 194, 200-01, 729 P.2d 475, 479-80 (1986). In sum, Ariegwe has not demonstrated that without Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. This being so, we decline to further address the deficiency prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test or the propriety of Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b625  We conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to Dr. Merrill\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b626 B. Recorded Conversation</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b627 As noted above, counsel for Ariegwe told the jury in his opening statement that it would hear the tape-recorded conversation between K.M. and her friend R.K. However, he forgot to introduce the tape into evidence, and ended up discussing the omission during his closing argument. He later testified at the PCR hearing that the tape had been important to his case strategy, as he had wanted to use K.M.\u2019s voice inflections on the tape to attack her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b628 Ariegwe argues on appeal that the District Court erred in denying his claim for LAC for counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the recorded conversation into evidence. He maintains that K.M.\u2019s inflection on the tape as she described the alleged sexual encounter to R. K. was enthusiastic and boastful. Ariegwe posits she made up the story to enhance her stature, and that when the answering machine tape was discovered, she became locked into her false story. Ariegwe claims that it was important that the jury hear the recorded conversation, as it would have assisted it in assessing K.M.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b629 After listening to the recorded conversation during the PCR proceedings, the District Court determined that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the failure to introduce the recording into evidence, given its content and poor audio quality. The State examined both K.M. and R.K. about the phone conversation, and Ariegwe\u2019s counsel had the full opportunity to cross-examine both of them. In addition, the court concluded that the recorded conversation was potentially inculpatory rather than exculpatory because in it K.M. stated that she had had sex with a man and that it was not supposed to happen. If anything, these nearly contemporaneous statements underscored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>K.M.\u2019s testimony that the sexual encounter had actually occurred. The court noted that had the recorded conversation been introduced to the jury, Ariegwe may well have been convicted of sexual intercourse without consent, rather than being acquitted of the charge. The court therefore found that counsel\u2019s error in not introducing the recorded conversation into evidence did not undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b630  We agree with the District Court. Ariegwe has not demonstrated that but for his counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the tape as intended, a reasonable probability existed that the result of the proceeding would have been different-er more favorable-to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b631 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Ariegwe\u2019s claim of LAC. The District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. We therefore affirm the denial and dismissal of Ariegwe\u2019s petition for PCR.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
