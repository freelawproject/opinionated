Pirello had argued that the pending charges should be dismissed on the grounds that the hashish oil that led to his charges was legally possessed pursuant to the Montana Marijuana Act (MMA). <em>See </em>\u00a750-46-101 to -210, MCA (2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues in the case as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b63 <em>Issue one: Did the District Court err in denying Pirello\u2019s motion to dismiss because it determined that he could not legally possess hashish oil under the Montana Marijuana Act, \u00a7\u00a7 50-46-101 to -210, MCA (2009)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b64 <em>Issue two: Does the rule of lenity require that the Montana Marijuana Act be interpreted in Pirello\u2019s favor?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b65 On June 30, 2010, Pirello was observed by law enforcement pulling into the center median between the lanes of Interstate 90. The officer stopped to check on Pirello, who explained that he had a flat tire. The deputy observed that Pirello had red, watery eyes, and that the smell of burnt marijuana emanated from the truck. A green, leafy substance was also plainly observed within the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b66 Pirello indicated to the deputy that he had a medical marijuana card from Washington State and consented to a search of the vehicle. The deputy found various items of paraphernalia, three marijuana cigarettes, 20 small baggies containing a total of 52 grams of marijuana, and two one-gram bottles of liquid that were labeled \u2018hash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b67 Pirello was charged with felony possession of dangerous drugs for the hashish (Count I) and misdemeanor criminal possession of dangerous drugs for the marijuana pursuant to \u00a745-9-102, MCA. He was also charged with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia pursuant to \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA, and driving under the influence of drugs in violation of \u00a761-8-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b68 He moved to dismiss Count I on the basis that his medical marijuana card entitled him to possess the hashish. His motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>denied by the District Court. He then entered a conditional guilty plea, which reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the additional misdemeanor charges were dismissed. The District Court sentenced him to a three-year deferred sentence, from which he timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b69 The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. LeMay, </em>2011 MT 323, \u00b6 27, 363 Mont. 172, 266 P.3d 1278. The District Court\u2019s denial of Pirello\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its interpretation of the MMA was a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Roundstone, </em>2011 MT 227, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 74, 261 P.3d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b610 Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>Wing v. State ex rel. Dept. of Transp., </em>2007 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 336 Mont. 423, 155 P.3d 1224. A defendant challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Wing, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b611 Pirello claims that the MMA\u2019s exception for \u201cusable marijuana\u201d necessarily includes the hashish for which he was charged because the term is defined as \u201cany mixture or preparation of marijuana.\u201d Otherwise, he claims that the term is unconstitutionally vague, and that the rule of lenity requires the MMA to be interpreted in his favor. The State argues that the MMA provides a limited exception to the prohibition of possession of marijuana, and that hashish is unambiguously excluded from this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b612 <em>Issue one: Did the District Court err in denying Pirello\u2019s motion to dismiss because it determined that he could not legally possess hashish oil under the Montana Marijuana Act, \u00a7\u00a7 50-46-101 to -210, MCA (2009)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u00b613 At the time of Pirello\u2019s arrest, the MMA provided patients limited exceptions to the provisions of Montana law that make possession of marijuana illegal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">(1) A person who possesses a registry identification card issued pursuant to 50-46-103 may not be arrested, prosecuted, or penalized in any manner or be denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to civil penalty or disciplinary action by a professional licensing board or the department of labor and industry, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(a) the qualifying patient or caregiver acquires, possesses, cultivates, manufactures, delivers, transfers, or transports marijuana not in excess of the amounts allowed in subsection (2); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">(b) the qualifying patient uses marijuana for medical use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">(2) A qualifying patient and that qualifying patient\u2019s caregiver may not possess more than six marijuana plants and 1 ounce of usable marijuana each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">(3) (a) A qualifying patient or caregiver is presumed to be engaged in the medical use of marijuana if the qualifying patient or caregiver:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">(i) is in possession of a registry identification card; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">(ii) is in possession of an amount of marijuana that does not exceed the amount permitted under subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">(b) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the possession of marijuana was not for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms or effects of a qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Section 50-46-201(l)-(3), MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">\u00b614 The MMA adopts the definition of marijuana found within the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), stating, \u201cMarijuana\u2019 has the meaning provided in 50-32-101.\u201d Section 50-46-102, MCA (2009). The CSA, in turn, provides that \u201cmarijuana\u201d is \u201call plant material from the genus cannabis containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or seeds of the genus capable of germination.\u201d Section 50-32-101(17), MCA (2009). Significantly, the CSA also specifically differentiates hashish: <em>\u201cas distinguished from marijuana, </em>[hashish] means the mechanically processed or extracted plant material that contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and is composed of resin from the cannabis plant.\u201dSection 50-32-101(14), MCA (2009) (emphasis added). \u00b615 The issue in this case arises from the fact that in addition to \u201cmarijuana,\u201d the MMA also defines \u201cusable marijuana,\u201d which is \u201cthe dried leaves and flowers of marijuana and any mixture or preparation of marijuana,\u201d excluding \u201cthe seeds, stalks, and roots of the plant.\u201d Section 50-46-102(10), MCA (2009). Thus, Pirello argues that hashish is one such \u201cmixture or preparation of marijuana\u201d under the MMA, regardless of differentiation provided by the CSA. He argues that \u201c[i]t is only when looking to statutes in other parts of the code that the definition of \u2018useable marijuana\u2019 is called into question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">\u00b616 To the contrary, when interpreting statutes within an act, we interpret individual sections of the act in a manner that ensures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>coordination with the other sections of the act. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2012 MT 101, \u00b6 20, 365 Mont. 56, 277 P.3d 1232. \u2018Where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Thus, in addressing this inquiry, it is necessary to consider the MMA and CSA in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b617 The State argues that to be \u201cuseable marijuana\u201d as defined by 50-46-102(10), MCA (2009), the substance in question must first be \u201cmarijuana\u201d as defined in 50-32-101(17), MCA (2009). We agree. When read together, it becomes clear that in order to have been considered \u201cuseable marijuana,\u201d the substance Pirello possessed needed to be a preparation of the intact \u201cplant material from the genus cannabis.\u201d Once that plant material was \u201cmechanically processed or extracted\u201d in a manner that reduced it to resins, the substance ceased to fall within the definition of \u201cmarijuana,\u201d and therefore could not be contained within the definition of \u201cuseable marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b618  We conclude in this case that the MMA was clear and unambiguous on its face, and that the District Court\u2019s interpretation appropriately harmonized the statutes. Hashish does not fall within the MMA\u2019s narrow exception to the CSA. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Pirello\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b619 <em>Issue two: Does the rule of lenity require that the Montana Marijuana Act be interpreted in Pirello\u2019s </em>favor?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b620 Pirello argues that the MMA\u2019s definition of \u201cuseable marijuana\u201d is only ambiguous when read in conjunction with other statutes. Accordingly, he argues that the rule of lenity requires the act to be interpreted in his favor. The State argues that the rule of lenity is inapplicable to his situation because the definitions within the MMA are not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b621 \u2018It is well settled that a statute must be specific enough to give fair notice of the conduct prohibited and to provide a meaningful differentiation between culpable and innocent conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 323, \u00b6 59, 292 Mont. 214, 974 P.2d 1139. Here, it is important to note that the MMA as it existed at the time provided a narrow exception to the general policy within the law that the possession of marijuana was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b622  In addressing Pirello\u2019s argument that the definition of \u201cuseable marijuana\u201dis an unnecessarily manufactured ambiguity, this Court\u2019s duty is to harmonize statutes relating to the same subject in order to give effect to each statute. <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448 (citing <em>Oster v. Valley Co., </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, 140 P.3d 1079). As we noted above, the MMA specifically defines marijuana by reference to the CSA. Under the CSA, hashish is not marijuana. The definitions of \u201cmarijuana\u201dand \u201cuseable marijuana\u201d are clear and unambiguous and do not provide an exception to the CSA for hashish. Accordingly, we decline to apply the rule of lenity to Pirello\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b623 Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
