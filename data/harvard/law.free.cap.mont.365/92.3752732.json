Whether the non-retiring justices on this Court should recuse themselves from participating in the decision of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">2. Whether Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge to LR-119 is justiciable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-14\">3. Whether LR-119 is constitutionally defective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-15\">4. Whether the constitutionally infirm provisions of LR-119 can be severed from the remainder of the referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">\u00b63 We hold that recusal is not required. We further hold that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is justiciable, that LR-119 impermissibly amends the Montana Constitution, and that the offending provisions cannot be severed. We accordingly affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-18\">LR-119</p>\n<p id=\"b118-19\">\u00b64 The 62nd Montana Legislature enacted Senate Bill 268 (SB 268), which submits to the electorate the question whether certain statutory changes should be made regarding the election of justices to the Montana Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 2011, ch. 203. SB 268 was filed with the Secretary of State on April 18, 2011, and was to be submitted to the voters at a special election to be held concurrently with the June 5, 2012 primary election. SB 268 was to appear on the ballot as Legislative Referendum No. 119. The ballot language of LR-119 and the text of SB 268 are included as an appendix following this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-20\">\u00b65 The Montana Supreme Court is composed of seven justices, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of whom is chief justice. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 3(1); \u00a7 3-2-101, MCA. The justices serve eight-year terms, which run from the first Monday of January following the justice\u2019s election to (but not including) the first Monday of January eight years hence. Mont. Const, art. VII, 7(2); \u00a7\u00a7 3-2-101, -103, MCA. One or two of the seats come up for election every two years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To be eligible to the office of Supreme Court justice, the person must (1) be a citizen of the United States, (2) have resided in Montana for two years immediately before taking office, and (3) have been admitted to the practice of law in Montana for at least five years prior to the date of appointment or election. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 9(1). Supreme Court justices must reside within the state. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 9(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b66 Under current law, the justices are elected on a statewide basis. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-2-101, MCA. LR-119 would change the law so that each justice is elected from one of seven districts of approximately equal population. The districts created under LR-119 follow county lines-for example, the Fifth Supreme Court district would consist of Lincoln, Sanders, Flathead, Glacier, and Toole Counties. The district numbers correspond to the justices\u2019 current seat numbers, with Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s seat being assigned to the seventh district (Missoula, Lake, and Mineral Counties). The justices would be required to reside and be registered to vote in their respective districts at the time they are elected, and electors in a given district could vote only for that district\u2019s justice. Consequently, rather than voting for each of the seven Supreme Court justices as they come up for election in two-year intervals, electors could vote for only one of the justices, who would come up for election every eight years. The chief justice would then be chosen from among the seven justices by majority vote of the justices.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\u00b67 LR-119, therefore, would effect three changes concerning the qualifications and selection of justices. First, LR-119 adds a residency and voter-registration requirement: a candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court must be a \u201cqualified elector\u201d of the district from which the candidate is elected. (Once elected, a justice is not required to reside within that district during the justice\u2019s service in office.) Second, LR-119 creates seven Supreme Court districts and requires that each justice be elected from a separate district. Only voters in a given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>district are eligible to vote for that district\u2019s justice. Third, LR-119 changes the method of selecting the chief justice from a statewide election to a selection by the seven justices from among their number.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b68 Plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are Montana citizens, taxpayers, and electors who historically have participated in elections for justices of the Montana Supreme Court and who reside in each of the seven districts proposed by LR-119. Plaintiffs commenced this action on November 23, 2011, naming the State, by and through Secretary of State Linda McCulloch, as defendant. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that LR-119 is constitutionally defective. Plaintiffs asked the District Court to order the State to decertify LR-119 and to enjoin the State from placing LR-119 on the ballot. The State, through the Attorney General, filed an answer on January 3, 2012. The answer included responses to the specific allegations of the complaint. In addition, the State asserted that Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge is not ripe and that LR-119 is not constitutionally defective in any event. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, together with a supporting brief and affidavits, on January 18. The State filed its brief in opposition on February 10, and Plaintiffs filed their reply on February 23. The District Court scheduled a summary judgment hearing for March 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b69 Meanwhile, on January 9, seven individual Montana legislators<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Legislators) filed a motion to intervene in the action as party defendants pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24. The Attorney General opposed the motion but stated that he would consent to an amicus brief from Legislators. Plaintiffs did not state a position on the matter. The District Court issued an order on February 28 denying intervention. The court indicated that Legislators could instead provide input regarding the issues in the case as amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b610 In response to the District Court\u2019s ruling, Legislators first filed a direct appeal to this Court on March 9. Plaintiffs responded with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>motion to dismiss the appeal and a motion to expedite ruling. Plaintiffs explained that the Secretary of State had to certify the June 5 primary election ballot by March 22 and that, in light of certain statutory deadlines, Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to LR-119 would be difficult to resolve on time if the summary judgment hearing were not permitted to go forward, as scheduled, on March 14. After receiving responses from Legislators and the Attorney General, this Court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>No. DA 12-0156 (Mar. 13, 2012). The District Court held the hearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on March 14, at which time counsel for Plaintiffs and counsel for the State gave oral argument. Counsel for Legislators was present via telephone. The court indicated that it would issue a ruling by March 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b611 In the interim, Legislators filed a petition for writ of supervisory control on March 15, again challenging the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion to intervene. This Court denied the petition and affirmed the District Court\u2019s February 28 order. <em>Seven Mont. Legislators v. First Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>No. OP 12-0171 (Mar. 16, 2012). We noted that if they wished to do so, Legislators could participate in the action by filing an amicus brief in the District Court electronically by 9:00 a.m. on March 19. Legislators did not file an amicus brief on March 19; however, per an earlier request by Legislators (filed March 15), the District Court did consider Legislators\u2019 previously filed documents (their answer to the complaint, and their response brief in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment) in analyzing the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b612 The District Court rendered its decision on March 20, granting summary judgment to Plaintiffs. The court determined, and the parties do not dispute, that the issues in this case are issues of law. In summary, the court concluded: that Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to LR-119 is justiciable; that LR-119 is unconstitutional on its face because it attempts, through statutory measures, to change the constitutionally established qualifications for Supreme Court justice by adding a new residency requirement; that LR-119\u2019s division of the state into seven Supreme Court districts, with the requirement that one justice be selected from each district, also introduces an unconstitutional residency requirement; and that LR-119 cannot be salvaged by severing the invalid portions of the referendum. The District Court\u2019s reasoning is discussed below where applicable. As noted, the court ordered the Secretary of State to decertify LR-119 and enjoined the Secretary of State from presenting LR-119 on the June 5, 2012 ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Post-Decision Events</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b613 The State filed its notice of appeal with the Clerk of this Court on March 21. Also on March 21, the State filed with the Clerk of the District Court a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 62(c) and M. R. App. P. 22(l)(a)(i) for an immediate stay of the District Court\u2019s March 20 order. The State argued that under \u00a7 13-27-501, MCA, the Secretary of State had to certify LR-119 for the June 5 ballot by 5:00 p.m. on March 22. If certification did not take place (per the District Court\u2019s order), then the preparation of the voter information pamphlets concerning this issue would cease and the ballots would be prepared without LR-119. The State proposed that if the District Court stayed its order, the Secretary of State could certify LR-119 and move forward with the voter information pamphlets and ballots. In the event this Court ultimately reversed the District Court\u2019s order, then the pamphlets and ballots would already be prepared. Conversely, if this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s order, then we could order that the votes on LR-119 should not be counted and have no force or effect, as occurred in <em>Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 87, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. If, however, the Secretary of State did not certify LR-119, and if this Court ultimately reversed the District Court\u2019s order, then it might not be possible to prepare voter information pamphlets and ballots for LR-119 in time for the June 5 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b614 Notwithstanding its request for an \u201cimmediate\u201d stay, the State did not present the District Court with a proposed order or include a separate notice that the matter had to be ruled upon before 5:00 p.m. the next day. Nor did the State request that the Clerk of the District Court bring the motion to the court\u2019s attention within a certain timeframe. One had to read the State\u2019s brief to glean this information; however, as explained by the Clerk of the District Court, she and her staff do not have the time to read and interpret all of the documents filed with the court. As a result, the State\u2019s motion was not presented to the District Court judge until approximately 1:30 p.m. on March 23. By this time, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-208 and -209, MCA, the Secretary of State had already certified to local election administrators the candidates and ballot issues that are to appear on the June 5 ballot. In compliance with the District Court\u2019s March 20 order, the Secretary of State did not certify LR-119 for the ballot. Thus, because it was too late to issue an effective order staying its March 20 order, the District Court denied the State\u2019s motion on March 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b615 On April 4, the State filed a motion in this Court to expedite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>briefing and disposition of this appeal. The State explained that under \u00a7 13-21-210(5), MCA, and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1973ff et seq.), absentee ballots must be provided to oversees and absentee electors not later than 45 days before a federal primary election. Thus, should this Court reverse the District Court\u2019s March 20 order, a supplemental ballot would have to be prepared and ready for mailing by April 20 in order to comply with state and federal deadlines. The State asserted that the April 20 deadline could be met if this Court rendered its decision by April 13, but if an expedited disposition were not granted, then this appeal would effectively be moot. The State opined that the voter information pamphlets could follow in a later mailing, provided that this Court allowed for mailing of the pamphlets on a timeline different from the statutory deadline. The State provided no authority for this Court to do so, however. Finally, the State noted that it was prepared to submit its opening brief by April 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b616 This Court granted the State\u2019s motion on April 5. We ordered the State to file its brief by April 6, Plaintiffs to file their brief by April 10, and Legislators to file their amicus brief (if they wished to file one) by April 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the briefing completed, this Court issued an order on April 12 affirming the District Court\u2019s March 20 decision. We stated that our opinion, analysis, and rationale would follow in due course. The analysis and rationale for our April 12 order are now provided herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b617 Several standards of review are implicated in our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b618 First, we review a district court\u2019s rulings on summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as did the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Krajacich v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2012 MT 82, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 455, 276 P.3d 922; <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 85, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421, <em>reversed on other </em>grounds,_ U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 1215 (2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230; <em>Williams v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>2011 MT 271, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14,362 Mont. 368, 264 P.3d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b619 Second, the District Court\u2019s decision involved the interpretation of constitutional and statutory language-albeit, with respect to the <em>latter,proposed </em>statutory language submitted by the Legislature to the electorate in a referendum. The interpretation and construction of constitutional and statutory provisions is a matter of law which we review de novo, determining whether the court\u2019s interpretation and construction are correct. <em>See Mont. Shooting Sports Assn. v. State, </em>2010 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 355 Mont. 49, 224 P.3d 1240; <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874; <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458; <em>cf. City of Billings v. Albert, </em>2009 MT 63, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828 (the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, for which our review is plenary).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b620 Third, issues of justiciability-such as standing, mootness, ripeness, and political question-are also questions of law, for which our review is de novo. <em>See Northfield Ins. Co. v. Mont. Assn. of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813 (\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on whether a justiciable controversy exists is a conclusion of law.\u201d); <em>Columbia Falls Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 6 v. State, </em>2005 MT 69, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257 (\u201cWhether an issue presents a nonjusticiable political question is a legal conclusion that this Court reviews de novo.\u201d); <em>Mont. State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 14, 270 P.3d 64 (\u201cA district court\u2019s determination regarding standing presents a question of law which we review de novo for correctness.\u201d); <em>Smith v. T-Mobile USA Inc., </em>570 F.3d 1119, 1122 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe review de novo whether a case is moot and whether plaintiffs have standing.\u201d); <em>Verizon Cal. Inc. v. Peevey, </em>413 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cWe review de novo whether claims are ripe for judicial review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b621 Lastly, we review for manifest abuse of discretion the granting of a preliminary or permanent injunction. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912. A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12. However, where the issuance of an injunction is based upon conclusions of law, we review those conclusions to determine if they are correct. <em>St. James Healthcare v. Cole, </em>2008 MT 44, \u00b6 21, 341 Mont. 368, 178 P.3d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b622 Before we may address the substantive merits of whether LR-119 is invalid, there are two threshold issues which must be considered and resolved. First, Legislators have raised the question whether certain justices of this Court should recuse themselves from this case. This question is obviously antecedent to all other issues on appeal, and we thus address it first (commencing at \u00b6 23). Second, the State has raised the question whether Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to LR-119 is justiciable. The judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to justiciable controversies-meaning that our courts do not resolve abstract differences of opinion or advise what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts. <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. Hence, issues of justiciability-such as whether the plaintiff has standing and whether the dispute is ripe or moot-are antecedent, as well, to any discussion of the substantive merits of the parties\u2019 claims. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 29, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80; <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. We therefore address the justiciability question after the recusal question (commencing at \u00b6 52). Then, having resolved the recusal question, and having concluded that this case is justiciable, we reach the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to LR-119 under Issue 3 (commencing at \u00b6 61).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b623 <em>Issue 1. Whether the non-retiring justices should recuse themselves.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b624 Legislators argue in their amicus brief that all non-retiring justices of this Court should recuse themselves. Chief Justice McGrath and Justice Morris recused themselves at the outset of this appeal. The Honorable Thomas McKittrick of the Eighth Judicial District Court is sitting for Chief Justice McGrath, and the Honorable Karen Townsend of the Fourth Judicial District Court is sitting for Justice Morris. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 3(2) (\u201cA district judge shall be substituted for the chief justice or a justice in the event of disqualification or disability ....\u201d). Justice Nelson is presently serving the final year of his eight-year term and is not seeking reelection. He is Acting Chief Justice in this case pursuant to \u00a7 3-2-301, MCA. Thus, Legislators expressly direct their arguments to Justices Rice, Wheat, Cotter, and Baker. Citing the Due Process Clause and the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct, Legislators contend that these four justices have a duty to disqualify themselves because they have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">\u00b625 As an initial matter, it is important to acknowledge that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Plaintiffs nor the Attorney General has argued that-or even raised the question whether-Justices Rice, Wheat, Cotter, and Baker ought to recuse themselves from this case. That issue is raised solely by Legislators. This Court has long held, however, that amici curiae cannot raise separate issues not raised by the parties. <em>See State ex rel. Bennett v. Bonner, </em>123 Mont. 414, 421, 214 P.2d 747, 751 (1950); <em>State ex rel. Dept. of Health &amp; Envtl. Sci. v. Lasorte, </em>182 Mont. 267, 275-76, 596 P.2d 477, 482 (1979); <em>Flynn v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2011 MT 300, \u00b6 22, 363 Mont. 55, 267 P.3d 23. One reason for this rule is that \u201c[t]he theories and arguments in the case should not be changed by amici at the expense of the litigants by injecting new and extraneous issues in the case.\u201d <em>Crabtree v. Mont. State Lib., </em>204 Mont. 398, 409, 665 P.2d 231, 237 (1983) (Haswell, C.J., specially concurring). Moreover, there is \u201c[t]he everpresent danger that issues and arguments ... not considered significant or controlling by the litigants themselves will not be adequately briefed or argued on appeal.\u201d <em>Crabtree, </em>204 Mont. at 410, 665 P.2d at 237 (Haswell, C. J., specially concurring). It also bears repeating that the right to be heard as amici curiae is within the discretion of the court. <em>Bennett, </em>123 Mont. at 420-21, 214 P.2d at 751. An amicus curiae-meaning \u201cfriend of the court\u201d-is \u201c[a] person who is not a party to a lawsuit but who petitions the court or is requested by the court to file a brief in the action because that person has a strong interest in the subject matter.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>98 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009); <em>see also </em>M. R. App. P. 2(2) (\u201cAmicus curiae. One who is not a party, but who, upon invitation or leave of the supreme court granted on motion, files a brief in a pending proceeding because of a strong interest in the subject matter.\u201d). An amicus curiae, \u201cwhether attorney or layman,... [may] inform the court as to facts or situations that may have escaped consideration or remind the court of legal matter which has escaped its notice and regarding which it appears to be in danger of going wrong.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>123 Mont. at 420, 214 P.2d at 751. But an amicus curiae has no control over the proceedings; he must take the case as he finds it, and it is within the discretion of the court as to whether it will accept the advice or suggestions of an amicus curiae. <em>Bennett, </em>123 Mont. at 421, 214 P.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b626 The general rule, therefore, is that \u201c[s]ince amici curiae are not parties and cannot assume the functions of parties, nor create, extend or enlarge issues, we ... consider[ ] the briefs of amici only insofar as they coincide with the issues raised by the parties to the action.\u201d <em>Mont.

Because the analysis under the Due Process Clause provides useful context for the analysis under the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct, we shall first address Legislators\u2019 arguments premised on constitutional standards, and then their arguments premised on the ethical standards set forth in the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Constitutional Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b628 Legislators analogize the present case to <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., </em>556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252 (2009). In <em>Caperton, </em>the Supreme Court held that due process \u201crequire[s] recusal when \u2018the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u2019 \u201d 556 U.S. at 872, 129 S. Ct. at 2257 (quoting <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 1464 (1975)). \u201cThe inquiry is an objective one. The Court asks not whether the judge is actually, subjectively biased, but whether the average judge in his position is \u2018likely\u2019 to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional \u2018potential for bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 881, 129 S. Ct. at 2262. Stated another way, \u201c[t]he proper constitutional inquiry is whether sitting on the case ... would offer a possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>temptation to the average ... judge to ... lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 879, 129 S. Ct. at 2261 (second and third ellipses in original, internal quotation marks omitted). Under this objective standard, recusal may be required \u201cwhether or not actual bias exists or can be proved.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 886, 129 S. Ct. at 2265. The temptation not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true may arise from \u201c \u2018a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest\u2019 \u201d in the outcome of the case, <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 876, 129 S. Ct. at 2259 (quoting <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 523, 47 S. Ct. 437, 441 (1927)), or from other \u201cinterests that tempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality,\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 878, 129 S. Ct. at 2260. The Due Process Clause does not require the judge to have no interest at all, however. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 879, 887-88, 129 S. Ct. at 2261, 2265-66. What degree or kind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting \u201c \u2018cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships must be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 879, 880, 129 S. Ct. at 2261 (quoting <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 625 (1955)). The crucial question is \u201cwhether, \u2018under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,\u2019 the interest \u2018poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 883-84, 129 S. Ct. at 2263 (quoting <em>Withrow, </em>421 U.S. at 47, 95 S. Ct. at 1464).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b629 This Court has not heretofore considered the application of these principles to a claim that a justice (or justices) or a judge (or judges) must be recused from a case in the interest of due process. As Legislators concede, the foregoing standards \u201cprotect <em>the parties\u2019 </em>basic right to a fair trial in a fair tribunal.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 887, 129 S. Ct. at 2266 (emphasis added). Again, Legislators are not \u201cparties\u201d to this action, and neither Plaintiffs nor the Attorney General has expressed fairness concerns here. Nevertheless, as noted, given the peculiar significance of the recusal issue in this case, we shall address the due process question.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b630 Legislators\u2019 argument is that \u201c[sjimilar to the nature of the justices\u2019 interest in <em>Tumey </em>and <em>Caperton </em>... the justices here have an interest in the outcome of this case.\u201d According to Legislators, the alleged interest of the four not-presently-retiring justices is their \u201cpotential\u201d to seek reelection in the future. Legislators note that LR-119 would require the justices to run for reelection from certain geographic districts, rather than statewide, which \u201ccould possibly prevent a justice from getting reelected if he or she were unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>garner the required number of votes to win in a particular district.\u201d Legislators suggest that the average sitting Supreme Court justice \u201cwho has even the potential to run for reelection\u201d would be tempted to decide the validity of LR-119 based on his or her perception of which outcome would give the justice the best chance for reelection. The thrust of Legislators\u2019 argument is that the average sitting justice would be biased in favor of a statewide election and, thus, would vote to strike down LR-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b631 Legislators are mistaken in their view that these circumstances rise to the level of <em>Caperton </em>and <em>Tumey. </em>The Due Process Clause does not mandate recusal simply because LR-119 \u201ccould possibly\u201d prevent a justice, who \u201cpotentially\u201d may decide in the future to seek reelection, from getting reelected. It is important here to make clear that \u201cnot all questions of judicial qualification . . . involve constitutional validity.\u201d <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. 813, 820, 106 S. Ct. 1580, 1584 (1986) (ellipsis in original, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, \u201c \u2018most matters relating to judicial disqualification do not rise to a constitutional level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 876, 129 S. Ct. at 2259 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>FTC v. Cement Institute, </em>333 U.S. 683, 702, 68 S. Ct. 793, 804 (1948)). In this regard, the traditional common-law rule, which the Due Process Clause incorporated, required recusal when the judge had a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in a case, but did not permit disqualification for bias or prejudice. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 876-77, 129 S. Ct. at 2259; <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 820, 106 S. Ct. at 1584; <em>State ex rel. Mueller v. Tenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>87 Mont. 108, 114, 285 P. 928, 930 (1930). \u201cAs Blackstone put it, \u2018the law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge, who is already sworn to administer impartial justice, and whose authority greatly depends upon that presumption and idea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 820, 106 S. Ct. at 1584-85 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *361). Instead, matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, and prejudice were left to statutes and judicial codes. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 876-77, 129 S. Ct. at 2259; <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 820, 106 S. Ct. at 1584-85. In Montana, such matters are addressed and governed by the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. And \u201c[b]ecause the codes of judicial conduct provide more protection than due process requires, most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to the Constitution. Application of the constitutional standard ... will thus be confined to rare instances.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 890, 129 S. Ct. at 2267.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b632 Indeed, each of the Supreme Court\u2019s recusal cases dealt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cextreme facts.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 887, 129 S. Ct. at 2265. To illustrate this point, we summarize four of those cases. First, in <em>Caperton, </em>a West Virginia trial court entered a $50 million jury verdict against A.T. Massey Coal Co. After the verdict but before the appeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the company\u2019s appeal, Massey\u2019s chairman, chief executive officer, and president (Don Blankenship) decided to support Brent Benjamin, an attorney who sought to replace one of the justices on that court. Blankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace him with Benjamin. His contributions eclipsed the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and exceeded by 300 percent the amount spent by Benjamin\u2019s campaign committee. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 872-73, 884, 129 S. Ct. at 2257, 2264. Given that the election was decided by fewer than 50,000 votes (382,036 to 334,301), the Supreme Court concluded that Blankenship\u2019s contributions had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 885, 129 S. Ct. at 2264. Furthermore, when the contributions were made, it was reasonably foreseeable that Massey\u2019s pending appeal would be before the newly elected justice. Absent recusal, Justice Benjamin would review a judgment that had cost his biggest donor\u2019s company $50 million. Although there was no allegation of a quid pro quo agreement, the fact remained that Blankenship\u2019s extraordinary contributions were made at a time when he had a vested stake in the outcome. The Supreme Court thus reasoned that \u201c|j]ust as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise when-without the consent of the other parties-a man chooses the judge in his own cause. And applying this principle to the judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benjamin\u2019s recusal.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 886, 129 S. Ct. at 2265. This was so because Blankenship\u2019s \u201csignificant and disproportionate influence,\u201d coupled with the \u201ctemporal relationship\u201d between the election and Massey\u2019s appeal, offered \u201ca possible temptation to the average ... judge to ... lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 886, 129 S. Ct. at 2265 (ellipses in original, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b633 Second, <em>Tumey </em>involved a situation where the mayor of a village had the authority to sit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating Ohio\u2019s Prohibition Act. As the Court later noted in <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 877, 129 S. Ct. at 2260, two potential conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>were inherent in this structure. First, the mayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties, and the funds for that compensation derived from the fines assessed in a case. Since no fines were assessed upon acquittal, the mayor-judge received a salary supplement only if he convicted the defendant. Second, sums from the criminal fines were deposited into the village\u2019s general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs. <em>See Tumey, </em>273 U.S. at 520-22, 47 S. Ct. at 440-41. On these facts, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause required disqualification \u201cboth because of [the mayor-judge\u2019s] direct pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his official motive to convict and to graduate the fine to help the financial needs of the village.\u201d <em>Tumey, </em>273 U.S. at 535, 47 S. Ct. at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">\u00b634 Third, <em>Mayberry v. Pa., </em>400 U.S. 455, 91 S. Ct. 499 (1971), arose out of a criminal trial on charges of prison breach and holding hostages in a penal institution. During the course of trial, Mayberry (who represented himself) engaged in \u201cbrazen efforts to denounce, insult, and slander the court and to paralyze the trial.\u201d <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 462, 91 S. Ct. at 503. He did not merely create \u201cawkward and embarrassing scenes\u201d; he leveled \u201cdownright insults\u201d against the trial judge and engaged in \u201ctactics taken from street brawls.\u201d Mayberry, 400 U.S. at 462, 91 S. Ct. at 503-04. Thus, in addition to being sentenced on the underlying charges for which he was convicted, the judge also pronounced Mayberry guilty of multiple instances of criminal contempt. <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 455, 91 S. Ct. at 500. On appeal, the question was whether, under the Due Process Clause, a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor. The Supreme Court answered this question in the affirmative. The Court acknowledged that not every attack on a judge disqualifies him from sitting. <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 465, 91 S. Ct. at 505. In <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 84 S. Ct. 841 (1964), for example, the Court ruled that a lawyer\u2019s challenge, though \u201cdisruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary,\u201d was still not \u201can insulting attack upon the integrity of the judge carrying such potential for bias as to require disqualification.\u201d 376 U.S. at 584, 84 S. Ct. at 847. In <em>Mayberry, </em>however, many of the words leveled at the judge were highly personal aspersions, even \u201cfighting words,\u201d including \u201cdirty sonofabitch,\u201d \u201cdirty tyrannical old dog,\u201d \u201cstumbling dog,\u201d and \u201cfool.\u201d The judge was charged with running a Spanish Inquisition and told to \u201cGo to hell\u201d and \u201cKeep your mouth shut.\u201d <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 466, 91 S. Ct. at 505. Insults of this kind, the Supreme Court observed, \u201care apt to strike at the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>vulnerable and human qualities of a judge\u2019s temperament.\u201d <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 466, 91 S. Ct. at 505 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cNo one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 465, 91 S. Ct. at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b635 Lastly, in <em>Lavoie, </em>a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court (Justice Embry) cast the deciding vote to uphold a punitive damages award against an insurance company for its bad-faith refusal to pay a claim. At the time, Justice Embry was the lead plaintiff in a very similar bad-faith-refusal-to-pay suit pending in Alabama\u2019s lower courts. Alabama law in this area was unsettled at the time. Thus, when Justice Embry cast the deciding vote and authored the court\u2019s opinion, he did not merely apply well-established law but, in fact, quite possibly made new law. Moreover, he and the other justices in the majority refused to set aside as excessive a punitive damages award of $3.5 million, although the largest punitive award previously affirmed by the court was $100,000. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 822-23, 106 S. Ct. at 1585-86. As a result, Justice Embry\u2019s deciding vote in <em>Lavoie </em>\u201cundoubtedly \u2018raised the stakes\u2019 \u201d for the insurance company (Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Alabama) in his own suit. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 823-24, 106 S. Ct. at 1586. His opinion for the Alabama Supreme Court \u201chad the clear and immediate effect of enhancing both the legal status and the settlement value of his own <em>case.\u201d Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 824, 106 S. Ct. at 1586. In this respect, Justice Embry had a \u201cdirect, personal, substantial, and pecuniary\u201d interest in the outcome and essentially \u201cacted as a judge in his own <em>case.\u201d Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 824, 106 S. Ct. at 1586 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court thus held that Justice Embry\u2019s participation in <em>Lavoie </em>violated the appellant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 825, 106 S. Ct. at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b636 The appellant in <em>Lavoie </em>challenged not only the participation of Justice Embry, but also the participation of the other justices of the Alabama Supreme Court, or at least the six justices who had not withdrawn from Justice Embry\u2019s class action against Blue Cross. The appellant claimed that these justices also had \u201can interest in this case.\u201d The Supreme Court concluded, however, that such allegations did not constitute a sufficient basis for requiring recusal under the Constitution. For one thing, \u201caccepting appellant\u2019s expansive contentions might require the disqualification of every judge in the State. If so, it is possible that under a \u2018rule of necessity\u2019 none of the judges or justices would be disqualified.\u201d <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 825, 106 S. Ct. at 1587 (citing <em>United States v. Will, </em>449 U.S. 200, 214, 101 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Ct. 471, 480 (1980)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More importantly, while these justices \u201cmight conceivably have had a slight pecuniary interest,\u201d the Court found it \u201cimpossible to characterize that interest as direct, personal, substantial, and pecuniary.\u201d <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 825-26, 106 S. Ct. at 1587-88 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, any interest the justices might have had was \u201chighly speculative and contingent.\u201d <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 826, 106 S. Ct. at 1588. At the time, the Alabama trial court had not even certified a class, let alone awarded any class relief of a pecuniary nature. At some point, the Supreme Court observed, \u201cthe biasing influence ... will be too remote and insubstantial to violate the constitutional <em>constraints.\u201d Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 826, 106 S. Ct. at 1588 (ellipsis in original, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b637 Returning now to the present case, we first note that the interest identified by Legislators as necessitating recusal is not exclusive to the four not-presently-retiring justices. In the event of a justice\u2019s disqualification, \u201c[a] district judge shall be substituted.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 3(2). A district judge, however, also has \u201cthe potential\u201d to run for a seat on this Court in the future, \u201ccould possibly\u201d be prevented by LR-119 from getting elected, and thus (under Legislators\u2019 theory) has an \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of this case. Under a logical extension of Legislators\u2019 argument, no judge in this state-indeed, no otherwise qualified person with \u201cthe potential\u201d to run for Supreme Court justice-could sit on this case. Hence, applying the rule of necessity, none of the justices would be disqualified. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 825, 106 S. Ct. at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b638 But more importantly, \u201cthe potential\u201d to run for reelection in the future, coupled with the fact that LR-119 \u201ccould possibly\u201d prevent a justice from getting reelected if he or she were unable to garner the required number of votes to win in a particular district, does not constitute a \u201cdirect, personal, substantial, and pecuniary\u201d interest. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 825-26, 106 S. Ct. at 1587-88 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, any interest the justices might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>conceivably have in this case is \u201chighly speculative and contingent.\u201d <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 826, 106 S. Ct. at 1588. It is sheer conjecture at this point whether the adoption of district-based elections under LR-119, in lieu of statewide elections under the current system, would help or hinder a justice\u2019s chance for reelection. It is also sheer conjecture whether LR-119 will become law, whether the four justices will seek reelection, and whether anyone will run against them. The Supreme Court has been \u201ccareful to distinguish the extreme facts of the cases before it from those interests that would not rise to a constitutional level.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 887-88, 129 S. Ct. at 2265-66. The fact that the justices have \u201cthe potential\u201d to seek reelection and \u201ccould possibly\u201d be hindered in their reelection bids by LR-119 (assuming it passes) does not create the sort of \u201cextreme,\u201d \u201cextraordinary,\u201d \u201cexceptional,\u201d and \u201crare\u201d circumstances that the Supreme Court has indicated must exist before a due process violation will be found. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 884, 887, 890, 129 S. Ct. at 2263, 2265, 2267. This case does not involve the exertion of a \u201csignificant and disproportionate influence\u201d by an interested party, coupled with a \u201ctemporal relationship\u201d between that exertion of influence and the justices\u2019 consideration of the interested party\u2019s case, as occurred in <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 886, 129 S. Ct. at 2265. Likewise, the justices are not \u201cembroiled in a running, bitter controversy\u201d with any of the parties to this case, as occurred in <em>Mayberry, </em>400 U.S. at 465, 91 S. Ct. at 505. And while Legislators suggest that the four justices here, like Justice Embry in <em>Lavoie </em>and the mayor-judge in <em>Tumey, </em>have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case (namely, safeguarding their future employment), the truth of the matter is that the justices\u2019 decision as to the validity of LR-119 will not have \u201cthe clear and immediate effect\u201d of enhancing their reelection prospects. <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 824, 106 S. Ct. at 1586 (Justice Embry\u2019s opinion for the court in <em>Lavoie </em>had the clear and immediate effect of enhancing both the legal status and the settlement value of his own case); <em>Tumey, </em>273 U.S. at 520-22, 47 S. Ct. at 440-41 (the mayor-judge received a salary supplement, and the village received additional funds for improvements and repairs, only if the mayor-judge convicted the defendants). To the contrary, any biasing influence here is, as it was with the other justices on the Alabama Supreme Court, \u201ctoo remote and insubstantial to violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>constitutional constraints.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. at 826, 106 S.

Restated, \u201cunder a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,\u201d the interest does not pose \u201csuch a risk of actual bias or prejudgment\u201d that the four justices must recuse themselves as a matter of due process. <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at 883-84, 129 S.

Ct. at 2267. Having explained, in some detail, why this case is not one of those \u201crare instances,\u201d we now turn to Montana\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Code of Judicial Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b641 The 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct \u201cestablishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates.\u201d Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Preamble [3]. The Code applies to Supreme Court justices, as well as district court judges and various other judges in the state. Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Application 1(A). A judge is required to comply with the Code. Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b642 Legislators focus on Rule 2.12(A), which states: \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d This includes circumstances where \u201c[t]he judge knows that the judge ... has more than a de minimis interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\u201d Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.12(A)(2)(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>interest need not be economic; in fact, \u201can economic interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding\u201d is covered separately in Rule 2.12(A)(3). In addition to Rule 2.12(A), Legislators also cite \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA, which this Court adopted by order in 1987. The provision states, in pertinent part, that a justice or judge \u201cmust not sit or act in any action or proceeding ... in which he is interested.\u201d Section 3-1-803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b643 Based on these provisions, Legislators contend that the four not-presently-retiring justices have more than a de minimis interest in this proceeding-namely, their ability to get reelected. Legislators further contend that LR-119 \u201cdirectly affects\u201d this interest because LR-119 would require the justices to run for reelection from certain geographical districts, rather than statewide, and this change \u201ccould possibly\u201d prevent a justice from getting reelected. Legislators thus argue that \u201cany justice who has even the potential to run for reelection in the future has a duty to the public and to the court as an institution to disqualify himself or herself from this case\u201d and to \u201ccall in district court judges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b644 As an initial matter, we again note the implausibility of Legislators\u2019 proposal. Like sitting Supreme Court justices, district court judges have \u201cthe potential\u201d to run for a seat on this Court in the future, \u201ccould possibly\u201d be prevented by LR-119 from getting elected, and thus (under Legislators\u2019 theory) have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of this case. That being so, the rule of necessity would apply and none of the justices would be disqualified. <em>See </em>\u00b6 37, supra; <em>see also </em>Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.12 cmt. [3] (\u201cThe rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b645  That point aside, Legislators apply an incorrect standard. The issue is not whether the four justices have an interest that would be <em>directly </em>affected by this proceeding. It is whether they <em>know </em>they have more than a de minimis interest that could be <em>substantially </em>affected by the proceeding. Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.12(A)(2)(c). At this point-roughly two years before Justices Rice and Wheat must decide whether to seek reelection, four years before Justice Cotter must decide, and six years before Justice Baker must decide-it cannot be said that these justices \u201cknow\u201d they have more than a de minimis interest in this case. Moreover, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the justices presently know they have an interest in being reelected, this interest would not be \u201csubstantially\u201d affected by this proceeding. It is sheer conjecture whether district elections under LR-119, in lieu of statewide elections under the current system, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>help or hinder the justices\u2019 chances, just as it is sheer conjecture whether LR-119 would become law if this Court upheld it. What was said above in the due process discussion applies with the same force here: any biasing influence is too remote, too speculative, and too contingent to mandate recusal under Rule 2.12 or \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA. \u00b646 We note that courts in other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions about the necessary degree of interest. For example, in <em>In re Placid Oil Co., </em>802 F.2d 783 (5th Cir. 1986), the court refused \u201cto adopt a rule requiring recusal in every case in which a judge owns stock of a company in the same industry as one of the parties to the case.\u201d 802 F.2d at 786. Although the trial judge there held \u201ca large investment in a Texas bank that may be affected by rulings in this case,\u201d the court explained that \u201c[a] remote, contingent, and speculative interest\u201d such as this does not create a situation in which the judge\u2019s impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>Placid Oil Co., </em>802 F.2d at 786-87. Similarly, the court in <em>Bratz v. Bratz, </em>495 A.2d 292 (Conn. App. 1985), rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial judge had a potential interest in the outcome of the proceeding due to the judge\u2019s prior association with a law firm that had represented the plaintiffs father 15 years earlier. The court stated that \u201c[t]he interest in the potential outcome of a case that will disqualify a judge must be a <em>present </em>one. It must be direct, certain and immediate ....\u201d <em>Bratz, </em>495 A.2d at 295 (emphasis in original); <em>accord State ex rel. Anaya v. Scarborough, </em>410 P.2d 732, 734 (N.M. 1966) (\u201can \u2018interest\u2019 necessary to disqualify a judge must be a present pecuniary interest in the result, or actual bias or prejudice, and not some indirect, remote, speculative, theoretical or possible interest\u201d); <em>Am. Rural Cellular, Inc. v. Sys. Commun. Corp., </em>939 P.2d 185, 194 (Utah App. 1997) (in general, to effect the disqualification of a judge, \u201c \u2018the interest at issue must be direct, certain, and immediate, and not one which is indirect, contingent, incidental, or remote\u2019 \u201d (quoting what is now 46 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Judges </em>\u00a7 90 (2006))); <em>see also Sturgis v. Skokos, </em>977 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Ark. 1998) (\u201cto be disqualifying, the prospective liability, gain, or relief to the judge must turn on the outcome of the suit\u201d); <em>In re African-American Slave Descendants Litig., </em>307 F. Supp. 2d 977, 989 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (\u201carguments based on mere speculation are insufficient to warrant recusal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b647 In <em>In re Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>539 F.2d 357 (4th Cir. 1976), the trial judge was a customer of VEPCO, the plaintiff utility company. The only interest the judge had in the case was a \u201cremote contingent possibility\u201d of sharing in any refund that might be ordered for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>VEPCO customers. <em>Va. Elec., </em>539 F.2d at 366. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">if VEPCO wins the lawsuit, and <em>if </em>it is awarded the entire amount claimed, and <em>if </em>the defendants satisfy the judgment, and <em>if </em>the Virginia State Corporation Commission decides that VEPCO must return to its customers that part of the award representing increased fuel costs, and when VEPCO makes such an adjustment, then the trial judge, as a customer of VEPCO, would get a refund estimated at between $70 and $100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Va. </em>Elec., 539 F.2d at 360 (emphases in original). The court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">[s]uch a contingent interest does not presently exist and will not be created by any judgment that may be entered in this litigation. Neither [the trial judge] nor any other customer of VEPCO will have a claim for refund until, if ever, there occurs an intervening and independent decision of a state agency, the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\"><em>Va. Elec., </em>539 F.2d at 366. The interest being so \u201cremote and speculative,\u201d the court held that recusal was not mandated. <em>Va. Elec., </em>539 F.2d at 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b648 Likewise, as discussed, there are a variety of contingencies and intervening and independent decisions which make the alleged interest in the present case too remote and speculative: <em>if </em>the justices divine correctly which vote (to uphold LR-119 or to strike it down) will give them the best chances for reelection, if the voters pass LR-119 (assuming it is upheld by this Court), if the justices decide to seek reelection, and if the justices draw opponents in their respective elections, then they might conceivably benefit from having sat on this case. Such a theoretical interest does not require disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b649 In reaching this conclusion, we are also mindful of Rule 2.7, which states: \u201cA judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when disqualification is required by Rule 2.12 or other law.\u201d The comment to this rule explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">Although there are times when disqualification is necessary to protect the rights of litigants and preserve public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, judges must be available to decide matters that come before the courts. Unwarranted disqualification may bring public disfavor to the court and to the judge personally. The dignity of the court, the judge\u2019s respect for fulfillment of judicial duties, and a proper concern for the burdens that may be imposed upon the judge\u2019s colleagues require that a judge not use disqualification to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>cases that present difficult, controversial, or unpopular issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\">Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.7 cmt. [1].</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b650  In sum, the ultimate question here is whether the four justices\u2019 impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\u201d Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.12(A). The fact that the justices have \u201cthe potential\u201d to run for reelection, coupled with the fact that LR-119 \u201ccould possibly\u201d hinder their reelection bids, does not establish that the justices\u2019 impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Legislators have presented no other legal theories for recusal. And neither Legislators nor the parties have pointed to any actual evidence of bias, prejudice, or unethical conduct on the part of any justice or judge sitting on this case. Absent evidence to the contrary, the \u201cpresumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators\u201d stands. <em>Withrow, </em>421 U.S. at 47, 95 S. Ct. at 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b651 Having given thoughtful and detailed consideration to Legislators\u2019 concerns under the Due Process Clause, the Code of Judicial Conduct, and \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA, we conclude that the four not-presently-retiring justices are not required to recuse themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b652 <em>Issue 2. Whether Plaintiffs\u2019constitutional challenge to LR-119 is justiciable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Principles of Justiciability and Ripeness</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b653 As stated above, the judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to \u201cjusticiable controversies.\u201d <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. In general terms, a justiciable controversy is one that is \u201cdefinite and concrete, touching legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests\u201d and \u201cadmitting of specific relief through decree of conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts, or upon an abstract proposition.\u201d <em>Chovanak v. Matthews, </em>120 Mont. 520, 526, 188 P.2d 582, 585 (1948) (emphasis omitted). To be justiciable, the parties must have existing and genuine (rather than theoretical) rights or interests, the questions must be presented in an adversary context, and the controversy must be one upon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively and conclusively operate, as distinguished from a dispute invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical, or academic conclusion. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8; <em>Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. City of Billings, </em>2003 MT 332, \u00b6 9, 318 Mont. 407, 80 P.3d 1247. This limitation on judicial power derives primarily from the Montana Constitution, which limits the courts to deciding only cases and controversies, but also from the courts themselves, which have adopted discretionary limitations on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>exercise of judicial power for prudential reasons. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 6; <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 22, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881; <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80. While the constitutional case-or-controversy requirement must always be met, prudential rules may be subject to exceptions. <em>Williamson v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2012 MT 32, \u00b6 28, 364 Mont. 128, 272 P.3d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b654 The central concepts of justiciability have been elaborated into more specific doctrines-advisory opinions, feigned and collusive cases, standing, ripeness, mootness, political questions, and administrative questions-each of which is governed by its own set of substantive rules. <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23. At issue here is ripeness, which is concerned with whether the case presents an \u201cactual, present\u201d controversy. <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 32, 305 Mont. 260, 26 P.3d 91. The basic purpose of the ripeness requirement is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements. <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Portman v. County of Santa Clara, </em>995 F.2d 898, 902-03 (9th Cir. 1993)). Ripeness is predicated on the central perception that courts should not render decisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute; hence, cases are unripe when the parties point only to hypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete conflicts. <em>Wis. C., Ltd. v. Shannon, </em>539 F.3d 751, 759 (7th Cir. 2008); <em>see also Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b655 In analyzing ripeness, it is helpful to understand its relationship to standing and mootness. To meet the constitutional case-or-controversy requirement for standing, the plaintiff must clearly allege a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and the injury must be one that would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 33. Note that standing may rest not only on past or present injury, but also on <em>threatened </em>injury. <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 442-43, 942 P.2d 112, 118 (1997); <em>Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Bd. v. Bd. of Envtl. Rev., </em>282 Mont. 255, 261-63, 937 P.2d 463, 467-68 (1997). Ripeness and mootness, in turn, can be seen as \u201cthe time dimensions of standing.\u201d Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 13B, \u00a7 3531.12,163 (3d ed., Thomson/West 2008). Ripeness asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen or, instead, is too contingent or remote to support present adjudication, whereas mootness asks whether an injury that has happened is too far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>beyond a useful remedy. Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3531.12, 163, \u00a7 3532.1, 383; <em>see also see also Texas v. United States, </em>497 F.3d 491, 496 (5th Cir. 2007) (\u201cIn general terms, standing is concerned with whether a proper party is bringing suit, while ripeness is concerned with whether the suit is being brought at the proper time.\u201d); <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23 (\u201c[M]ootness is the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b656 There is both a constitutional and a prudential component to the ripeness inquiry. <em>Portman, </em>995 F.2d at 902; <em>accord Natl. Park Hospitality Assn. v. Dept. of Int., </em>538 U.S. 803, 808, 123 S. Ct. 2026, 2030 (the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from constitutional limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction); <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6 32 (the ripeness doctrine is grounded in the Constitution as well as in judicial prudence). The constitutional component focuses on whether there is sufficient injury, and thus is closely tied to standing. <em>Portman, </em>995 F.2d at 902-03. \u201cWhether framed as an issue of standing or ripeness, the [constitutional] inquiry is largely the same: whether the issues presented are definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.\u201d <em>Wolfson v. Brammer, </em>616 F.3d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The prudential component, on the other hand, involves a weighing of the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration. <em>Wolfson, </em>616 F.3d at 1060. The principal consideration under the fitness inquiry is whether there is a factually adequate record upon which to base effective review. <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864; see <em>also Portman, </em>995 F.2d at 903. The more the question presented is purely one of law, and the less that additional facts will aid the court in its inquiry, the more likely the issue is to be ripe, and vice-versa. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Application to Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b657 At the outset, it is important to note that we are analyzing the question of ripeness based on the facts that existed on April 12, 2012, when we issued our order affirming the District Court\u2019s March 20 decision (including the District Court\u2019s conclusion that this matter is ripe). As explained, the State requested that we expedite the disposition of this appeal and render our decision by April 13 due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>certain statutory deadlines applicable to the preparation of the June 5, 2012 primary election ballots. We thus issued an order on April 12 announcing the disposition of the appeal and stating that our opinion, analysis, and rationale would follow in due course. The analysis below explains the reasoning behind this Court\u2019s conclusion, on April 12, that Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b658 Starting with the constitutional component of ripeness, the Legislature has placed a referendum on the June 5 ballot concerning the election of Supreme Court justices. If passed, the statutory changes outlined in the referendum are effective immediately. They will change the manner in which justices are elected to Seats 5 and 6 (presently held by Justice Nelson and Justice Morris, respectively), which are up for election this year. The deadline to file as a candidate for those seats was March 12. While all registered voters in the state may vote in the June primary election for the candidates running for Seats 5 and 6, only registered voters in the Fifth and Sixth Supreme Court districts, respectively, will be permitted to vote for those seats in the November general election (if LR-119 is adopted). Plaintiffs challenge LR-119 as impermissibly amending the constitutionally established qualifications for, and selection of, Supreme Court justices by creating a residency requirement and thereby disenfranchising Plaintiffs. They allege a threatened injury because LR-119, should it pass, will deprive them of their right to vote for each seat on the Supreme Court. For those Plaintiffs who do not reside in the Fifth and Sixth Supreme Court districts, the disenfranchisement will occur this election cycle. The issues presented are definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract, and this case thus presents a controversy in the constitutional sense. <em>Cf. Air Pollution Control Bd., </em>282 Mont. at 262-63, 937 P.2d at 468 (\u201cpotential economic harm\u201d is sufficient to establish a threatened injury); <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 443-44, 942 P.2d at 118-19 (although the challenged deviate-sexual-conduct statute had never been enforced against consenting adults and no prosecution under the statute was imminent, plaintiffs established a threatened injury because the statute was only 24 years old, it had been amended as recently as 1991, the Legislature had decided three times in the preceding seven years not to repeal the statute, plaintiffs were the individuals the statute was designed to impact, and there was nothing to prevent a county attorney from enforcing the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b659 Turning to prudential considerations, we must weigh the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration. In this regard, this Court has noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that \u201c[j]udicial intervention in referenda or initiatives prior to an election is not encouraged.\u201d <em>Cobb v. State, 278 </em>Mont. 307, 310, 924 P.2d 268, 269 (1996). We have reasoned that to effectively protect and preserve the rights which Montanans have reserved to themselves to change the laws or the Constitution through the initiative process, Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 4, art. XIV, \u00a7 9, and to approve or reject by referendum legislative acts (except appropriations of money) and proposed constitutional amendments, Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 5, art. XTV, \u00a7 8, pre-election judicial review should not be routinely conducted. <em>State ex rel. Boese v.

Such deference and restraint do not apply, however, where a challenged measure is facially defective. In that event, the courts have a duty to exercise jurisdiction and declare the measure invalid. <em>See e.g. State ex rel. Steen v. Murray, </em>144 Mont. 61, 69, 394 P.2d 761, 765 (1964) (enjoining the Secretary of State from placing on the ballot an initiative that was \u201cunquestionably and palpably unconstitutional on its face\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Harper v. Waltermire, </em>213 Mont. 425, 428, 691 P.2d 826, 828 (1984) (entertaining a pre-election challenge to an initiative that, on its face, was \u201cbeyond the power of initiative granted the people by the Montana Constitution\u201d); <em>cf.

It instead creates a sham out of the voting process by conveying the false appearance that a vote on the measure counts for something, when in fact the measure is invalid regardless of how the electors vote. Placing it on the ballot would also be a waste of time and money for all involved-putting the Secretary of State, local election officials, and ultimately taxpayers to the expense of the election; putting proponents and opponents to the expense of needless campaigning; and putting voters to the task of deciding a ballot issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>which this Court already knows cannot stand even if passed. Deferring decision to a later date so the measure can go forward is senseless. It consumes resources with no corresponding benefit. Nothing in ripeness doctrine mandates such an approach. Indeed, \u201cthe prudential concerns of the ripeness doctrine [are] not implicated\u201d where \u201cthe possible constitutional infirmity [is] clear on the face\u201d of the measure. <em>Portman, </em>995 F.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b660  In the present case, the record is factually adequate to enable the court to make the necessary legal determinations. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 20. The question presented is purely one of law, and no additional facts will aid the court in its inquiry. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 20. As explained below under Issue 3, the constitutional infirmity is clear on the face of the measure in that LR-119 attempts to amend the Constitution by means of a statutory referendum. Furthermore, as explained under Issue 4, the constitutionally infirm portions of LR-119 cannot be severed from the remainder of the referendum. The issues are fit for judicial decision, and the hardship of withholding consideration of those issues would be great for the reasons just discussed. Accordingly, we conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to LR-119 is ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b661 <em>Issue 3. Whether LR-119 is constitutionally defective.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">The Constitutional Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b662 Article VII, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution specifies the \u201c[qualifications\u201d of Supreme Court justice and district court judge. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">A citizen of the United States who has resided in the state two years immediately before taking office is eligible to the office of supreme court justice or district court judge if admitted to the practice of law in Montana for at least five years prior to the date of appointment or election. Qualifications and methods of selection of judges of other courts shall be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Mont Const, art. VII, \u00a7 9(1). Thus, to be eligible to the office of Supreme Court justice or district court judge, the person must (1) be a citizen of the United States, (2) have resided in Montana for two years immediately before taking office, and (3) have been admitted to the practice of law in Montana for at least five years prior to the date of appointment or election. Article VII, Section 9(1) contemplates that the qualifications for these offices are dictated solely by the Constitution. This much is apparent from the last sentence of Article VII, Section 9(1), which states that \u201c[qualifications and methods of selection of judges of <em>other </em>courts shall be provided <em>by law\u201d </em>(emphases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>added), a clear indicator that the Legislature may establish the qualifications and methods of selection of judges of other courts, but the qualifications and methods of selection of Supreme Court justices and district court judges are set by the Constitution alone and consist of the foregoing three criteria-no more, no less. Even without the last sentence, however, this Court has held that the Legislature may not add to or subtract from the constitutional qualifications to hold a particular office.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b663 In addition to Section 9(1), certain other sections of Article VII are pertinent here. Section 1 mandates three types of courts-\u201cone supreme court, district courts, [and] justice courts\u201d-and permits the Legislature to establish \u201cother courts.\u201d The creation of judicial districts is addressed in Section 6. Section 6(1) directs the Legislature to \u201cdivide the state into judicial districts and provide for the number of judges in each district,\u201d with each district \u201cformed of compact territory and ... bounded by county lines.\u201d Although the Legislature may change the number and boundaries of judicial districts and the number of judges in each district, Section 6(2) states that \u201cno change in boundaries or the number of districts or judges therein shall work a removal of any judge from office during the term for which he was elected or appointed.\u201d Section 5 addresses justices of the peace. Section 5(1) specifies that at least one justice of the peace shall be elected \u201cin each county,\u201d with qualifications \u201cprovided by law.\u201d Section 9(4) requires Supreme Court justices-i.e., persons who have been elected to the office of Supreme Court justice-to reside \u201cwithin the state.\u201d In contrast, Section 9(4) provides that, during his or her term of office, a district court judge shall reside \u201cin the district\u201d in which the judge was elected or appointed, and a justice of the peace shall reside \u201cin the county\u201d in which the justice of the peace was elected or appointed. Section 9(4) states that the residency requirement for \u201cevery other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>judge\u201d must be provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b664 The language and structure of these sections demonstrate that the Constitution intends Supreme Court justices to be elected and serve on a statewide basis, district court judges to be elected and serve on a district-wide basis, and justices of the peace to be elected and serve on a countywide basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When a justice or judge is to be selected from a discrete geographic area, the Constitution states that requirement expressly-as it does with district court judges and justices of the peace. The election of representatives and senators from \u201cdistricts\u201d is likewise explicit in the Constitution. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 14. With respect to Supreme Court justices, however, the Constitution could, but does not, specify district elections. To the contrary, the residency requirements in Section 9(4) plainly contemplate that Supreme Court justice, district court judge, and justice of the peace are \u201cstate,\u201d \u201cdistrict,\u201d and \u201ccount/\u2019 offices, respectively. This conclusion is consistent with the constitutional history discussed later in this Opinion. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 80-81, <em>infra. </em>As explained there, the 1972 Constitutional Convention delegates debated whether justices and judges should be elected, appointed, or some combination of the two, but the assumption of all who spoke on the question was that, under whatever system the delegates finally adopted, Supreme Court justices would be selected on a statewide basis and district court judges would be selected on a district-specific basis. The Constitutional Convention record thus supports our \u201cstructural\u201d analysis of Article VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b665 This structure is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s function. Under Article VII, Section 2, the Supreme Court has statewide appellate jurisdiction, general supervisory control over \u201call other courts,\u201d authority to make rules governing practice and procedure for \u201call other courts,\u201d and authority to make rules governing admission to the bar and the conduct of its members. Given this statewide jurisdiction, it would be incongruous to interpret the Constitution as contemplating a Supreme Court made up of justices who are elected from districts and implicitly \u201crepresent\u201d regional interests. Such an interpretation would be inimical to the judicial function.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their judgment is best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>informed, and therefore most dependable, within narrow limits. Their essential quality is detachment, founded on independence. History teaches that the independence of the judiciary is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in choosing between competing political, economic and social pressures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><em>Dennis v.

Legislative and executive officials serve in representative capacities, as agents of the people, whose primary function is to advance the interests of their constituencies. Judges, in contrast,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">are not political actors. They do not sit as representatives of particular persons, communities, or parties; they serve no faction or constituency. \u201c[I]t is the business of judges to be indifferent to popularity.\u201d <em>[Chisom v.

Rehnquist, Dedicatory Address: Act Well Your Part: Therein All Honor Lies, 7 Pepperdine L. Rev. 227, 229-300 (1980). Even when they develop common law or give concrete meaning to constitutional text, judges act only in the context of individual cases, the outcome of which cannot depend on the will of the public. See <em>[W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, </em>319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 1185-86 (1943)] (\u201cOne\u2019s right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Republican Party of Minn. v.

The obligation of Supreme Court justices is to interpret and apply the law on a uniform basis statewide. The requirements and protections of the Constitution and the law do not vary from one county or district to another. They are the same whether one is from Yaak, Broadus, Wisdom, or Plentywood. Ethical rules do not permit judges to \u201crepresent\u201d particular constituencies or interest groups. <em>See </em>Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct, Rule 2.2 (Impartiality and Fairness), Rule 2.3 (Bias, Prejudice, and Harassment). These principles are implicit in the constitutional design, which establishes the office of Supreme Court justice as one subject to selection by electors statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>LR-119\u2019s Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b666 Current statutes are consistent with Article VII. Section 3-2-102(1), MCA, states that a person is not eligible for the office of Supreme Court justice \u201cunless the person is a citizen of the United States, has resided in the state 2 years immediately before taking office, and has been admitted to practice law in Montana for at least 5 years prior to the date of appointment or election.\u201d Section 3-2-102(2), MCA, states that Supreme Court justices must reside \u201cwithin the state\u201d during their terms of office. And \u00a7 3-2-101, MCA, states that Supreme Court justices are elected by the qualified electors of \u201cthe state at large.\u201d LR-119 would amend this system in two ways. \u00b667 First, LR-119 would create new qualifications for the office of Supreme Court justice. Specifically, it would add the following italicized language to \u00a7 3-2-102, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">(1) A person is not eligible for the office of justice of the supreme court unless the person is a citizen of the United States, has resided in the state 2 years immediately before taking office, and has been admitted to practice law in Montana for at least 5 years prior to the date of appointment or election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">(2) Justices of the supreme court must reside within the state during their terms of office. <em>Once elected from a district, a justice is not required to reside within the district during the justice\u2019s service in office.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\n<em>(3) A supreme court justice must, at the time of initial election, be a qualified elector of the supreme court district from which the justice is elected. A supreme court justice appointed to fill a vacancy must, at the time of appointment, be a qualified elector of the same initial supreme court district as the justice being replaced, and in an election following an appointment, the elected justice must be a qualified elector of the initial district.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7 2. Hence, in addition to (1) being a citizen of the United States who (2) has resided in Montana for two years immediately before taking office and (3) has been admitted to practice law in Montana for at least five years prior to the date of appointment or election, the person would also have to (4) \u201cbe a qualified elector\u201d of the Supreme Court district from which the person is elected or appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b668 [5] The Constitution defines \u201cqualified elector\u201d as \u201c[a]ny citizen of the United States 18 years of age or older who meets the registration and residence requirements provided by law ....\u201d Mont. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 2; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 13-1-101(10), MCA (\u201c \u2018Elector\u2019 means an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>qualified to vote under state law.\u201d). Among the qualifications to vote, a person must be \u201cregistered as required by law\u201d and be \u201ca resident... of the county in which the person offers to vote for at least 30 days.\u201d Section 13-l-lll(l)(a), (c), MCA. Thus, in requiring the person to be a \u201cqualified elector of the supreme court district,\u201d LR-119 would effectively create two new qualifications for Supreme Court justice: at the time of election or appointment, the justice (a) must be registered to vote and (b) must be a resident not merely of \u201cthe state,\u201d but of <em>a specific portion of </em>the state-specifically, a county within the Supreme Court district from which the justice is elected or appointed. We agree with the District Court that LR-119\u2019s attempt to add these qualifications is unconstitutional. The problem is not that LR-119 would amend \u00a7 3-2-102, MCA. The problem, rather, is that the amendments to this statute would effectively amend the Constitution. As we have stated, when the Constitution has prescribed the qualifications required to hold a particular office, neither the Legislature nor the people have the power to supplement the constitutional pronouncement by prescribing additional qualifications. <em>Anaconda Copper Mining, </em>30 Mont. at 537, 77 P. at 315; <em>Chenoweth, </em>31 Mont. at 44, 77 P. at 302; <em>Palagi, </em>113 Mont. at 357, 126 P.2d at 826. To be sure, the Constitution is clear that the right and power of government derives from and originates with the people, and the people may alter the Constitution whenever they deem it necessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet, while the people may amend the Constitution, they may not violate it in the process. The Constitution prescribes the specific methods for making amendments. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. XIV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 8, 9. Statutory measures are not one of the constitutionally allowed methods. Accordingly, LR-119\u2019s attempt to create new qualifications for Supreme Court justice by means of a statutory referendum is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b669 Second, LR-119 would alter the structure of the Supreme Court. It would revise \u00a7 3-2-101, MCA, to delete the language \u201c[the justices] are elected by the qualified electors of the state at large\u201d and replace it with \u201c[each justice is] elected from a separate district of the state\u201d as provided in Section 3. LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7 1. Section 3 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>referendum defines the Supreme Court districts. Thus, rather than statewide elections, LR-119 would mandate district-based elections. \u00b670 In many respects, LR-119\u2019s proposed system for selecting justices is identical to the Constitution\u2019s existing system for selecting senators and representatives. Article V, Section 14(1) provides that \u201c[t]he state shall be divided into as many districts as there are members of the house, and each district shall elect one representative.\u201d LR-119 likewise provides that the state shall be divided into seven districts (the number of Supreme Court justices) and specifies that \u201c[t]here must be one supreme court justice selected from each district.\u201d LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7 3(1), (2). Article V, Section 14(1) provides that \u201c[e]ach district shall consist of compact and contiguous territory\u201d and \u201c[a]ll districts shall be as nearly equal in population as is practicable.\u201d LR-119 likewise provides that \u201c[t]he legislature shall review the districts after each decennial census for purposes of maintaining districts with approximately equal populations while following county lines.\u201d LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7 3(3). Article V, Section 4 requires a candidate for the Legislature to \u201cbe a resident of the county if it contains one or more districts or of the district if it contains all or parts of more than one county\u201d for six months next preceding the general election. LR-119 likewise requires a candidate for the Supreme Court to be a qualified elector (i.e., registered voter, and resident for at least 30 days) of the district from which the candidate is elected. LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Essentially, then, LR-119 would transform the Supreme Court into a representative body identical to the Legislature in the method of selection, but tasked with a judicial function instead of a legislative function. Notably, the State characterizes \u201cthe intent of the law\u201d as being \u201cto tie Justices to the districts from which they are elected.\u201d LR-119 also would eliminate the right presently held by all Montana voters to select all seven justices of the Supreme Court. Each voter would have the right to select only the one justice whose seat corresponds with the voter\u2019s district.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b671 As with the attempt to add qualifications to the office of Supreme Court justice, however, this attempt to alter the structure of the Supreme Court by making it into a representative body composed of members elected from districts is likewise facially unconstitutional. Neither the Legislature nor the people have the power to alter the constitutionally established structure of government by means of a statutory referendum. Again, such amendments to the Constitution must be made through one of the methods permitted by the Constitution itself. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. XIV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b672 The State argues two theories for sustaining LR-119. We address these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The State\u2019s Article VII, Section 8(1) Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b673 First, the State contends that LR-119 \u201cdoes not impermissibly add to or change\u201d the Constitution, but instead \u201cimplements\u201d the Constitution pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(1), which states: \u201cSupreme court justices and district court judges shall be elected by the qualified electors as provided by law.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, the \u201cas provided by law\u201d clause permits the statutory creation of electoral districts in which Supreme Court candidates must reside and from which the justices must be elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b674 We disagree with the State\u2019s reading of this provision. For starters, Article VII, Section 8, which is titled \u201cSelection,\u201d does not purport to address the qualifications of Supreme Court justice. Those are covered exclusively in Article VII, Section 9, which is titled \u201cQualifications.\u201d Significantly, there are a number of provisions in the Constitution explicitly granting the Legislature authority to set the \u201cqualifications\u201d for certain public offices.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Article VII, Section 8(1), however, is not one of them. Hence, this provision is not authority for LR-119\u2019s addition of qualifications (i.e., voter-registration and residency requirements) to the office of Supreme Court justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b675 Nor is Article VII, Section 8(1) authority to convert the Supreme Court itself from a statewide elected body into a district-based representative body. As adopted in 1972, Article VII, Section 8 provided that: (1) vacancies on the Supreme Court or a district court shall be filled by nomination of the Governor or the Chief Justice, and the nomination shall be confirmed by the Senate, but if the nomination is made while the Senate is not in session, then the nomination shall be effective as an appointment until the end of the next session; (2) at the first election after Senate confirmation, and at the election before each succeeding term of office, the name of the incumbent justice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>judge shall be placed on the ballot, either for a contested election if there is an opposing candidate, or for the voters to approve or reject the incumbent justice or judge if there is no election contest; and (3) if an incumbent does not run, then there shall be an election for the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b676 In 1991, the 52nd Montana Legislature passed House Bill 353 (HB 353), which submitted to the electors various amendments to Article VII, Section 8. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 1991, ch. 475. Representative Bill Strizich introduced HB 353 in the Legislature, at the request of then-Secretary of State Mike Cooney, to close a perceived \u201cloophole\u201d in Article VII, Section 8. The issue was brought to the fore when Justice Gulbrandson retired from this Court on August 31, 1989. His seat (Seat 1) was set to expire on January 6, 1991. Governor Stephens nominated District Court Judge Diane Barz to fill the vacancy. The Governor also nominated Maurice Colberg Jr. to fill a similar vacancy on the Thirteenth Judicial District Court and Larry W. Moran to fill a similar vacancy on the Eighteenth Judicial District Court. Since the Senate was not in session at the time, it did not consider confirmation of these nominations. On March 14,1990, Gene Huntley attempted to file for Seat 1 (then held by Justice Barz); however, the Secretary of State rejected Huntley\u2019s declaration based on a 1987 opinion of the Attorney General (42 Op. Atty. Gen. Mont. No. 31) which concluded that no election for a judicial position can occur until the Senate has confirmed a serving nominee. The case ultimately reached this Court, which agreed with the Attorney General and held that a nominee for Supreme Court justice or district court judge \u201cneed not stand for election until the next election after the Senate\u2019s confirmation of the nominee.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Racicot v. First Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>243 Mont. 379, 391, 794 P.2d 1180, 1187 (1990). Interpreting Article VII, Section8,the Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">the general constitutional rule is that appointees and nonappointees shall stand for contested and uncontested elections at the general elections prior to the expiration of each judicial term. The exception to that general rule provides that when the Senate has not had an opportunity to confirm a nominee, the nominee must stand for election for the first time at the next election following Senate confirmation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>Racicot, </em>243 Mont. at 391,794 P.2d at 1187. Hence, because the Senate had not yet considered the nominations of Justice Barz and Judges Colberg and Moran, the Secretary of State was not required to place their offices on the 1990 ballot. Presumably, Senate confirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>would occur when the Legislature next met in 1991, and the first elections for these positions would occur in 1992. This Court held that the resulting \u201choldover\u201d situation (where a nominee could serve past the expiration of the predecessor\u2019s term) was mandated by the Constitution. <em>Racicot, </em>243 Mont. at 385-86, 794 P.2d at 1183-84. Nevertheless, the Court suggested that \u201cit would be wise for the Legislature to consider amendment of the Constitution\u201d given \u201cthe potential for unreasonable results and even abuses of the judicial selection system\u201d inherent in the scheme created by Article VII, Section 8. <em>Racicot, </em>243 Mont. at 391, 794 P.2d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b677 That is the problem to which the Section 8 amendments were addressed. HB 353 added what is now Section 8(1) and amended other parts of Section 8 for the specific purpose of ensuring that appointees would face election in a timely manner and that no appointee could serve past the expiration of his or her predecessor\u2019s term without standing for election. Notably, Representative Strizich indicated at the February 1, 1991 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee that the intent of HB 353 was \u201cto protect the voter\u2019s right to vote for Supreme Court and District Court judges.\u201d Likewise, contrary to the State\u2019s and Legislators\u2019 arguments in the present case, Secretary of State Cooney noted at that same hearing and at the March 26, 1991 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee: \u201cIn 1990, <em>every voter in this state </em>was denied the right to vote for their candidate of choice for a Supreme Court seat.... House Bill 353 will strengthen our Constitution and it will affirm the right of <em>all Montanans </em>to vote for those who govern our state.\u201d (Emphases added.) The purpose of the measure, Cooney explained, was \u201cto amend the constitution to mandate the election of judges and justices at the times prescribed by law.\u201d After voters approved the measure in November 1992 <em>(see </em>Laws of Montana, 1993, Ballot Issues, Const. Amend. No. 22), the Legislature amended certain statutes specifically addressed to these issues (see Laws of Montana, 1993, ch. 377 (amending \u00a7\u00a7 3-1-1013 and -1014, MCA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b678 Thus, HB 353 was a <em>timing </em>measure. Nothing in the plain language of Article VII, Section 8 (as amended) or in the history of HB 353 indicates that the 1992 amendments were intended-or even contemplated-to grant the Legislature power to convert the Supreme Court from an institution composed of members elected on a statewide basis into a representative body composed of members elected from separate districts. The State is mistaken in its claim that Section 8(1) grants such authority. If anything, the proponents\u2019 views indicate that HB 353 was intended to <em>strengthen </em>the right of \u201call Montanans\u201d to vote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for Supreme Court justices, not take that right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The State\u2019s Con-Con Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b679 The State\u2019s second theory is premised on the records from the 1972 Constitutional Convention (Con-Con). In this regard, Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that the relevant language of Article VII is unambiguous and, thus, resort to the Con-Con records is unnecessary. But to the extent the transcripts of the Con-Con debates may be considered, Plaintiffs argue that the delegates\u2019 remarks reflect an intention to broadly empower the electorate to vote for Supreme Court justices on a statewide basis. In response, the State asserts that \u201c[t]he individual delegates\u2019 statements . . . should not be considered by the Court.\u201d Instead, the State focuses on the fact that Delegate David L. Holland\u2019s proposed amendment to Article VII did not pass. Having reviewed the relevant portion of the Con-Con record, however, we disagree with the significance the State attributes to the failure of Delegate Holland\u2019s amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b680 As discussed <em>in Racicot, </em>243 Mont. at 387-88, 794 P.2d at 1184-85, the Judiciary Committee presented the delegates with two different proposals. The majority proposal provided for the selection of justices and judges primarily through general elections, while the minority proposal provided for the selection of justices and judges through a system of appointment with an approval-or-rejection election for each succeeding term. The delegates voted to adopt the minority proposal, but then, in a series of debates and amendments before the committee of the whole, broadened its election provisions. In the midst of those debates, Delegate Holland moved to amend part of the minority proposal by substituting the following language taken from Section 6 of the majority proposal: \u201cThe justices of the Supreme Court shall be elected by the electors of the state at large, and the term of the office of the justices of the Supreme Court, except as in this Constitution otherwise provided, shall be six years.\u201d <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Feb. 29, 1972, p. 1086; Montana Constitutional Convention, Judiciary Committee Proposal, Feb. 17, 1972, vol. I, p. 487. Ultimately, this amendment failed by a narrow margin. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Feb. 29, 1972, p. 1099. And from this fact, the State posits that \u201cthe attempt to constitutionally require the election of Supreme Court Justices at-large was rejected by the convention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b681 We cannot agree with this inference. Delegate Holland\u2019s amendment was the third of five proposals that were placed before the delegates concerning the selection of Supreme Court justices and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>district court judges. The sole question being debated at the time was whether justices and judges should be elected, appointed, or some combination of the two. There is no indication in the delegates\u2019 discussion that they objected to the \u201cstate at large\u201d portion of Delegate Holland\u2019s proposal. To the contrary, the assumption of all who spoke on the question was that, under whatever system the delegates finally adopted, Supreme Court justices would be selected on a statewide basis and district court judges would be selected on a district-specific basis. A careful reading of the transcript reveals that Delegate Holland\u2019s amendment was rejected because a majority of the delegates favored an approach involving merit-based appointments with the justice or judge having to stand for election at each succeeding term. It would be extraordinary to conclude that the delegates intended by their vote on Delegate Holland\u2019s amendment to \u201creject\u201d Montana\u2019s decades-old system of electing Supreme Court justices by the electors of the state at large, without even a single word by any of the delegates directed to this issue and without any language to this effect in Constitution itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b682  In sum, LR-119 would create new qualifications for the office of Supreme Court justice by requiring each justice to be a \u201cqualified elector\u201d-i.e., a registered voter and resident-of the Supreme Court district from which the justice is elected or appointed. In addition, LR-119 would alter the structure of the Supreme Court by converting it from a statewide elected institution into a district-based representative body. Correspondingly, LR-119 would eliminate the right presently held by all Montana voters to select all seven justices of the Supreme Court. Legislators argue extensively in their amicus brief that the process of electing justices from smaller, local districts from around the state has \u201cinherent value.\u201d However, this case is not about the wisdom or \u201cvalue\u201d of the changes proposed by LR-119. The point, rather, is that these changes constitute amendments to the Constitution, which cannot be achieved by means of a statutory referendum. Accordingly, we hold that LR-119 is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b683 <em>Issue 4. Whether the constitutionally infirm provisions of LR-119 can he severed from the remainder of the referendum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b684 As noted at the outset, LR-119 would effect three changes concerning the qualifications and selection of Supreme Court justices. First, it would require a candidate to be a qualified elector of the district from which the candidate is elected. Second, it would require that each justice be elected from a separate district and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>correspondingly take away the present right of all Montana voters to select all seven justices. Third, it would change the method of selecting the chief justice from a statewide election to a selection by the seven justices from among their number. Based on the analysis under Issue 3, the first and second of these changes are facially unconstitutional. Plaintiffs have not challenged the third change concerning the selection of the chief justice, and thus we shall assume (without deciding) that this change is not unconstitutional. The question, then, is whether the provisions creating new qualifications and district-based elections can be severed from the provisions modifying how the chief justice is selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b685 In this regard, the State points out that LR-119 contains a severability section, which states: \u201cIf a part of [this act] is invalid, all valid parts that are severable from the invalid part remain in effect. If a part of [this act] is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains in effect in all valid applications that are severable from the invalid applications.\u201d LR-119 (SB 268), \u00a7 6 (brackets in original). The State and Legislators argue that severability could be accomplished here and that the remainder of the referendum could go to the electorate. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the District Court got it right when it concluded that the invalid portions of the referendum cannot be severed from the rest. We agree with Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"AoH\">\u00b686 It is a well-established principle that a statute is not destroyed in toto because of an improper provision, unless such provision is necessary to the integrity of the statute or was the inducement to its enactment. <em>Hill v.

In other words, this was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201cinducement\u201d for LR-119\u2019s enactment, and thus \u201cjudicial severability policy\u201d does not apply. <em>See Sheehy, </em>262 Mont. at 141, 864 P.2d at 770. The District Court also expressed concern with the State\u2019s and Legislators\u2019 suggestion that the court should somehow revise LR-119 to edit out major portions in an effort to salvage some small part that might pass constitutional muster. The court reasoned that the principle of separation of powers commits the drafting of legislation to the Legislature, not the courts. The court noted that in reviewing challenges to ballot initiatives proposed by the electorate, a district court has authority to rewrite the ballot statements on the proposed initiatives but not to rewrite the initiatives themselves. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-316, MCA. Here, the court stated, \u201c[wjithout clear judicial legislation, this Court cannot re-write the remaining parts of this referendum. To do so would entail completely re-writing the title, the ballot statement, the statements of implication, and the text of the referendum itself. There is no constitutional or statutory authority for such a revision.\u201d In sum, the District Court concluded that if it \u201csevered the invalid parts, the remaining provisions are neither a complete statutory scheme nor do they reflect what induced the Legislature to pass LR-119 in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b688  Neither the State nor Legislators refute the District Court\u2019s reasoning. Nor do they suggest that it would be proper for the courts to rewrite this referendum in order to salvage some small part of it. Legislators maintain that the change to how the chief justice is selected is \u201cindependent\u201d of the other changes effected by LR-119 and is itself constitutional. However, even assuming this to be true for the sake of argument, we agree with the District Court that changing how the chief justice is selected was not the inducement for passing LR-119.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the District Court noted, salvaging this part of the referendum would involve completely rewriting the title, the ballot statement, the statements of implication, and the text of the referendum itself \u2014 which the courts are not situated to do. For these reasons, we conclude that the constitutionally infirm portions of LR-119 cannot be severed from the remainder of the referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b689 Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude and hold that Justices Rice, Wheat, Cotter, and Baker are not required to recuse themselves from sitting on this case; that this case presents a justiciable controversy; that LR-119\u2019s proposed amendments to the qualifications and structure of the Supreme Court are facially unconstitutional; and that the provision regarding the selection of the chief justice is not severable from LR-119\u2019s constitutionally infirm provisions.

City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864 (quoting <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 32, 305 Mont. 260, 26 P.3d 91). We have followed the guiding principle that \u201ccourts should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079; <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6 10, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211. The Court cites to no case in which a court has determined a statute to be ripe for constitutional challenge before it was enacted. Prior to approval by the voters, the constitutional dispute at issue regarding residency qualifications and district elections for Supreme Court justices does not rise above an abstract difference of opinion. Depending on the election results, there may never have been a constitutional issue to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b697 The Court determines that LR-119 presents unique grounds for pre-election review because of its effect in the current election cycle, observing that the measure threatened to disenfranchise voters outside the Fifth and Sixth Supreme Court Districts. (Opinion \u00b6 58.) The Court\u2019s concerns, however, conflate the merits of the constitutional issues with the timing of their consideration. The legislature clearly was within its authority to order a special election in conjunction with the June 5 primary election. Mont. Const, art. III, \u00a7 6; <em>State ex rel. Gould v. Cooney, </em>253 Mont. 90, 94, 831 P.2d 593, 595 (1992). At that election, all Montana voters would have been given the opportunity to vote on LR-119, and all Montana voters would have been able to vote for all Supreme Court positions on the ballot. If, and only if, LR-119 passed would anyone\u2019s right to vote have been affected in the general election. As illustrated by the efficiency with which this appeal was briefed, considered and decided, we easily could have held the appeal in abeyance, awaited certification of the June 5 election results, and decided the case-if necessary-within a few weeks. The only impact may have been a few weeks of lost statewide campaigning time by successful primary candidates, but they are not even parties to the challenge. Ironically, the only \u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d of voters results from the Court\u2019s decision to remove LR-119 from the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u00b698 The Court\u2019s ruling that the measure\u2019s facial invalidity requires its immediate consideration also is unconvincing. First, the District Court acknowledged, and the Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute, that not all provisions of LR-119 are facially unconstitutional. The District Court agreed that the Montana Constitution does not prohibit the legislature from creating Supreme Court districts or from having the Chief Justice selected by the other members of the Court. Whether or not these provisions, if constitutional, could be severed from the measure would have been appropriate and better suited for consideration only if the referendum passed and became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b699 Finally, the Court holds that it would have been a \u201cwaste of time and money\u201d to place the measure on the ballot. (Opinion \u00b6 59.) Although I agree that delays in this case, including the State\u2019s inexplicable failure to secure a stay of the District Court\u2019s decision, were regrettable and have made the process tortuous and more costly than necessary, these types of emergencies are not uncommon in election matters and the court system is equipped to deal with them. I cannot ascribe \u201cno corresponding benefit\u201d (Opinion \u00b6 59) to the fulfillment of our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of the right of initiative and referendum. The \u201cconsum[ption of] resources\u201d in this case (Opinion \u00b6 59) is not sufficient to outweigh the people\u2019s right to vote. The Court\u2019s decision to protect the voters from a measure referred by the legislature is patronizing and elevates judicial economy above respect for the constitutional process and the people\u2019s role in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b6100 We should decline to interfere with the initiative and referendum process \u201cunless it appears to be absolutely essential.\u201d <em>Mont. Citizens for the Preservation of Citizens\u2019 Rights, </em>224 Mont. at 276, 729 P.2d at 1285. Because a decision on the constitutional issues could have been rendered quickly following the primary election had the referendum passed, the Court\u2019s interference now is not, in my view, \u201cabsolutely essential.\u201d I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"Aci\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>LEGISLATIVE REFERENDUM NO. 119 BALLOT LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"Adp\">LEGISLATIVE REFERENDUM NO. 119</p>\n<p id=\"Azv\">AN ACT REFERRED BY THE LEGISLATURE</p>\n<p id=\"AQq\">AN ACT REQUIRING THAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES BE ELECTED AND APPOINTED FROM SUPREME COURT DISTRICTS; ESTABLISHING SUPREME COURT DISTRICTS; PROVIDING THAT THE PROPOSED ACT BE SUBMITTED TO THE QUALIFIED ELECTORS OF MONTANA AT A SPECIAL ELECTION TO BE HELD CONCURRENTLY WITH THE 2012 PRIMARY ELECTION; AMENDING SECTIONS 3-2-101 AND 3-2-102, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE AND AN APPLICABILITY DATE.</p>\n<p id=\"AuN\">The Montana Supreme Court is composed of seven justices, one of whom Is Chief Justice.
