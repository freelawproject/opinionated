(SC&amp;F) and reversing the decision of the Board of Labor Appeals. \u00b62 We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling and address the following</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\"><em>\u00b63 Did the District Court err by determining that SC&amp;F is not chargeable for a pro rata share of the unemployment insurance benefits paid to a former employee because the employee voluntarily terminated her </em>employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b64 SC&amp;F is a radio broadcasting company based in Missoula, Montana. Joni Mielke (Mielke) was employed by SC&amp;F as a radio personality. Mielke and SC&amp;F entered a one-year contract covering the time period from June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009. Mielke performed programming, live \u201cremotes\u201d at station events, production, and voice tracking duties for SC&amp;F. During the term of employment, SC&amp;F evaluated Mielke as being an excellent radio personality and announcer but as underperforming other responsibilities because she either did not want to do them or preferred announcing-related duties. During the one-year contract period, SC&amp;F\u2019s president Sheila Callahan and CFO Max Murphy discussed with Mielke the possibility of reconfiguring the contract for 2009-2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">\u00b65 SC&amp;F offered Mielke a one year contract for the 2009-2010 term with a different payment schedule and slightly different job duties. On May 28, 2009, shortly before the expiration of the 2008-2009 contract, Mielke sent the following e-mail to Murphy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">Even before you handed me the new contract to consider, I had concerns about making a commitment for the next year. After discussing it with my family we decided it would be best if I focus on helping my mother through her current health crisis instead of accepting your offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">I am grateful for the opportunity you and Sheila have given me here. I honestly mean that ... thank you. So, I\u2019m scheduled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>work Saturday until 6 and I know there is a remote that day ... will my final check be June 3rd?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b66 Mielke completed an exit interview prior to her departure and completed a form used by SC&amp;F for departing employees. On the form, Mielke indicated her reason for leaving was that she had \u201cquit\u201d and that her letter explaining why was \u201con file.\u201d Mielke initialed the exit interview form next to each entry, including the entry indicating her reason for leaving was that she had quit, and she also signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">\u00b67 After Mielke left her employment with SC&amp;F, she was hired by another radio station. After a brief employment with this subsequent employer, she was laid off and filed for unemployment benefits in October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b68 The Department of Labor and Industry (Department) sent a Notice of Chargeability Determination to SC&amp;F assessing a pro rata share of the costs of Mielke\u2019s unemployment insurance benefits to SC&amp;F\u2019s experience rating account. The Department administratively determined that Mielke was employed for SC&amp;F on a contract basis during her base period of employment and that SC&amp;F\u2019s account was chargeable for a portion of benefits drawn by Mielke. SC&amp;F requested a redetermination, arguing that Mielke had voluntarily left her employment. The Department issued a Redetermination on May 18, 2010, affirming the initial Determination. An administrative hearing was then conducted by telephone on January 7, 2011. The hearing officer determined that Mielke neither voluntarily quit nor was discharged for misconduct and affirmed the decision to charge SC&amp;F\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b69 SC&amp;F appealed to the Board of Labor Appeals (Board). The Board conducted a hearing and held that, under applicable statutes and rules, Mielke did not voluntarily terminate her employment but had \u201cworked out the terms of her employment contract,\u201d which was of limited duration, and that SC&amp;F\u2019s rating account was chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">\u00b610 SC&amp;F petitioned the District Court for judicial review. The District Court reversed the decision of the Board, holding that Mielke clearly stated she voluntarily left employment with SC&amp;F due to a family illness, not because her contract was expiring, although continued employment was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b611 The Department appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u00b612 Findings of the Board of Labor Appeals as to the facts are conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court will be confined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>questions of law if the findings are supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud. Section 39-51-2410(5), MCA; <em>Johnson v. W. Transp., LLC, </em>2011 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 359 Mont. 145, 247 P.3d 1094 (citations omitted). \u201cSupported by evidence\u201d means supported by substantial evidence, which is \u201csomething more than a scintilla of evidence, but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Am. <em>Agrijusters Co. v. Mont. Dept. of Lab. and </em>Indus., 1999 MT 241, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 176, 988 P.2d 782. We review questions of law for correctness. <em>Am. Agrijusters </em>Co., \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that SC&amp;F is not chargeable for a pro rata share of the unemployment insurance benefits paid to a former employee because the employee voluntarily terminated her employment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b614 Montana law directs that unemployment compensation benefits paid to an unemployed worker \u201cmust be charged to the account of each of the claimant\u2019s base period employers\u201d on a pro rata basis. Section 39-51-1214(1), MCA. A \u201cbase period\u201d is defined as \u201cthe first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual\u2019s benefit year.\u201d Section 39-51-20l(2)(a), MCA. Generally, a \u201cbenefit year\u201d is the 52-week period \u201cbeginning with the first day of the calendar week in which an individual files a valid claim for benefits.\u201d Section 39-51-201(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b615 SC&amp;F does not dispute that it is a base period employer, but argues it qualifies for a statutory exemption from a charge to its account for Mielke\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 39-51-1214(2)(a), MCA. That section provides that a charge may not be made to the account of a covered employer with respect to benefits paid under the following situations: \u201c(a) <em>if paid to a worker who terminated services voluntarily without good cause attributable to a covered employer </em>or who had been discharged for misconduct in connection with services.\u201d Section 39-51-1214(2)(a), MCA (emphasis added). SC&amp;F argues that the District Court was correct in determining that the uncontroverted evidence established that Mielke voluntarily left employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b616 The Department argues that Mielke did not voluntarily leave her employment with SC&amp;F, but rather, the 2008-2009 contract expired by its terms, and Mielke was not obligated to negotiate or entertain a further contract with SC&amp;F. The Department argues that the Board properly deemed Mielke\u2019s termination of employment a \u201clayoff\u2019 by operation of Admin. R. M. 24.11.454A(6)(a), which applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>employment of \u201climited duration.\u201d The parties agree that Mielke\u2019s employment was pursuant to a limited-duration contract. The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-3\">(6) The department shall impute the reason for separation from work of limited duration in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">(a) when a worker agrees to accept employment of limited duration as specified by the employer, the department shall consider the worker to have been laid off due to a lack of work at the end of the duration agreed upon and the last day worked; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(b) when an employer agrees to employ a worker for a limited duration as specified by the worker, the department shall consider the worker to have voluntarily left work only when the worker has refused an offer by the employer to continue the same work beyond the limited duration. In the absence of a valid offer by the employer to continue the same work, the department shall consider the worker to have been laid off due to a lack of work on the last day worked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b617 The Department\u2019s argument focuses on the contract provisions and cites the standards for contract interpretation, as did the Hearing Officer, arguing that the language of the 2008-2009 contract is unambiguous, and the duty of the court is to apply the language as written. The Department then points out that SC&amp;F\u2019s offer for the 2009-2010 contract \u201csignificantly modified terms and conditions of Mielke\u2019s employment\u201d and that the two contracts \u201cdiffered in important ways.\u201d The Department argues that these differences demonstrate that SC&amp;F failed to offer Mielke the opportunity \u201cto continue the same work\u201d as required by Rule 24.11.454A(6)(b), and consequently, the Rule requires that \u201cthe department shall consider the worker to have been laid off due to a lack of work on the last day worked.\u201d If Mielke is thus deemed to have been laid off by SC&amp;F, then the company\u2019s account must be charged for a portion of Mielke\u2019s unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b618 The problem with the Department\u2019s position is that, regardless of the contract terms, the rules imputing the reason for work separation simply do not encompass the evidence in the record about what occurred in this case. Initially, we note that Rule 24.11.454A(6)(a) applies where the worker has agreed to accept employment of limited duration \u201cas specified by the employer.\u201d Rule 24.11.454A(6)(b) applies where the employer has agreed to employment of limited duration \u201cas specified by the worker.\u201d No findings were made regarding which party had specified the limited duration of the employment, and, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>District Court noted, there was testimony that indicated \u201cthe length of the 2008-2009 contract was mutually agreed on by the parties.\u201d More importantly, the Rules do not contemplate the facts here, that is, where the worker declines, without qualification, to consider any future work offered by the employer. The uncontested evidence is that Mielke told SC&amp;F that she \u201chad concerns about making a commitment for the next year\u201d even before the 2009-2010 contract was offered to her and that she had decided to leave employment to help her mother. Under Rule 24.11.454A(6)(b), the Department \u201cshall consider the worker to have voluntarily left work only when the worker has refused an offer by the employer to continue the same work.\u201d Here, Mielke refused <em>all </em>offers-necessarily including a theoretical offer to continue the same work. Mielke was not merely faced with the lapse of a contract; she was voluntarily terminating employment altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"AP4\">\u00b619  The Department argues the District Court improperly failed to defer to the Board\u2019s findings of facts. However, the error of the Board was primarily premised upon application of legal standards, in the nature of a conclusion of law (\u201cUnder the rules and guidelines of the Unemployment Insurance Laws, the evidence supports that Mielke did not voluntarily terminate her services with the employer ....\u201d). Given the inapplicability of the imputation rules to the situation here, the District Court properly concluded that the evidence did not support the Board\u2019s determination that Mielke\u2019s work separation was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b620  A charge may not be made to the account of a covered employer with respect to benefits \u201cif paid to a worker who terminated services voluntarily without good cause attributable to a covered employer ....\u201d Section 39-51-1214(2)(a), MCA. SC&amp;F is entitled to this statutory exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b312-7\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u00b622 The Court properly concludes that, under the unique facts of this case, the Department misapplied its rule in deeming Mielke to have been laid off when her contract with SC&amp;F expired. The rule requires the Department to \u201cimpute the reason for separation from work\u201d in different ways, depending on the circumstances of the separation and the nature of the employment relationship. Admin. R. M. 24.11.454A(3), (4), (6). Thus, if a worker gives notice of intent to leave work, the Department considers the worker to have left voluntarily if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the \u201cworker\u2019s notice of intent to leave work is valid.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.11.454A(3)(a). On the other hand, where the employment constitutes \u201cwork of limited duration,\u201d the Department considers the worker to have been laid off at the end of the agreed-upon duration \u201cspecified by the employer.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.11.454A(6)(a). Since the parties here entered into a contract for a specified term, the Department urges the Court to apply only subsection (6) of the rule. \u00b623 Under the rule, a \u201cvalid notice\u201d means \u201ca formal, unconditional, specific communication between an individual worker and an employer ... that provides notice of the date a worker intends to leave work voluntarily (quit)[.]\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.11.454A(1). Neither the Hearing Officer nor the Board of Labor Appeals made any finding that Mielke\u2019s notice of intent to leave work was anything but a valid notice. The Department cannot apply subsection (6) in a vacuum when an employee has given valid notice of her intent to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b624 The holding in this case should not, however, be seen to undermine the Department\u2019s legitimate interest, consistent with the unemployment benefits statutes, in extending benefits to a worker who leaves at the end of a fixed contract period and is subsequently laid off by another employer. The employer who enjoys the benefits that accompany short-term employment contracts should not be able to escape responsibility for the safety net offered by unemployment insurance by unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of the contract and then arguing the employee was not laid off when she refused to accept them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
