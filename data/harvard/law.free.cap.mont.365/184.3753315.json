We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u00b62 Hauer raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it prohibited Hauer from</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">testifying that the January altercation was caused by Hauer walking in on the victim purposely cutting herself?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">\u00b64 2. Was Hauer prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel agreed not to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s intentional cutting?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">\u00b65 Hauer was charged by Information with two misdemeanor counts of Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>MCA; one misdemeanor count of Unlawful Restraint in violation of \u00a7 45-5-301, MCA; one felony count of Aggravated Assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA; one felony count of Assault with a Weapon in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA; one felony count of Tampering with a Witness in violation of \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA; and two felony counts of PFMA in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. The charges stemmed from three separate arrests occurring in Missoula.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b66 On January 13,2009, Hauer was arrested after his girlfriend, Ulla Couture, reported that he assaulted her. Couture alleged that Hauer had strangled her, punched her and pushed her down. Hauer was charged in City Court with one count of misdemeanor PFMA as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b67 Hauer was arrested for a second time on May 28, 2009, after Couture again reported that he assaulted her. This time Couture alleged that Hauer had pushed her over a couch resulting in a cut to Couture\u2019s arm. Hauer was charged in City Court with a second count of misdemeanor PFMA as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b68 Hauer was arrested for a third time on July 28, 2009, for three separate incidents that occurred in July. The first incident took place during the first week of July. Couture reported that, during an argument, Hauer had head-butted her in the face causing her nose to bleed and to bruise. Hauer was charged in the District Court with one count of felony PFMA as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b69 The second incident took place on July 9 when Couture went out for drinks with a girlfriend. Couture reported that Hauer showed up at the bar where she was drinking with her friend. Couture stated that Hauer was very angry and that he insisted Couture leave with him. On the walk back to Couture\u2019s house, Hauer threatened to kill her and forced her to walk down by the river. When they neared the river, Hauer pushed Couture down into some bushes and pulled out a knife. Hauer told Couture that she had a choice to have either her lips cut off or her asshole cut out. When Couture rolled over onto her stomach, Hauer called her a coward.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b610 Couture further reported that Hauer then made Couture get up and they continued to walk along the river. At one point Hauer accidentally stepped on Couture\u2019s foot, but when he realized what he had done, he stomped on her foot again and told her that he hoped her foot was broken. When the two arrived at Couture\u2019s home, Hauer forced Couture to drink several alcoholic drinks. Couture stated that Hauer repeatedly told her that she should either kill herself or stab him in the neck and kill him. Before leaving, Hauer had sex with Couture and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>her that he owned her. Hauer was charged in the District Court with unlawful restraint, assault with a weapon, and an additional count of felony PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b611 The third incident took place on July 27, 2009. Couture report\u00e9d that, during an argument, Hauer had knocked her to the ground, gotten on top of her, and put his hands on her throat. She stated that Hauer pressed down on her neck for between 10 and 30 seconds and that she had difficulty breathing. Hauer was charged in the District Court with aggravated assault as a result of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b612 In addition, Hauer was charged in the District Court with tampering with a witness. This charge stemmed from Couture\u2019s report that Hauer had been pressuring her to sign an affidavit recanting the earlier PFMA allegations. Hauer wanted her to state that she had gone off of her meds and that the prior PFMA reports were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b613 At some point prior to trial, the January 13 and May 28 misdemeanor PFMA charges were transferred from City Court to the District Court and consolidated with the other six counts against Hauer. At the Omnibus Hearing on October 14,2009, Hauer gave notice that he intended to rely on the defense of justifiable use of force. He later clarified that this defense pertained to the January 13 and May 28 misdemeanor PFMA charges as well as the aggravated assault charge stemming from the July 27 incident. He maintained his innocence on the remaining charges. Hauer proceeded to trial before a jury on all eight counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b614 At the final pre-trial conference, the prosecutor proposed an oral motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of Couture being a \u201ccutter\u201d maintaining that such evidence was irrelevant and inappropriate character evidence. Hauer\u2019s trial counsel, Christopher Daly, did not oppose the State\u2019s motion stating that he did not intend to raise the issue. The court granted the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b615 After the jury trial began and the State had presented its case-in-chief, Daly asked the court for a discussion outside the presence of the jury. Daly informed the judge that Hauer intended to testify that the January incident occurred when Hauer caught Couture purposely cutting herself. Hauer claimed that Couture, angered by Hauer\u2019s intrusion, turned the knife on him and that he was acting in self-defense. The District Court refused to revisit the earlier motion in limine and prohibited Hauer from introducing evidence that Couture was a \u201ccutter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b616 Hauer testified in his defense at trial claiming that he was the victim in the relationship, not Couture. Hauer testified that all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>injuries Couture sustained were the result of Hauer defending himself from her attacks. Regarding the January 13, 2009 incident, Hauer testified that Couture had run at him with a knife and tried to stab him. According to Hauer, he acted in self-defense by punching her three times in the arm and throwing her to the ground. He also claimed that many of the other incidents that Couture described never happened.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">\u00b617 At the conclusion of the trial, Hauer was convicted on six of the eight counts. The jury entered a not guilty verdict on the charge of Tampering with a Witness. In addition, one of the July 2009 felony PFMA charges resulted in a hung jury, and the District Court declared a mistrial with respect to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b618 The District Court sentenced Hauer to six months in the Missoula County Detention Facility on the charge of Unlawful Restraint and six months each on the two charges of misdemeanor PFMA. The court also sentenced Hauer to five years in the Montana State Prison (MSP) on the charge of felony PFMA and twenty years each on the charges of felony Assault with a Weapon and felony Aggravated Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b619 Hauer now appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err when it prohibited Hauer from testifying that the January altercation was caused by Hauer walking in on the victim purposely cutting herself?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b621 Hauer points out that a criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected due process right to present a defense. He contends that he was denied that right in this case when the District Court barred him from testifying \u201cas to the full course of events\u201d occurring on January 13, 2009. Hauer claims that he intended to testify that the January altercation was sparked by Hauer walking in on Couture intentionally cutting herself with a knife. He maintains that the District Court unlawfully prohibited him from offering that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b622 The State argues that the District Court\u2019s ruling to prohibit testimony regarding Couture cutting herself did not violate Hauer\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. The State maintains that contrary to Hauer\u2019s contentions, he was permitted to introduce extensive testimony, including expert testimony, in support of his justifiable-use-of-force defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u00b623 \u2018Whether a defendant\u2019s right to due process has been violated is a question of constitutional law over which this Court exercises plenary review.\u201d <em>State v. Schaff, </em>2011 MT 19, \u00b6 7, 359 Mont. 185, 247 P.3d 727 (citing <em>State v. Lally, </em>2008 MT 452, \u00b6 13, 348 Mont. 59, 199 P.3d 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b624 Defendants have a constitutional right to present a defense. Whether that right is \u201crooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>Holmes v. South Carolina, </em>547 U.S. 319, 324, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1731 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, this right is not absolute. The United States Supreme Court has established that state rules excluding evidence from criminal trials do not abridge a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense so long as the rule is not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purpose it is designed to serve. <em>State v. Ahto, </em>1998 MT 200, \u00b6 16, 290 Mont. 338, 965 P.2d 240 (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 107, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 513, 958 P.2d 1182; <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S. Ct. 1261, 1264 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b625  Furthermore, defendants do not have an unlimited right to introduce evidence that is inadmissible under standard rules of evidence. <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S. Ct. 646, 653 (1988). What\u2019s more, \u201c[speculative or unsupported allegations are insufficient to tip the scales in favor of a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense <em>....\u2019\u2019Ahto, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b626 In the instant case, Hauer asserted a justifiable-use-of-force defense under \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">Use of force in defense of person. A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary for self-defense or the defense of another against the other person\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. However, the person is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to the person or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b627  However, the State maintained that the \u201ccutting\u201d evidence that Hauer sought to introduce in his defense was inadmissible under the rules of evidence relating to character evidence of the victim. A defendant who asserts a justifiable-use-of-force defense may offer the victim\u2019s character evidence only in limited circumstances. First, the character evidence must be \u201ca pertinent trait of character of the victim ....\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(a)(2). Second, specific instances of conduct may be admitted only in \u201ccases in which character or a trait of character of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, or where the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of force used by the accused in self defense....\u201d M. R. Evid. 405. Evidence of a victim\u2019s violent character is not an \u201cessential element\u201d of a justifiable-use-of-force defense. <em>Deschon v. State, </em>2008 MT 380, \u00b6 24, 347 Mont. 30, 197 P.3d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b628 Character evidence is evidence regarding someone\u2019s personality traits or evidence of a person\u2019s moral standing in a community based on reputation or opinion. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>576 (Bryan A. Gardner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 404, 405 and 608). A person who self-harms by \u201ccutting\u201d is presently thought to be suffering from a symptom of a borderline personality disorder, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV </em>650-54 (4th ed. 1994 American Psychiatric Association)-although there is some movement in the medical community to upgrade this affliction to a mental or psychiatric disorder in its own right, Kathleen Masterson, \u201c <em>\u2018Cutting\u2019 Elevated from Symptom to Mental </em>Disorder,\u201d http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123529829 (accessed May 16, 2012); <em>Cornell Research Program on Self Injurious Behavior in Adolescents and Young Adults, </em>http://www.crpsib.com/whatissi.asp (accessed May 16, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b629 Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court made the correct decision in characterizing Couture\u2019s \u201ccutting\u201d as \u201ccharacter evidence\u201d-at least based on the present medical definition of this affliction. The point is that however one characterizes Couture\u2019s \u201ccutting,\u201d under the facts here-as admitted by Hauer-her act of \u201ccutting\u201d herself was not admissible under M. R. Evid. 404(a)(1), or (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, Couture\u2019s \u201ccutting\u201d herself was not relevant under M. R. Evid 401<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Hauer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>justifiable-use-of-force defense, and this evidence was, therefore, inadmissible under M. R. Evid 402.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b630 The relevance of Couture\u2019s cutting to Hauer\u2019s defense was only that she allegedly had in her possession the knife that she raised and used to try to assault him as he entered the room. Under the facts of this case, the <em>reason </em>Couture had the knife in her possession was not relevant. She could have been cutting herself or slicing a salami. Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, even if relevant as character evidence, <em>arguendo, </em>Couture\u2019s cutting herself was properly excludable because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of this evidence confusing and misleading the jury. M. R. Evid 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The focus of Hauer\u2019s justifiable-use-of-force defense was his allegation that as he entered the room, Couture came at him with an upraised knife intending to assault and harm him. He then had to physically assault Couture to protect and defend himself from her attack. <em>Why </em>she had the knife in her hand simply did not matter under these facts. Hauer\u2019s attempt to use this evidence was, rather, to show that Couture was acting in conformity with her character, in violation of M. R. Evid 404(a)(2)-which makes no sense, in any event, since \u201ccutters\u201d harm themselves, not others. If Hauer had argued that he had to use force to prevent Couture from cutting herself, then evidence that Couture was a \u201ccutter\u201d may have been relevant, but that is not how the evidence was presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b631 Moreover, the District Court\u2019s ruling did not prevent Hauer from presenting his justifiable-use-of-force defense. At trial, Hauer testified that he was the victim in the relationship, that he was terrified of Couture, and that she had hurt him both emotionally and physically. Hauer further testified that he physically had to defend himself against Couture to keep from being harmed and that all the bruises he inflicted on Couture resulted from Hauer defending himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b632 As the State points out in its brief on appeal, Hauer\u2019s claim that the District Court\u2019s ruling limited him to testifying that \u201cMs. Couture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>had a knife in her hand and that she ran at him with it\u201d understates his actual testimony. Hauer testified that Couture \u201cran at me with [the knife] in her right hand and lifted it up and came down at me and tried to stab me with it ....\u201d We agree with the State\u2019s argument that this testimony would have supported a justifiable-use-of-force defense had the jury believed Hauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b633 Hauer also contends that \u201cthis was an extremely close call for the jury\u201d and that \u201c[i]n a case where the scales were so evenly balanced, there is-at the very least-a reasonable probability that Mr. Hauer\u2019s full self-defense testimony would have tipped the scales in his favor and led to a full acquittal.\u201d Hauer further contends that the appropriate remedy in this case is a new trial on all of the charges because \u201cadditional evidence showing that Ms. Couture was the aggressor in the January incident may have altered the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility with respect to the subsequent altercations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b634 These contentions are pure speculation on Hauer\u2019s part. There is nothing in the record indicating that this was a \u201cclose call\u201d for the jury or that the scales were \u201cevenly balanced.\u201d The jury convicted Hauer of six counts, three of which involved Hauer\u2019s self-defense claims. The jury heard all of the relevant testimony regarding justifiable use of force and ruled against Hauer. Admitting evidence that Couture was cutting herself would have added nothing to the defense. Consequently, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling did not unconstitutionally abridge Hauer\u2019s right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b635 [3] Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it prohibited Hauer from testifying that the January altercation was caused by Hauer walking in on Couture purposely cutting herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b636 <em>Was Hauer prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel agreed not to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s intentional cutting?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b637 Hauer contends on appeal that his trial counsel failed to investigate Hauer\u2019s version of events and wrongly agreed not to introduce evidence that Couture was cutting herself. Hauer maintains that counsel made this agreement without discussing it with him. Hauer states that when counsel realized his mistake, the judge declined to reopen the issue and left the prohibition on that evidence. Hauer argues that as a direct result of counsel\u2019s failure, the jury was presented with a self-defense argument considerably weaker than the one Hauer intended to present. He asserts that there is a reasonable likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, Hauer\u2019s self-defense argument would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b638 The State argues that Hauer\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to present evidence that Couture was cutting herself because, under the rules of evidence, the testimony that Hauer wanted to give was inadmissible. The State asserts that even if counsel had objected to the State\u2019s motion to preclude such evidence, the District Court would have overruled that objection under the rules governing character evidence. The State notes that it is well settled in Montana that counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to make a meritless objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b639 The right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600 <em>(citing Becker v. State, </em>2010 MT 93, \u00b6 8, 356 Mont. 161, 232 P.3d 376; <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b640 We evaluate ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the following two-part test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984): (1) whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citingAdams <em>v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601). If a defendant makes an insufficient showing on one prong of the test, then there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b641 To establish that counsel rendered ineffective assistance, a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel performed \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). And, to overcome this presumption, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b642 In addition, we have determined that ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be reviewed on direct appeal only if they are capable of resolution based solely on the record. <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 21, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606 (citing <em>In re Petition of Hans, </em>1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>MT 7, \u00b6 41, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175). We make this determination by questioning \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not perform the challenged action. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b643 In this case, we conclude that Hauer\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is capable of resolution based solely on the record, thus we review it on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b644 Hauer claims that counsel performed below the range of competence demanded when counsel stipulated to the State\u2019s motion to preclude evidence that Couture was cutting herself. Hauer asserts in his brief on appeal that \u201c[o]ne of the seemingly easiest and most [obvious] ways to begin an investigation into a client\u2019s case would be to ask your client for his or her version of the events.\u201d According to Hauer, counsel\u2019s stipulation shows that counsel was not aware of Hauer\u2019s version of the January assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b645 On the contrary, the record establishes that counsel diligently pursued Hauer\u2019s justifiable-use-of-force theory from the beginning. Soon after taking over Hauer\u2019s defense, counsel subpoenaed witnesses whom Hauer claimed could \u201cexculpate\u201d him. According to Hauer, these witnesses would testify that Couture had assaulted Hauer, that Couture made false statements to the municipal court, and that she violated that court\u2019s \u201cno-contact orders.\u201d At trial, counsel questioned these witnesses in a manner consistent with Hauer\u2019s defense theory. In addition, defense counsel cross-examined Couture about inconsistencies in her statements and about a false statement she had made to the municipal court. Counsel also hired an expert witness who testified that the marks on Couture\u2019s neck were not made by Hauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b646 While the record here clearly establishes that counsel diligently pursued Hauer\u2019s justifiable-use-of-force defense throughout counsel\u2019s representation of Hauer, the record also establishes that Hauer\u2019s version of events continued to evolve throughout these proceedings. The transcript of the final pretrial conference indicates that Hauer was present when counsel informed the court that the defense had no plans to introduce evidence that Couture was a \u201ccutter.\u201d Even though Hauer was present, he did not attempt to contradict counsel\u2019s statement or inform counsel or the court that counsel was mistaken. In addition, Hauer originally planned to rely on self-defense for the July 27 incident, but, when it came time for Hauer to testify, he claimed that the incident never happened-that he did not have any contact with Couture after July 19. However, on cross-examination, he changed once again and claimed that the July 27 incident occurred because Couture had been abusive toward him and that he \u201csnapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b647  Even if counsel had not been diligent in presenting Hauer\u2019s justifiable-use-of-force defense, the testimony Hauer sought to introduce regarding Couture cutting herself was improper character evidence of the victim and would not have been admissible under the rules of evidence in any event. Counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to make a meritless objection. On the contrary, it is well settled that counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to object does not constitute ineffective assistance when the objection lacks merit and properly would have been overruled.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b648 Hauer has failed to meet his burden to show that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. Because Hauer made an insufficient showing on this first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we do not address the second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b649 [5] Accordingly, we hold that counsel did not render ineffective assistance when he agreed not to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s intentional cutting.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b650 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> M.

I don\u2019t agree that evidence of cutting is necessarily, as a matter of law, character evidence admissible only as permitted under M. R. Evid. 404, or that it is irrelevant as a matter of law to the charge of assault, as the Court indicates in \u00b6 30 (\u201cUnder the facts of this case, the <em>reason </em>Couture had the knife in her possession was not relevant. She could have been cutting herself or slicing a salami.\u201d). Hauer makes no showing of the particular relevance to his defense of the cutting evidence, or of his surprise discovery of this activity. He offers generally that the circumstances surrounding the incident must be examined, and offers the speculative assertion that \u201cMs. Couture using the knife to harm herself clearly suggests that she was willing to use the knife as a weapon.\u201d Without a more definitive connection, however, I believe the evidence, though relevant, was well excludable as substantially outweighed by the danger of confusing and misleading the jury under M. R. Evid. 403, even if Hauer had given the District Court a timely opportunity to consider it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
