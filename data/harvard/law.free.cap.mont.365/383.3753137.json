We conclude Briscoe was not denied effective assistance of counsel, however, we reverse Briscoe\u2019s sentence and remand to the District Court to correct his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b62 On June 28, 2010, Briscoe stabbed Tom Trachy (\u2018Trachy\u201d). Briscoe, a 72 year old man, had been a client of the Poverello Center, a Missoula, Montana, homeless shelter. Briscoe was kicked out of the shelter by Trachy on June 25, 2010, for violating the shelter\u2019s no alcohol policy. On June 28, 2010, an intoxicated Briscoe soiled his pants and went to the Poverello Center to shower and change his clothing, which was stored in a locker at the shelter. Trachy was working that day and, according to Briscoe, Trachy would not allow him to shower or retrieve his clean clothes. A confrontation ensued, culminating in Briscoe stabbing Trachy in the back, then leaving the Poverello Center. The police were called by another Poverello Center employee. Trachy\u2019s wound was closed with three stitches at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b63 At approximately 4:00 p.m., Missoula police officers responded to the reported stabbing. While walking the block from the police station to the Poverello Center, Officer Herbert encountered Briscoe and observed him throw something into the bushes. Briscoe then raised his hands and said \u201cI\u2019m the one you want.\u201d Briscoe made several more unsolicited incriminating statements to Officer Herbert. He said he did not like the staff at the Poverello Center and said <em>\u20181 </em>hope the fucking punk dies. The son of a bitch.\u201d He also said he knew the police were coming, so he threw the knife in the bushes, and pointed at the bushes. The police later recovered a knife from the same bushes. Briscoe was arrested and taken to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u00b64 At the police station, Detective J.C. Denton (\u2018Denton\u201d) was assigned to question Briscoe. Before questioning Briscoe, Denton administered a breath test. Briscoe\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was .166. Denton then questioned Briscoe to determine if Briscoe could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his rights. Once Denton obtained what he believed to be a sufficient <em>Miranda </em>waiver, he proceeded with the interrogation and Briscoe made numerous incriminating statements, such as: \u201c... I walked in and this guy jumped up in my face so I fucking stuck him[;]... I pulled a knife from my belt and I stuck the son of a bitch[;] .. ,[t]he son of a bitch doesn\u2019t deserve to live ... [a]nd I meant to kill him ... I meant to stick him in the fucking heart... [p]lain and simple if I\u2019d meant to cut him a little bit I\u2019d hit him in a[n] arm or something I didn\u2019t mean to I meant to kill the dirty rotten bastard. ...\u201dHe further said that \u201cthe honest truth is if I didn\u2019t kill him I hope I did I hope I hit him right in the fucking heart.\u201d Briscoe described in detail the knife he used to stab Trachy, and the manner in which he stabbed Trachy. He also described Trachy as a \u201cprick\u201d and a \u201creal asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b65 Briscoe was subsequently charged with attempted deliberate homicide. After a jury trial, he was found guilty of the lesser included offense of assault with a weapon. At his sentencing hearing, Briscoe made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">All I can do is ask for the mercy of The Court. I have a place to stay in Arizona. The only reason I need to go to Helena is because my billfold and my clothing have disappeared in the system. I need to replace those things and get Social Security started again. I realize the seriousness of this thing. I don't believe that I can-I'm older now than any member of my family that has ever lived. I would hate to die in prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b66 Briscoe was sentenced to 20 years at Montana State Prison, with no restriction on parole eligibility. The District Court stated Tt]he reasons for the sentence, it takes into account the Defendant\u2019s criminal history, the verdict of the jury, and the apparent issues where the Defendant does not appear to have any remorse for this particular offense.\u201d A similar finding is in the written judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These statements were not linked by the District Court to any evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b67 Briscoe timely appealed, raising the following issues, which we restate:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b68 <em>Issue One: Was Briscoe\u2019s counsel ineffective for failing to move to suppress Briscoe\u2019s post-Miranda statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b69 <em>Issue Two: Is Briscoe\u2019s sentence illegal because it was based in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>on lack of remorse which was not affirmatively linked to information in the record?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b610 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 66, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. However, before addressing the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we must first determine whether the record is sufficient for review. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2009 MT 170, \u00b6 29, 350 Mont. 493, 208 P.3d 851. When the record is silent as to why counsel took a particular course of action, we will not address the claim on direct appeal. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 71; <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 29. Rather, the claim is better raised in a petition for postconviction relief where a sufficient record can be developed. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 71; <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>State v. Rovin, </em>2009 MT 16, \u00b6 34, 349 Mont. 57, 201 P.3d 780. However, where no plausible reason exists to justify counsel\u2019s action or inaction, the claim is record-based and appropriate for direct appeal. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 19, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b611 When an offender is eligible for sentence review, we review a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 37. Because Briscoe was sentenced to more than one year of actual incarceration, he is eligible for sentence review. Section 46-18-903, MCA. Therefore, we review Briscoe\u2019s sentence for legality only. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>State v. McDowell, </em>2011 MT 75, \u00b6 11, 360 Mont. 83, 253 P.3d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b612 <em>Issue One: Was Briscoe\u2019s counsel ineffective for failing to move to suppress Briscoe\u2019s post-Miranda statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b613 Briscoe argues there was no plausible justification for his counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress his statements made while in police custody. Because there was no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s inaction, Briscoe argues his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is suitable for direct appeal. He urges us to reverse his conviction and suppress the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b614 The State argues that this claim is not well-suited for direct appeal, but should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief. However, should this Court consider the claim, the State argues that Briscoe suffered no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress his statements, and therefore his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">\u00b615 Before ruling on the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we must determine if direct appeal is the proper forum to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the claim. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. If the record provides the answer, the claim is record based and we will address it on direct appeal. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. If the record does not provide the answer, the claim is non-record based and we will not review the claim on direct appeal. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. Claims involving \u201comissions of trial counsel are often ill-suited for direct <em>appeal.\u201d Robinson, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>State v. Russell, </em>2008 MT 417, \u00b6 33, 347 Mont. 301, 198 P.3d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b616 When reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we employ the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>State v. Savage, </em>2011 MT 23, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 207, 248 P.3d 308. In order for a defendant to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he or she must demonstrate both (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he or she suffered prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064; <em>Savage, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 67. If the defendant makes an insufficient showing regarding one prong, the other need not be addressed. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 68. Thus, if it can be shown from the record on direct appeal that a defendant cannot satisfy either of the <em>Strickland </em>prongs we will decide the issue accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b617 For purposes of review in this case we assume that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, thus satisfying the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. We conclude, however, that Briscoe cannot establish that he was prejudiced by the assumed deficient performance. The burden is on Briscoe to establish that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 67. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b618 Excluding Briscoe\u2019s in-custody statements, there was overwhelming evidence that Briscoe stabbed Trachy. Trachy testified it was Briscoe who stabbed him. When officers responded to the report of a stabbing, they nearly immediately encountered Briscoe, who raised his hands and told Officer Herbert that he (Briscoe) was \u201cthe one you want.\u201d Officer Herbert saw Briscoe throw an object into the bushes. Briscoe told officers he threw a knife into the bushes, and indicated which bushes. Officers later recovered a knife from those bushes. Briscoe also made several unsolicited statements to officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>before his arrest, indicating that he did not like the staff at the Poverello Center and he hoped Trachy died.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b619 Further, even after hearing the allegedly inadmissible statements Briscoe made while in custody indicating his intent to kill Trachy, the jury did not convict Briscoe of attempted deliberate homicide. Briscoe was convicted of the lesser included offense of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"Afn\">\u00b620  Briscoe has not established a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had his counsel filed a motion to suppress his in-custody statements. We conclude Briscoe did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b621 <em>Issue Two: Is Briscoe\u2019s sentence illegal because it was based in part on lack of remorse which was not affirmatively linked to information in the record?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b622 Briscoe argues that his sentence is illegal because the District Court did not reference any part of the record to substantiate its finding that he lacked remorse. The State argues that, while the District Court \u201cdid fail to point to specific evidence in the record which showed Briscoe\u2019s lack of remorse[,]\u201dthere is substantial evidence in the record-namely Briscoe\u2019s statements to police-to support the District Court\u2019s finding of lack of remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b623  A district court can sentence a defendant based upon lack of remorse provided there is affirmative evidence of lack of remorse. <em>State v. Morris, </em>2010 MT 259, \u00b6 22, 358 Mont. 307, 245 P.3d 512. Such affirmative evidence includes: \u201cevidence as to the manner of the commission of the offense or admissible statements made by a defendant pre-trial, at trial, or post-trial.\u201d <em>State v. Rennaker, </em>2007 MT 10, \u00b6 51, 335 Mont. 274, 150 P.3d 960. Lack of remorse may not be inferred from a defendant\u2019s silence or failure to acknowledge his conviction. <em>State v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, \u00b6 53, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111. The district court \u201cmust tie its finding of lack of remorse to actions or statements made by [the defendant] <em>in its pronouncement of the sentence.\u201dDuncan, </em>\u00b6 54 (emphasis in original). Stated another way, if the district court does not point to affirmative evidence of lack of remorse in its pronouncement of the sentence, a sentence based on lack of remorse is not legal. <em>Duncan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b624 In the present case, the District Court failed to point to any evidence to support its finding of lack of remorse, which the State acknowledges. This is undoubtedly error given our holding in <em>Duncan. </em>In <em>Duncan, </em>the district court sentenced Duncan based in part on his lack of remorse. There, as here, the district court \u201cdid not affirmatively point to any evidence in the record to support that finding.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u00b6 54. Again, as the State does here, the State in <em>Duncan </em>argued on appeal \u2018that there is sufficient evidence in the record from which we [this Court] could infer Duncan\u2019s lack of remorse.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>\u00b6 54. We held however, that \u201c[e]ven if true, the presence of such evidence in the record would not cure the error. The District Court must tie its finding of lack of remorse to actions or statements made by [the defendant] <em>in its pronouncement of the sentence.\u201d Duncan, </em>\u00b6 54 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b625  Given our clear holding in <em>Duncan, </em>Briscoe\u2019s sentence based in part on lack of remorse is illegal. The District Court did not affirmatively point to any evidence in the record to support its finding of lack of remorse. When a portion of a sentence is illegal, and can be corrected on remand, we will remand to the district court to correct the illegal provision. <em>State v. Olivares-Coster, </em>2011 MT 196, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 380, 259 P.3d 760. Accordingly, we reverse Briscoe\u2019s sentence and remand to the District Court to correct this illegal provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b626 We conclude Briscoe was not denied effective assistance of counsel. We also conclude that Briscoe\u2019s sentence based in part on lack of remorse is illegal given our holding in <em>Duncan. </em>We remand to the District Court to correct Briscoe\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\"> The oral pronouncement of sentence controls. <em>State v.
