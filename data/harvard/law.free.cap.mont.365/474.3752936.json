We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing Bomar\u2019s postconviction petition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b63 In 2005, Bomar was charged with attempted sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault, both felonies, upon K.J. The crimes were alleged to have occurred in 2000, when K. J. was six years old. K.J. was twelve years old at the time the trial was conducted in November, 2005. Bomar was represented by Daniel Donovan and Jeremy Yellin. The jury convicted Bomar of sexual assault and acquitted him of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced to twenty-seven years at the Montana State Prison with twelve years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b64 Bomar appealed the conviction, and this Court affirmed. <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, 342 Mont. 281, 182 P.3d 47. We rejected Bomar\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and declined to reach his arguments concerning the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness, Rochelle Beley (Beley), on grounds that his arguments were waived for failing to timely raise them in the District Court. <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 33-41. Bomar thereafter filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief and was appointed counsel by the District Court to represent him in the proceeding. Bomar\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental brief in support of the petition, arguing that Bomar\u2019s trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by, inter alia, failing to present exculpatory medical evidence and failing to present adequate expert testimony to challenge the qualifications and testimony of Beley. The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing and thereafter dismissed the petition. Bomar appeals. Additional facts will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b65 In postconviction relief proceedings, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. We review its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact that the Court reviews de novo.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 12. A petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s order denying postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel has a heavy burden. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 509, 74 P.3d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing Bomar\u2019s postconviction </em>petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b67 When evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we use the two-part test enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2064). \u201c\u2018There is a strong presumption with regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). \u2018In order to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, we have explained that judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Worthan v. State, </em>2010 MT 98, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 206, 232 P.3d 380 (citing <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15). The burden of establishing the first prong \u201crequires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b68 Under the second prong, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685). \u2018The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. The defendant must prove both prongs in order to succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim; therefore, if a defendant makes an insufficient showing regarding one prong of the test, there is no need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to address the other prong. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b69 Bomar argues his trial attorneys were ineffective by failing to adequately challenge Beley\u2019s expert testimony and by failing to offer exculpatory medical evidence that was referenced during the defense\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">A. Failure to rebut testimony of the State\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b610 The incident giving rise to the charges was alleged to have occurred in Montana in July of 2000, when K. J. was six years old. The record indicates that K.J., who resides in Oregon, did not speak about the incident until December of 2001. After she told her mother what had happened, an Oregon police detective interviewed K.J. at her school. The detective did not record the conversation with K. J., but he took notes during the interview. A medical examination was performed upon K. J. at a child advocacy center that revealed no signs of vaginal trauma or physical injury. She was also interviewed by medical personnel at the advocacy center. Bomar was thereafter charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFs\">\u00b611 Prior to trial, Bomar\u2019s attorneys filed several motions in limine, \u2018four of which pertained to K.J.\u2019s out-of-court statements, Beley\u2019s anticipated expert testimony or both.\u201d <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6 30. Beley, a therapist with a Master\u2019s Degree in Marriage and Family Therapy, was expected to testify concerning the credibility of K.J.\u2019s statements to the Oregon detective and to the medical personnel at the child advocacy center, based upon a Statement Validity Assessment (SVA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> completed by Beley. Bomar\u2019s counsel requested a hearing on their motions in limine. The District Court indicated that it did not have time for a hearing and that it assumed that the motions could be decided on the briefs. Counsel agreed that the District Court could decide the motions on the briefs. <em>See Bomar, </em>\u00b6 32. The District Court granted Bomar\u2019s motion to preclude Beley from testifying about the ultimate issue of whether K. J. was truthful and reserved ruling on other issues concerning Beley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>anticipated testimony until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b612 The court held an in-chambers hearing during the trial to address Beley\u2019s anticipated trial testimony. Beley testified she had received training on conducting SVAs and that she was familiar with the vast body of research on SVAs. She testified that an in-person interview or recording of the child\u2019s interview was preferable but was not necessary if the interviewer had written down how the questions were asked and the responses of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b613 Defense counsel hired two experts, Dr. Donna Zook and Dr. Michael Scolotti, who ultimately expressed strong disagreement with Beley\u2019s opinion that an in-person interview with the child or some sort of verbatim documentation of the interview was not necessary. Neither Zook nor Scolotti testified at the in-chambers hearing, although Bomar\u2019s counsel extensively cross-examined Beley about her testimony, focusing on Beley\u2019s failure to personally interview the child. Counsel then argued to the court that Beley did not have adequate credentials to qualify as an expert and that her flawed methodology required exclusion of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b614 The District Court denied the defense\u2019s motions, ruling that Beley had satisfied the Scheffelman<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requirements and could testify at trial. The District Court permitted Beley to testify from her assessment about the factors that indicated truthfulness in K. J.\u2019s statements to the detective and medical personnel, but it excluded any testimony about whether K. J. was in fact truthful or not truthful. Beley thus testified to the jury that \"many of [K. J.]\u2019s statements were consistent with the research, which shows valid statements of sexual abuse.\u201d Defense counsel cross-examined Beley about her failure to personally interview K. J. and the absence of a recording of the interview. Counsel elicited from Beley the concession that the accuracy of her assessment depended upon K.J.\u2019s statements being accurately reported by the detective and the medical personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b615 After the State rested, defense counsel moved to strike Beley\u2019s testimony and for an instruction that the jury was to disregard the testimony or, alternatively, for a mistrial. The court denied the motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The defense then called Dr. Zook, who testified that Beley\u2019s SVA was flawed. When asked which procedures necessary for a valid SVA Beley had failed to follow, Dr. Zook responded \u201c[t]he most significant is that she did not interview the child face-to-face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b616 After Bomar was convicted of sexual assault, he moved for a new trial supported by an affidavit from Dr. Scolotti expressing Scolotti\u2019s disagreement with Beley\u2019s methodology and opining that her SVA was invalid because of the failure to have, at least, a verbatim transcript of the interviews. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b617 Bomar argues that \u2018Twjhile defense counsel had evidence showing that [Beley] fundamentally misunderstood the research-based Statement Validity Assessment for analyzing the credibility of children\u2019s statements ... they failed to present the evidence to the district court in a timely manner.\u201d Bomar argues his defense attorneys were ineffective in failing to call Dr. Zook during the in-chambers hearing to demonstrate that Beley did not have sufficient knowledge of SVAs or the requisite evidence for completion of a valid SVA of K.J.\u2019s statements. Bomar contends that, had this been done, Beley would not have been allowed to testify as an expert witness under Mont. R. Evid. 702 or the second prong of the <em>Scheffelman </em>test, which requires \u201cthorough and up to date knowledge of the professional literature on child sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. at 342, 820 P.2d at 1298. Instead, Beley was \u201callowed to tell the jury that the child\u2019s testimony was confirmed by the rigors of the scientific method.\u201d Had Dr. Zook testified about Beley\u2019s flawed understanding during the in-chambers hearing or had defense counsel insisted on a pretrial hearing instead of ceding to the court\u2019s request to rule based on the briefing, Bomar posits that the outcome of the trial would likely have been different. Noting our ruling in <em>Bomar, </em>Bomar argues that his defense counsel \u201cdeficiently waived the pretrial <em>Daubert</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing on Ms. Beley\u2019s flawed testimony.\u201d The State responds that \u201cBomar\u2019s defense counsel made an aggressive effort to prevent the State from being able to present Beley\u2019s testimony\u201dand that they \"provided active and capable representation and were not ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b618 The record reveals that Bomar\u2019s defense counsel were sharply focused on Beley\u2019s testimony and fully engaged in an effort to exclude or undermine it. Prior to trial, counsel filed several motions in limine for the specific purpose of precluding or limiting Beley\u2019s anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>testimony. They hired Dr. Zook to evaluate K. J.\u2019s statements, analyze Beley\u2019s work, and provide rebuttal testimony should Beley be permitted to testify. They strongly cross-examined Beley at the in-chambers hearing. During trial, counsel made vigorous objections to Beley\u2019s qualification as an expert and challenged her opinion as being improperly based upon the notes of the detective and the medical personnel and lacking an in-person interview of K.J. After Beley testified, counsel again objected to her testimony, moved to strike her testimony, moved to instruct the jury to disregard it, and moved alternatively for a mistrial. When the District Court denied their motions, they called Dr. Zook to rebut Beley\u2019s testimony and to demonstrate Beley\u2019s flawed approach to the SVA. Bomar\u2019s counsel\u2019s efforts to disqualify Beley\u2019s testimony were such that, upon their request for a mistrial, the prosecutor commented, \u2018Your Honor, I believe that point has been belabored.\u201dIn closing arguments, Bomar\u2019s counsel again emphasized the flaws in Beley\u2019s testimony. After trial, they moved for a new trial based upon Dr. Scolotti\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b619  Mr. Donovan\u2019s and Mr. Yellin\u2019s efforts were exhaustive and commendable. If they can also be described as imperfect, that is not the standard by which effective representation is assessed. \u201c\u2018The Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 8, 124 S. Ct. 1, 6 (2003) (per curiam)). \u201cIt is \u2018all too tempting\u2019 to \u2018second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.\u2019 .... The question is whether an attorney s representation amounted to incompetence under \u2018prevailing professional norms,\u2019 not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 770, 788 (2011) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2052). \u2018Success is not the test of efficient counsel.\u201d <em>Riggs v. State, </em>2011 MT 239, \u00b6 32, 362 Mont. 140, 264 P.3d 693 (citing <em>State v. Martz, </em>233 Mont. 136, 140, 760 P.2d 65, 68 (1988)). Bomar\u2019s counsels\u2019 efforts clearly fell within \u201cthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065, and it certainly cannot be said that they \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064). Bomar\u2019s claim does not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and thus has not established ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>B. Failure to introduce medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b620 During his opening statement, Mr. Donovan told the jury that \u2018Tt]he evidence will show that there\u2019s no medical evidence of that, there\u2019s no sign of an injury in her private area, no scarring, no DNA, nothing whatsoever.\u201d When K.J. was examined at the child advocacy center a year and a half after the alleged assault, the medical professionals found no signs of trauma or physical evidence of injury. However, neither the defense nor the State introduced any medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b621 Bomar thus contends that his counsel was ineffective for promising evidence to the jury that was never produced. He argues that \u201c[t]he one piece of evidence that could impeach KJ.\u2019s core claim of penetration, the first piece of evidence promised by defense counsel during opening statement, the piece of evidence that would cast a shadow over the state\u2019s entire case, was never introduced,\u201d and \u201ccounsel could have no reason to then expressly promise the jury evidence that he did not intend to present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b622 The State argues defense counsel was not ineffective because their decision not to introduce the medical evidence, or the lack thereof, was sound trial strategy. Both defense counsel testified at the postconviction hearing that they made a strategic decision during the trial not to introduce the medical evidence. They reasoned it would have opened the door for the State to offer expert testimony to the effect that the absence of trauma a year and a half after the assault did not demonstrate that penetration had not occurred. Additionally, counsel testified that because the charge of sexual intercourse without consent had been amended to attempted sexual intercourse without consent, penetration was no longer an issue that needed to be litigated. The State also notes that, though no medical evidence was introduced, Mr. Yellin\u2019s closing argument nonetheless \u2018focused on the fact that there was not any physical evidence to support the charges against Bomar, which was an important piece of the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b623  In <em>Worthan v. State, </em>2010 MT 98, 356 Mont. 206, 232 P.3d 380, we held that a defense counsel\u2019s promise during opening statement to produce an expert who was not ultimately called to testify, did not constitute ineffective assistance because it was not prejudicial to Worthan. <em>Worthan, </em>\u00b6 16. Similarly, it cannot be said that but for Bomar\u2019s counsel\u2019s unfulfilled promise to present medical evidence, the result of the trial likely would have been different, as required under the second prong of <em>Strickland. Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068 (\u2018The defendant must show that there is a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d). We conclude that, because the issue of penetration was no longer an issue, and counsel was nonetheless able to argue during closing that the State failed to provide any evidence of physical injury to K.J., that counsel\u2019s misstatement did not prejudice the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> Bomar was originally charged with sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent, but after the State learned there was no evidence of penetration, it amended the sexual intercourse without consent charge to attempted sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> A Statement Validity Assessment is a methodology used to determine whether allegations of sexual abuse by children are more consistent with a true account or a false account of abuse, based on the 1991 study, \u201cAssessment of Children\u2019s Statements of Sexual Abuse,\u201d by David C.
