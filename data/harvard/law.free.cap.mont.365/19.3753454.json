On the basis of controlling precedent, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in granting Johnson\u2019s motion for a change of venue to his county of residence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether application of Montana\u2019s venue statutes violates Johnson\u2019s right to equal protection of the law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u00b65 On July 15, 2011, Ward filed suit seeking damages for personal injuries she sustained when a gate failed to latch and struck her in the head as she was sorting horses on Johnson\u2019s property. She alleged claims for strict products liability and breach of warranties against Powder River, Inc., the gate\u2019s manufacturer. She also claimed Johnson was negligent. Ward is a resident of Yellowstone County and filed her complaint there. Ward\u2019s injuries occurred in Pondera County. Powder River is a non-resident corporation organized under the laws of the State of Idaho with its principal place of business in Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">\u00b66 On August 29, 2011, Johnson filed a motion to change venue. Johnson argued Pondera County was the appropriate place for trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, as it was the only county where a defendant resided. Powder River neither supported nor objected to the motion. Ward opposed the motion, asserting our decision in <em>Nelson v. Cenex Inc., </em>2004 MT 170, 322 Mont. 54, 97 P.3d 1073, controlled and permitted Ward to file her claim in Yellowstone County, her place of residence. The District Court, without mentioning <em>Nelson </em>in its order, ruled in favor of Johnson stating Pondera County was the only proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>venue. Ward appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b67 Whether a county designated in the complaint is a proper place for trial is a question of law. <em>DML, Inc. v. Fulbright, </em>2005 MT 204, \u00b6 7, 328 Mont. 212, 119 P.3d 93. We review de novo a District Court\u2019s decision to transfer venue because the complaint was not filed in the proper county. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. State ex rel. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2010 MT 46, \u00b6 7, 355 Mont. 296, 228 P.3d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in granting Johnson\u2019s motion for a change of venue to his county of residence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b69 Venue is determined by the status of the parties and pleadings at the time of the complaint or at the time the moving party appears in the action. <em>Lockhead v. Weinstein, </em>2001 MT 132, \u00b6 5, 305 Mont. 438, 28 P.3d 1081. Section 25-2-114, MCA, permits a defendant to move for a change of venue when \u201can action is brought in a county not designated as the proper place for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b610 Section 25-2-118, MCA, the general rule for venue in civil actions, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (3) [concerning family law matters], the proper place of trial for all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or any of them reside at the commencement of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">(2) <em>If none of the defendants reside in the state, </em>the proper place of trial for a contract action is as provided in 25-2-121(l)(b) or (2) and the proper place of trial for a tort action is as provided in 25-2-122(2) or (3). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">With respect to tort actions, \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-13\">(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) through (4), the proper place of trial for a tort action is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-14\">(a) <em>the county in which the defendant or any of them reside at the commencement of the action -, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-15\">(b) the county in which the tort was committed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-16\">(2) <em>If the defendant is a corporation incorporated in a state other than Montana, </em>the proper place of trial for a tort action is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">(a) the county in which the tort was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-18\">(b) <em>the county in which the plaintiff resides-, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-19\">(c) the county in which the corporation\u2019s resident agent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>located, as required by law. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b611 Ward argues that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, controls here because Powder River is incorporated in a state other than Montana. Johnson asserts that subsection is applicable only where an out-of-state corporation is sued independently, or with another out-of-state corporation or individual. Finding our precedent determinative, we agree with Ward that subsection (2) allowed her to file her complaint in Yellowstone County.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b612 In <em>Nelson, </em>the plaintiff filed his complaint in Lewis and Clark County, alleging tort claims against three corporate entities and two individual defendants. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 3. CHS, Inc., the successor-in-interest to the three corporate defendants, was incorporated and maintained its principal place of business in Minnesota. CHS\u2019s registered agent in Montana was located in Lewis and Clark County. The two individual defendants were residents of Yellowstone County, and Nelson resided in Missoula County. The district court denied CHS\u2019s motion for a change of venue and this Court affirmed. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 13. We reaffirmed that \u00a7 25-2-118(2), MCA, did not apply \u201cwhere one or more of the defendants reside[s] in Montana.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Platt v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P.2d 336, 338 (1986)). We disagreed with CHS\u2019s argument that \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, required the case to be brought in the resident defendants\u2019 county of residence. Rejecting the contention that subsection (1) controlled because subsections (2) and (3) \u201conly applied where none of the defendants reside[s] in Montana,\u201d we stated that when \u00a7 25-2-118(2), MCA, is inapplicable, \u201cvenue must be determined according to other venue <em>statutes.\u201dNelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12 (emphasis added). We held that Lewis and Clark County was a proper place for trial under \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, and Nelson was \u201clegally correct\u201d in filing his complaint there. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b613  <em>Nelson </em>compels a similar conclusion in this case. We agree with Johnson that Pondera County would have been a proper place for trial under \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA. Nonetheless, because Powder River is incorporated in a state other than Montana, \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, also specifies a proper place for trial. Accordingly, Ward\u2019s decision to file her complaint in Yellowstone County was legally correct under \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b614 Johnson attempts to distinguish <em>Nelson </em>by noting that in that case it was CHS, the out-of-state corporation, that challenged venue; here, Johnson, the in-state individual defendant, is asserting his right to have the trial conducted in his county of residence as provided by \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>25-2-118(1), MCA. This distinction is not supported by our construction of the statute in <em>Nelson. </em>Our decision there did not depend on which defendant sought a change of venue, but on whether one or more of the defendants was a Montana resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b615 We recognize the historical preference of the law for defendants to be sued in their county of residence <em>(See Hardenburgh v. Hardenburgh, </em>115 Mont. 469, 475, 146 P.2d 151, 153 (1944); <em>McNussen v. Graybeal, </em>141 Mont. 571, 578-79, 380 P.2d 575, 578-79 (1963)). Johnson makes a plausible argument for construction of the venue statutes, but it is one we already rejected in <em>Nelson. </em>If our holding there does not accurately reflect the intent of the statute, it remains the prerogative of the Legislature to amend it. <em>Certain v. Tonn, </em>2009 MT 330, \u00b6 18, 353 Mont. 21, 220 P.3d 384 (citing <em>Sampson v. Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 541, 144 P.3d 797). The Legislature has not done so; therefore our interpretation in <em>Nelson </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b616  Moreover, the law makes clear that where there are two or more defendants, \u201ca proper place of trial for any defendant is proper for all defendants.\u201d Section 25-2-117, MCA. This statute \u201cis intended to apply to all venue provisions.\u201d <em>Weiss v. State, </em>219 Mont. 447, 450, 712 P.2d 1315, 1317 (1986). \u201c[T]he right to move for a change of venue under \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, applies only if the action is filed in a county that is a proper place of trial for <em>none </em>of the defendants.\u201d <em>Farmers Union Ass\u2019n v. Paquin, </em>2009 MT 305, \u00b6 12, 352 Mont. 390, 217 P.3d 74 (emphasis added). Since Yellowstone County is a proper county for trial as to defendant Powder River under \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, it also is a proper county as to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b617 <em>2. Whether application of Montana\u2019s venue statutes violates Johnson\u2019s right to equal protection of the law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b618 Johnson asserts that this application of the venue statutes would violate his right to equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution because it treats resident defendants differently depending on whether they are sued with a non-resident defendant. Ward argues Johnson is prohibited from asserting this constitutional claim because Johnson did not notify the Attorney General pursuant to M. R. App. P. 27. Under that rule, \u201ca party who challenges the constitutionality of any act of the Montana legislature ... must give notice to the supreme court and to the Montana attorney general of the existence of the constitutional issue.\u201d Ward contends Johnson\u2019s failure to provide notice denied the State an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>advance a legitimate governmental interest in maintaining the current venue statutes. For the reasons that follow, we do not rely on Ward\u2019s notice argument but conclude that Johnson\u2019s constitutional rights are not violated by application of the statutes in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b619 We have analyzed a party\u2019s constitutional arguments absent compliance with the notice requirement in cases where the challenging party was not asserting the statute itself was unconstitutional. <em>Polasek v. Omura, </em>2006 MT 103, \u00b6 20, 332 Mont. 157, 136 P.3d 519. Here, Johnson is not asserting the plain language of \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, is unconstitutional; rather, it is this Court\u2019s application of the statute in multiple-defendant cases that allegedly violates his right to equal protection. It is also unclear whether M. R. App. P. 27 applies when, as here, the constitutional issue is raised by the appellee in defense of a district court\u2019s ruling on non-constitutional grounds. Our previous cases rejecting the constitutional claim for noncompliance with the rule did not consider this unique situation. <em>Boettcher v. Mont. Guaranty Fund, </em>2006 MT 127, \u00b6 12, 332 Mont. 279, 140 P.3d 474; <em>Weinert v. City of Great Falls, </em>2004 MT 168, \u00b6 13, 322 Mont. 38, 97 P.3d 1079; <em>Russell v. Masonic Home of Mont., Inc., </em>2006 MT 286, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 351, 147 P.3d 216. Given the lack of clear application of the rule in this instance, we consider Johnson\u2019s constitutional argument on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b620 Johnson asserts that our application of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, violates his right to equal protection because he is compelled to defend this action in Ward\u2019s county of residence simply because she named a nonresident defendant in her complaint. \u201cThe principal purpose of the Equal Protection Clause, Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution, is to ensure that persons who are citizens are not subject to arbitrary and discriminatory state action.\u201d <em>Timm v. Mont. Dept. of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2008 MT 126, \u00b6 30, 343 Mont. 11, 184 P.3d 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b621 The right to equal protection \u201cdoes not prevent a state from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in that connection,\u201d it merely requires that those classifications are not arbitrarily made and have \u201ca reasonable relation to the subject of that particular legislation.\u201d <em>Ford v. Burlington N. R.R., </em>250 Mont. 188, 193, 819 P.2d 169, 173 (1991) <em>(quoting Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, </em>274 U.S. 490, 493, 47 S. Ct. 678, 679 (1927). If the \u201cclassification is neither capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon real differences and some reasonable consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of the equal protection of the law.\u201d <em>Powder River Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 79, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357. Our review of these classifications is not confined to the purposes advanced by the legislature or litigants, but extends to \u201cany possible purpose of which the court can conceive.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 34, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566. This standard reflects the notion \u201cthat the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one.\u201d <em>Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 314, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 2567 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Ford, </em>the plaintiff was injured while working as a locomotive engineer and filed suit in Yellowstone County against an out-of-state corporation under the Federal Employers Liability Act. 250 Mont. at 189, 819 P.2d at 170. Burlington argued our application of the venue statutes in FELA cases violated its right to equal protection by permitting actions against a foreign corporation in any county, while actions against a domestic corporation could only be brought in the county where it had its principal place of business. 250 Mont. at 190, 819 P.2d at 171. We disagreed, noting the United States Supreme Court\u2019s observation that a state\u2019s directive as to one proper forum over another \u201ccan have no tendency to violate the guarantee of the equal protection of the laws where in both the forums equality of the law governs and equality of administration prevails.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>250 Mont. at 192, 819 P.2d at 171 (quoting <em>Cincinnati Street Ry. Co. v. Snell, </em>193 U.S. 30, 37, 24 S. Ct. 319, 321 (1904)). We declined to address whether there was a rational basis for treating out-of-state corporations differently due to a \u201cnational policy\u201d allowing railroad workers \u201cto sue their employer at any location where the employer does business.\u201d 250 Mont. at 195, 819 P.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b623 On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. It held that Montana\u2019s venue laws satisfied rational basis review because, in adjusting the \u201cwarring interests\u201d of parties with different forum preferences, states may have a number of choices, \u201ceach of them passable under the standard tolerating some play in the joints of governmental machinery.\u201d <em>Burlington N. R.R. v. Ford, </em>504 U.S. 648, 651, 112 S. Ct. 2184, 2186-87 (1992). It concluded that Montana rationally could have decided that \u201ca nonresident defendant\u2019s interest in convenience is too slight to outweigh the plaintiffs interest in suing in the forum of his choice.\u201d 504 U.S. at 652, 112 S. Ct. at 2187. The Court explained that states must be afforded some liberty in striking a balance between these competing interests; thus, \u201ca State would act within its constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weight to the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the counties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>their choice under all circumstances.\u201d 504 U.S. at 651-52, 112 S. Ct. at 2187. Finally, the Court acknowledged that while Montana could have implemented its policy judgment \u201cwith greater precision,\u201d the distinctions withstood rational-basis review because \u201crational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\u201d 504 U.S. at 653, 112 S. Ct. at 2187 (quoting <em>New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S. Ct. 2513, 2517 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b624 We conclude, as in <em>Ford, </em>that there is a rational basis for a legislative determination to expand a plaintiffs venue options when there are both resident and nonresident defendants. The legislature could have presumed that, because the nonresident defendant will be inconvenienced regardless of where the suit is brought, the resident defendant, rather than the plaintiff, should bear any additional burdens associated with venue. This is not an arbitrary distinction, as a plaintiffs interest in filing suit in the forum of her choice is likely greater when there are multiple defendants involved in the litigation residing both in and outside of Montana. We also note that the statute at issue in <em>Ford </em>was amended by the legislature so that plaintiffs in tort actions now are afforded only two more options for proper venue-their place of residence or where the tort was committed-rather than any county of their choice. Section 25-2-118(2), MCA. Accordingly, a plaintiff is not permitted to simply choose the venue farthest away from the resident defendant and, in many instances, one of the two additional locations also will be where the defendant resides. While a different scheme would have been permissible, the legislature\u2019s policy choice in this instance is not constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b625  We conclude that the statute permitting Ward to file her action in the county of her residence does not deprive Johnson of the equal protection of the laws. Ward filed her complaint in a proper county. The District Court\u2019s order granting Johnson\u2019s motion to change venue is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
