Cleary was transported to the hospital, where a consensual blood alcohol content test revealed a BAC of .18. On March 26, 2010, the State of Montana filed an Information charging Cleary with felony Driving a Motor Vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI). The felony charges were based upon Cleary\u2019s Montana driving record which reported three previous DUIs-two in Montana and one in South Dakota. Cleary moved to have the felony dismissed, arguing that he should not be subject to the enhanced felony charges because the DUI issued in South Dakota was not a \u201cprior conviction.\u201d The Thirteenth Judicial District Court denied his motion. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b62 A restatement of Cleary\u2019s issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that the \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d which Cleary received pursuant to South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL) \u00a7 23A-27-13 on August 7, 2007, following his \u201cguilty\u201d plea to a Per Se offense under SDCL \u00a7 32-23-1(1), constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(16), MCA, for purposes of enhancing his charges to \u201cfelony\u201d status under \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b64 In March 2010, Cleary was charged by Information with felony DUI, or in the alternative, felony BAC based upon his September 2009 motorcycle accident. The Affidavit for Leave to File Information stated \u201cThe Defendant was convicted of DUI or Per Se on: August 7, 2007; July 9,2004; and October 21,1991.\u201d Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (2007),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cleary was charged with a \u201cfourth\u201d lifetime alcohol-related driving offense and charged with a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b65 After pleading not guilty, Cleary moved to have the felony charge dismissed in District Court, arguing that the DUI recorded in South Dakota was not a \u201cconviction\u201d and should not have been considered in determining the number of Cleary\u2019s past DUI convictions. Cleary argued that the South Dakota Magistrate Court did not enter a judgment of \u201cguilty;\u201d rather, it exercised judicial clemency as allowed by SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13. Cleary also argued, with limited legal analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that because his 2009 DUI was his first DUI in 5 years, it should be charged as a \u201cfirst offense\u201d under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b66 Cleary expressly appeals the District Court\u2019s ruling on his South Dakota offense as reflected in his issue statement above. He also suggests that this Court should remand the matter to the District Court with instruction that he be charged and sentenced for a \u201cfirst offense.\u201d However, Cleary\u2019s failure to present any analysis of applicable law and application of such law to the facts of his case, precludes us from addressing this latter issue. We therefore confine our analysis and resolution to Cleary\u2019s primary issue. M. R. App. P. 12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b67 Cleary received his South Dakota DUI on August 5, 2007, and pled guilty two days later on August 7. On August 8, 2007, the South Dakota Magistrate Court issued an \u201cOrder Suspending Imposition of Sentence\u201d (Suspension Order). This Suspension Order, issued pursuant to SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13, stated that the court \u201cdoes not enter a judgment of guilt but exercises its judicial clemency under SDCL 23A-27-13 and with the consent of [Cleary] suspends the imposition of the sentence ....\u201d Also under the Suspension Order, Cleary was required to pay a fine and court costs and to obey all laws during a six-month probation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b68 Six months later, on February 7, 2008, the South Dakota Magistrate Court entered an \u201cOrder of Dismissal and Discharge\u201d of Cleary\u2019s \u201csuspended imposition of sentence.\u201d The court dismissed the action and discharged Cleary based upon Cleary\u2019s compliance with the conditions of the Suspension Order. The order of dismissal further provided that \u201call official records, in this action be sealed, along with all recordation relation to [Cleary\u2019s] arrest, indictment, trial, and dismissal and discharge.\u201d Despite the court order sealing the records in accordance with SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-17, the South Dakota Driver\u2019s Licensing Program mistakenly transmitted Cleary\u2019s charge, plea and suspended imposition of sentence to the State of Montana and it was posted to his Montana driving record as a DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b69 Cleary immediately sought to have reference to the South Dakota proceeding removed from his Montana driving record. When the Montana Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) declined to revise Cleary\u2019s record, Cleary and the South Dakota Magistrate Court embarked upon a circuitous remedial route. First, on February 1, 2010, the South Dakota Magistrate Court issued an order vacating the August 8, 2007 Suspension Order, stating the \u201cmatter is hereby vacated, and shall have no further legal effect. The judgment shall be stricken from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>record ....\u201d Then, a week later, the South Dakota court entered a nunc pro tunc order under a new file number again suspending the sentence associated with Cleary\u2019s August 2007 DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b610 Meade County, South Dakota, provided the Montana MVD with the South Dakota court\u2019s February 1, 2010 order vacating Cleary\u2019s original suspended imposition of sentence. On February 17, 2010, Cleary received a letter from MVD informing him that the South Dakota DUI was \u201cexpunged\u201d from his record. Shortly thereafter, in March 2010, Cleary was arraigned on the DUI arising from his September 2009 motorcycle accident. On July 23, 2010, the South Dakota Department of Public Safety sent Cleary an \u201cOrder of Dismissal\u201d notifying him that the DUI had been removed from his South Dakota driving record and that record of it had been sealed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b611 Against this backdrop, Cleary moved the District Court for dismissal of the felony DUI charges. He argued that because both Montana and South Dakota had removed the South Dakota DUI from his driving record, there were insufficient predicate DUI convictions to support a felony DUI. The State opposed his motion, arguing that the South Dakota DUI could be used for sentence enhancement purposes. The District Court agreed with the State and denied Cleary\u2019s motion to dismiss the felony charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b612 After comparing South Dakota and Montana DUI statutes, the District Court determined that Cleary\u2019s South Dakota DUI could be used to enhance his sentence for his 2009 Montana DUI. The court relied upon SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 and <em>State v. Winchester, </em>438 N.W.2d 555 (S.D. 1989). It explained that the South Dakota law-SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13-allowing suspended sentences to individuals who have not previously been convicted of a felony, is countered in some instances by another South Dakota law, SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15, which allows that same suspended sentence to later be considered a conviction in the event the individual commits another crime. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">South Dakota does not allow a repeat, habitual criminal to reap the benefit of a \u201csuspended imposition of sentence.\u201d [SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13] is designed to give one second chance to a specific group of individuals not previously convicted of a felony. By statute [SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15] and the <em>Winchester </em>case, the South Dakota Supreme Court has unequivocally prevented a defendant convicted of multiple crimes from using a \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d as a sword against the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The District Court concluded that SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 applied not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to any subsequent DUI Cleary might get in South Dakota but also to Cleary\u2019s subsequent DUI in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b613 On June 16, 2011, Cleary entered into a plea bargain agreement in which he entered a plea of guilty to the felony charge but reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. He was sentenced in September 2011 to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for thirteen months and upon successful completion of the DOC\u2019s residential alcohol treatment program, the remainder of his sentence would be served on probation. Cleary was also sentenced to the DOC for 3 years, all suspended, to run consecutively to the thirteen-month term. Following sentencing, Cleary moved for a stay of execution of sentence which the District Court granted. Cleary filed his appeal on October 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b614 This Court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss in criminal cases de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Sidmore, </em>286 Mont. 218, 223, 951 P.2d 558, 562 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d which Cleary received pursuant to SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13 on August </em>7, <em>2007, following his \u201cguilty\u201dplea to a Per Se offense under SDCL \u00a7 32-23-1(1), constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(16), MCA, for purposes of enhancing his charges to \u201cfelony\u201d status under \u00a761-8-731, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b616 Like South Dakota, Montana disciplines DUI offenders differently based upon how many DUI convictions an offender has received. The penalties for three or fewer DUIs are not as harsh as the penalties for four or more DUI offenses. Sections 61-8-714 and 61-8-722, MCA (2007). For a fourth or greater DUI, the State shall pursue a felony charge and sentence rather than a misdemeanor charge and sentence against the defendant. Section 61-8-731, MCA (2007). Additionally, \u00a7 61-8-734, MCA (2007), provides that convictions in other states maybe used to determine the number of previous convictions an offender has, providing that (1) it was a \u201cconviction,\u201d and (2) the other state\u2019s statute or regulation is \u201csimilar\u201d to Montana\u2019s. Therefore, in order to determine whether Cleary\u2019s South Dakota DUI counts as a previous conviction, we must examine both Montana and South Dakota\u2019s statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b617 The South Dakota \u201cjudicial clemency\u201d statute, SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13 (2005), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">Upon receiving a verdict or plea of guilty for a misdemeanor or felony not punishable by death or life imprisonment by a person never before convicted of a crime which at the time of conviction thereof would constitute a felony in this state, a court having jurisdiction of the defendant, if satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby, may, without entering a judgment of guilt, and with the consent of the defendant, suspend the imposition of sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem best. A court may revoke such suspension at any time during the probationary period and impose and execute sentence without diminishment or credit for any of the probationary period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Upon completion of the probationary period and established compliance with the conditions imposed, the court \u201cshall\u201d discharge the defendant with a \u201cformal entry of... discharge\u201d filed with the clerk of court. \u201cDischarge and dismissal under this section shall be without court adjudication of guilt and shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime.\u201d SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-14 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b618 The \u201chabitual offender\u201d South Dakota statute, SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 (2005), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">For the sole purposes of consideration of the sentence of a defendant for subsequent offenses or the determination of whether the defendant is an habitual offender under chapter 22-7, the fact of suspension of imposition of sentence under \u00a7 23A-27-13, whether or not discharge and dismissal have occurred, shall be considered a prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b619 Under Montana law, \u201cconviction\u201d is defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(16), MCA (2005), as \u201ca judgment of conviction or sentence entered upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or upon a verdict or finding of guilty of an offense rendered by a legally constituted jury or by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to try the case without a jury.\u201d A \u201cjudgment\u201d is \u201can adjudication by a court that the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and if the adjudication is that the defendant is guilty, it includes the sentence pronounced by the court.\u201d Section 46-1-202(11), MCA (2005). A \u201csentence\u201d means \u201cthe judicial disposition of a criminal proceeding upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or upon a verdict or finding of guilty.\u201d Section 46-1-202(25), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u00b620 Cleary argues that he was never \u201cconvicted\u201d or \u201csentenced\u201d for the per se offense in South Dakota. He asserts that the South Dakota court did not accept his guilty plea, but rather proceeded \u201cwithout entering a judgment of guilty\u201d and suspended the imposition of sentence. Therefore, he maintains that he was neither \u201cconvicted\u201d nor \u201csentenced,\u201d as the terms are defined under Montana law. Cleary\u2019s interpretation was supported at the District Court hearing by testimony from the Deputy Meade County Attorney from South Dakota. She testified that the \u201csuspension of imposition of sentence\u201d statute-SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13-allowed both South Dakota residents and out-of-state individuals to receive a suspended imposition of sentence under the circumstances described in the statute. She also testified that she was not aware of any Montana statute or decision by this Court that would allow a per se charge in South Dakota that was successfully resolved through SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13 to be considered a \u201cconviction\u201d for sentence enhancement purposes in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b621 Cleary also submits that Montana does not have a statute stating that a \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d received in another state shall be deemed a \u201cconviction\u201d in Montana for purposes of enhancing the sentence imposed on a subsequent DUI. Additionally, he points out that the South Dakota statute does not reveal a legislative intent to have a South Dakota \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d treated as a conviction if the defendant has a subsequent alcohol-related driving offense in another state. Lastly, Cleary argues-correctly-that Montana has no statutory equivalent to SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded that because Cleary had pled guilty to violating South Dakota\u2019s DUI statute which is similar to Montana\u2019s, and because both South Dakota and Montana have felony-charging provisions for \u201chabitual offenders,\u201d Cleary\u2019s suspended imposition of sentence qualified as a conviction under Montana\u2019s statute. The court relied upon SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 and the <em>Winchester </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Winchester, </em>Winchester, a South Dakota resident, argued that her suspended imposition of sentence for her first DUI may not be used to enhance the penalty for her second South Dakota DUI. The South Dakota Circuit Court disagreed and she appealed to the State\u2019s Supreme Court. The South Dakota Supreme Court, citing SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15, which specifically allows a \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d to be considered a prior conviction for purposes of sentencing a defendant for a subsequent offense, affirmed the Circuit Court. <em>Winchester, </em>438 N.W. 2d at 556. However, because there is nothing in <em>Winchester </em>that extends application of SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>non-residents in a similar position, and because Montana does not in any event have a \u201cjudicial clemency\u201d statute or anything remotely similar, we conclude <em>Winchester </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b624 Returning to Montana law, in order for an out-of-state DUI to qualify for felony enhancement purposes in Montana, there must be a \u201cconviction\u201d for violation of a similar DUI statute in another state. Section 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA. The South Dakota DUI does not meet this standard, as there was not a \u201cconviction\u201d in South Dakota as the term is defined under Montana law (\u201ca judgment of conviction or sentence entered upon a plea of guilty or ... upon a ... finding of guilty ... by a court of competent jurisdiction ...\u201d per \u00a7 45-2-101(16), MCA). Rather, there was in South Dakota a suspended imposition of sentence followed by a statutorily-authorized vacation of sentence and a complete expungement of the judgment from the record. Such a disposition, which has no similar counterpart in Montana law, simply cannot be equated to a conviction under Montana law for felony enhancement purposes. Moreover, the fact that South Dakota may elevate a \u201csuspended imposition of sentence\u201d to the status of a \u201cprior conviction\u201d for purposes of sentencing habitual South Dakota offenders in South Dakota is unavailing in Montana. We decline to import into Montana a portion of an out-of-state DUI sentencing scheme the remainder of which is not at all similar to Montana\u2019s DUI sentencing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b625  For these reasons, we conclude Cleary\u2019s South Dakota offense was neither a conviction nor a sentence for Montana purposes, and that the expungement of the charge precludes it from being counted as a previous conviction for sentence enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b626 We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling on Cleary\u2019s motion to dismiss and remand this case for further proceedings in accordance \u25a0with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> It is well established that the law in effect at the time the offense was committed controls as to the possible sentence. <em>State v.

The 2007 MCA did not go into effect until October 1, 2007; therefore the 2005 MCA controls this offense.

The South Dakota court entered an order in August 2007, suspending imposition of Cleary\u2019s sentence pursuant to SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13. South Dakota law makes clear that a suspended imposition of sentence is considered a prior conviction \u201c[f]or the sole purposes of <em>consideration of the sentence of a defendant for subsequent offenses </em>or the determination of whether the defendant is an habitual offender under chapter 22-7, ... <em>whether or not discharge and dismissal have occurred.\u201d </em>SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-15 (emphasis added). \u201cThe South Dakota Supreme Court has plainly held that a suspended imposition of sentence may be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent criminal law violation.\u201d <em>Whitepipe v. Weber, </em>536 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1080 (D.S.D. 2007) (citing <em>State v. Marnette, </em>519 N.W.2d 35, 38 (S.D. 1994); <em>Winchester, </em>438 N.W.2d 555).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b629 Section 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA (2007), provides in relevant part that in order to determine the number of convictions for prior offenses, \u201c\u2018conviction\u2019 means a final conviction, as defined in 45-2-101, in this state, [or] conviction for a violation of a similar statute ... in another state[.]\u201d Thus, the statute does not define \u201cconviction in another state,\u201d but limits reference to \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, to determining a final conviction \u201cin this state.\u201d We have held that the determination whether the defendant has been convicted in another state is to be made by reference to that state\u2019s law. In <em>State v. Ailport, </em>1998 MT 315, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 292 Mont. 172, 970 P.2d 1044, we considered North Dakota law in determining whether a North Dakota judgment could be used to enhance a charge in Montana. We stated, \u201cThe judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u201d <em>Ailport, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, 970 P.2d 1017). Cleary\u2019s suspended imposition of sentence constituted a conviction in South Dakota for the purpose of considering his sentence for subsequent offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b630 Application of Montana\u2019s statutes does not lead to a different conclusion. Cleary\u2019s 2007 DUI charge resulted in a judicial disposition of a criminal proceeding upon his plea of guilty. It therefore was a \u201csentence\u201d within the meaning of Montana\u2019s definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d Sections 45-2-101(16), 46-1-202(25), MCA (2005). Accordingly, nothing in Montana law prohibits Montana courts from giving it the same effect for the \u201csole purpose\u201d of consideration of Cleary\u2019s sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b631 The purpose of South Dakota\u2019s statute allowing a suspended imposition of sentence is to give an offender one chance for judicial leniency. <em>Winchester, </em>438 N.W.2d at 555-56. While a suspended sentence may not be considered a conviction \u201cfor certain purposes,\u201d it explicitly is a conviction for determining enhancement of sentence for subsequent offenses. <em>State v. Cran, </em>281 N.W.2d 81, 84 (S.D. 1979). Both the 2007 sentencing order and the 2010 nunc pro tunc order expressly note that Cleary entered a plea of guilty to the offense of \u201cdriving or control of vehicle while having .08 percent or more of alcohol in blood\u201d and that, based on his lack of any prior felony convictions, the imposition of his sentence was suspended pursuant to SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-13. Once Cleary committed another offense, he lost the protection of that \u201cjudicial clemency\u201d under South Dakota law. South Dakota\u2019s determination that his 2007 DUI should be considered a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes is entitled to \u201cthe same credit, validity, and effect\u201d in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b632 I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
