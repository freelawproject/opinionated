We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>concluded that Jennifer Fazio is entitled to a distribution from the Trust as a descendant of George Kincaid under the Gift Trust document.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b63 In December, 1976, Cecilia Kincaid Bates, grantor, and Co-Trustees George W. Kincaid and Richard E. Peterson entered into a trust agreement establishing the Cecilia Kincaid Gift Trust for George. George was Cecilia\u2019s son. The Trust was an irrevocable intervivos trust and George was the sole beneficiary of the Trust during his lifetime. George passed away on October 15,2009, intestate. By the terms of the Trust, George\u2019s death was the triggering event for appointment of a new co-trustee, for termination of the Trust, and for distribution of the remaining assets. The current Co-Trustees of the Trust are Gloria LaMott and Glenn Kincaid, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b64 On November 3, 2010 the Co-Trustees filed a Final Account, Petition for Settlement, Distribution, and Termination of the Cecilia Kincaid Gift Trust for George. On December 1, 2010 Jennifer Fazio, formerly known as Stacey Jean Kincaid, objected to the Trustees\u2019 petition, which proposed that she receive no distribution from the Trust. Jennifer is the natural child of George Kincaid. She was born after the Trust was established and was given up for adoption when she was a small child. The District Court considered the briefs of the parties and determined that Jennifer was properly entitled to distribution of the Trust proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b65 The issue in this case is whether Jennifer is the rightful beneficiary of the Cecilia Kincaid Gift Trust for George. Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the Trust provides that upon George\u2019s death any remaining funds in the Trust are to be distributed to George\u2019s \u201cliving descendants.\u201d The Trust defines \u201cdescendants\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">As used herein, the term \u201cdescendent\u201d or \u201cdescendents\u201d shall mean lawful blood descendants in the first, second or any other degree of the designated ancestor; provided, however, that an adopted child and the lawful blood descendants of any such adopted child shall for all purposes be regarded as the lawful blood descendants of the adopting parent or parents and of anyone who is by blood an ancestor of the adopting parent or of either of the adopting parents, and such adopted child and any said descendant of such adopted child shall not be regarded as the descendants of either natural parent of such adopted child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkP\">Kincaid Trust for George, Article XIII, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b66 The District Court determined that Jennifer, as a \u201clawful blood descendant\u201d of George Kincaid, should be included in the Trust distribution. The Trustees appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b67 The interpretation of a trust agreement is a question of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>In re: Marjorie Q. Ward Revocable Trust, </em>2011 MT 308, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 72, 265 P.3d 1260; <em>In re: The Charles M. Bair Family Trust, </em>2008 MT 144, \u00b6 32, 343 Mont. 138, 183 P.3d 61. This Court construes the words of a trust instrument in their ordinary grammatical sense, absent evidence of a clear intent otherwise. <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32. The plain language of the trust instrument is controlling. <em>Ward, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b68 The resolution of this case depends upon whether Jennifer Fazio is George\u2019s \u201cdescendant\u201d as that term is defined in the Trust instrument. If so, she has a claim to the remaining proceeds of the Trust. The District Court construed Art. XIII, \u00a7 3 of the Trust to define George\u2019s descendants as \u201clawful blood descendants,\u201d which clearly includes Jennifer. The District Court further construed the \u201cadopted child\u201d language to describe only children who were adopted into the family by George. The Trustees contend, however, that the adopted child language makes no distinction between children adopted into or out of the family. The Trustees contend that under the plain language of the Trust any adopted child is deemed to be a descendant of the child\u2019s adopting parent, and not a descendant of the child\u2019s natural parent. The Trustees contend that for the purposes of the Trust, Jennifer is deemed to be a child of her adoptive parents and is not a \u201cdescendant\u201d of George.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b69 The language of the Trust instrument is not ambiguous. We conclude that the plain language of Art. XIII, \u00a7 3 makes no distinction between children adopted into the family and children adopted out of the family. The plain language describes any adopted child, and an adopted child is deemed to be the descendant of its adoptive parents for purposes of this Trust. The Trust can only be construed to include Jennifer as a descendant of George by adding language making a distinction between children adopted into the family and those adopted out of the family. This language is not in the Trust instrument and may not be added, nor may the language be re-written. <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Coops. Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>30, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b610  A court may not properly add language when interpreting a trust instrument, \u00a7 1-4-101, MCA, but must apply the plain language. <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 53; <em>Ward, </em>\u00b6 21. The plain language of the Trust provides that any adopted child is to be deemed a descendant of the child\u2019s adoptive parents. Jennifer is not a descendant of George under the Trust because she was adopted and is therefore deemed to be \u201cregarded as the lawful blood descendant! ] of the adopting parent or parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b611 The decision of the District court is therefore reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-6\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AJC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b612 Respectfully, I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion. While the Court concludes that the Trust instrument is not ambiguous, Opinion, \u00b6 9,1 conclude that it is. Accordingly, I would vacate the District Court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b613 As the Court notes at \u00b6 5 of the Opinion, Article IV, Section 3 of the Trust states that upon George\u2019s death, any remaining funds in the Trust are to be distributed to George\u2019s \u201cthen living descendants.\u201d Article XIII, Section 3, in turn, defines the term \u201cdescendant\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">As used herein, the term \u201cdescendant\u201d or \u201cdescendants\u201d shall mean lawful blood descendants in the first, second or any other degree of the designated ancestor; provided, however, that an adopted child and the lawful blood descendants of any such adopted child shall for all purposes be regarded as the lawful blood descendants of the adopting parent or parents and of anyone who is by blood an ancestor of the adopting parent or of either of the adopting parents, and such adopted child and any said descendant of such adopted child shall not be regarded as the descendants of either natural parent of such adopted child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">\u00b614 An ambiguity exists when the language of an instrument is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 23, 301 Mont. 447, 11 P.3d 1192; <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Coops., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851. Here, the term \u201cadopted child\u201d is reasonably susceptible to three different interpretations. \u201cAdopted child\u201d could reasonably mean a child that was adopted <em>into </em>the family; it could reasonably mean a child that was adopted <em>out </em>o/1 the family; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>it could reasonably mean both. The ambiguity arises from the fact that it is not clear what Cecilia, the Grantor, intended in her use of the phrase \u201cadopted child.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b615 The relevant language of Article XIII, Section 3 of the Trust states that an adopted child shall be regarded as the lawful blood descendant of the adopting parent/parents, and such adopted child shall not be regarded as the descendant of his/her natural parents. This language could reasonably be interpreted to mean that if one of George\u2019s children is adopted <em>out of the </em>family, he/she is no longer a \u201cdescendant\u201d of George. On the other hand, it is equally reasonable that in her choice of language, the Grantor did not contemplate excluding from the estate her blood descendants who happened to be adopted <em>out of </em>the family. Indeed, it is reasonable to believe-and in my view is more likely-that the Grantor contemplated that George might adopt a child into the family, rather than give up his natural child for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"Aan\">\u00b616 Reading the Trust instrument as a whole, it is clear that the Grantor intended to provide financially for her four children by way of a separate trust for each. That being her purpose, it also would have been her contemplation, desire, and intent, as a grandmother, to insure that George\u2019s natural and adopted children, if any, received his share of the residue of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b617 Importantly, for our purposes here, the phrase \u201cadopted child\u201d as used in defining \u201cdescendant\u201d is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and is, therefore, ambiguous. Since the language used by the Grantor is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be introduced at trial to allow the trier of fact to determine the Grantor\u2019s intent. <em>See Baker Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b618 I conclude that the District Court should have required a full evidentiary hearing admitting extrinsic evidence to clear up the aforementioned ambiguity and the Grantor\u2019s intent. Accordingly, we should vacate the District Court\u2019s decision and remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b619 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-8\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> As an aside, the language \u201cfor all purposes\u201d-to which the Trustees attach great significance-is irrelevant. It refers to all purposes in the Trust where \u201cdescendant\u201d is used. It has no bearing on the meaning of \u201cadopted child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
