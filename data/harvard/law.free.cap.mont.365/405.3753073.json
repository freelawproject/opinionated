He was diagnosed with a cervical strain, and Sentry Casualty Company accepted liability and paid benefits for this injury. During Ford\u2019s treatment, he underwent an MRI which revealed a more serious cervical disc condition. Ford claimed that the workplace accident caused or aggravated this condition and that Sentry was liable for surgery to address it. Ford also claimed that Sentry was liable for ongoing temporary total disability benefits and that Sentry had unreasonably adjusted his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b62 Sentry denied liability for Ford\u2019s cervical disc condition based on the opinions of several doctors that the condition was not related to the industrial accident. Sentry also maintained that Ford has reached maximum medical improvement, that he has been released to return to work without restrictions, and that it reasonably adjusted his claim. The dispute ultimately reached the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC). Trial was held January 28, 2011. Ford and his wife testified, and numerous medical records were admitted into evidence. The WCC ruled in favor of Sentry as to each of the foregoing issues, and Ford now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u00b63 The issues and sub-issues raised on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">1. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for medical bills and treatment involving Ford\u2019s cervical disc condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">A. Whether the WCC applied an incorrect standard of proof on the question of causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">B. Whether the WCC erred in relying solely on medical opinions to determine causation and aggravation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">C. Whether the WCC erred in concluding that Ford had not adequately demonstrated that the industrial accident caused or aggravated his cervical disc condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">2. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for ongoing temporary total disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">3. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or a penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">We affirm as to all three issues. In so doing, we clarify the standards and analysis for determining a casual connection between a claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>injury and a workplace accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">BACKGROUND Circumstances of Ford\u2019s Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b64 At the time of the accident, Ford was 38 years old and employed as a yard worker with Pacific Hide and Fur in Billings. Pacific Hide and Fur was enrolled under Compensation Plan No. 2 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and insured by Sentry. On September 29, 2009, Ford was working when the baler jammed. This machine takes scraps of metal, which enter on a conveyor belt, and compresses them into a solid bale of metal similar to a bale of hay. Ford and his coworkers were unable to dislodge the jammed metal using a cutting torch, so they attempted to pull the metal out of the baler using a Ford Ranger pickup truck and a tow chain. They attached one end of the chain to the metal and the other end to the tow hook on the front of the pickup. Ford got into the pickup, put it in reverse, gave it gas, and popped the clutch. The jammed metal did not budge. As a result, when the tow chain became taut, the pickup came to an abrupt stop, actually coming off the ground, and Ford\u2019s head \u201csnapped back\u201d with such force that his hardhat flew into the back of the crew cab pickup. Ford attempted this maneuver at least two more times, with the same results. Eventually, he and his coworkers dislodged the metal using a Volvo loader.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b65 On the way home after his shift, Ford felt an ache in the back of his neck down into his shoulders and felt stiff and sore. He felt the same way the next morning and also had a headache. Although he had experienced occasional headaches in the past, Ford did not have neck problems and had never sought medical treatment for headaches or neck pain prior to this incident. Ford advised his supervisor of his condition and sought medical care at a clinic in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u00b66 Over the ensuing months, Ford was seen by a slew of different doctors due to ongoing complaints of headaches, neck pain, and numbness and tingling in his fingers. After learning the results of his MRI, and based on discussions with one of his doctors, Ford concluded that he should undergo surgery to address his cervical disc condition. The question then arose as to whether this condition was causally related to the accident of September 29. Ford\u2019s doctors were not in unanimous agreement on this point, and it therefore became necessary for the WCC, and now this Court, to review the various medical opinions, and the bases therefor, in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Medical Evaluations and Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">\u00b67 Ford was first seen by Adam Mattingly, a physician assistant at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the Billings clinic, on September 30, 2009. Mattingly diagnosed Ford has having suffered a cervical strain. He recommended physical therapy and certain restrictions on Ford\u2019s physical activities. Ford did not find the physical therapy beneficial, however, and continued to complain of neck pain and intermittent numbness and tingling in his fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b68 Ford underwent a cervical MRI on October 20. The MRI revealed degenerative changes in Ford\u2019s cervical spine, most significantly at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels. There was disc desiccation, disc space narrowing, posterior bony ridging and disc bulge, and a foraminal disc herniation which compromised the right neural foramen.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b69 Mattingly referred Ford to a neurosurgeon, Eric Schubert, M.D., who saw Ford on three occasions in November and December 2009. Based on Ford\u2019s medical history, the MRI results, and a neurological examination, Dr. Schubert opined that the degenerative changes shown on Ford\u2019s MRI \u201cwere certainly present\u201d <em>before </em>the work-related accident, with the possible exception of a disc protrusion or herniation at the C5-6 level which Dr. Schubert stated \u201cmay have occurred\u201d at the time of the accident. Dr. Schubert theorized that Ford had an underlying asymptomatic degenerative lesion which \u201ccould have become\u201d symptomatic as a result of the accident. He noted, however, that Ford\u2019s cervical condition did not fit with his complaints of numbness and tingling in his fingers, i.e., there was \u201csome mismatch of his radicular symptoms with the cervical pathology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b610 Dr. Schubert opined that surgery may have \u201csome role\u201d in Ford\u2019s treatment, but he advised Ford that he wanted to exhaust nonsurgical treatment options first. Dr. Schubert recommended a cervical epidural steroid injection. When this did not provide relief, he ordered a second epidural steroid injection and recommended that Ford undergo bilateral electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) studies of the upper extremities. Ford underwent the EMG/NCV studies on December 4. The studies did not reveal any evidence of radiculopathy (i.e., disease of the spinal nerve roots from inflammation or impingement) or other neuropathies in either arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b611 Dr. Schubert reevaluated Ford on December 23. Based on Ford\u2019s report that his symptoms still persisted, and given the fairly significant findings on the MRI, Dr. Schubert concluded that \u201cthe better part of valor is to offer surgery and, if [Ford] wishes, to proceed with surgical treatment\u201d (specifically, a two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C5-6 and C6-7). Dr. Schubert noted that he had reviewed the MRI images with another neurosurgeon who agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>that Ford\u2019s cervical pathology \u201cshould be fixed.\u201d Dr. Schubert advised Ford, however, that the potential benefit of surgery was about a 50 percent chance of significant improvement in his neck pain and no likely change in his hand symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b612 Meanwhile, at Mattingly\u2019s request, Ford was evaluated by Scott Ross, M.D., an occupational medicine specialist, who became Ford\u2019s treating physician and continued to evaluate Ford on roughly a monthly basis. At their first visit, on December 4, Dr. Ross thoroughly reviewed Ford\u2019s available medical records, questioned Ford about his current status, and conducted a physical examination. Dr. Ross noted that Ford was continuing to report pain in the posterior neck region, but there was \u2018ho point localization or point specificity\u201d to the complaints. Nor was there any \u201cconsistent pattern or periodicity\u201dto the complaints; rather, \u201cthey vary from day to day per his report.\u201dDr. Ross inspected the posterior region of Ford\u2019s neck and found no redness, puffiness, swelling, discoloration, edema, or bony step-off in the midline. When Dr. Ross made light touch palpations in the neck region, Ford gave \u201cexaggerated/embellished\u201d pain responses (in Dr. Ross\u2019s opinion). As for Ford\u2019s appearance and mobility, Dr. Ross observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">Mr. Ford is seated comfortably in the exam chair during today\u2019s lengthy interview. He does not shift about uncomfortably, nor does he appear uncomfortable. Throughout the interview, he is freely and fully moving his head and neck. He is able to easily rotate and extend his neck when looking up at the \u2018Pain Chart\u201d mounted on the exam room cupboard, performing this task without limitation or pain complaint. He stands without assistance, difficulty, or pain complaint. He is able to dress/undress without assistance or difficulty. He moves about during today\u2019s examination without difficulty or pain. He doffed his long sleeved T-shirt without difficulty, using both upper extremities -no pain complaints. At the conclusion of today\u2019s physical examination, he donned his long sleeved T-shirt without difficulty, and donned his jacket without difficulty, utilizing both upper extremities. He also donned his knitted cap at the end of today\u2019s physical exam, utilizing both upper extremities to position the cap, performing this task without difficulty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b613 Dr. Ross found no \u201cobjective correlation\u201d between his physical examination of Ford and Ford\u2019s subjective complaints of neck pain. Likewise, Dr. Ross noted that Ford\u2019s complaints of numbness and tingling in his fingers were not consistent with the EMG/NCV studies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>which had revealed no electrodiagnostic abnormality. Dr. Ross assessed Ford has having a cervical strain and recommended that Ford undergo a psychological evaluation. Dr. Schubert concurred in this recommendation. As to Ford\u2019s request for pain medication, Dr. Ross noted that Ford had been prescribed \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of narcotic pain medication since October and that Dr. Schubert had recently prescribed a one-month supply. Dr. Ross thus denied Ford\u2019s request. \u00b614 Joseph McElhinny, Psy.D., conducted the psychological evaluation of Ford on December 30 and then issued a report based on his review of Ford\u2019s post-injury medical records, his clinical interview with Ford, a Personality Assessment Inventory, and a Survey of Pain Attitudes. Dr. McElhinny concluded that Ford has a somatoform pain disorder that is being fueled by depression. Dr. McElhinny observed that Ford seemed unhappy, had very low self-insight into his own affective functioning, and focused on external causes for his unhappiness. Dr. McElhinny opined that Ford exhibits physical symptomatology, like high levels of pain, in lieu of emotional distress. Dr. McElhinny also posited that Ford\u2019s response to pain-producing stimuli is exaggerated because of Ford\u2019s prior methamphetamine use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. McElhinny observed that \u2018Mr. Ford has a number of antisocial personality features which come into play when he is seeking medical care and treatment. He is prone to manipulative behaviors (almost automatically).\u201dDr. McElhinny thus cautioned medical care providers to \u201cuse only objective medical evidence when prescribing treatments for this man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b615 In a letter to Sentry that is undated but appears to have been written following the psychological evaluation, Dr. Schubert reiterated his opinion that Ford has a cervical condition which \u201cmay very well be\u201d the cause of his neck pain and which warrants surgical treatment. Although Ford\u2019s subjective complaints of pain did not correlate with obj ective medical findings on physical examination, Dr. Schubert noted that \u201cmany surgical candidates with significant axial skeletal pain with significant degenerative pathology unresponsive to medical or non-operative therapy do not have objective findings on examination and very often do well with surgery in terms of symptom relief.\u201d Dr. Schubert recommended that Ford be referred for a second neurosurgical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00b616 Steven Speth, M.D., an orthopedic spine surgeon, evaluated Ford on March 11, 2010. He diagnosed Ford with cervical spondylosis (i.e., degenerative disc disease resulting in compression of the nerve roots), and congenital and acquired stenosis (abnormal narrowing of the open spaces within the spine) at C5-6. He found \u201cobjective evidence for surgery in that there is significant cord flattening and some subtle signal change within the cord.\u201d He thus recommended that Ford proceed with Dr. Schubert\u2019s proposed treatment. Dr. Speth provided \u2018ho opinion regarding causation,\u201d however.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b617 Dr. Ross reevaluated Ford in January, March, and April 2010. His assessments at these evaluations were more or less the same as his original December 4 assessment: Ford made subjective complaints of diffuse and generalized posterior neck pain and headaches, but Dr. Ross found no objective correlation on physical examination. Notably, Dr. Ross twice recorded \u201can examination inconsistency.\u201d Specifically, Ford reported pain to <em>light </em>touch palpation over the posterior spinous processes in the cervical midline; however, \u201cwhen distracted,\u201d <em>firm, </em>palpation pressure in this same region elicited no pain response whatsoever. At the January 11 evaluation, Dr. Ross noted that \u201cthroughout today\u2019s interview, Mr. Ford is freely, fluidly, and fully moving his cervical spine, including flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation; in fact, he exhibits excellent range of motion of the cervical spine.\u201d Likewise, at the March 16 evaluation, Dr. Ross noted that Ford was seated comfortably in the exam chair during the interview, was \u201ccheerful, smiling, and joking throughout today\u2019s evaluation,\u201d and was moving his head and neck \u2018freely and fully . . . without limitation, restriction, or pain complaint.\u201d Dr. Ross made similar observations at the April 12 evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b618 Dr. Ross\u2019s last evaluation of Ford occurred May 17, 2010. Ford reported a reduction in the frequency and intensity of his headaches. He also reported that his neck pain was minimal in intensity, describing it as \u2018just annoying,\u201d without radicular-type symptoms into either upper extremity. Ford had been walking approximately one mile per day and was able to lift his three-year-old son, who weighed approximately 40 pounds. Dr. Ross observed Ford moving his head, neck, and both upper extremities fully and freely, without limitation, restriction, or pain complaint. Ford reported no pain to palpation over the posterior spinous processes in the cervical midline.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b619 Based on this evaluation, Dr. Ross concluded that Ford had reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d from the September 29 work incident. Dr. Ross opined To]n a medically more probable than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>not basis\u201d that the accident had caused \u201ca temporary aggravation\u201d of Ford\u2019s preexisting cervical spine condition and that Ford had now returned to his \u2018baseline status.\u201d Dr. Ross thus released Ford \u2018to regular and unrestricted work duties,\u201d noting there were \u2018bo permanent limitations or restrictions\u201d attributable to the work incident. As for the proposed surgery, Dr. Ross stated \u201c[o]n a medically more probable than not basis\u201dthat Ford\u2019s need for a two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion \u2018is not causally related to/attributable to\u201d the work incident. Rather, in Dr. Ross\u2019s opinion, \u201c[a]ny surgery contemplated at this time is attributable to the preexisting cervical spondylosis and congenital/acquired spinal stenosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b620 Henry Gary, M.D., a neurosurgeon, conducted an independent medical examination of Ford on July 20. He reviewed the available medical records, including Ford\u2019s MRI, took Ford\u2019s history, and performed a physical examination. Ford reported neck pain and numbness in certain fingers. He also complained of daily headaches, which were \u201con and off all day long\u201d but lessened somewhat with the use of Percocet. Ford reported that he had recently developed a new type of headache, which Dr. Gary thought might be migrainous. Dr. Gary opined that this type of headache could be related to Ford\u2019s ongoing use of narcotic medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b621 Dr. Gary diagnosed Ford with chronic cervical strain. In Dr. Gary\u2019s opinion, \u201con a more probable than not basis,\u201d Ford\u2019s cervical disc condition \u201cpreceded\u201d the industrial injury and was \u201cnot caused by the injury.\u201d He noted that there is a \u201cpossibility\u201d that some disc herniation \u201ccould have occurred\u201d with the accident, but he stated that it is \u2018impossible\u201d to determine whether or not it did due to the absence of a pre-injury MRI. Dr. Gary agreed with Drs. Schubert and Speth that Ford needs surgery to address his underlying degenerative disc disease. Dr. Gary also agreed with the procedure recommended by Dr. Schubert. Importantly, however, Dr. Gary stated that in his opinion \u201csurgery is necessary because of the radiographic findings and not because of the symptoms that [Ford] is complaining of.\u201d In his opinion, Ford\u2019s present pain \u2018Is related to the cervical strain injury\u201drather than \u201cthe underlying degenerative disc disease, which is a separate issue.\u201d In this regard, Dr. Gary noted that Ford\u2019s complaints of neck pain, headaches, and episodic numbness and tingling in certain fingers do \u2018hot correlate well\u201d with the MRI findings, but are \u201cconsistent with\u201d a cervical strain injury. Dr. Gary was \u2018hot optimistic,\u201d therefore, that surgery would significantly alter Ford\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b622 Upon receipt of Dr. Gary\u2019s report, Sentry desired to obtain \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>consensus opinion\u201das to whether Ford\u2019s need for cervical spine surgery is causally related to the accident. Responding to Sentry\u2019s inquiry, Dr. Ross indicated that he would defer to the spine surgeons (Drs. Schubert, Speth, and Gary) regarding <em>the necessity </em>for surgery. But as to <em>the underlying cause, </em>Dr. Ross stated that he agreed with Dr. Gary: on a medically more probable than not basis, any contemplated surgery is \u201cattributable to the preexisting and radiographically confirmed cervical spondylosis, degenerative disk disease, and congenital/acquired spinal stenosis, and not attributable to the 09/29/09 cervical strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b623 Dr. Schubert also responded to Sentry\u2019s inquiry. In his opinion, Ford had suffered \u201ccervical strain from essentially a \u2018whiplash\u2019 mechanism of injury.\u201d Dr. Schubert noted that Ford\u2019s MRI findings were consistent with \u201ctypical degenerative changes\u201d and \u201cmost likely predated his injury.\u201d He stated that Ford \u201ccould have\u201d become symptomatic from a preexisting degenerative problem, but he classified this as \u201ca medical possibility and not as a medical probability.\u201d Dr. Schubert suggested that the contemplated surgery would not necessarily resolve Ford\u2019s headaches and neck pain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">While I believe that surgery is effective in some cases of neck pain refractory to non-operative treatments and without radicular symptoms but with significant degenerative changes, I think that it\u2019s [sic] success rate for significant improvement is in the 50% range at best and this without confounding factors. I think that sometimes headaches from muscle spasm compensatory or secondary to degenerative spine conditions can sometimes improve[;] however ... <em>if this occurs this is an extra \u201cbonus\u201d of the procedure, </em>but not something that can be expected as headaches have so many other causes other th[a]n cervical muscle spasm. I think in the majority of cases, headaches associated with neck pain do not respond to surgical treatment. ... Surgery for essentially axial neck pain in the face of degenerative changes is at best a 50/50 chance of improvement in symptoms without confounding factors. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Dr. Schubert concluded: \u2018TG]iven that Mr. Ford does have confounding issues and particularly in light of his neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. McElhinny, I think he would be a very poor candidate for surgery and would [be] very unlikely to have significant relief of his symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b624 The last doctor to provide an opinion on Ford\u2019s condition is John Moseley, M.D., MS, PC. Dr. Moseley, a neurosurgeon, conducted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>independent medical examination of Ford on September 23, 2010. He diagnosed Ford with cervical radiculopathy (i.e., irritation of a cervical nerve root due to a cervical disc herniation) and posttraumatic headache. He opined, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical probability,\u201d that the work incident aggravated Ford\u2019s preexisting cervical spine condition by causing the discs at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels to bulge significantly enough to compress and impinge his spinal cord. Dr. Moseley detailed his reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">The objective medical evidence which supports this finding is the fact that Mr. Ford has never had cervical spine symptoms or cervical radiculopathy before this injury occurred. He denies having any symptoms at all before this injury. There are no medical records of any cervical spine complaints before the 09/29/09 injury. I performed many operations on cervical conditions very similar to Mr. Ford\u2019s condition over the course of my career as a neurosurgeon. In my experience, patient\u2019s [sic] with Mr. Ford\u2019s degree of cervical radiculopathy involvement as shown on the 10/20/09 MRI seek medical treatment urgently. The fact that Mr. Ford immediately sought medical treatment one day after his injury and that his cervical radiculopathy symptoms have continued more or less in the same timeframe, leads me to conclude within a reasonability [sic] degree of medical probability that his injury produced a material and substantiation [sic] aggravation of his cervical disk disease, i.e., bulging disk significant to cause symptoms. Other factors which influence my opinion are the nature of the injury itself. Rapid hyperextension and flexion of the cervical spine is one of the most common methods of causing or substantially aggravating disks in the cervical spine. His description of his injury and onset of symptoms is common, in my experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b625 Dr. Gary reviewed Dr. Moseley\u2019s assessment. In a December 22, 2010 letter to Sentry, he stated that he disagreed with the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy. Dr. Gary pointed out that Ford had not described \u201ca true radiculopathy, as he has no radiating pain from the neck out the arms.\u201d Dr. Gary noted that he had found no objective findings of radiculopathy in his evaluation of Ford and that neither Dr. Schubert nor Dr. Ross had described a radiculopathy or a radiculitis in their medical reports. Dr. Gary was thus \u201cat a loss as to why Dr. Moseley would classify this as a radiculopathy with discrepancy in the sensory findings.\u201d In any event, Dr. Gary concluded that if Ford had in fact developed symptoms of radiculopathy, it was unrelated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>workplace injury and more likely related to progressive cervical spondylitic changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b626 Ford testified at trial that his ongoing physical complaints since the accident are daily headaches, stiffness and soreness in his neck, and numbness and tingling in some of his fingers. He stated that his pain medications lessen his symptoms but that his pain has never entirely resolved. Ford testified that he wants surgery on his neck and understands that doctors have predicted a 50 percent chance that the procedure will improve his neck pain and headaches. He stated that he does not believe he can work presently because he does not believe he could find a job that would allow him to take frequent breaks and lie down as much as is necessary. Ford currently receives unemployment benefits and has conducted job searches as required to maintain those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The WCC\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b627 On the question whether Sentry is liable for medical bills and treatment involving Ford\u2019s cervical disc condition, the WCC noted that the parties\u2019 dispute centered on whether the industrial accident had caused or aggravated the condition. In this regard, the WCC observed that Dr. Moseley had opined Ford\u2019s cervical disc herniation occurred in the accident, while Drs. Schubert and Gary thought this was possible but could not say with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the accident had caused the herniation. As to which of these opinions it would give more weight, the WCC noted that the opinion of a treating physician is generally accorded greater weight than the opinions of other expert witnesses, although it is not conclusive. <em>See EBI/Orion Group v. Blythe, </em>1998 MT 90, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 288 Mont. 356, 957 P.2d 1134. Here, Dr. Schubert treated Ford for his cervical condition following the accident, whereas Drs. Gary and Moseley saw Ford for independent medical examinations. The WCC also noted that it considers such factors as the relative credentials of the physicians and the quality of evidence upon which the physicians based their respective opinions. Here, the court observed, no evidence was presented giving it grounds to assign greater weight to Dr. Moseley\u2019s opinion than to Dr. Schubert\u2019s opinion. Thus, the WCC ruled that \u2018Tsjince Dr. Schubert was unable to state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ford\u2019s industrial accident caused his cervical disk condition, I conclude that Ford has not proven that his industrial accident caused his cervical disk condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b628 As to the issue of aggravation, the WCC distinguished <em>Narum v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 127, 350 Mont. 252, 206 P.3d 964, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>where this Court concluded that Narum had met his statutory burden to show that his industrial accident aggravated his preexisting degenerative hip condition, thus requiring hip surgery and other treatments. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-31. The WCC noted that in <em>Narum, </em>the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain correlated with objective medical findings regarding his hip condition, whereas Ford\u2019s subjective complaints of pain do not correlate with the objective medical findings regarding his cervical disc condition. The WCC reasoned that \u201c[ajlthough Ford clearly has ongoing problems from the industrial injury, the medical opinions in evidence indicate that the problems from the industrial injury would not be addressed by the proposed surgery Ford seeks.\u201d Based on the medical evidence, the WCC concluded \u201cthat Ford had an asymptomatic cervical disk condition before his industrial injury and continues to have an asymptomatic cervical disk condition after his industrial injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b629 The WCC next considered whether Sentry is liable for temporary total disability benefits subsequent to Dr. Ross\u2019s May 17, 2010 determination that Ford has reached maximum medical improvement. In this regard, the WCC noted that some of Ford\u2019s doctors have recommended additional treatment for his symptoms of headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his fingers which the court noted \u201care indisputably related to his industrial injury.\u201d The WCC reasoned that it is impossible for an injured worker to be simultaneously at maximum medical improvement while still expected to improve with further treatment. Nevertheless, the WCC observed that if an injured worker has been released to return to his time-of-injury employment, then he is not eligible for temporary total disability benefits. Thus, since no doctor had disputed Dr. Ross\u2019s opinion that Ford can return to work without restriction, the WCC held that Ford is not entitled to temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b630 Lastly, the WCC concluded that since Ford was not the prevailing party, he was not entitled to costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or a penalty under \u00a739-71-611 and -2907, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b631 We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are correct. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 25. We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 25.

This is because an assessment of testimony is best made upon observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor and consideration of other intangibles that are only evident during live testimony. <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 12. Conversely, we are in as good a position as the WCC to assess testimony presented by way of deposition, and we thus conduct de novo review of deposition testimony. <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 13. The same principle would apply to the assessment of medical opinions provided through written reports, and our review of such medical opinions is thus de novo. If there is conflicting evidence, we consider whether substantial evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings, not whether the evidence might support contrary findings. <em>Keller v.

This is incorrect. The statutes in effect on the date of the accident or injury control in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>Fleming v. Intl. Paper Co., </em>2008 MT 327, \u00b6 26, 346 Mont. 141, 194 P.3d 77. Ford\u2019s accident occurred on September 29, 2009. With exceptions not applicable here, \u201cevery statute . . . takes effect on the first day of October following its passage and approval.\u201dSection 1-2- 201(l)(a), MCA. Thus, laws enacted by the 2009 Legislature did not take effect until two days after Ford\u2019s accident (again, with exceptions not applicable here, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1-2-201, MCA). It follows, then, that the 2007 version of the Act governs Ford\u2019s claim, and all statutory references below are to the 2007 MCA unless otherwise indicated. Although the WCC misstated the governing version of the Act, we conclude that the court ultimately reached the correct resolution of this case in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b633 <em>Issue 1. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for medical bills and treatment involving Ford\u2019s cervical disc condition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b634 Ford, as claimant, bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits sought. <em>Simms v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 511, 116 P.3d 773. This includes establishing a \u201ccausal connection\u201dbetween his injury and the right to benefits. <em>Fellenberg v. Transp. Ins.

The first pertains to the standard of proof; the second concerns the WCC\u2019s reliance solely on medical opinions; and the third involves the WCC\u2019s interpretation of the evidence. We address these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A. Standard of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b636 An insurer is liable for the payment of compensation to an employee who receives \u201can injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Section 39-71-407(1), MCA. The claimant must establish that it is \u2018haore probable than not\u201d that (i) a claimed injury has occurred or (ii) a claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition. Section 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA. Proof that it was \u201cmedically possible\u201d that a claimed injury occurred, or that the claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition, is not sufficient to establish liability. Section 39-71-407(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b637 Section 39-71-119, MCA, provides the controlling definitions with regard to the injury itself and the requisite causal connection. <em>Burns v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>268 Mont. 82, 84, 885 P.2d 508, 509 (1994); \u00a739-71-407(2)(a), MCA (\u201cAn insurer is liable for an injury, <em>as defined in 39-71-119, </em>....\u2019\u2019(emphasis added)). An \u2018injury\u201dmay take the form of internal or external physical harm to the body, damage to prosthetic devices or appliances, or death. Section 39-71-119(1), MCA. By definition, an \u201cinjur/\u2019 is \u201ccaused by\u201d an \u201caccident,\u201d i.e., by \u201can unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain; identifiable by time and place of occurrence; identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift.\u201d Section 39-71-119(2), MCA. Thus, to be compensable, \u201cthere must be an \u2018injury\u2019 and an \u2018accident,\u2019 and the injury must be \u2018caused by\u2019 the accident.\u201d <em>Welch v. Am. Mine Servs., </em>253 Mont. 76, 81, 831 P.2d 580, 584 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b638 We read \u00a7\u00a739-71-407 and -119, MCA, together, not only because the former expressly references the latter, but also because \u201c \u2018when interpreting statutes we view them as part of a whole statutory scheme, and construe them so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tinker v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2009 MT 218, \u00b6 30, 351 Mont. 305, 211 P.3d 194 (quoting <em>Vader v. Fleetwood Enters., </em>2009 MT 6, \u00b6 30, 348 Mont. 344, 201 P.3d 139). Doing so, the statutory standard is clear: the claimant\u2019s burden to establish an accident, an injury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>aggravation of a preexisting condition, and a causal connection between the accident and the injury/aggravation is \u201cmore probable than not.\u201d <em>Prillaman v. Community Med. Ctr., </em>264 Mont. 134, 137, 870 P.2d 82, 84 (1994) (\u201c[B]y reference [to \u00a739-71-119, MCA], \u00a739-71-407, MCA, dictates that \u2018accident,\u2019 \u2018injury\u2019 and \u2018causation\u2019 must be proven by the claimant with the \u2018more probable than not\u2019 burden of proof.\u201d). \u00b639 Ford contends that the WCC failed to apply this standard in his case. The WCC began its analysis with a statement of the statutory standard: \u201can insurer is liable for an injury ... if the claimant establishes that it is more probable than not that the claimed injury either occurred or aggravated a preexisting condition\u201d (citing \u00a739-71-407(2), MCA). The WCC then proceeded, however, to use the term \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d in its analysis and ultimately held that \u2018is]ince Dr. Schubert was unable to state <em>with a reasonable degree of medical certainty </em>that Ford\u2019s industrial accident caused his cervical disk condition, I conclude that Ford has not proven that his industrial accident caused his cervical disk condition\u201d (emphasis added). Ford argues that the WCC erred in holding him to this \u201cmedical certainty\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b640 Sentry, on the other hand, argues that the WCC did not hold Ford to the wrong standard. Sentry points out that the WCC relied on the reports of Ford\u2019s physicians, all of whom expressed their opinions in terms of medical \u201cprobability.\u201d At one point in his report, Dr. Gary also used the term \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d; however, this was in his answer to a question posed by Sentry, where Sentry asked Dr. Gary to \u201cplease state your opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, i.e., medically more probable than not.\u201d Sentry opines that the WCC likewise used the terms \u201cmedical certainty\u201d and \u201cmedical probability\u201d synonymously. Sentry contends that this Court and the WCC have used these terms interchangeably in prior cases, citing <em>Rightnour v. Kare-Mor, Inc., </em>225 Mont. 187, 732 P.2d 829 (1987), <em>Gallagher v. The Wally\u2019s Bar, </em>No. 8405-2458 (Mont. WCC Mar. 8, 1985), and <em>Strong v. Jacobs Constructors, </em>No. 8502-2895 (Mont. WCC June 19, 1985), as examples. We note that the pertinent portions of the WCC\u2019s orders in <em>Gallagher </em>and S7rorag-which Sentry quotes in its brief-are actually quotations from our decision in <em>Dallas v. Burlington N., Inc., </em>212 Mont. 514, 689 P.2d 273 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b641 Implicit in Ford\u2019s and Sentry\u2019s arguments is a dispute about whether \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d and \u201cmore probable than not\u201dare qualitatively different. Ford\u2019s position is that the former is a \u2018higher standard\u201d than the latter, while Sentry maintains that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>two terms are synonymous. We conclude, however, that we need not attempt to parse these terms in resolving the standard of proof issue. In <em>Dallas, </em>we observed that this Court has generally adhered to a test of \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d as the basis for admitting medical testimony. 212 Mont. at 522, 689 P.2d at 277. We recognized, however, that this term Is not well understood by the medical profession\u201d because \u201c[l]ittle, if anything, is \u2018certain\u2019 in science.\u201d <em>Dallas, </em>212 Mont. at 522-23, 689 P.2d at 277. We explained that what we are striving for \u201cis a probability rather than a possibility\u201d and, thus, that \u201c[o]ur evidentiary standards are satisfied if medical testimony is based upon an opinion that it is \u2018more likely than not.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Dallas, </em>212 Mont. at 523, 689 P.2d at 277. Since then, we have adhered to the proposition that \u201ca medical expert\u2019s opinion is admissible if it is based on an opinion that it is \u2018more likely than not.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Butler v. Domin, </em>2000 MT 312, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 452, 15 P.3d 1189 (quoting <em>Dallas, </em>212 Mont. at 523, 689 P.2d at 277); <em>accord State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 129, 130 P.3d 169; <em>Estate of Willson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410. The \u2018inore likely than not\u201d standard assures that the expert testimony or opinion \u201cdoes not represent mere conjecture, but rather is sufficiently probative to be reliable.\u201d <em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Dallas, </em>212 Mont. at 523, 689 P.2d at 277).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b642 Subsequent to <em>Dallas, </em>the Legislature incorporated a \u2018inore probable than not\u201d standard into \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA, as the burden which a claimant must satisfy in demonstrating accident, injury, and causation. Laws of Montana, 1987, ch. 464, \u00a7 11. Of course, notwithstanding the particular language used in the statute, we cannot control how doctors phrase their opinions and testimony on these issues, and we do not purport to do so here. As a result, there may be cases in which a doctor states his or her opinion in terms of \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d or fails to state that his or her opinion is on a \u201cmore probable than not\u201d basis. Nevertheless, the probative force of the opinion \u2018is not to be defeated by semantics if it is reasonably apparent that the doctor intends to signify a probability supported by some rational basis.\u201d <em>Miller v. Natl. Cabinet Co., </em>168 N.E.2d 811, 813 (N.Y. 1960); <em>see also Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Myers, </em>411 S.W.2d 710, 713 (Tex. 1966) (\u2018Reasonable probability ... is determinable by consideration of the substance of the testimony of the expert witness and does not turn on semantics or on the use by the witness of any particular term or phrase.\u201d). Doctors are not lawyers and may on occasion phrase medical opinions in medical, rather than legal, terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u00b643 What is essential is that <em>the WCC </em>applies the correct standard in determining whether there was an accident in the course of employment, whether the claimant suffered an injury or an aggravation of a preexisting condition, and whether there is a causal connection between the accident and the injury/aggravation. That standard is \u201cmore probable than not.\u201d Here, it is apparent that the WCC recognized the correct statutory standard at the outset of its analysis. Regardless of whether the WCC intended its subsequent references to \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d to mean something different, we conclude for the reasons discussed below that the WCC ultimately reached the correct result when the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d standard is applied to the medical evidence at issue. Nevertheless, we note for purposes of future cases that it will facilitate this Court\u2019s review on appeal if the WCC frames its analysis in terms of the statutory \u201cmore probable than not\u201d standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">B. Objective Medical Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b644 Ford next contends that the WCC erred in relying solely on medical opinions to determine causation or aggravation. Ford recognizes that an injury must be established \u2018by objective medical findings.\u201d Section 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA. As noted, \u2018injury\u201d includes internal physical harm to the body, \u00a739-71-119(l)(a), MCA, and Ford contends that there is overwhelming objective medical evidence that he has internal physical harm to his body, namely, a cervical disc condition. Ford then asserts that once a claimant has provided objective medical findings of internal harm to the body, all the claimant must establish under \u00a739-71-407(2)(a)(ii), MCA, is that it is more probable than not that his injury aggravated his preexisting condition. Ford maintains that the evidence bearing on this question need not be limited to medical opinions. He quotes our statement in <em>Boyd v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., </em>2010 MT 52, \u00b6 22, 355 Mont. 336, 227 P.3d 1026, that \u201cclaimants are not required to prove causation through medical expertise or opinion.\u201d For the reasons which follow, however, we conclude that this statement in <em>Boyd </em>is an incorrect statement of the law and must accordingly be overruled. Pursuant to workers\u2019 compensation laws in effect since July 1, 1995, a claimant is required to establish injury and causation through objective medical findings. \u00b645 As authority for the proposition that \u201cclaimants are not required to prove causation through medical expertise or opinion,\u201d the Court in <em>Boyd </em>cited <em>Plainbull v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>264 Mont. 120,870 P.2d 76 (1994), and <em>Prillaman, </em>264 Mont. 134, 870 P.2d 82. <em>Plainbull </em>involved the 1989 version of \u00a739-71-407(2), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>(a) An insurer is liable for an injury as defined in 39-71-119 if the claimant establishes it is more probable than not that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">(i) a claimed injury has occurred; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">(ii) a claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">(b) Proof that it was medically possible that a claimed injury occurred or that such claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition is not sufficient to establish liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Interpreting this language, the WCC held that medical testimony is required to establish the requisite causal connection, i.e., that it is <em>\u201cmedically </em>more probable than not\u201d that a work-related accident caused the condition at issue. <em>Plainbull, </em>264 Mont. at 125, 870 P.2d at 80 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted). This Court, however, held that nothing in \u00a739-71-407(2)(a), MCA (1989), requires a medical opinion as to whether the injury actually occurred and whether it was caused by the accident. <em>Plainbull, </em>264 Mont. at 125, 870 P.2d at 79-80.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Under our present statutory scheme, all that the legislature has required of a claimant is that he establish that it is \u2018inore probable than not\u201d that his injury or aggravation of a preexisting condition occur[red] out of and in the course of his employment and ... that the injury cause[d] the condition for which he is seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Whether the claimant chooses to meet that burden with medical evidence, non-medical evidence or a combination of both, is up to him and, obviously, depends on the facts and circumstances of his particular case, the nature of the claimed injury, and the evidence available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqz\"><em>Plainbull, </em>264 Mont. at 126, 870 P.2d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b646 <em>Prillaman </em>involved the same question: whether the WCC erred in concluding that medical opinion evidence was required to establish injury and causation. 264 Mont. at 135, 870 P.2d at 83. Interpreting the 1991 version of \u00a739-71-407(2), MCA, which is identical to the 1989 version, we concluded that a claimant is not required to prove occurrence under \u00a739-71-407(2), MCA, and, by reference, causation under \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, by use of medical opinion evidence. <em>Prillaman, </em>264 Mont. at 137, 870 P.2d at 84.

Furthermore, the Legislature added the following italicized language to the definition of\u2018injury\u201d in \u00a739-71-119(1), MCA: \u201c(a) internal or external physical harm to the body <em>that is established by objective medical findings', </em>....\u2019\u2019Laws of Montana, 1995, ch. 243, \u00a76 (italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b648 As discussed, we interpret \u00a7 39-71-407(2) and -119, MCA, together. <em>See </em>\u00b6 38, supra; <em>Prillaman, </em>264 Mont. at 137, 870 P.2d at 84. Again, to constitute an \u2018Injury,\u201dthe internal or external physical harm to the claimant\u2019s body must have been \u201ccaused by\u201d a work-related accident. Section 39-71-119(l)(a), (2), MCA. In other words, a causal connection between the claimant\u2019s physical condition and a work-related accident is an integral part of establishing a compensable \u2018Injury\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA. That \u2018injury,\u201d and \u2018the entitlement to benefits\u201d generally, must be established by objective medical findings. Section 39-71-407(2)(a), (7), MCA. It follows, then, that not only the physical harm but also the causal connection must be established by objective medical findings. Indeed, that was the plain intent of the Legislature\u2019s 1995 amendments to these statutes subsequent to our decisions in <em>Plainbull </em>and <em>Prillaman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b649 For these reasons, we overrule the statement in <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 22, that \u201cclaimants are not required to prove causation through medical expertise or opinion.\u201d Claimants are required to establish injury and causation by objective medical findings. Accordingly, contrary to Ford\u2019s argument, the WCC did not err by relying solely on medical opinions to determine causation or aggravation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>C. Evaluation of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b650 Lastly, Ford claims the WCC erred in concluding that he did not prove a causal connection between his industrial accident and his cervical disc condition. Sentry, on the other hand, argues that the medical evidence establishes, more probably than not, that Ford sustained a cervical strain injury in the accident and that the accident did not cause or aggravate his underlying cervical condition. We agree with Sentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b651 There is no dispute that Ford has a cervical spine condition for which surgical treatment has been recommended. There also is no dispute that certain MRI findings, such as the bony ridging, could not have developed in the 21 days between the accident and the MRI and, therefore, must have been present before the accident. And there is no dispute that Ford suffered some sort of physical harm from the repeated \u201csnapping back\u201d motions when he tried to dislodge the jammed metal from the baler. What is in dispute is the particular harm Ford suffered-a cervical strain, or damage to his cervical discs for which surgery is required. In other words, is it more probable than not that Ford\u2019s spinal condition for which he seeks surgery was caused by the accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b652 Dr. Ross is an occupational medicine specialist who was Ford\u2019s primary treating physician for six months. Dr. Schubert was Ford\u2019s treating neurosurgeon for two months. Dr. Gary, also a neurosurgeon, saw Ford for an independent medical examination. All three doctors agreed that Ford suffered a cervical strain from essentially a \u201cwhiplash\u201d mechanism of injury. All three doctors agreed that the degenerative changes shown on Ford\u2019s MRI were present before the accident. Drs. Schubert and Gary opined that some disc herniation <em>could </em>have occurred with the accident, but that this was only a medical \u201cpossibility\u201d and not a medical \u201cprobability.\u201d All three doctors agreed that Ford\u2019s subjective complaints did not correlate well or fit with his cervical pathology shown on the MRI. All three doctors agreed that the recommended surgery was necessary to address Ford\u2019s preexisting and radiographically confirmed degenerative spine condition, and not to address the symptoms that he was complaining of. None of the three doctors was optimistic that surgery would significantly improve Ford\u2019s pain complaints. Dr. Schubert stated that any improvement in Ford\u2019s headaches would be a \u2018bonus\u201d of the surgical procedure, rather than an expected result, and that surgery for axial neck pain in the face of degenerative changes had at best a 50/50 chance of improvement in symptoms without confounding factors. Drs. Ross and Gary expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>their opinions on a \u201cmore probable than not\u201d basis. Dr. Schubert expressed his opinions in terms of medical \u201cprobabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b653 Dr. Moseley is the only doctor to have offered an opinion that Ford suffered something more than a cervical strain injury. Dr. Moseley, also a neurosurgeon, saw Ford for an independent medical examination. He opined, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical probability,\u201d that the accident had caused the discs at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels to bulge significantly enough to compress and impinge Ford\u2019s spinal cord. The bases of this opinion were: Ford was asymptomatic prior to the accident; in Dr. Moseley\u2019s experience, patients with the sort of cervical pathology shown on Ford\u2019s MRI seek medical treatment urgently; Ford immediately sought medical treatment one day after his injury; Ford\u2019s symptoms have continued; and rapid hyperextension and flexion of the cervical spine is one of the most common methods of aggravating discs in the cervical spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b654 Ford contends that Dr. Moseley\u2019s opinion is the only medical opinion that fits all the facts of this case and that the WCC erred in crediting Dr. Schubert\u2019s and Dr. Gary\u2019s opinions over Dr. Moseley\u2019s. He presents essentially three arguments in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b655 First, Ford argues that a cervical strain diagnosis cannot be correct because he underwent treatments for cervical strain and his symptoms persisted nonetheless. Ford testified that he faithfully complied with his physical therapy but that it did not provide lasting relief, and he notes that the WCC found him to be a credible witness. Ford fails to acknowledge, however, other explanations for his ongoing symptoms. It was precisely because he continued to complain of pain-despite the absence of any objective findings in the MRI results or on the physical examinations to explain his complaints-that Drs. Ross and Schubert concurred in sending Ford for a psychological evaluation. Dr. McElhinny determined that Ford has a somatoform pain disorder which is being fueled by depression; that Ford is more likely to exhibit physical symptomatology, like high levels of pain, in lieu of emotional distress; that Ford is prone to \u201cmanipulative behaviors\u201d when seeking medical care and treatment; and that medical care providers, therefore, should use only \u201cobjective medical evidence\u201d when prescribing treatments for Ford. Ford\u2019s pain complaints must be viewed in light of Dr. McElhinny\u2019s unrefuted assessment. In addition, Dr. Gary opined that Ford\u2019s migrainous headaches could be related to his chronic use of narcotic medication, as opposed to his cervical disc condition. Hence, given the medical evidence, the fact that Ford reported he did not experience relief from the cervical strain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>treatments does not make the cervical strain diagnosis-in which three of his physicians concurreddess probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b656 Second, although Drs. Schubert and Gary stated that some disc herniation in the accident was a medical \u201cpossibility,\u201d but not a medical \u201cprobability,\u201d Ford nevertheless contends that we can infer he suffered damage to his cervical discs given the onset of his symptoms and the mechanism of his injury. Specifically, Ford states that he lacked neck symptoms before the accident; that repetitive hyper extension and flexion of the cervical spine is known to aggravate degenerative cervical spine conditions; that he had an immediate onset of symptoms following the accident; and that if his cervical disc condition was as bad before the accident as it appeared on the MRI taken after the accident, then he surely would have had symptoms and sought medical attention prior to the accident. Dr. Moseley engaged in the very same reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b657 The fact that Ford had an immediate onset of symptoms following the accident, however, does not necessarily establish that the accident more probably than not caused or aggravated his cervical disc condition. Rather, the crux of Dr. Moseley\u2019s opinion, and of Ford\u2019s argument, is that Ford would have been in pain prior to the accident if his cervical condition, as shown on his post-injury MRI, did in fact exist prior to the accident. Yet, as Drs. Ross, Schubert, and Gary attested, Ford\u2019s subjective complaints do not correlate or fit with what is shown on the MRI. Dr. Moseley is alone in suggesting the contrary, and the persuasive value of his opinion is low. For one thing, unlike the reports of Drs. Ross, Schubert, and Gary, there is no indication in Dr. Moseley\u2019s report that he specifically took Dr. McElhinny\u2019s findings into account. Moreover, in reviewing Dr. Moseley\u2019s diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, Dr. Gary pointed out that Ford had not described \u201ca true radiculopathy\u201d and that there were no objective findings of radiculopathy in Ford\u2019s medical records. Lastly, Dr. Moseley did not document or cite any objective findings specific to his examination of Ford, but instead relied on generalizations about his past experiences with other patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b658 Third, Ford contends that Dr. Schubert\u2019s opinion should be rejected because Dr. Schubert allegedly changed his diagnosis and treatment recommendation \u201csimply to run with the herd and avoid a deposition or trial testimony.\u201d There is absolutely no evidence in the record, however, substantiating the theory that Dr. Schubert tailored his medical opinions for such purposes. Moreover, contrary to Ford\u2019s argument, Dr. Schubert never said that Ford\u2019s neck pain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>headaches were more probably than not attributable to the disc problems shown on his MRI or that Ford had more probably than not suffered an aggravation of his cervical disc condition. What Dr. Schubert said in his early reports was that a disc herniation \u201cmay have occurred\u201d at the time of the accident, that Ford\u2019s underlying asymptomatic degenerative condition \u201ccould have become\u201d symptomatic as a result of the accident, and that Ford\u2019s cervical condition \u201cmay\u201d be the cause of his neck pain. It is clear that Dr. Schubert was reluctant to give a definitive opinion on causation at this stage. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Dr. Schubert consistently viewed surgery as necessary primarily to address Ford\u2019s preexisting degenerative spine condition, and only incidentally to address Ford\u2019s pain. Dr. Schubert\u2019s position has always been that the surgical procedure to address Ford\u2019s cervical spine condition has at best a 50/50 chance of also providing significant improvement in Ford\u2019s neck pain, with no likely change in his hand symptoms</p>\n<p id=\"ApS\">\u00b659  Although they are not conclusive, the opinions of Ford\u2019s treating physicians (Drs. Ross and Schubert) are entitled to greater weight than the opinions of the other expert witnesses. <em>EBI/Orion Group, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. We agree with the WCC that no grounds exist in the record for weighing Dr. Moseley\u2019s opinion more heavily than the opinions of Ford\u2019s treating physicians. Based on all of the medical opinions in this case, we conclude it is more probable than not that Ford suffered a cervical strain injury on September 29, 2009, and that the recommended surgery is necessary to address his preexisting degenerative spine condition rather than an injury or condition resulting from the accident. The WCC\u2019s determination that Ford failed in his burden to establish causation is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b660 <em>Issue 2. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for ongoing temporary total disability benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b661 A worker is eligible for temporary total disability benefits (a) when the worker suffers a total loss of wages as a result of an injury and until the worker reaches maximum healing, or (b) until the worker has been released to return to the employment in which the worker was engaged at the time of the injury or to employment with similar physical requirements. Section 39-71-701(1), MCA. The determination of temporary total disability must be supported by a preponderance of objective medical findings. Section 39-71-701(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b662 Ford contends the WCC erred in concluding that he is not entitled to ongoing temporary total disability benefits. He maintains that he \u2018is incapable of working due to his cervical disk condition resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>his industrial accident.\u201d As discussed above, however, Ford has failed to establish, on a more probable than not basis, that his cervical disc condition was caused by the accident. The objective medical findings establish, rather, that it is more probable than not he suffered a cervical strain injury as a result of the accident. It is that injury we must assess here.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b663 Following his September 30, 2009 evaluation of Ford (the day after the accident), Mattingly released Ford to work with temporary restrictions-specifically, Ford was not to lift heavy objects and was to minimize continuous twisting or bending of his neck. Ford was released to work with similar temporary restrictions following his subsequent visits with Dr. Ross. On May 17,2010, Dr. Ross concluded that Ford could be released \u2018to regular and unrestricted work duties.\u201d Dr. Ross noted that there were \u201cno permanent limitations or restrictions\u201d attributable to the accident. He gave Ford a <em>\u201c0% </em>whole person impairment\u201d rating per the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 6th edition. Dr. Gary, in his July 23, 2010 report, stated that he agreed with this rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b664 While Ford disagrees with Dr. Ross\u2019 s assessment, the fact remains that no doctor has disputed Dr. Ross\u2019s opinion that Ford can return to work without restriction. The WCC cited this fact in concluding that Ford is not entitled to temporary total disability benefits. As noted, the determination of temporary total disability must be supported by a preponderance of objective medical findings. Section 39-71-701(2), MCA. Ford has failed to do so, and the WCC\u2019s decision as to this issue is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b665 <em>Issue 3. Whether the WCC erred in determining that Sentry is not liable for costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or a penalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b666  Because Ford\u2019s claim has not been \u201cadjudged compensable,\u201dhe is not entitled to costs and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a739-71-611, MCA. Nor is he entitled to the 20 percent penalty under \u00a739-71-2907, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b667 In summary, a workers\u2019 compensation claimant\u2019s burden to establish an accident, an injury or aggravation of a preexisting condition, and a causal connection between the accident and the injury/aggravation is \u201cmore probable than not.\u201d In meeting this burden, the claimant must establish injury and causation by objective medical findings. Ford failed to meet this burden with respect to his cervical disc condition. He also has not established by a preponderance of objective medical findings that he is entitled to ongoing temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>total disability benefits subsequent to May 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b668 In closing, we note that Ford has expressed concern in his reply brief regarding Sentry\u2019s argument that causation must be established \u2018by objective medical findings.\u201d As discussed above at \u00b6\u00b6 44-49, we agree with Sentry that \u00a7 39-71-407 and -119, MCA, impose this requirement. Ford fears that such an interpretation will have \u2018huge negative implications for Montana workers\u2019 compensation claimants\u201d because in many cases no objective medical findings have been developed to establish the baseline state of a preexisting condition owing to the fact that the preexisting condition was asymptomatic. Ford posits, therefore, that it may be difficult or impossible to establish aggravation of a preexisting condition by objective medical findings. Whether or not this is true, however, it does not control our resolution of this case. Absent a direct constitutional challenge to the statutes, this Court\u2019s role is simply to interpret and apply the statutes as written and consistent with legislative intent. Sections 1-2-101, -102, MCA. We must leave it to the Legislature to consider Ford\u2019s concerns regarding the ability of claimants to establish causation through objective medical findings as the statutes, at present, clearly require. \u00b669 The July 20,2011 judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\"> Ford admitted at trial in the WCC that he had been addicted to methamphetamine in the past.

In my view, this is a very close case, and, had I been the trial judge, I might very well have reached a different result.

In my view, the former is a qualitatively higher burden of proof than the latter. I believe that \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201dis to \u201cmore probable than not\u201d as \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is to \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d That being said, the Court concludes that in resolving this case, it is not necessary to address the difference between the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d and \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d standards. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Opinion, \u00b6 41.
