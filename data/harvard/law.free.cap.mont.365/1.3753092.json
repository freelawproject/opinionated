We hold that the District Court erred in adopting and implementing the recommendations of the child\u2019s Guardian ad Litem without first holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-23\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"At\">\u00b62 P.J. was born in Nevada, where Michael and Laura Wendlandt (Laura) were married in August 2002. Laura moved to Montana in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>2004, taking P.J. with her. Michael and Laura finalized their divorce in Nevada in May 2005. Michael last saw P.J. when he visited Missoula, Montana in May 2008. At about that time, Montana Child Protective Services (CPS) began investigating allegations that Michael sexually abused P.J. Laura had taken P.J. to see a therapist, Mary Jo Barrett, after P.J. related incidents with Michael that gave Laura concern. After approximately six months of counseling, and as P.J. became increasingly verbal, Barrett made a report to CPS. No charges were filed and CPS determined the allegations could not be substantiated. However, CPS recommended appointment of a Guardian ad Litem, supervised visitation with Michael, Michael\u2019s completion of a sex offender evaluation, and continued individual counseling for P.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b63 Laura filed an ex parte motion in the District Court on May 29, 2008, requesting temporary emergency jurisdiction, assumption of continuing jurisdiction, and an order of protection. Following unsuccessful attempts by the court to obtain files on the case from Nevada, Judge Larson ordered the parties to file status reports. In response to these reports, on March 12, 2009, the court appointed Guardian ad Litem Courtney Stone (Stone) and awarded full custody to Laura until Stone issued her report and recommendations. In her May 8, 2009 report, Stone recommended that, before Michael and P.J. were reintroduced, Michael needed to perform six specified tasks: (1) complete an evaluation by a certified sex offender therapist; (2) submit to testing for herpes; (3) complete a comprehensive psychological examination and parenting capacity assessment; (4) complete a full chemical dependency evaluation by a Licensed Addictions Counselor; (5) complete an investigative and relationship assessment per the recommendation of CPS; and (6) attend a Fourth Judicial District parenting class. Stone further recommended that once those tasks were completed, any visitation between Michael and P.J. should be supervised by P. J.\u2019s therapist and should occur in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b64 On May 12,2009, the District Court held a jurisdictional hearing under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), together with the Third Judicial District Court of Nevada, which appeared telephonically. Laura was present, represented by counsel, and Michael appeared pro se by telephone from Nevada. At the hearing, Michael stated emphatically that he did not hurt his son, but he did not object to the admission of Stone\u2019s report and agreed with her recommendations. He stated he was willing to comply with requests from either court. Based on the agreement of both courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Judge Larson ruled that Montana had jurisdiction over the matter. He adopted Stone\u2019s recommendations and terminated her appointment as GAL since she was taking a new job.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b65 The court appointed a new Guardian ad Litem, Janna Gobeo (Gobeo), on October 28, 2009, at Laura\u2019s request. Gobeo conducted additional investigation and agreed with Stone\u2019s recommendations. Michael thereafter filed a request to conduct discovery on the sexual abuse allegations. The District Court denied his request on February 1, 2010, stating that the issue of sexual abuse was not being litigated and that the parties needed to focus on the parenting plan and what steps would be necessary to begin a reunification process between P.J. and his father. Michael saw Dr. Robert Page, a psychologist, who performed an evaluation pursuant to the District Court\u2019s May 19,2009 order adopting Stone\u2019s recommendations. In conferring with Gobeo, Dr. Page reported that Michael did not suggest any signs of psychopathology and that the data did not indicate Michael lacked parenting awareness or the skills to parent children safely. Though he did not meet P.J. or Laura, Dr. Page indicated that the results of his evaluation did not justify preventing Michael from visiting P.J. However, due to the lengthy separation, he recommended it was \u201cnecessary for a gradual, therapeutic reunification process to occur____ [under the direction] of an objective professional\u201d after P.J.\u2019s emotional fragility is assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b66 Gobeo filed her final report and recommendations to the court on March 15,2010. She noted the various professionals working with P.J. believed \u201cthat any forced contact with his dad now would be extremely detrimental to [P.J.]\u2019s well being.\u201d She recommended that P.J. not be reunified or have contact with his father until P.J.\u2019s therapist verified the child was therapeutically ready to begin those efforts. Gobeo also discussed P.J.\u2019s burgeoning relationship with his school counselor and the counselor\u2019s efforts in assisting P.J.\u2019s therapist. Additionally, Gobeo\u2019s report described Michael\u2019s compliance with the tasks assigned him and the details of Dr. Page\u2019s evaluations-all of which had occurred following Stone\u2019s report. Though she found Michael \u201ccomplied technically\u201d with the list of tasks, she expressed skepticism because all of the evaluations had been completed by a single examiner, Dr. Page, and she would have expected \u201cmore thorough investigations of the issues.\u201d Gobeo\u2019s report also included recommendations that all parties receive (or continue to receive) counseling, and that \u201ctherapeutic boundaries\u201d requiring the parties to transfer information about P.J. via P.J.\u2019s therapist were necessary as \u201cthere was no reason whatsoever to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>bring [Michael and Laura] together any more ever\u201d based on their continued hostility.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b67 The court issued an order March 17, 2010, adopting Gobeo\u2019s recommendations unless objected to within ten days. Michael filed an objection to the report on March 30, 2010. He did not raise specific objections to the particulars of Gobeo\u2019s report, but requested discovery so that he would have the opportunity to address \u201call issues\u201d that needed to be raised in order to adequately challenge her recommendations. He did not state what discovery was needed or what he thought would be gained by it. He also requested a hearing on discovery issues and additional time to allow full briefing regarding issues surrounding the \u201ctermination or near termination\u201d of his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b68 On April 20,2010, the court denied Michael\u2019s request for discovery and adopted Gobeo\u2019s recommendations. Stating it had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the case, the court ordered that full custody of P.J. would remain with Laura, and that reunification and visitation with Michael could resume when the child\u2019s therapist determines P.J. is therapeutically ready for contact. No hearing was held. The court stated it would not entertain any further motions on modification \u201cunless there is a report from both the child\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s therapists.\u201d Michael appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b69 Whether a party\u2019s due process rights were afforded is a question of law to which we apply plenary review. <em>In re Marriage of Cini, </em>2011 MT 295, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 1, 266 P.3d 1257. We review orders granting or denying requests for discovery for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 22, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P. 3d 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b610 Michael argues the court erred when it adopted Gobeo\u2019s recommendations without a hearing because it effectively terminated his parental rights with no opportunity for cross-examination. Laura argues that Michael\u2019s appeal is time-barred because he did not file his notice of appeal within thirty days of the District Court\u2019s order. In our order of November 15, 2011, we denied Laura\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for want of timeliness since no notice of entry of judgment was filed. We decline to reconsider that ruling. <em>In re Marriage of Alexander, </em>2011 MT 1, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 89, 246 P.3d 712. Laura also contends the court acted within its discretion in refusing Michael\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>additional discovery and another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b611 Section 40-4-212(1), MCA, governs a district court\u2019s custody determinations based on the best interests of the child, and allows the court to determine whether contact with a parent would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest. The statute states that such a determination must be made \u201cafter a hearing.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1X1), MCA. A district court may place conditions on visitation. <em>In re Marriage of Kovash, </em>260 Mont. 44, 51-52, 858 P.2d 351, 356 (1993); <em>Bradshaw v. Bradshaw, </em>270 Mont. 222, 234, 891 P.2d 506, 513 (1995) (overruled on other grounds) (upholding district court\u2019s ruling that father could have opportunity for unsupervised visitation upon approval of his therapist).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b612 We recently held that a district court\u2019s reliance on a GAL\u2019s report to determine custody without allowing the mother the opportunity to cross-examine the GAL violated the mother\u2019s due process rights. <em>In re Marriage of Puccinelli, </em>2012 MT 46, \u00b6 21, 364 Mont. 235, 272 P.3d 117. We held that since the GAL had \u201cradically revised her parenting recommendations <em>following </em>the final hearing, [mother] had no opportunity to cross-examine her concerning her conclusions\u201d even though she had the opportunity to submit written objections. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Puccinelli, </em>\u00b6 20. We stated, \u201c[u]nder our clear precedent, a district court may not rely on hearsay evidence contained in out-of-court reports when the report\u2019s author does not testify at the custody hearing and is not subject to cross-examination. To rely on such reports is a violation of the parent\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>Puccinelli, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b613 By comparison, in <em>In re R.M.T., </em>2011 MT 164, \u00b6 50, 361 Mont. 159, 256 P.3d 935, we considered whether a district court violated a father\u2019s rights by not allowing him to cross-examine the GAL during a parental rights termination hearing when the GAL\u2019s report provided little new information. We reiterated that \u201c[d]ue process requires that a party be allowed to cross-examine the author of a written report presented to the court.\u201d <em>In re R.M.T., </em>\u00b6 47. However, since the GAL\u2019s two-page report did not provide new information to the court, and the same information was presented through other witnesses, the exclusion of the GAL\u2019s testimony \u201cdid not cause a substantial injustice\u201d to the father and amounted to harmless error. <em>In re R.M.T., </em>\u00b6 50. The father had the opportunity for a hearing on the information offered against him, and cross-examination on the GAL\u2019s report would have been cumulative. <em>In re R.M.T., </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b614  The District Court\u2019s April 20, 2010 order deprives Michael of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>parenting time with P.J. indefinitely without the opportunity to question the author of the report upon which the court\u2019s decision rested or to offer competing evidence. This deprivation, unlike the error considered in <em>In re R.M.T., </em>is not harmless. Although Gobeo reiterated Stone\u2019s recommendations, Michael had at least minimally complied with the required tasks, and Gobeo\u2019s report contained additional findings, updated information and new recommendations. While the court\u2019s refusal to allow more discovery was within its discretion, <em>Puccinelli </em>requires that Michael be afforded a hearing before the court acts on the GAL\u2019s recommendations. In accordance with <em>Puccinelli, </em>the District Court may not rely exclusively on the GAL\u2019s written report in making its custody determination. As noted above, Michael already has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing on Stone\u2019s report. The District Court need not allow an expansive hearing encompassing matters previously considered. We hold only that Michael must be afforded a hearing on Gobeo\u2019s report and provided the opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b615 The court also entered two orders concerning child support, one on July 20, 2009, and one on March 7, 2011. Both parties sought clarification of the final child support order, but the District Court had not issued a ruling on those motions prior to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b616 We reverse and remand for the District Court to conduct a hearing in accordance with this opinion and for entry of an order on the parties\u2019 requests for clarification of the final child support order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
