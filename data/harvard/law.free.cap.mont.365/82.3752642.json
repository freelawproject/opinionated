Petitioners ask this Court to exercise supervisory control, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14, over the Montana Fourth Judicial District Court in relation to Missoula County Cause Nos. DJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>11-88, DJ 11-90, and DC 11-507. They claim that the District Court incorrectly denied as untimely their motions for substitution of district court judge in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b62 Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy that is sometimes justified when (1) urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, (2) the case involves purely legal questions, and (3) the trial court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice, constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved, or the trial court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of judge in a criminal case. M. R. App. P. 14(3). Petitioners contend that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law with its calculation of the time period in which to file a motion for substitution of district judge. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court calculated properly the time period in which to file a motion for substitution of district judge in youth court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWq\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court calculated properly the time period in which to file a motion for substitution of district judge on an appeal from justice court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\"><em>In re D.H. </em>and <em>In re J.H.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b65 <em>In re D.H. </em>and <em>In re J.H. </em>involve proceedings in Youth Court. Both D.H. and J.H. appeared in court for detention hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u00b66 Petitioner D.H. appeared with assigned counsel for his detention hearing on October 13, 2011, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-332, MCA. A specific detention order was issued at the hearing, indicating that J.H.\u2019s case was assigned to Department 3 of the Fourth Judicial District on that day. Additionally, J.H.\u2019s file was opened on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b67 The State filed a Petition in the Fourth Judicial District Court on October 17, 2011, alleging D.H. to be a delinquent youth. The District Court issued a summons directing D.H. to appear on October 20,2011, to answer the State\u2019s allegations. D.H. appeared personally on October 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b68 D.H. filed a motion to substitute district court judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, on October 28, 2011. The District Court determined that D.H.\u2019s appearance for the detention hearing on October 13,2011, constituted his first appearance for purposes of triggering the time period for substitution of district judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>MCA. The District Court denied the motion for substitution as untimely due to the fact that October 28,2011, fell more than 10 days after October 13, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b69 Petitioner J.H. similarly appeared with assigned counsel for his detention hearing on October 17, 2011, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-332, MCA. The Standing Master ordered J.H. to undergo screening for the Youth Court Home Arrest Program. A specific detention order was issued at the hearing, indicating that J.H.\u2019s case was assigned to Department 3 of the Fourth Judicial District on that day. Additionally, J.H.\u2019s file was opened on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b610 The State filed a Petition alleging J.H. to be a delinquent youth on October 24, 2011. The District Court set a hearing for October 27, 2011. J.H. appeared in court on October 27, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b611 J.H. filed a motion to substitute district court judge on October 28, 2011. The District Court determined that the detention hearing on October 17, 2011, constituted J.H.\u2019s first appearance for purposes of triggering the time period for substitution of district judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(b), MCA. The District Court denied the motion for substitution as untimely due to the fact that October 28, 2011, fell more than 10 days after October 17, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"Ace\">\u00b612 J.H. and D.H. appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\n<em>State v. Bledsoe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b613 Jaycie Therese Bledsoe (Bledsoe) pled guilty to driving under the influence in Missoula County Justice Court on October 21, 2011. Bledsoe filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay sentence on October 24,2011, in Justice Court pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA. The Clerk of Justice Court delivered the Justice Court file, which included the notice of appeal, to the Fourth Judicial District Court on November 4, 2011. The Clerk of District Court then assigned the appeal to Department 3 of the Fourth Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b614 Bledsoe filed a motion for substitution of judge on November 16, 2011. The District Court denied the substitution as untimely due to the fact that November 16, 2011, fell more than 10 days after November 4, 2011. The District Court determined that November 4, 2011, when the Clerk of the Justice Court delivered the Justice Court file, including the notice of appeal, constituted Bledsoe\u2019s first appearance in district court. Bledsoe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court calculated properly the time period in which to file a motion for substitution of district judge in youth court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u00b616 Montana law regarding the substitution of judges, codified at \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, delineates between a youth\u2019s trigger date and the prosecution\u2019s trigger date. The law states that \u201ca motion for substitution by the prosecution or the state must be filed within 10 calendar days after the district judge is assigned pursuant to subsection (2)(a).\u201d Section 3-l-804(l)(b), MCA. The law outlines the process for a defendant, parent, youth, or respondent. The motion \u201cmust be filed within 10 calendar days after the defendant, parent, youth, or respondent makes an initial appearance in the district court.\u201d Section 3-l-804(l)(b), MCA. The statute nowhere defines the term \u201cinitial appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b617 The District Court determined that a youth\u2019s detention hearing constitutes his initial appearance. A detention hearing serves, however, to determine whether probable cause exists to determine that a youth is delinquent. Section 41-5-332(3), MCA. The State may apply to the youth court for permission to file a petition charging a youth to be delinquent. Section 41-5-1401(1), MCA. The youth court must grant leave to the State to file a petition if probable cause exists. Section 41-5-1401(1), MCA. A \u201cprobable cause hearing\u201d does not constitute a youth\u2019s \u201cinitial appearance\u201d in court within the meaning of \u00a7 3-1-804(l)(b), MCA. This probable cause hearing instead simply establishes whether the State may charge the youth as delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b618 The department assignment cited by the District Court constitutes the triggering date for the time period in which the State may file a motion to substitute district judge. The court must serve a summons to the youth\u2019s parent or guardian after the State files a petition. Section 41-5-1403(1), MCA. The summons directs the youth to appear personally before the court to answer the allegations of the petition. Section 41-5-1403(2), MCA. The Montana Youth Court Act refers to this appearance as the youth\u2019s \u201cfirst appearance.\u201d Section 41-5-1412(1), MCA. This \u201cfirst appearance\u201d corresponds with the statute\u2019s reference to a youth\u2019s \u201cinitial appearance\u201d in the district court. Section 3-l-804(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b619  D.H. made his initial appearance on October 20, 2011, and filed his motion for substitution on October 28. J.H. initially appeared on October 27, 2011, and filed his motion for substitution on October 28. Both D.H. and J.H. filed their motions for substitution within the 10-day timeframe contemplated by \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(b), MCA. The District Court improperly determined that D.H. and J.H. had filed untimely motions for substitution of district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court calculated properly the time period in which to file a motion for substitution of district judge on an appeal from justice court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b621 Bledsoe\u2019s filing of notice of appeal invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court as set forth in \u00a7 46-17-311(3), MCA. Bledsoe\u2019s appeal did not constitute a trial de novo. Bledsoe instead invoked the district court\u2019s power to act as an appellate court. Bledsoe pled guilty injustice court and reserved her right to appeal a specific legal ruling pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, and \u00a7 46-17-311(1), MCA. District court appeals from a court of limited jurisdiction do not create a right to be \u201ctried anew in district court...\u201d unless they constitute trials de novo. Section 46-17-311(1), MCA. Bledsoe pled guilty in the Justice Court and appealed only the Justice Court\u2019s denial of her pretrial suppression motion. Bledsoe thus reserved her right to appeal a specific legal ruling pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b622 Section 3-1-804, MCA, makes no specific reference to a right of a defendant to substitute a district judge on an appeal of a specific legal ruling from a justice court. The District Court serves entirely in an appellate capacity under these circumstances. In fact, \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, refers to serving a \u201csummons,\u201d an \u201cinitial appearance,\u201d and a \u201cdefendant, parent, youth or respondent.\u201d These terms relate specifically to trial-type proceedings. Bledsoe did not seek a trial de novo. Though the District Court may hold an evidentiary hearing on the appealed issue, an evidentiary hearing of this type does not constitute a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b623  Accordingly, no right exists under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, to substitute a district judge in an appeal of a specific pre-trial legal ruling from justice court. The District Court correctly denied Bledsoe\u2019s motion for substitution of district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b624 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED for J.H. and D.H. and DENIED for Bledsoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">DATED this 15th day of May, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">/S/ CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">/S/JUSTICE COTTER</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">/S/ JUSTICE BAKER</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">/S/JUSTICE WHEAT</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">/S/JUSTICE NELSON</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">/S/JUSTICE RICE</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
