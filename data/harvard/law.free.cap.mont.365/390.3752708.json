We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b64 1. Did the District Court err in granting Sterling Life Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment based on its determination that Kuszmaul was not wrongfully discharged from her employment?</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court err in denying Kuszmaul\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment pertaining to Sterling\u2019s affirmative defenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b66 Beginning in May 2000, Kuszmaul was employed as an Outside Sales Agent by Olympic Health Management Systems, Inc. (Olympic),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a subsidiary of Aon Corporation, and a sister company of Sterling since 1999. Sterling is a national insurance provider which sells various insurance plans, including health and life insturance. Kuszmaul signed an employment agreement with Olympic on May 19, 2000, which included the following provision: \u2018You agree not to use any advertising materials, supplies, other printed or written material used in the sale or promotion of the Carrier\u2019s policies without prior written approval of Olympic.\u201d The agreement also provided that Tn] otwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, employment at Olympic is voluntarily entered into and may be terminated by either party, with or without cause, at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">\u00b67 On November 6, 2002, Kuszmaul signed another employment agreement with Olympic, which noted that \u2018Olympic is engaged in the business of the sale of life and health insurance and coverage products for Sterling Life Insurance Company,\u201d that Sterling owns the business named in the agreement, and that under the agreement, Kuszmaul will be \u201cacting as a Sales Agent of Olympic and Sterling.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>parenthetical definitions excluded.) This agreement contained similar provisions as the one signed in 2000, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">3.3.2 Advertising and Sales Promotion Material</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">a. Agent agrees not to use any advertising medium, leads, supplies, or other printed or written materials used in the sale or promotion of Sterling\u2019s policies without prior authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">b. In the event Agent becomes aware of any materials used in the sale or promotion of the carrier\u2019s policies which have not been authorized by Olympic, Agent agrees to promptly disclose such information to Olympic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">7.1 Employment At Will</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">As stated in Section 1 of this Agreement, employment with Olympic is \u201cat-will\u201d. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">8.6 No Waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">No act of forbearance or toleration on the part of either party to this Agreement in favor of the other with respect to any provision of this Agreement, either express or implied, shall be construed as a waiver by either party of any of its rights hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u00b68 Kuszmaul signed yet another employment agreement on J anuary 1, 2008, which contained provisions identical to those in the 2002 contract. Sterling had a written Zero Tolerance Policy (Policy), requiring all solicitation materials for Sterling to be pre-approved by its home office, and providing that without exception, a violation of the Policy would result in immediate termination. It is undisputed that Kuszmaul was aware of the Policy. The employment agreement she signed included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">4. Zero Tolerance Activities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">Agents, Field Sales Managers and Market Managers selling Sterling products will be immediately terminated, without exception, for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">4.2 Use of Unapproved Marketing Materials/Leads -Distributing in any fashion (including but not limited to mailing, handing out in person or placing as advertisement for publication or broadcast) any document that describes Sterling or a Sterling product and has not been explicitly approved for use by the home office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">It is to be noted that this is a violation of State and Federal law and regulation, and is also a direct breach of the OHM Sales Agent Employment Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>According to Kuszmaul, she signed and dated this document after she carefully read it, she agreed with the content of it before signing it, and she understood she was required to comply with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b69 On April 1, 2008, Sterling was sold to Munich-American Holding Company, though Aon Corporation still managed several employee programs for six more months. On this same date, Sterling adopted an Employee Handbook (Handbook), which was designed to help the employees get acquainted with the \u201corganization\u2019s general policies and practices applicable to all employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b610 On September 21, 2009, Kuszmaul read and signed a separate document specifying Sterling\u2019s Policy. This document included the same Zero Tolerance Activities provision as noted above, though \u2018immediately terminated\u201d was underlined. The document also stated at the beginning that \u2018[the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)] and the state departments of insurance are heavily scrutinizing the marketing activities of companies selling in the Medicare market place,\u201d and that Sterling thought it \u201cprudent to publish a list of activities that will not be tolerated.\u201d In signing the document, Kuszmaul agreed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">I have read and understand the Sterling Zero Tolerance Policy. I understand that I must comply with all provisions in this document and that failure to comply with the above listed policy will result in termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b611 In October 2009, Kuszmaul drafted a marketing letter promoting Sterling products. She mailed out approximately 1,000 copies of the letter to current and potential customers. Notably, Kuszmaul did not obtain approval from anyone at Sterling before sending the letter, nor did she clear it with the Montana Department of Insurance (DOI) or any other regulatory agency. A relative of one of the recipients of the letter anonymously notified Sterling by mail that the letter might violate the Policy. The writer sent a copy of its complaint, dated November 20, 2009, to the Sterling Life Corporate Compliance Office, the Montana DOI, and the CMS Regional Office, exposing Sterling to possible state and federal sanctions. This prompted Sterling to begin an internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b612 While being investigated, Kuszmaul acknowledged that her marketing letter was not in conformance with the Policy, but denied doing anything <em>intentionally </em>wrong. On November 24, 2009, Marty Sawicki, one of Kuszmaul\u2019s managers at Sterling, contacted Kuszmaul by telephone, explained the marketing letter could be grounds for termination, and asked her to write a letter explaining why she sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the marketing letter. Kuszmaul issued a written apology to Sterling on November 25, 2009, acknowledging how her mailing may have appeared from Sterling\u2019s perspective, and pointing out that she had worked for Sterling for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b613 While the investigation was ongoing and before deciding what discipline was appropriate for Kuszmaul\u2019s misconduct, Sterling sent to multiple employees, including Kuszmaul, a document to sign titled \u2018Sales Employment Agreement\u201d(Agreement). The Agreement included provisions of the Policy and specified that employment with Sterling was at will. It included provisions identical to the 2002 \u201cAdvertising and Sales Promotion Material\u201dand \u2018No Waiver\u201dsections, with the only change being the replacement of\u201cOlympic\u201d with \u2018Sterling.\u201d It also had a section about the Policy, which stated: \u201cAgent agrees to abide by Sterling\u2019s Zero Tolerance Policy. A copy of the current policy is attached hereto and amended at anytime by publication by Sterling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHdp\">\u00b614 Kuszmaul signed the Agreement on December 3,2009. Sometime after she did so, Sterling\u2019s Agent Review Board recommended termination of Kuszmaul\u2019s employment for her violation of the Policy. She was subsequently terminated on December 18,2009, for violating Sterling\u2019s Policy by \u201c[sending] out marketing materials (letters) to customers without DOI or CMS or Company approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b615 On January 22, 2010, Kuszmaul filed a complaint under Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), \u00a7\u00a739-2-901 to -915, MCA (2009). Kuszmaul claimed that Sterling violated the WDEA because her discharge was not for good cause, she had completed Sterling\u2019s probationary period of employment, and that Sterling violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policies. Sterling moved to dismiss the complaint, stating that it \u201crelied on reasonable job-related grounds and other legitimate business reasons for terminating [Kuszmaul\u2019s] employment.\u201d Sterling then moved for summary judgment and Kuszmaul moved for partial summary judgment on the affirmative defenses asserted by Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"Aua\">\u00b616 The District Court held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment on June 2, 2011, at which both parties were represented by counsel. On July 26,2011, the District Court issued its Order granting summary judgment for Sterling and denying Kuszmaul\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b617 Kuszmaul appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\u00b618 \u2018We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>summary judgment de novo and apply the same criteria under M. R. Civ. P. 56 as applied by the district court.\u201d <em>Williams v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>2011 MT 271, \u00b6 13, 362 Mont. 368, 264 P.3d 1090. Summary judgment should only be granted when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201dM. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). Once the party moving for summary judgment has demonstrated that no genuine issues of material fact exist and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, \u2018the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove by more than mere denial and speculation that a genuine issue of material fact does exist.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Arnold v. Yellowstone Mt. Club, LLC, </em>2004 MT 284, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 295, 100 P.3d 137. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is one that \u2018involves the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Arnold, </em>\u00b6 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b619 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in granting Sterling Life Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment based on its determination that Kuszmaul was not wrongfully discharged from her employment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b620 Kuszmaul argues on appeal that the District Court erred in granting Sterling\u2019s motion for summary judgment. She argues there was not good cause for her termination, and further that Sterling waived its right to terminate her employment by presenting her with the Agreement in December 2009. She also alleges that Sterling violated its own personnel policies in the handling of her discharge. Finally, Kuszmaul argues that the District Court erred when it failed to grant her motion for partial summary judgment due to the lack of sufficient evidence provided by Sterling to support the affirmative defenses it asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b621 Sterling argues that it had good cause to terminate Kuszmaul, that it did not waive its right to termination, and that the termination did not violate its personnel policy. Sterling asserts that the Agreement was merely \u201ca routine modification to her commission schedule,\u201d and not a new employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b622 With few exceptions, the WDEA is the exclusive remedy for a wrongful discharge from employment in Montana. Section 39-2-902, MCA (2009); <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 18. Under the WDEA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(1) A discharge is wrongful only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(a) it was in retaliation for the employee\u2019s refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">(b) the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer\u2019s probationary period of employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">(c) the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">(2)(a) During a probationary period of employment, the employment may be terminated at the will of either the employer or the employee on notice to the other for any reason or for no reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">(b) If an employer does not establish a specific probationary period or provide that there is no probationary period prior to or at the time of hire, there is a probationary period of 6 months from the date of hire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Section 39-2-904, MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b623  Applying \u00a739-2-904(l)(b), MCA, we first address the issue of \u201cgood cause.\u201d \u201c\u2018Good cause\u2019 means reasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or other legitimate business reason.\u201dSection 39-2-903(5), MCA (2009). Kuszmaul admitted that she had read, signed, and understood the Policy, and that she sent out her unapproved letter in November 2009. It is also undisputed that the Policy clearly provides that a violation would result in immediate termination, and that Sterling terminated Kuszmaul in December 2009 for her violation of the Policy. Given the foregoing facts, there is simply no question that Kuszmaul committed a serious Policy infraction, and that Sterling had the right to terminate her for doing so. \u2018Good cause\u201d existed for the discharge. This being so, it is unnecessary to consider whether Kuszmaul had completed her probationary period of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u00b624 Alternatively, Kuszmaul argues that while good cause for termination may have existed upon her mailing of the letter, Sterling \u201cwaived\u201d its good cause to discharge her when it later provided her with the December 3, 2009 Agreement. We reject this argument. The new agreement was sent to all employees as a matter of course and in any event, it too contained the at-will provisions and the zero tolerance policy upon which Sterling relies for the discharge. Waiver must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>manifested unequivocally. <em>Tvedt v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos., </em>2004 MT 125, \u00b6 33, 321 Mont. 263, 91 P.3d 1. By simply sending Kuszmaul and multiple others a routine document, Sterling did not unequivocally manifest \u201can intentional or voluntary relinquishment\u201d of its right to terminate Kuszmaul\u2019s employment for violation of the Policy. <em>Sperry v. Mont. State Univ., </em>239 Mont. 25, 30, 778 P.2d 895, 898 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b625 Next, we address Kuszmaul\u2019s argument that Sterling violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy set forth in its 2008 Handbook, thus rendering her discharge wrongful under \u00a739-2-904(l)(c), MCA. She argues that under the Policy, an employee would be immediately terminated for distributing documents describing Sterling or a Sterling product which \u201cha[ve] not been explicitly approved for use by the home office,\u201d while the Handbook states that Td]epending on the seriousness and circumstances of each individual case, misconduct can result in various degrees of discipline, ranging from warnings to unpaid suspensions to termination of employment.\u201d Kuszmaul cites an email exchange between Sterling managers for the proposition that they chose to follow the Policy and terminate her rather than follow the Handbook and discipline her according to \u201cmanagement discretion on an individual basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b626  We reject this argument. The Handbook clearly contemplates that a termination of employment may be appropriate depending on the seriousness of the situation. It does not require progressive discipline in every case. The discharge of an employee for a significant infraction is within the purview of the Handbook; therefore, Sterling did not violate the express provisions of its personnel policy by terminating Kuszmaul\u2019s employment for violation of the Policy. Kuszmaul further posits that the personnel policy was contravened due to the manner in which the Termination Request form was completed, but she fails to cite with particularity any policy provision that was violated. We find this allegation speculative and unsupported by evidence. \u2018The party opposing summary judgment cannot rely on mere allegations in the pleadings, but must present its evidence raising genuine issues of material fact in the form of affidavits or other sworn testimony.\u201d <em>Yarbro, Ltd. v. Missoula Fed. Credit Union, </em>2002 MT 152, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 346, 50 P.3d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b627 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in denying Kuszmaul\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment pertaining to Sterling\u2019s affirmative defenses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b628 Because we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Sterling, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b629 All of the salient facts surrounding Kuszmaul\u2019s termination are undisputed. For the foregoing reasons, we therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Sterling.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> This corporation is referred to as Olympic Health Management Systems, Inc. and Olympic Health Management Services, Inc. throughout the record and briefing.
