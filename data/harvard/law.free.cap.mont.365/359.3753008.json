Molloy presiding, certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\u00b62 <em>Is obesity that is not the symptom of a physiological condition a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d as it is used in Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 49-2-101(19)(a)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">\u00b63 We accepted the certified question and now answer with a qualified \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">\u00b64 On February 27,2009, Eric Feit filed an administrative complaint with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (Department) alleging that Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) illegally discriminated against him because of perceived disability-obesity. In an order dated March 10,2010, a hearing officer for the Department entered summary disposition in favor of Feit, concluding that \u201cBNSF engaged in and is liable for a discriminatory refusal to hire Feit because it regarded him as disabled\u201d and awarded damages for lost wages and benefits, prejudgment interest, and emotional distress. BNSF filed an appeal with the Montana Human Rights Commission, which issued an order on December 6, 2010, affirming the Department\u2019s decision. BNSF then petitioned the U.S. District Court to review whether it violated the Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA) by refusing to hire Feit because of his obesity. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, at which time the U.S. District Court certified its question to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">\u00b65 In accordance with M. R. App. P. 15(6)(b), the U.S. District Court certified the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-16\">1. BNSF offered Eric Feit a conditional offer of employment as a conductor trainee. The employment was conditioned upon successful completion of a physical examination, drug screening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>background investigation, proof of employment eligibility, and BNSF\u2019s Medical History Questionnaire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">2. On February 6,2008, BNSF informed Feit he was not qualified for his \u201csafety sensitive\u201d position because of the \u201csignificant health and safety risks associated with extreme obesity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">3. BNSF told Feit he would not be considered for the job unless he either lost 10% of his body weight, or successfully completed additional physical examinations at his own expense. Regardless of the test results, BNSF did not guarantee Feit a job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">4. With the exception of a sleep study test, Feit successfully completed the additional physical exams BNSF requested. The sleep test cost at least $1,800, and Feit could not afford the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">5. Because BNSF informed Feit that it would not consider him for the conductor trainee position unless he completed the sleep study, Feit set out to lose 10% of his weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">6. A genuine dispute exists regarding whether BNSF received documentation of Feit\u2019s weight loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">7. On February 27,2009, Feit filed a complaint with the Montana Department of Labor and charged BNSF [with] discriminating against him based on a physical or mental disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\u00b66  \u201cUnder M. R. App. P. 15(3), this Court may answer a question of law certified to it by another qualifying court. Our review, therefore, is purely an interpretation of the law as applied to the agreed facts underlying the action.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Bush Hog, LLC, </em>2009 MT 349, \u00b6 4, 353 Mont. 173, 219 P.3d 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">\u00b67 This case requires the Court to answer the narrow question posed. It is not the job of this Court to determine questions of fact or to apply the law to the facts presented to us. In his brief, Feit requests that we reformulate the certified question. Although this Court may reformulate a certified question under M. R. App. P. 15(4), Feit\u2019s proffered reformulation essentially asks us to resolve the ultimate issue in his dispute with BNSF, which we decline to do. Further, Feit asks the Court to consider facts outside those certified by the U.S. District Court in its order. This Court\u2019s August 16, 2011 order accepting the certified question did so \u201cas formulated on the relevant facts set forth in Judge Molloy\u2019s certification of the question\u201d and we find it unnecessary to consider information outside that statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b68 The MHRA makes it unlawful for an employer to refuse employment to a person because of \u201cphysical or mental disability ... when the reasonable demands of the position do not require a[] ... physical or mental disability ... distinction.\u201d Section 49-2-303(l)(a), MCA. A \u201cphysical or mental disability\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">(i) <em>a physical or mental impairment </em>that substantially limits one or more of a person\u2019s major life activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">(ii) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">(iii) a condition regarded as such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Section 49-2-101(19)(a), MCA (emphasis added). The U.S. District Court\u2019s question asks us specifically to analyze \u201cphysical or mental impairment,\u201d not the broader definition of disability. As Judge Molloy observed, this Court has not had occasion to interpret the meaning of the term \u201cimpairment.\u201d To construe this Montana statute, we look to guidance from federal discrimination law under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). <em>McDonald v. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2009 MT 209, \u00b6 39, n. 4, 351 Mont. 243, 214 P.3d 749; <em>Campbell v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2004 MT 231, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 322 Mont. 434, 97 P.3d 546; <em>Pannoni v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>2004 MT 130, \u00b6 28, 321 Mont. 311, 90 P.3d 438. The Montana Legislature has indicated its clear intent that the MHRA be interpreted consistently with federal discrimination statutes and case law. In particular, the definition of physical or mental disability is substantially identical to that in the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102. And the preamble to the 1991 amendments to the MHRA states that the \u201cdefinitions previously adopted lack clarity and are inconsistent with definitions used in federal civil rights statutes and court interpretations on the subject.\u201d 1991 Mont. Laws ch. 241, 551. We turn, therefore, to federal law and interpretation of it to inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u00b69 We have relied on federal case law as well as the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations and interpretive guidelines in construing Montana\u2019s discrimination laws. <em>Butterfield v. Sidney Pub. Schs., </em>2001 MT 177, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 306 Mont. 179, 32 P.3d <em>1243; Reeves v. Dairy Queen, Inc., </em>1998 MT 13, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 287 Mont. 196, 953 P.2d 703; <em>Hafner v. Conoco, Inc., </em>268 Mont. 396, 402, 886 P.2d 947, 950-51 (1994). An interpretation of federal law by the federal agency that administers it is afforded great deference. <em>Sleath v. West Mont Home Health Servs., </em>2000 MT 381, \u00b6 37, 304 Mont. 1, 16 P.3d 1042 (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467U.S. 837, 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u00b610 Congress recently amended the ADA by passing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325,122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Congress amended specific provisions of the ADA not relevant here, but in so doing, also affirmed the purpose of the ADAAA to reinstate \u201ca broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA,\u201d and clarified its intention that \u201cthe definition of disability... shall be construed in favor of broad coverage ... to the maximum extent permitted\u201d by the terms of the Act. 122 Stat. at 3554-55; <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.1(c)(4) (2011). The ADAAA provides: \u201cCongress finds that [federal cases] have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect.\u201d While the legislative history suggests that Congress did not expect the EEOC\u2019s current regulatory definition of these terms to change (29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (2011)), Congress did express its specific intent that \u201cthe question of whether an individual\u2019s impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.\u201d 122 Stat. at 3553-54. Notably, Congress did not amend the substantive definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the federal Act, except to add new subparagraphs clarifying the definitions of \u201cmajor life activities\u201d and \u201cregarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2), (3). Thus, insofar as they are relevant to the certified question, the Montana and federal definitions of \u201cdisability\u201d remain substantively identical despite the passage of the ADAAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b611 Neither the original ADA nor the ADAAA defines \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d The EEOC defines \u201cimpairment\u201d as \u201c[a]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1) (2011). The EEOC regulations in this context define \u201cimpairment\u201d in the same manner as those in place prior to the ADAAA, with the addition of two body systems (circulatory and immune). <em>Compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1) (2011) <em>with </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j)(2)(i) (2011); Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b612 The EEOC\u2019s Interpretive Guidance distinguishes between conditions that are impairments and conditions that are simply physical characteristics: \u201cThe definition of the term \u2018impairment\u2019 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>not include physical characteristics such as eye color, hair color, left-handedness, or height, weight, or muscle tone that are within \u2018normal\u2019 range and are not the result of a physiological disorder.\u201d 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (2011). The Interpretive Guidance thus suggests that \u201cimpairment\u201d requires a \u201cphysiological disorder\u201d only if a person\u2019s weight is <em>\u201cwithin \u2018normal\u2019 range.\u201d </em>By using the conjunctive <em>\u201cand,\u201d </em>the regulation excludes weight from the definition of impairment only if it is <em>both </em>\u201cwithin \u2018normal\u2019 range\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cnot the result of a physiological disorder.\u201d BNSF points out that most federal courts to have considered the issue have held that obesity is not an impairment unless it is the result of a physiological disorder or condition. <em>See EEOC v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d 436, 443 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding \u201cto constitute an ADA impairment, a person\u2019s obesity, even morbid obesity, must be the result of a physiological condition\u201d); <em>Andrews v. Ohio, </em>104 F.3d 803, 810 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding the charging parties had not demonstrated their weight was the result of a physiological condition under the ADA and affirming a motion to dismiss their claims); <em>Francis v. City of Meriden, </em>129 F.3d 281, 286-87 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that physical characteristics, such as weight, that do not result from a physiological disorder are not considered \u201cimpairments\u201d). These courts have held that \u201cphysical characteristics that are \u2018not the result of a physiological disorder\u2019 are not considered \u2018impairments\u2019 for the purposes of determining either actual or perceived disability.\u201d <em>Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d at 442 <em>(quoting Andrews, </em>104 F.3d at 808-09). BNSF urges us to follow this line of cases and answer the certified question in the negative. However, the cases on which BNSF relies all were decided before passage of the ADAAA. In that Act, Congress instructed the courts they were interpreting the statute too restrictively and expressed its specific intent that determination of disability not demand extensive analysis. 122 Stat. at 3553-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b613 The EEOC\u2019s Compliance Manual, interpretations of the law for EEOC employees charged with investigating discrimination claims, states: \u201c[Njormal deviations in height, weight, or strength that are not the result of a physiological disorder are not impairments.....At extremes, however, such deviations may constitute impairments.\u201d <em>EEOC Compliance Manual </em>\u00a7 902.2(c)(5), http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/ 902cm.html#902.2c5 (accessed on June 28, 2012) (citations omitted). The Compliance Manual was last updated on November 21, 2009, subsequent to the passage and effective date of the ADAAA. Although the Compliance Manual has not been formally adopted and made part of the Code of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Regulations, it does provide insight into the agency\u2019s interpretation. The United States Supreme Court has expressly recognized the usefulness of the EEOC Compliance Manual. <em>Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, </em>552 U.S. 389, 399, 128 S. Ct. 1147, 1156 (2008) (citing cases and noting the EEOC\u2019s compliance manuals, though not binding on the courts, \u201creflect \u2018a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance\u2019\u201d). This Court affords an agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule \u201cgreat weight\u201d and defers to that interpretation unless \u201cplainly inconsistent\u201d with the spirit of the rule. <em>Easy v. Mont. Dept. of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>231 Mont. 306, 309, 752 P.2d 746, 748 (1988) (affirming a state agency\u2019s interpretation of its hiring policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b614 While the EEOC notes that \u201cbeing overweight, in and of itself\u2019 is generally not an impairment, \u201csevere obesity, which has been defined as body weight more than 100% over the norm ... is clearly an impairment.\u201d <em>EEOC Compliance Manual </em>\u00a7 902.2(c)(5)(h). The EEOC\u2019s interpretation supports a conclusion that weight outside \u201cnormal range\u201d may constitute a physiological condition within the definition of impairment if it \u201caffects one or more body systems.\u201d This conclusion recently has been adopted by some federal courts. <em>See EEOC v. Resources for Human Dev., Inc., </em>827 F. Supp. 2d 688, 694 (E.D. La. 2011) (concluding, in reliance on the EEOC Compliance Manual, that \u201cif a charging party\u2019s weight is outside the normal range-that is, if the charging party is severely obese-there is no explicit requirement that obesity be based on a physiological impairment\u201d); <em>Lowe v. American Eurocopter, LLC, </em>2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133343, ** 23, 25 (N.D. Miss. Dec. 16, 2010) (denying motion to dismiss plaintiffs ADA claim, noting the \u201csubstantial expansion of the ADA by the ADAAA\u201d and stating cases requiring that obesity be a product of a physiological condition \u201cwere all before the ADAAA took effect\u201d); <em>but see Lescoe v. Pa. Dept. of Corrects., </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34325, **10-13 (M.D. Pa. March 30, 2011) (upholding summary judgment in favor of the defendant on an ADA claim because plaintiff had not demonstrated his obesity was a physical or mental impairment, but not addressing the ADAAA). As noted in the EEOC Compliance Manual, \u201c[t]he mere presence of an impairment does not automatically mean that an individual has a disability. Whether severe obesity rises to the level of a disability will turn on whether the obesity substantially limits, has substantially limited, or is regarded as substantially limiting, a major life activity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>EEOC Compliance Manual </em>\u00a7 902.2(c)(5)(ii) n. 16;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also Sibilla v. Follett Corp., </em>2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46255, *26 (E.D.N.Y. March 30, 2012) (even under the ADAAA, \u201c[t]he fact that an employer regards an employee as obese or overweight does not necessarily mean that the employer regards the employee as suffering a physical impairment.\u201d). Prior to the ADAAA, the EEOC\u2019s Interpretive Guidance included the statement that, \u201cexcept in rare circumstances, obesity is not considered a disabling impairment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. \u00a7 1630.2(j) (2008). Notably, this language has been omitted from the 2011 version.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b615 BNSF argues that Montana has not expressly adopted the statutory changes contained in the ADAAA, and therefore, we should not consider the federal amendments or the EEOC\u2019s interpretations thereof. Moreover, BNSF contends the ADAAA is not retroactive and therefore interpretation of it is not applicable here, citing <em>Becerril v. Pima Co. Assessor\u2019s Office, </em>587 F.3d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 2009), for the proposition that Congress did not intend the ADAAA to apply retroactively. These arguments overlook the point that we are interpreting Montana statutes, not the ADAAA, and that we are construing \u201cimpairment\u201d for the first time. They further overlook the fact that the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d was not substantively amended with respect to the meaning of \u201cimpairment.\u201d Our prior case law directs us to use federal interpretations as guidance, without confining our review to authority in place on the date the MHRA was first enacted. <em>Hafner, </em>268 Mont. at 402, 886 P.2d at 951 (stating the MHRA is \u201cpatterned after\u201d federal law and referencing federal case law decided after the passage of the MHRA); <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing current federal regulations). Our use of contemporaneous federal interpretations is therefore appropriate as it fulfills the legislature\u2019s directive that Montana law be interpreted consistently with federal discrimination laws. BNSF acknowledged during oral argument that this Court is not applying the ADAAA here. Thus, we are not giving retroactive effect to a federal statute whose application is expressly prospective. Rather, given the development of the law, we construe Montana\u2019s act in a manner that comports with stated congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u00b616  Taken together, the ADA, ADAAA, and the EEOC\u2019s interpretation are clear and provide persuasive guidance in interpreting the MHRA. Based on the foregoing, we answer the certified question as follows: Obesity that is not the symptom of a physiological disorder or condition may constitute a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d within the meaning of Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 49-2-101(19)(a) if the individual\u2019s weight is outside \u201cnormal range\u201d and affects \u201cone or more body systems\u201d as defined in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1) (2011).</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\"> It appears this statement has not been updated since adoption of the ADAAA. Under the amendments, an individual meets the requirement of \u201cbeing regarded as having such an impairment\u201d by establishing that he or she has been subjected to discrimination \u201cbecause of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment <em>whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(3)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b391-5\">JUSTICE MORRIS,</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b617 The United States District Court has asked us, in effect, to define \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d as used in the MHRA. I agree with the Court that we must turn to federal law to guide us. Opinion, \u00b6 8. Luck would have it that the EEOC-the federal commission responsible for enforcing the ADA-has created a regulatory definition that defines \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(h)(1). This definition provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d includes \u201cany physiological disorder, or condition\u201d that affects a major system of the human body. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b618 A plain reading of this definition demonstrates that a physiological condition or disorder must affect a bodily system before a person possesses a physical or mental impairment. Thus, a physiological condition must be present before an impairment exists. Obesity accordingly cannot fall within this definition when it does not occur secondarily to a physiological condition or disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b619 The interpretative guidance that accompanies the definition supports this reading. The \u201cdefinition of the term \u2018impairment\u2019 does not include physical characteristics such as eye color, hair color, left-handedness, or height, weight, or muscle tone that are within \u2018normal\u2019 range <em>and </em>are not the result of a physiological disorder.\u201d 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (emphasis added). The Court construes this statement to mean \u201cthat \u2018impairment\u2019 requires a \u2018physiological disorder\u2019 only if a person\u2019s weight is \u2018within normal range.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. This construction ignores the conjunctive nature of the interpretative guidance. The guidance plainly provides that a person\u2019s weight qualifies as an impairment only if it falls outside the normal range AND occurs as the result of a physiological disorder. Both requirements must be satisfied before an impairment can be found. The Court\u2019s interpretation would be accurate only if the interpretative guidance provided that physical characteristics should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>considered impairments if the characteristics \u201care within the \u2018normal\u2019 range <em>or </em>are not the result of a physiological disorder.\u201d The EEOC did not write the guidance in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b620 Indeed, a reading of the definition\u2019s entire interpretative guidance demonstrates that a physiological disorder or condition represents a threshold issue for determining whether an impairment exists. For example, the guidance provides that \u201cother conditions, such as pregnancy, that are <em>not the result of a physiological disorder </em>are also not impairments.\u201d 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (emphasis added). Similarly, the guidance notes that \u201c[t]he definition of an impairment also does not include common personality traits such as poor judgment or a quick temper where these <em>are not symptoms of a mental or psychological disorder.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (emphasis added). The guidance, as a whole, makes clear that a physiological condition or disorder must be present before an impairment exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b621 Numerous courts have agreed that obesity must be caused by a physiological disorder or condition before it may be considered an impairment. The Sixth Circuit specifically rejected the notion that weight outside the normal limit may constitute a physical impairment absent a physiological condition. <em>EEOC v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d 436, 442-43 (6th Cir. 2006). Obesity must be secondary to a physiological disorder or condition before it may be considered an impairment. <em>Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d at 442-43. The court further noted that to conclude that abnormal weight not secondary to a physiological condition constitutes an impairment would require the court to determine that \u201cany physical abnormality ... may be an ADA impairment.\u201d <em>Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b622 The Second Circuit similarly agreed that obesity, by itself, does not qualify as an impairment because \u201cphysical characteristics that are \u2018not the result of a physiological disorder\u2019 are not considered \u2018impairments\u2019 for the purposes of determining either actual or perceived disability.\u201d <em>Francis v. City of Meriden, </em>129 F.3d 281, 286 (2d Cir. 1997). Courts from other jurisdictions that have interpreted similar definitions of impairment conclude that obesity does not qualify as an impairment unless it occurs secondary to a physiological condition. <em>Civil Service Commn. of City of Pittsburg v. Penn. Human Relations Commn., </em>591 A.2d 281, 322-23 (Pa. 1991); <em>Cassista v. Community Foods, Inc., </em>856 P.2d 1143, 1152 (Cal. 1993). These cases stand for the proposition that a protected disability must be more than a physical characteristic. The presence of this physiological disorder or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>condition distinguishes a disability from a mere physical characteristic.</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">\u00b623 The Court dismisses this reasoning based on the fact that the ADAAA has superceded these decisions. Opinion, \u00b6 12. The ADAAA requires broad construction of disability. Yet, the ADAAA has no effect with regard to the definition of \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d The EEOC expressly noted that it made no change to its definition of \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d because \u201cthe legislative history of the Amendments Act notes that Congress \u2018expects that the current regulatory definition of [physical or mental impairment] ... will not change.\u2019 \u201d 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(h). Accordingly, the ADAAA\u2019s directive for a broad construction of disability provides no justification to ignore the definition\u2019s plain language or to ignore previous cases interpreting the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b624 The ADAAA\u2019s effect on the definition is further borne out through the EEOC\u2019s response to the ADAAA. For example, the EEOC made no substantive modification to its \u201cphysical and mental impairment\u201d definition following the enactment of the ADAAA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1) (2008); <em>compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1) (2011). In particular, the EEOC definition still retains the physiological disorder or condition requirement. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b625 By contrast, the EEOC substantively modified its definition for the two other elements of a disability in light of the ADAAA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2Q) (2008), <em>compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2Q) (2011); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i)(2008), <em>compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i) (2011). The EEOC modified \u201csubstantially limits\u201d by instructing that term must be \u201cconstrued broadly in favor of expansive coverage ...\u201d and that the standard \u201cis not meant to be demanding....\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(l)(i). The EEOC further made clear that \u201csubstantially limits\u201d does not require that an impairment \u201cprevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(l)(ii). This modification represents a complete reversal of the \u201csubstantially limits\u201d definition pre-ADAAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b626 The EEOC also substantively modified its definition of \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d The list previously included only physical activity. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i) (2008). The EEOC now has modified the list of major life activity to include non-physical activities such as \u201cspeaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working ....\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i)(l)(i). The EEOC further directed that \u201cmajor life activity\u201d \u201cshall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability.\u201d 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u00b627 These modifications reflect the full extent of EEOC\u2019s response to the ADAAA. The EEOC now instructs that \u201cmajor life activity\u201d and \u201csubstantially limits\u201d shall be construed broadly. The EEOC made no similar modifications regarding the need to construe broadly the definition of a \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d The EEOC clearly determined that the ADAAA imposed no changes to its definition of \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d and imposed no adjustments to how this phrase should be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b628 Congress\u2019s action, in addition to the previously mentioned legislative history, further supports the notion that the ADAAA has no effect on the physiological condition requirement for impairment. Congress specifically directed the EEOC in the ADAAA to change its definition of \u201csubstantially limits.\u201d ADAAA, P.L. 110-325, \u00a7 2(a)(8). Congress included nothing in the ADAAA, however, regarding any need to revise the EEOC\u2019s regulatory definition of \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d Congress did not direct the EEOC to eliminate the physiological condition or disorder requirement of that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b629 Indeed, Congress conveyed its intent in the ADAAA that \u201cwhether an individual\u2019s impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.\u201d ADAAA, P.L. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b)(5). This stated purpose presumes that the individual actually possesses an impairment, and leads to the suggestion that broad construction applies only with regard to whether that actual impairment constitutes a disability. Congress specifically noted in the ADAAA its disagreement with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the terms \u201csubstantially limits\u201d and \u201cmajor life activity\u2019 should be construed strictly. ADAAA, P.L. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b)(4). Congress made no statement whatsoever with regard to how to interpret \u201cphysical or mental impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b630 I disagree with the Court\u2019s determination that obesity may be considered an impairment when it occurs without an accompanying physiological condition or disorder. The EEOC regulatory definition requires that a physiological disorder or condition must be present for an impairment to exist. The EEOC did nothing to modify this definition in response to ADAAA. Congress included no directive to the EEOC in the ADAAA to modify its definition of a physical or mental impairment. These factors persuade me to answer the certified question no. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH joins in the dissenting Opinion of Justice Morris.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b394-8\">JUSTICE RICE, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u00b631 I would answer the certified question \u201cno\u201d-obesity that is not a symptom of a physiological condition is not a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d as the term is used in \u00a7 49-2-101(19)(a), MCA. I believe the Court\u2019s analysis is flawed because it is premised upon post-event congressional amendments to the ADA that have not been incorporated by the Montana Legislature into the Montana Human Rights Act, rather than the federal court precedent that should guide our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b632 The seven statements of undisputed fact from the U.S. District Court upon which we are to base our answer to the certified question indicate that the alleged discriminatory conduct occurred in 2008. \u201cOn February 6, 2008, BNSF informed Feit he was not qualified for his \u2018safety sensitive\u2019 position because of the \u2018significant health and safety risks associated with extreme obesity.\u2019 \u201d Finding of Fact 2. BNSF thereafter suggested that Feit could pursue certain additional options, such as losing weight, but, even so, BNSF did not guarantee a position to Feit if he successfully completed these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b633 The ADAAA did not become effective until January 1, 2009. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, \u00a7 8 (2008). \u201c We determine the substantive rights between the parties according to the law in effect at the date of injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>2010 MT 246, \u00b6 26, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321 (quoting <em>Boettcher v. Mont. Guar. Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 393, 154 P.3d 629 (citation omitted)); <em>see also Anderson v. Werner Enters., </em>1998 MT 333, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 284, 972 P.2d 806 (\u201cwe adhere to the rule that the substantive rights between parties to an action are determined by the law in effect on the date of the injury .... Further, a statute will not be applied retroactively unless the legislature clearly expressed an intention to so apply it.\u201d). Federal courts addressing ADA claims have held likewise. <em>See Hill v. Verizon Md., Inc., </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59786 *23, n. 9 (D. Md. July 13,2009) (\u201cThe amendments to the ADA are not effective until January 9, 2009, and the Court must use the laws and interpretations of those laws in effect at the time of the complained-of actions.\u201d). To impose liability upon a party based upon law not in effect at the time of the party\u2019s actions violates this principle and raises questions of fundamental fairness. While a legislature may intend legislation to be retroactively applied, <em>see U.S. v. Juvenile Male, </em>2011 MT 104, \u00b6 7, 360 Mont. 317, 255 P.3d 110, Congress did not intend so here. In response to BNSF\u2019s citation to federal authority holding that the ADAAA was not intended to operate retroactively, the Court dismisses the argument because it \u201coverlook[s] the point that we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>interpreting Montana statutes, not the ADAAA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. However, we should not be retroactively applying ADAAA principles to interpret Montana law governing a 2008, pre-ADAAA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b634 Further, the Court overlooks the fact that the Montana Legislature has not adopted corresponding changes to the MHRA in the two legislative sessions since enactment of the ADAAA. The Court presumes that because Congress enacted the ADAAA, Montana law necessarily follows, without pausing to consider that our Legislature has not so directed. When Congress revises federal disability discrimination laws, Montana is faced with the question of whether to revise state laws in the same manner. After congressional passage of the ADA, the Montana Legislature saw fit in 1991 to make corresponding changes in the MHRA, including adding the requirement of \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d and updating the definition of \u201cphysical or mental handicap.\u201d <em>See </em>Mont. H.B. 389, 52d Legis., Reg. Sess.; Laws of Montana, 1991, ch. 241,551. The preamble to H.B. 389 explained that the then-current definitions of physical and mental handicap in state law \u201clack[ed] clarity and are inconsistent with definitions used in federal civil rights statutes and court interpretations on the subject.\u201d Again, in 1993, the Montana Legislature elected to follow the lead of Congress by exchanging the concept of \u201chandicap\u201d within the MHRA for the concept of \u201cdisability.\u201d <em>See </em>Mont. H.B. 496,53rd Legis., Reg. Sess.; Laws of Montana, 1993, ch. 407,1374. The preamble to H.B. 496 explained that \u201cmaking the state human rights laws consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act will eliminate some confusion between state and federal laws.\u201d Laws of Montana, 1993, ch. 407, at 1375. Rep. Diana Wyatt, sponsor of the bill, commented in her opening statement that \u201c[t]he purpose of HB 496 is to update terminology used in the Montana Human Rights Law so it is consistent with the terminology used in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\u201d Mont. S. Comm, on Jud., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 496, </em>53rd Legis., Reg. Sess. 2 (March 12, 1993). \u00b635 However, the Montana Legislature has not yet enacted corresponding revisions to the MHRA based upon the ADAAA. \u201c[T]he Legislature is presumed to act with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing laws on a subject.\u201d <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Assn. v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 41, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003 (citing <em>Ross v. City of Great Falls, </em>1998 MT276, \u00b6 17, 291 Mont. 377, 967 P.2d 1103). \u201cMoreover, in construing a statute, our job \u2018is simply to ascertain and decide what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted....\u2019 Section 1-2-101, MCA.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Hunter v. City of Great Falls, </em>2002 MT 331, \u00b6 14, 313 Mont. 231, 61 P.3d 764.1 believe the Court impinges upon legislative prerogative by-conforming state law to the ADAAA before the Legislature has spoken. \u00b636 Consequently, I would look to federal jurisprudence under the ADA for guidance in applying the MHRA to a 2008 claim. I first note that the pertinent language of the ADA and the MHRA are virtually identical. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 49-2-101(19)(a), MCA, defining \u201cphysical or mental disability\u201d as: \u201c(i) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a person\u2019s major life activities; (ii) a record of such an impairment; or (iii) a condition regarded as such a impairment;\u201d <em>with </em>42 U.S.C. 12102(2), defining \u201cdisability\u201d as: \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such impairment.\u201d Further, when interpreting the term \u201cphysical or mental impairment,\u201d federal courts have unfailingly required that obesity be caused by a physiological condition to qualify as a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b637 In <em>Andrews v. Ohio, </em>104 F.3d 803 (6th Cir. 1997), state troopers alleged under the ADA that the state perceived them as being disabled because they exceeded Ohio\u2019s mandatory weight limits for law enforcement officers. <em>Andrews, </em>104 F.3d at 805. Citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h), the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals held that \u201cphysical characteristics that are \u2018not the result of a physiological disorder\u2019 are not considered \u2018impairments\u2019 for the purposes of determining either actual or perceived disability.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>104 F.3d at 808.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Francis v. City of Meriden, </em>129 F.3d 281 (2d Cir. 1997), the plaintiff was disciplined by the City for exceeding the fire department\u2019s weight requirements and alleged that the City perceived him as having a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>disability based solely on his weight, despite his ability to perform his job duties. <em>Francis, </em>129 F.3d at 282. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held that the physical characteristic of weight, not the result of a physiological disorder, was not considered an \u201cimpairment\u201d under the Act. <em>Francis, </em>129 F.3d at 286. In <em>Equal Empl. Opportunity Commn. v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., </em>463 F.3d 436 (6th Cir. 2006), the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals held \u201cto constitute an ADA impairment, a person\u2019s obesity, even morbid obesity, must be the result of a physiological condition.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>463 F.3d at 443. Consistent with these holdings, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, in <em>Cook v. R.I., Dept. of Health, </em>10 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1993), held that a morbidly obese woman was disabled after she presented evidence that her obesity was caused by a physiological disorder. <em>Cook, </em>10 F.3d at 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b638 Numerous federal district court decisions have reached the same conclusion. In a notable recent case, the plaintiff was diagnosed as morbidly obese and brought claims under the ADA against his employer for demoting him and reducing his pay because of the employer\u2019s perception that the plaintiff could no longer perform his job duties, and for failing to provide reasonable accommodation. <em>Hill, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59786 at *9-10. There was \u201cno evidence suggesting that Mr. Hill suffered from an underlying physiological condition or disorder.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59786 at *10. In denying the claim, the federal district court, quoting the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, observed that \u201cthe case law and the regulations both point <em>unrelentingly </em>to the conclusion that a claim based on obesity is not likely to succeed under the ADA,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe case law and regulations weigh heavily against a determination that obesity constitutes a disability.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59786 at *17-18 (quoting <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>57 F.3d 1340, 1354 (4th Cir. 1995); <em>Smaw v. Commw. of Va. Dept. of State Police, </em>862 F. Supp 1469, 1472 (E.D. Va. 1994)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b639 BNSF is entitled to be judged under the law that governed alleged discriminatory conduct in 2008. Looking to the appropriate federal jurisprudence for guidance in applying state law to this particular claim, the very strong rule across the federal circuits is that obesity that is not the result of a physiological condition is not a \u201cphysical impairment.\u201d I would thus answer the certified question \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-5\"> 2008 EEOC regulations similarly defined \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d as: (1 <em>)Any physiological disorder, or condition, </em>cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">(2) Any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (2008) (emphasis added).
