The Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, sentenced Moore and also imposed appointed counsel costs of $1,340, prosecution costs of $100, and jury costs of $1,447.50. Moore appeals the imposition of those costs. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly investigate Moore\u2019s financial ability to pay the jury costs, appointed counsel costs, and prosecution costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">\u00b64 The State of Montana (State) charged Moore with felony driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(1), MCA, in June 2010. A jury found Moore guilty in November 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-16\">\u00b65 A probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI) on January 3, 2011. Moore\u2019s PSI indicated that he has $7,900 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>assets and $3,500 in debts. The $7,900 represents the value of his truck, van, and car, as well as an antique gun. His $3,500 in debts constitutes bank loans for his vehicles. The PSI stated that Moore had been employed with his cousin\u2019s cabinet company, though Moore was not currently working at the time that the probation officer prepared Moore\u2019s PSI. Moore earned $14.50 an hour when employed at the cabinet company. Moore underwent hand surgery, however, the day before his arrest. The PSI contains no reference as to how, if at all, this injury would affect Moore\u2019s ability to work at his cousin\u2019s cabinet company in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b66 The PSI recommended that Moore pay the appropriate statutorily mandated fees. These fees included a fee for the preparation of the PSI, supervision fees, a fine, a surcharge for each felony offense, a surcharge for victim and witness advocate programs, and a court information technology fee. The PSI did not contemplate the imposition of jury costs, costs of the prosecution, or the cost of a public defender. The PSI did not explore Moore\u2019s ability to pay any restitution, and listed \u201cN/A\u201d under the heading \u201cRestitution.\u201d The PSI thus did not investigate Moore\u2019s ability to pay additional trial costs.</p>\n<p id=\"ARp\">\u00b67 The State asked the court to impose costs of the jury, prosecution, and appointed counsel at Moore\u2019s sentencing hearing on January 6, 2011. The State claimed jury costs of $1,447.50. The State did not know the amount of appointed counsel costs. The State claimed that \u00a7 46-18-232(1), MCA, sets the cost of prosecution at $100. The State acknowledged that it had not informed the probation officer who had prepared Moore\u2019s PSI that it intended to ask the court to impose these court costs. Moore\u2019s counsel objected to the imposition of jury and public defender costs due to his indigence. The State argued that Moore likely could find a job upon his release from prison based upon Moore\u2019s employment history.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b68 The District Court stated that it would not revoke Moore\u2019s suspended commitment to the Department of Corrections (DOC) \u201cin the event that it is shown that he is unable to pay those costs, but that is yet to be seen depending on how things go once he\u2019s outside of any kind of incarcerated status.\u201d The District Court did not question Moore about his ability to pay court costs. Moore\u2019s testimony was limited to an apology for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b69 The District Court imposed a thirteen-month commitment to the DOC, followed by a suspended commitment to the DOC for five years. The court imposed orally the three court costs without stating the amount of each. The written judgment listed the cost of appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>counsel at $1,340, the cost of prosecution at $100, and the cost of the jury at $1,447.50. Moore appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b610 We review for legality a criminal sentence imposing over one year of incarceration. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 37, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the court adhered to the applicable sentencing statute. <em>State v. McMaster, </em>2008 MT 268, \u00b6 20, 345 Mont. 172, 190 P.3d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b611 Section 46-8-113(1), MCA, authorizes a district court to impose costs incurred by counsel assigned to represent the defendant. The court must question the defendant as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the costs. Section 46-8-113(3), MCA. The court cannot impose such costs \u201cunless the defendant is or will be able to pay the costs\u201d of assigned counsel. Section 46-8-113(4), MCA. Section 46-18-232(1), MCA, authorizes a district court to impose costs incurred by the prosecution. The court may not impose costs of prosecution \u201cunless the defendant is or will be able to pay them.\u201d Section 46-18-232(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">\u00b612 The Court determined in <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 35, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126, that a district court must investigate a defendant\u2019s ability to pay a fine. McLeod owed thousands of dollars in back child support. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 32. McLeod\u2019s PSI did not address his ability to pay court-imposed fines. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 33. The district court imposed a $1,000 fine without asking McLeod about his ability to pay. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 32. The fine was due immediately upon McLeod commencing parole, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-234, MCA. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\u00b613 The Court determined that the district court had failed to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, before imposing the fine. These requirements include consideration of whether the defendant will be able to pay the fine, the defendant\u2019s financial resources, and the burden that the fine would impose. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 35. The Court remanded to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether McLeod had the ability to pay the fine and for consideration of the other factors required by the statute. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b614  The District Court failed to question Moore directly about his ability to pay the costs of his appointed counsel as required under \u00a7 46-8-113(3), MCA. Moore\u2019s PSI did not explore his ability to pay costs of his appointed counsel or prosecution, but did include Moore\u2019s assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and debts. The court did not refer to the information in the PSI in either its oral pronouncement or written order. The court did not \u201cdemonstrate a serious inquiry or separate determination\u201d into the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fine. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 34. The court acknowledged tacitly Moore\u2019s potential inability to pay the costs by not conditioning Moore\u2019s suspended sentence on payment of the costs. The court did not \u201ctake into account the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden,\u201d however, that the costs would impose. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 34. The District Court failed to investigate Moore\u2019s ability to pay costs of appointed counsel or costs of prosecution, as required by \u00a7 46-8-113, MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-232(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b615  Section 46-18-232(1), MCA, similarly allows a court to require a convicted defendant to pay costs of jury service. The court must determine whether the \u201cdefendant is or will be able to pay them.\u201d Section 46-18-232(2), MCA. The court must consider the defendant\u2019s resources, the future ability of the defendant to pay, and the burden that the costs will impose on the defendant. Section 46-18-232(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b616 In applying this statute, however, courts must be cognizant that the United States Constitution protects the right to trial by jury in Article III, Section 2. The Montana Constitution provides a person with an enhanced right to a jury trial. <em>State v. Covington, </em>2012 MT 31, \u00b6 20, 364 Mont. 118, 272 P.3d 43. The Montana Constitution refers to the right to a jury trial in three separate places. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 24, 26. Each person has the right to a jury trial and that right \u201cshall remain inviolate.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b617 This Court in <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>2001 MT 198, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 267, 32 P.3d 771, addressed a district court\u2019s imposition of jury costs. We noted that the court could have imposed jury costs upon the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA, after \u201ca proper determination that [the defendant] \u2018is or will be able to pay them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackwell, </em>\u00b6 7. We reversed the imposition of jury costs in <em>Blackwell, </em>however, based upon the district court\u2019s improper reliance on Local Rule 11 for the assessment of costs. <em>Blackwell, </em>\u00b6 8. The district court failed to consider entirely the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those costs as required by \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b618  To require a defendant to pay costs of a jury trial poses a potential chilling effect on an indigent defendant. A defendant who cannot afford the potential cost associated with a criminal jury trial may forego a jury trial, even if a jury trial would be in a defendant\u2019s best interest. As a result, courts cannot apply the portion of \u00a7 46-18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>232(1), MCA, that allows the imposition of \u201ccosts of jury service\u201d to indigent defendants without first scrupulously and meticulously determining the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those costs. To apply the provision to a defendant who cannot afford the fee undermines his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b619  The District Court failed to ascertain independently Moore\u2019s ability to pay the jury costs, and appears to have relied solely upon the information contained in the PSI. The PSI did not address directly Moore\u2019s ability to pay the jury costs. The PSI stated that Moore had been employed at $14.50 an hour, though he was not currently earning an income. The District Court needed to investigate further Moore\u2019s financial circumstances, including his ability to pay, before imposing jury costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b620  An order of jury costs must not compromise a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial. The PSI demonstrated that Moore was not working at the time of his sentencing and that Moore recently had suffered an injury. Nothing in the record indicates that Moore had the ability to pay jury costs of $1,447.50 in this instance. Without further evidence indicating his ability to pay, to require Moore to pay those jury costs would encroach upon his clear and \u201cinviolate\u201d constitutional right to a jury trial. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b621  We remand to the District Court for a determination as to whether Moore can afford the appointed counsel and prosecution costs pursuant to \u00a7 46-8-113, MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA. We also remand the District Court\u2019s award of jury costs of $1,447.50 for a similar determination. The District Court\u2019s analysis of Moore\u2019s ability to pay jury costs must take into account the potential chilling effect of these jury costs on the rights of an indigent defendant to a jury trial in a criminal case. The District Court must analyze the factors contained in \u00a7 46-18-232(2), MCA, with an eye to preserving an indigent defendant\u2019s \u201cinviolate\u201d right to a jury trial in a criminal case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
