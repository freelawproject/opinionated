The dispositive issue on appeal is whether BNSF has demonstrated sufficient grounds to excuse its noncompliance with the fourteen-day filing deadline of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">\u00b62 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to deny BNSF\u2019s petition for judicial review and to enter judgment in favor of Cringle.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">\u00b63 This case is before the Court for a second time regarding the fourteen-day time limit for appeal to the Human Rights Commission (Commission). <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. The background is summarized briefly before turning to the issue raised in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">\u00b64 On July 7, 2008, Cringle filed a complaint with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry charging that BNSF had illegally discriminated against him in employment. The complaint was referred to a hearing officer for contested case proceedings. On May 1,2009, the hearing officer granted summary judgment to Cringle on the issue of liability. The hearing officer determined that BNSF had \u201cengaged in and is liable for a discriminatory refusal to hire Cringle.\u201d Following proceedings on the issues of damages and affirmative relief, the hearing officer issued a final decision in Cringle\u2019s favor on September 2,2009. That same day, the hearing officer issued notice of his decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>by mail to counsel for Cringle and to counsel for BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b65 The hearing officer\u2019s decision and the notice of that decision were received at the office of BNSF\u2019s counsel the next day, September 3. This was a \u201cparticularly busy day\u201d at the law office, with staff working on a voluminous discovery project. The office was short-staffed and both documents were \u201cset aside.\u201d Nineteen days elapsed. Then, on September 22, a legal secretary discovered the hearing officer\u2019s decision and the notice \u201cunder papers\u201d on her desk. By that time, the decision had become final under \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, which states that if the hearing officer\u2019s decision is not appealed to the Commission within fourteen days after issuance of the notice, \u201cthe decision becomes final and is not appealable to district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b66 BNSF filed a notice of appeal to the Commission under \u00a7 49-2-505(4), MCA. BNSF also filed a request to the Commission for an extension of time in which to file its notice of appeal. Citing Rule 24.9.113(3) of the Administrative Rules of Montana, BNSF argued that the time to file its appeal to the Commission could be enlarged for good cause. That rule provides: \u201cExcept as to dates fixed by statute and not subject to modification, the commission may enlarge the time to perform an act. In accordance with Rule 6(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, the time may be enlarged for good cause shown.\u201d Cringle objected to BNSF\u2019s request for an extension of time and argued that the filing deadline is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d bar that deprives the Commission of authority to entertain untimely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b67 The Commission entered an order on October 5, 2009, denying BNSF\u2019s extension request and dismissing BNSF\u2019s appeal. Based on the plain language of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, the Commission observed that the hearing officer\u2019s decision became \u201cfinal\u201d on September 16, six days before BNSF filed its notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b68 BNSF sought judicial review in the District Court of the Commission\u2019s order dismissing its appeal. BNSF advised the District Court that the hearing officer\u2019s decision and notice were \u201ceither misfiled or otherwise misplaced by counsel\u2019s staff, and the time in which to file a notice of appeal was accordingly not placed on counsel\u2019s calendar.\u201d BNSF argued that the Commission had authority to extend the fourteen-day period for BNSF\u2019s appeal from the hearing officer\u2019s decision on the ground that filing periods are subject to \u201cequitable modification.\u201d BNSF asked the District Court to reverse the Commission\u2019s decision denying BNSF\u2019s extension request and to remand the matter to the Commission with instructions either to accept BNSF\u2019s notice of appeal as timely or to consider in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>instance whether to grant BNSF\u2019s extension request.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b69 The Commission and Cringle filed separate motions to dismiss BNSF\u2019s petition. The Commission argued that its decision was in accordance with \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, and that it did not have discretion to extend the statutory deadline. Cringle argued, among other things, that the District Court could not review the hearing officer\u2019s decision because the fourteen-day filing deadline of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c) and (4), MCA, is jurisdictional. Alternatively, Cringle argued that even if the filing deadline is a \u201ccategorical time prescription,\u201d rather than a jurisdictional limitation, the result is still the same. He observed that there is no language in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, allowing the deadline to be extended based on good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b610 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, \u201climit[s] this Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d over decisions of the Department of Labor and Industry by requiring that they be appealed to the Commission within fourteen days. Thus, because subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited or waived, the District Court decided that BNSF\u2019s petition must be dismissed. The court also denied BNSF\u2019s alternative request for \u201ca writ of mandate, writ of review, or other appropriate writ\u201d directing the Commission to entertain BNSF\u2019s appeal. The court observed that the Commission \u201cdoes not have authority to lengthen statutory deadlines.\u201d Finally, the court granted Cringle\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s cross-petitions to enforce the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">\u00b611 BNSF appealed to this Court and argued that the District Court had jurisdiction to review the dismissal order under \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-702 and 49-2-505(9), MCA, or alternatively under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA. BNSF argued that the District Court had erred in interpreting the fourteen-day filing deadline as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and asked this Court to hold that the Commission \u201chas the authority to extend the deadline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b612 This Court articulated one issue on appeal: \u201cDoes the 14-day filing deadline in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, deprive a district court of jurisdiction over matters arising between the parties after the deadline has expired?\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 12. We answered this question in the negative, concluding that the fourteen-day filing deadline is a procedural time bar, not a limitation on a district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. Under \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, the District Court \u201cpossesses jurisdiction to hear the parties\u2019 dispute and adjudicate their issues.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 20. The Court remanded to the District Court to consider BNSF\u2019s \u201calleged good cause that would justify its motion for an extension of time.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28. If BNSF made a sufficient showing, then BNSF could pursue its appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>decision to the Commission. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28. Otherwise, the District Court was directed to deny BNSF\u2019s request for an extension. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b613 The case now returns to this Court following the District Court\u2019s determination on remand that BNSF has shown good cause for its untimely filing. The District Court cited three considerations in its ruling. First, the court observed that the fourteen-day filing period is \u201ca very short procedural limitation which implicates due process rights for both claimants and respondents because valid claims can be lost because documents can easily be misplaced for that period of time.\u201d Second, the court concluded that Cringle would suffer no prejudice if the fourteen-day time bar were waived because, \u201c[i]f successful, Cringle will be awarded his attorney fees for being required to march through the administrative hoops, a likely appeal to this Court or federal court, and another appeal to the Montana Supreme Court or the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d Lastly, the court stated that \u201cit does not appear BNSF has acted in bad faith in misplacing the documents for a short period of time and acted promptly once the documents were found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b614 Alternatively, the District Court noted that under an equitable tolling or excusable neglect standard, BNSF had presented evidence which the court viewed \u201cas justifying relief from the very short 14-day administrative time bar.\u201d The court reasoned that the interests of justice would be served by allowing BNSF\u2019s appeal to the Commission. The court entered an order on July 11, 2011, remanding this case to the Commission. Cringle timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b615 We now clarify that, because \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, is a statutory time prescription that provides an inflexible rule of finality, \u201cgood cause\u201d for excusing noncompliance with the statute requires a showing of circumstances beyond the party\u2019s reasonable control that prevented the party from timely filing its notice of appeal. Applying this principle, we conclude that BNSF has failed to justify relief from the time bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b616 The parties dispute the applicable standard of review. Cringle argues that de novo review applies, while BNSF argues that the standard is whether the District Court abused its discretion. We conclude that de novo review applies to determine whether the facts found by the District Court warrant a conclusion that BNSF presented circumstances sufficient to grant it an equitable exception from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>statutory filing deadline. We apply de novo review to mixed questions of law and fact, including the district court\u2019s application of controlling legal principles to its factual findings. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534. In such cases, the district court\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Hass, </em>2011 MT 296, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 8, 265 P.3d 1221. Thus, although we review the District Court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error, whether those facts satisfy the legal standard is reviewed de novo. <em>Citizens Right to Recall v. State, </em>2006 MT 192, \u00b6 6, 333 Mont. 153, 142 P.3d 764; <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654 (\u201cWe review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for equitable tolling where the underlying facts are undisputed.\u201d). We have recognized in other contexts that such a \u201cbifurcated standard of review affords appropriate deference to the trial court\u2019s fact-finding role and responsibility, while providing this Court with the opportunity to review legal conclusions and the application of legal standards de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Kaufman, </em>2002 MT 294, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 1, 59 P.3d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b617 On appeal, as they did before the District Court, the parties dispute what standard BNSF had to satisfy to proceed with its appeal despite noncompliance with the appeal deadline. This Court did not elaborate on that question in <em>Cringle. </em>In our decision, we simply held that the deadline in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, is a nonjurisdictional time bar that is subject to \u201cconstitutional review and equitable principles.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18. The Court cited the doctrine of equitable tolling as an example of equitable principles. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18. In its remand instructions, the Court directed the District Court to \u201chear BNSF\u2019s alleged good cause that would justify\u201d an out-of-time appeal. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b618 Cringle argues that the standard for extending a deadline which is categorical and contains no express exceptions-like \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA-should be <em>greater </em>than the standard for extending a deadline which expressly is made subject to exceptions such as \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d He argues that the Court should interpret the \u201cgood cause\u201d language of <em>Cringle </em>consistently with the standard for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b619 BNSF asserts that \u201ctraditional equitable tolling\u201d is not the standard. Rather, focusing on the references in <em>Cringle\u2019s </em>remand instruction to good cause, BNSF argues the Court unequivocally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>adopted a good cause standard, which is \u201cconsiderably more lenient\u201d than equitable tolling. BNSF argues that this Court should uphold the District Court\u2019s ruling on the basis of the four-factor test we articulated in N.W. <em>Truck &amp; Trailer Sales v. Dvorak, </em>265 Mont. 327, 334, 877 P.2d 31, 35 (1994), for consideration in assessing \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d under Mont. R. App. P. 5(c) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b620 We disagree that <em>Cringle\u2019s </em>reference to \u201cequitable principles\u201d and \u201cgood cause\u201d created a liberal standard for excusing noncompliance with the categorical statutory time bar contained in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA. We reject BNSF\u2019s analogy to <em>Dvorak, </em>which interpreted a rule of court that expressly allowed a good cause or excusable neglect exception. We leave for another day, however, Cringle\u2019s argument that we should apply principles of equitable tolling to a party\u2019s failure to meet a categorical deadline imposed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b621 Both in <em>Cringle, </em>where we remanded for a determination of \u201cgood cause,\u201d and in <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704, where we did apply equitable tolling, we emphasized \u2018\u201cthe importance of applying procedural bars regularly and consistently.\u2019\u201d <em>Weidow, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing cases). Firm deadlines for launching an appeal \u201cadvance the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair notice and finality.\u201d <em>Greenlaw v. U.S., </em>554 U.S. 237, 252, 128 S. Ct. 2559, 2569 (2008). While we have recognized that equitable principles will in some cases excuse strict compliance with a categorical time bar, \u201cgood cause\u201d for such relief necessarily requires a \u201clegally sufficient reason.\u201d <em>City of Helena v. Roan, </em>2010 MT 29, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 172, 226 P.3d 601. Because categorical claim-processing rules are generally rigid, inflexible, and unalterable, <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 44, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121, it necessarily follows that a \u201clegally sufficient reason\u201d for excusing noncompliance with a categorical time prescription requires a greater and more demanding showing than a \u201clegally sufficient reason\u201d for excusing noncompliance with a statute or rule providing a good cause exception. While we have rejected a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach\u201d in the application of equitable principles, <em>Weidow, </em>\u00b6 28, a legally sufficient reason requires, at a minimum, reasonable effort to pursue one\u2019s legal rights. <em>Puhto v. Smith Funeral Chapels, </em>Inc., 2011 MT 279, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 447, 264 P.3d 1142 (denying relief for a layperson\u2019s \u201cinattention to mail\u201d). As we noted in <em>Puhto, </em>\u201c[Litigants have a duty to monitor litigation.\u201d <em>Puhto, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Caplis v. Caplis, </em>2004 MT 145, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 450, 91 P.3d 1282). <em>See also Irwin v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 458 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>(characterizing an attorney\u2019s failure to timely discover EEOC notice as a lack of \u201cdiligence in preserving his legal rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b622  In this regard, we reject BNSF\u2019s characterization of the fourteen-day filing deadline as merely \u201can internal agency claim-processing rule.\u201d As the Commission pointed out in the District Court, the Montana Human Rights Act\u2019s short deadlines are designed to bring about prompt resolution of discrimination claims. <em>See generally </em>Title 49, chapter 2, part 5, MCA. Section 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, mandates that a hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal\u201d unless it is appealed to the Commission within fourteen days after issuance of the notice of decision. This period-\u201cshort\u201d though it may be-reflects the legislature\u2019s general intent to expedite discrimination claims. It is therefore appropriate to excuse noncompliance with the Human Rights Act\u2019s appeal deadline only where the parties have acted with reasonable diligence to preserve their legal rights but have been prevented from doing so by circumstances reasonably beyond their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b623  We therefore conclude, as we did in <em>Arthur v. Pierre Ltd., </em>2004 MT 303, \u00b6 42, 323 Mont. 453, 100 P.3d 987, that it is unnecessary to determine in this case whether the equitable tolling doctrine recognized in federal discrimination cases <em>{e.g., Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S. Ct. at 458) should apply to the deadlines imposed by the Montana Human Rights Act. Even under a \u201cgood cause\u201d standard, as discussed above, BNSF is not entitled to relief. In this case, BNSF had participated in contested case proceedings with a full opportunity to present evidence and legal argument. It was represented by experienced legal counsel, familiar with the Human Rights Act\u2019s processes, who reasonably knew or should have known the importance of responding quickly to the hearing officer\u2019s decisions but simply \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d There is no evidence that BNSF was prevented by any factor outside its control from timely filing its appeal. Although BNSF disputes whether Cringle would suffer prejudice if the appeal were allowed to proceed, we conclude that consideration of potential prejudice to Cringle is not controlling under the circumstances presented in this case. Misplacement of the hearing officer\u2019s decision in counsel\u2019s office fails to establish reasonable steps to preserve BNSF\u2019s legal rights. Counsel\u2019s failure to discover the notice did not constitute sufficient cause for relief from its untimely notice of appeal. \u00b624 The July 11, 2011 order of the District Court is reversed. On remand, the court is directed to deny BNSF\u2019s petition for judicial review and to enter judgment in favor of Cringle.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b336-4\">JUSTICE MORRIS,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b625 I join in the Court\u2019s decision because the facts do not warrant our exercise of equitable powers. I write separately to reiterate that we rejected in <em>Weidow </em>\u201cany one-size-fits-all approach\u201d when addressing a limitations period. Weidow, \u00b6 28. Equity allows courts to evaluate the circumstances and reasons for why a party failed to comply with a limitations period. <em>Weidow, </em>\u00b6 28. This equitable power proves particularly critical when a limitations period would deprive a party of his rights and where, simultaneously, enforcing the limitations period would serve no policy purpose. <em>Weidow, </em>\u00b6 28.

I write separately to clarify my views concerning the application of common-law equitable exceptions to categorical time prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u00b627 In resisting BNSF\u2019s motion for an extension of time in which to file an appeal to the Human Rights Commission, Cringle invoked the notion that the 14-day filing deadline is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d We made clear in <em>Cringle </em>that this deadline-and procedural time bars generally-are not jurisdictional (in the sense that they do not deprive a court of subject-matter jurisdiction). <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-20. In so doing, we observed that \u201c[pjrocedural time bars, like the 14-day filing deadline in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, remain subject to constitutional review and equitable principles.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18. There is no question that procedural time bars are subject to constitutional challenge and review. On this point, we were unanimous. <em>See Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18 (opinion of the Court); <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 39 (Rice, J., dissenting). Upon further research and reflection, however, I have reconsidered our suggestion that <em>all </em>procedural time bars are subject to judicially crafted equitable exceptions. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18.1 have now concluded that this proposition is incorrect. Rather, each categorical time prescription must be analyzed individually, within its statutory context and framework, so as to effect legislative intent. (The same principle would apply to categorical time bars contained within rules of court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u00b628 The Supreme Court\u2019s equitable tolling jurisprudence provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>some useful insights in this regard. In <em>Irwin v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 111 S. Ct. 453 (1990), the Supreme Court observed that time requirements in lawsuits between private litigants, including the statutory time limits applicable to lawsuits against private employers under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u201care customarily subject to \u2018equitable tolling.\u2019 \u201d 498 U.S. at 95, 111 S. Ct. at 457. The Supreme Court noted, however, that this \u201cpresumption of equitable tolling\u201d is \u201crebuttable.\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 95-96, 111 S. Ct. at 457. In order to honor legislative intent, the <em>Irwin </em>presumption is rebutted where \u201cthere [is] good reason to believe that Congress did <em>not </em>want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply.\u201d <em>United States v. Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. 347, 350, 117 S. Ct. 849, 851 (1997) (emphasis in original). Thus, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[e]quitable tolling is not permissible where it is inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Beggerly, </em>524 U.S. 38, 48, 118 S. Ct. 1862, 1868 (1998); <em>accord Young v. United States, </em>535 U.S. 43, 49, 122 S. Ct. 1036, 1040 (2002) (\u201cIt is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b629 The tax statute under consideration in <em>Brockamp, </em>for example, set forth its time limitations \u201cin unusually emphatic form.\u201d 519 U.S. at 350,117 S. Ct. at 851. Moreover, it set forth \u201cexplicit exceptions to its basic time limits, and those very specific exceptions d[id] not include \u2018equitable tolling.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. at 351, 117 S. Ct. at 852. The Supreme Court concluded, therefore, that Congress did not intend courts to read \u201cunmentioned, open-ended, \u2018equitable\u2019 exceptions into the statute that it wrote.\u201d <em>Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. at 352, 117 S. Ct. at 852. Conversely, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Holland v. </em>Florida,_ U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 2549 (2010), that the timeliness provision in the federal habeas corpus statute <em>is </em>subject to equitable tolling. Among other things, the Supreme Court observed that the statute did not contain \u201cunusually emphatic\u201d language and that equitable tolling would not undermine the statute\u2019s basic purposes. <em>Holland, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2561-62 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u00b630 Following this logic, the application of common-law equitable doctrines to categorical statutory time bars is a two-step process: first, determine whether the Legislature intended to preclude the application of equitable exceptions to the time bar at issue; second, if the Legislature <em>did </em>intend to preclude equitable exceptions, then the time bar must be enforced (absent a successful constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>challenge), but if the Legislature <em>did not </em>intend to preclude equitable exceptions, then determine whether the claimed equitable exception applies on the facts presented. Whether the Legislature intended the courts to read \u201cunmentioned, open-ended, \u2018equitable\u2019 exceptions into the statute that it wrote,\u201d Brockamp, 519 U.S. at 352,117 S. Ct. at 852, is a preliminary question because equitable exceptions are not permissible where they are \u201cinconsistent with the text of the relevant statute,\u201d <em>Beggerly, </em>524 U.S. at 48, 118 S. Ct. at 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Lozeau v. GEICO Indem. Co., </em>2009 MT 136, 350 Mont. 320, 207 P.3d 316, the governing time provision stated: \u201cExcept as provided in 27-2-216 and 27-2-217, the period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon a liability not founded upon an instrument in writing is within 3 years.\u201d Section 27-2-204(1), MCA; <em>see also Lozeau, </em>\u00b6 13. This is not the sort of \u201cunusually emphatic\u201d statutory language that would preclude the application of equitable exceptions. Indeed, we applied our equitable tolling doctrine to Lozeau\u2019s late-filed claim. <em>Lozeau, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-21. In the present case, in contrast, the timing provision states that an appeal may be filed with the Commission within 14 days after notice of the hearing officer\u2019s decision is issued, but if the appeal is not filed within 14 days, \u201cthe decision becomes final <em>and is not appealable to district court.\u201d </em>Section 49-2-505(3)(c), (4), MCA (emphasis added). It is one thing for the Legislature to provide a mechanism for obtaining review and to include a filing deadline. In that situation, equitable doctrines may be available to excuse noncompliance with the deadline. But it is quite another when the Legislature goes further and dictates that a decision \u201cis not appealable\u201d if it is not appealed within the specified timeframe. In that situation, it is not the prerogative of the courts to ignore the Legislature\u2019s clear and unequivocal pronouncement and to graft equitable exceptions onto the statute. In my view, the language \u201cis not appealable\u201d is a clear directive not to apply equitable exceptions to the filing deadline. It is \u201c \u2018an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever\u2019 its \u2018clock has run.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2560 (quoting <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 208, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 1683 (2006)); <em>see also Cringle, </em>\u00b6 35 (Rice, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b632 I stand by our holding in <em>Cringle </em>with regard to the District Court\u2019s erroneous \u201cjurisdiction\u201d rationale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, for the reasons discussed above, I now conclude that we should not have crafted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>equitable exception to the filing deadline of \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA. For purposes of <em>future </em>cases, if the 14-day deadline is timely raised-by the party who would benefit from it, by the Commission, or by the district court, <em>see Cringle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 25-1 believe it must be enforced, subject to constitutional challenge and review. For purposes of <em>this </em>case, however, the law established in <em>Cringle </em>requires that we apply a \u201cgood cause\u201d analysis to BNSF\u2019s motion. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28.
