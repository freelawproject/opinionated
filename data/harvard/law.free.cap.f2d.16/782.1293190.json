The search warrant of September 22, which was the one used, was good. It is fairly to be inferred, though not .expressly recited, that the warrant was based on the affidavit of C. W. Fuller, who appeared before the officer issuing the warrant and stated, on oath of his own knowledge, facts which justified the issue. A copy of this affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>was attached to the warrant. Whether there was a further affidavit by the narcotic agent is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Duncan was charged in the first three counts with selling narcotics without having registered and paid a dealer\u2019s tax (section 1, as amended February 24,1919), and in counts 4 and 5 with making sales to a person who had no order form (section 2). Counts 1, 2, and 3 were dismissed; he was convicted on 4 and 5. The point now made, that there was no proof that the purchaser had no order form, even if it is not covered by the established rule that the exceptions of this statute need not be negatived by the prosecution, was not made below, and cannot be considered now. The point actually made was that there was no proof that Duncan had not registered and paid; but this pertained to counts 1, 2, and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Mandate forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
