The case is in all respects similar to that of Rojas-Adam Corporation v. Young et al. (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 988, recently decided, and is ruled by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">However, the District Court did not pass upon the application for a preliminary injunction, and a question is raised as to the ownership by appellant of some of the lands sought to be protected by injunction. That question, and other questions as to the alleged trespass, should' be decided by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-20\">The judgment appealed from will be reversed, and the ease remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-21\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
