The indictment charged that O\u2019Connor was operating and driving an automobile, and that Story and O\u2019Connor \u201cfeloniously, violently, wantonly, recklessly, and negligently did strike, hit, and beat him, the said Charles P. Jarvis [the deceased], with the said automobile,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The evidence for the government, stated in narrative form, is substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Jarvis, prior to the occurrence, was possessed of a gold watch and a small sum of money. \u2022 Early in the morning of November 16, 1924, he was in an obviously intoxicated \u25a0condition, when he was observed by O\u2019Connor and Story, who also had been drinking and were riding around in Story\u2019s automobile, with Story at the wheel. The car was stopped, and O\u2019Connor invited Jarvis to take a ride. Jarvis accepted the invitation, and, according to a statement signed by O\u2019Connor shortly after the occurrence and which Story in a similar statement characterized as true with two exceptions, O\u2019Connor \u201chelped the \u2022drunken man into the front seat, where Story was at the wheel.\u201d After proceeding a short distance, Story stopped the car and directed \u2022O\u2019Connor to put Jarvis on the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">According to the signed statement of Story, which he testified was true, the three men took several drinks of liquor and finally \u2022drove out to Kane\u2019s Lane and stopped. There the three men got out of the ear, and Jarvis was so drunk he fell in a ditch. Story pulled him up, and Jarvis then started to walk up the lane, in the direction the ear was headed. Story said to O\u2019Connor, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d whereupon O\u2019Connor asked permission to drive, and Story, according to his statement, asked if he had a permit. O\u2019Connor said he had, so Story allowed him to drive. Jarvis then was about 50 yards up the road, in front of the car. O\u2019Connor was at the wheel, with Story sitting beside him. Just as they got up to Jarvis, he staggered in front of the car and was run over. \u201cThe car was going about 20 or 25 miles an hour at the time that the man was hit.\u201d While Story and O\u2019Connor were attempting to turn the ear around, police officers arrived, and asked each of them \u201cwhat they run over that man for, and they both said, \u2018What man?\u2019 \u201d No money was found on the body of 'Jarvis, and his watch was found in the overcoat pocket of O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">In O\u2019Connor\u2019s signed statement he admitted taking the watch, and charged Story with taking the money. Story, both in his statement and testimony, disclaimed knowledge of the taking of the watch, and denied taking the money. There also was evidence to the effect that Kane\u2019s Lane' is very narrow at this point, and that it would be necessary for a pedestrian to step outside the road to avoid being run down.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">Both O\u2019Connor and Story took the stand. Story testified that, just prior to seeing Jarvis, he and O\u2019Connor purchased half a pint of liquor \u201cand started riding out H street, and came to First and H street Northeast; on the right corner there was a man staggering around, and he fell just as we got past him, and I stopped the ear right quick, and O\u2019Con-nor he run and pulled him up and holloed back to me that the man was drunk. * * * \u201d After being taken into the car, Jarvis \u201cpulled a bottle out of his pocket and handed it to O\u2019Connor, and he passed it to me and I took a drink. * * * We rode out H street, and, when we got to the lumber yard, there is a little lane turns there; I later found out it was Kane\u2019s Lane, and O\u2019Connor says, \u2018Turn up in here, Story, and we will all have a drink.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Story had never been in this lane. The three men got out of the car, and Story walked a little to one side, and, when he returned, he heard Jarvis say to O\u2019Connor, \u201cOh, you done me wrong.\u201d Thereupon \u201cO\u2019Connor turned him loose, and he sat down on the bank, on the left-hand side of the car, and the grass was wet down there.\u201d Story pulled Jarvis up, and \u201che said,\u201cLet.me walk; I will be all right in a few minutes;\u2019 and I [Story] turned him loose. After saying three or four words to him; I forgot what I said, I turned him loose and he started walking down the lane. O\u2019Connor says, \u2018Tell him to get in the car;\u2019 and I says, \u2018He says he wants to walk; he wants to sober up;\u2019 and I $ays, \u2018Let us turn around in the ear;\u2019 and I started to get back to the wheel, and O\u2019Connor says, \u2018Let me drive, Story; you can\u2019t turn around with one arm.\u2019 I left him drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>It is 'unnecessary to detail the other evidence in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">The first assignment of error is based upon the refusal of the court to sustain the demurrer to the indictment, the contention being that it is lacking in that degree of precision and definiteness necessary to charge a crime. This contention is without merit. The indictment charges that O\u2019Connor and Story feloniously, violently, wantonly, recklessly, and negligently struck Jarvis with the automobile driven by O\u2019Connor. Under these allegations, each was a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">If the owner of a dangerous instrumentality like an automobile knowingly puts that instrumentality in the immediate control of a careless and reckless driver, sits by his side, and permits him without protest so recklessly and negligently to operate the ear as to cause the death 'of another, he is as much responsible as the man at the wheel. If Story did no inore than aid and abet O\u2019Connor in his criminal negligence, Story was properly charged as a principal under section 908 of the Code, which provides that \u201cin prosecutions for any. criminal offense all persons advising, inciting, or conniving at the offense, or aiding or abetting the principal offender, shall be charged as principals and not as accessories,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In the present case, the automobile was the property of Story. He and O\u2019Connor had been drinking, when they discovered Jarvis in such an intoxicated condition that he hardly could stand. Jarvis was invited into the car, and, although having the responsibility of driving the ear, Story continued drinking with the two other men. They turned into a narrow lane, where all got out of the car, which up to that time had been driven by Story. Jarvis fell into a ditch, was pulled out by Story (according to Story\u2019s testimony), and started up the lane in the direction the ear was headed. Knowing that Jarvis was so intoxicated he hardly could walk, that the lane was narrow, and that even the most careful driver would have difficulty in passing Jarvis, Story placed his ear under the control of another drunken man, and, without protest, permitted him to attain a speed of from 20 to 25 miles an hour at the time Jarvis was struck. If a jury may not find criminal carelessness from such conduct, it is difficult to pereeife what conduct would justify . such a finding. And such is the view of other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In Com. v. Sherman, 191 Mass. 439, 78 N. E. 98, Sherman had been complained against for driving a car in excess of the speed limit. Under the agreed statement of facts, the car was being driven by a chauffeur, and Sherman was one of several persons sitting in the tonneau. The appeal was from the refusal of the trial court to rule that, upon the agreed facts, the defendant could not be convicted. In sustaining this action the appellate court said: \u201cIn our opinion those facts warranted the inference that the owner knew and allowed his vehicle to be illegally run. The ease so made out is a prima facie case only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">In Ex parte Liotard, 47 Nev. 169, 217 P. 960, 30 A. L. R. 63, Liotard, with another, had been charged with manslaughter, in that, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, they so operated an automobile as to strike and Mil another person. It appeared that the ear belonged to Liotard, and at the moment of the occurrence was being operated by the codefendant, with Liotard on the running board. The court said: \u201cWhile it does not appear that petitioner gave Krites [the codefendant] instructions to operate the car, it is an undisputed fact that the petitioner was present while Krites was at the wheel and while the engine was in action. Krites admits that he was at the wheel at the time of the tragedy. He was in control of the car by consent of the petitioner. Petitioner was chargeable with knowledge of Krites\u2019 condition. No one would contend that the owner of a ear would not be liable for injuries resulting from \u25a0his operating it while intoxicated. How, then, can he escape the consequence when he sits by and permits another, who is intoxicated, to operate it? * * * One who is so careless of the rights of others as to use a dangerous instrumentality while incapacitated by drink, or who permits others to do so, as here shown, invites the consequences. He must pay the penalty.\u201d See, also, Reg. v. Longbottom, 3 Cox C. C. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">In People v. Scanlon, 132 App. Div. 528, 117 N. Y. S. 57, relied upon by appellant, a chauffeur and the owner of the ear had been convicted of manslaughter. The tragedy was the result of driving too close to a vehicle in passing it. The conviction was sustained as to the chauffeur, but reversed as to the owner; the court saying: \u201cIf it were the chauffeur\u2019s habit to run so close to other ears as to cause danger, and Albro [the owner] knew it, without correcting it, he might be held liable for this negligence; but there is not one word of evidence to the effect that this was the habit of the chauffeur, and Albro\u2019s conviction must rest upon his failure within a second of time to give directions, which could not even be comprehended and acted upon, if given, in time to have avoided the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">There was no abuse of discretion by the-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>trial court in refusing to grant a severance, requested by appellant, as the joint character \u2022of the acts of O\u2019Connor and Story rendered a joint, trial peculiarly appropriate, and a severance might have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. While the charge of the \u2022court apparently was satisfactory to counsel .at the time it was given, some fault now is found with it. We have examined this charge with care, and find that it fully and fairly states the law of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Finding no error in the record, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
