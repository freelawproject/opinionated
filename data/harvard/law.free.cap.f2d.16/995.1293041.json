St. \u00a7 6336%g. The loss of $1,252 in question here is charged to have been sustained in an expenditure to repair the damage done to plaintiff\u2019s automobile by its overturning while \u201cin the unlawful and unauthorized possession of plaintiff\u2019s chauffeur.\u201d It is charged that the loss by this \u201ccasualty originated in the theft and unauthorized use of plaintiff\u2019s automobile, which constituted larceny under the laws of New York, and the overturning of said automobile was caused by the icy condition of the road resulting from storms and freezing.\u201d The complaint sought recovery of $300.48 taxes paid because of the disallowance of this deduction; judgment on the pleadings was rendered on defendant\u2019s motion, on the ground that no cause of action was set forth. The only question before us is whether the phrase \u201cother casualty\u201d in the act covers this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Plaintiff contends that under U. S. v. Mescall, 215 U. S. 26, 30 S. Ct. 19, 54 L. Ed. 77, the rul\u00e9 of ejusdem generis is not applicable in the construction of this section of the act, because the words \u201cother casualty\u201d were not in the original act of 1913, or in the acts <em>of </em>1867, 1870, and 1894, but were inserted after \u201cshipwreck\u201d for the first time in the act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756). We find it unnecessary, however, to determine whether, in and of itself, this would suffice to \u25a0obviate the application of the doctrine, and thus to give the deduction in every case of damage due to any casualty; that is, to any serious accident or disaster, due to causes external to the owner, because in our judgment an automobile wreck may be, and under this complaint was, a casualty in closest analogy to a shipwreck, a casualty clearly ejusdem generis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">Officials of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, however, in construing a like statutory provision in the act of 1918 and later acts, have held that \u201cother casualty\u201d must be some act of nature analogous to storms or fire due to natural causes, and not to some casualty due to- negligent collisions, even though such a casualty may be analogous to some kinds of shipwreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">Whatever the effect of the departmental interpretation of the later act of 1918 may be on the construction of the same clause re-enacted by still later legislation, it cannot operate retroactively; we are here concerned with rights under the act of 1916. The later views of the department as to the meaning of this act can be at the best but persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">We find no basis, however, in the words or history of the act for such a limitation; on the contrary, as \u201ccasualty\u201d expresses rather the result than the cause of the damage, that is, the wreck itself rather than the lightning, storm, or the negligence or fault of some person, so the \u201cother casualty\u201d is at least as clearly ejusdem generis with shipwreck as with fire or storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">Shipwreck does not mean complete loss; damage to the ship suffices. Nor need such damage, be caused by storms or other natural causes; the word is without limitation; a wreck through collision, whether due to the wrong or negligence of the other vessel or of the employee of the wrecked ship, is a shipwreck within the act. Furthermore the ship may be a pleasure yacht, in no way connected with a trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">An automobile used for recreation and convenience would seem to be most closely analogous to a pleasure yacht. As Congress has made damages due to a wreck of the latter a deductible loss, the act should be construed to show an intent to cover a wreck to the former, similarly caused, inasmuch as such a construction can fairly and reasonably be given thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">Whether the complaint be interpreted as charging the loss to be due proximately to the overturning caused by the faulty driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>ing of the chauffeur over an icy road, or to subsequent freezing of the motor, in any event, it is alleged to be due to a casualty, analogous to a shipwreck, not caused by the willful act or neglect of the owner, or of one acting in his behalf. We conclude that such a loss is deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
