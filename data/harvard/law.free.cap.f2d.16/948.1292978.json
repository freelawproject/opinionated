The act is similar in phrase to that referred to in New York &amp; Cuba Mail Steamship Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 945, decided this day. The construction of the statute we applied in that ease is applicable here. It results in our holding that the court did not err in allowing interest on the legal damages. The amount has been stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-21\">The decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
