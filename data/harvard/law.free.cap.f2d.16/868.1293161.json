St. \u00a7\u00a7 6287g-6287q) by selling 150 grains of opium, and the second count charged that on the same day they violated the Jones-Miller Narcotie Aet (42 Stat. 596) by willfully, etc., receiving, concealing, buying, selling, and facilitating the transportation and concealment after importation of two packages of morphine and three packages and two capsules of cocaine which they knew had been imported into the United States contrary to law. The defendant Hooper was found guilty on both counts. Haanstra was found guilty only on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">The defendant Hooper presents to this court the single contention that section 2 of Aet Feb. 9, 1909, as amended by section 1, subdivision (f), of the Jones-Miller Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 8801) was insufficient to contain all the elements of the crime charged, and that it was necessary to prove affirmatively that the narcotics had been unlawfully imported and adduce evidence that the drug was in fact imported. The constitutionality of that provision of the law was sustained in Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U. S. 178, 45 S. Ct. 470, 69 L. Ed. 904. It is argued that the decision in that ease is not controlling here, for the reason that the court held only that the possession of smoking opium might lawfully sustain a presumption of unlawful importation, and it is contended that the section has no application to a case such as this which involves narcotic drugs other than smoking opium for the reason that morphine and cocaine may lawfully be imported under certain regulations, whereas the importation of smoking opium is absolutely prohibited. We find no ground for the alleged distinction. The presumption of unlawful importation may attach in either ease, for it is a prima facie presumption only, leaving with the accused the burden of proving lawful possession. Ng Sing v. United States (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 919; Rosenberg v. United States (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">The defendant Haanstra contends that the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Aet is unconstitutional, and he relies upon the fact that, while in United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86, 39 S. Ct. 214, 63 L. Ed. 493, the majority of the court held the aet constitutional, the finality of that decision was questioned in United States v. Daugherty, 269 U. S. 360, 46 S. Ct. 156, 70 L. Ed. 309, where it was intimated that more recent decisions of the court might thereafter necessitate a review of that question. But as yet there has been no such review, and we are bound by the decision in the Doremus Case. Its conclusiveness was recognized in Teter v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 224, of which decision it is to be noted that the Supreme Court has denied eertiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">Haanstra moved.the-court for an instructed verdict of acquittal, and he now insists that there was no evidence to sustain his complicity in the offense charged. Jourdin, a narcotic agent of the Revenue Service, testified that at an agreed time and place he and an informant were present to purchase morphine from Hooper; that the two defendants drove by, turned the corner and stopped, and Hooper got out of the machine and had a conversation with the informant after which the defendants drove away; that on the following evening, the witness having gone to a certain designated comer, Hooper drove up and said to him, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d to which he answered, \u201cHalf an ounce of morphine;\u201d that Hooper said, \u201cAll right, stay here;\u201d that Hooper drove away, and shortly thereafter came back and took the witness into his auto, and drove around one or two blocks; that the witness gave Hooper $32.50 for the morphine; that they came to a point where Hooper parked his machine right behind the machine of Haan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>stra; that Hooper walked over to tlie latter and had some conversation, with him, and then returned to his own machine and drove around a few more blocks, finally returning to the point where Haanstra\u2019s machine was parked; that Hooper told the witness, \u201cGo over and get in that machine;\u201d that the witness went to Haanstra\u2019s machine, the door of which Haanstra opened for him to enter; that there was another man in the machine with Haanstra; that, while driving around, Haanstra appeared very nervous; that at one time Haanstra said, \u201cThat looks like Mr. Elliott and his wife; she usually goes with him,' \u25a0 sometimes to make cases\u201d (it was in the. evidence that Elliott was an inspector and that his wife did at times accompany him in his investigations); that at one time Haanstra turned the lights on the witness, observing, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a very good look at you,\u201d and then said, \u201cOh, yes,\u2018you used to buy from Curley;\u201d that Haanstra, when he stopped his machine, kept the motor running;' that he became impatient at Hooper\u2019s \u2018delay; that Haanstra said, \u201cWell, he must h'ave blew a tire or something; of course, the first thing you think of is a knock-over\u201d (a phrase which meant an arrest); that the other man in the ear said to Haanstra, \u201cI think I will go home and you bring it up to me;\u201d, that Haanstra said, \u201cNo; if he don\u2019t cbme, pretty soon, I will go and weigh it up myself;\u201d that shortly thereafter Hooper appeared and blew his horn, to which Haanstra answered with his horn; that Hooper left a clearance of some feet between his machine and Haanstra\u2019s, and Haanstra said to the witness,. \u201cAll right, get out;\u201d that tlie witness got out, and Hooper walked up, placed his hands in his overcoat pocket, and, delivering the package of narcotics, said, \u201cHere;: get out; &lt;beat it;\u201d that, as Hooper started to enter his machine, the witness attempted to arrest him, but that Hooper broke away; that the witness shouted to Haanstra to stop, declaring that he was a federal officer, but that Haanstra made a rapid flight down the street. As indicating Haanstra\u2019s participation in the offense charged, the testimony amounted to more than suspicious circumstances. If credited by- the jury, as it evidently was, it was sufficient to sustain the charge; and it was doubtless, strengthened rather than weakened by Haanstra\u2019s denial of the incriminating portions thereof. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We find no error.
