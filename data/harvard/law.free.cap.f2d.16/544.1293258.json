The case turns upon the sufficiency of the testimony to establish prior use by appellee company during the period named.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">It is unnecessary for us to review the testimony of the witnesses on this point. It was'held sufficient by the various tribunals below to conclusively establish prior use of the mark by appellee company. A careful review of the record convinces us that this conclusion is correct. To hold otherwise would require us to discredit a number of witnesses, whose testimony we.think is entitled to belief. In this view of the case, we are convinced that the Commissioner was right in rejecting the registration of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
