Davis copied the claim from the Robinson patent into his application, which was not filed until March 20, 1922, or about 20 months' after \u25a0 the issue of the Robinson patent. The case turns wholly on issues of fact, and under the rule of evidence applied in such eases a' heavy burden is placed upon Davis in proving priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The record is a rather interesting one, and we have examined it with care, supplemented by the able briefs of counsel. In the elaborate opinions of the various tribunals of the Patent Office, the case has been reviewed at length, and in each instance priority was awarded to Davis. While the case is a close one, in view of a question of originality involved, we are of opinion that the conclusion thus reached is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Inasmuch as the testimony has been reviewed in detail by the tribunals below, and especially in the able opinion rendered by the Board of Examiners in Chief, in which we fully concur, further consideration' here would amount merely to repetition.'</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
