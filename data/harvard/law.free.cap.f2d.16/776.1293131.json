St. \u00a7 10385) of knowingly causing a letter to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon for the purpose of executing an alleged scheme to defraud may be made and tried in the district of the delivery, as well as that \u00f3f the deposit of the letter. Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 44 S. Ct. 519, 68 L. Ed. 989. It follows that the first-mentioned ground on which the order appealed from is challenged is not a tenable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-19\">Neither the Fifth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution' entitles one to be tried for a criminal offense in the district where he resides. Under section 42 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 1024) a criminal offense begun in one district and completed in another is cognizable in either, and the statute (R. S. \u00a7 1014 [Comp. St. \u00a7 1674]), providing for the removal of the accused from the district where he is to the district where the offense is to be tried, leaves the court no room to make an exception where Congress has made none, though the accused is subjected to the hardship of being taken from his home, rather than the victims of the crime charged being taken from theirs. Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462, 473, 30 S. Ct. 249, 54 L. Ed. 569, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112; Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 363, 32 S. Ct. 793, 56 L. Ed. 1114, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614; Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 25 S. Ct. 760, 50 L. Ed. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-20\">Where a criminal offense is cognizable in more than one district, it is not a function of a court to select the district in which the charge is to be made and prosecuted, and it is not an oppression in law, nor a deprivation of due process of law, for the prosecuting officials to select a district other than that of the accused\u2019s residence, though that district might have been selected. Haas v. Henkel, supra. Were tfip government attempting to prosecute in both places, a question might arise as to whether it should be required to elect between them; but that question is not presented, as there was no attempt to prosecute the appellant in more than one place. Salinger v. Loisel, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-21\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
