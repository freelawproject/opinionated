St. \u00a7 6309%a), on certain of appellee\u2019s manufactures, alleged to be \u201cslot machines of the exclusively gambling type,\u201d known as \u201coperator\u2019s bells\u201d and \u201ctraders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">One of appellee\u2019s contentions is that \u201cthe exaction demanded was not a tax,\u201d but it admits that, if it was a tax, the court was, by reason of section 3224 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. \u00a7 5947), without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-24\"> Its main reliance, it says, is upon Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557, 42 S. Ct. 549, 66 L. Ed. 1061, which was followed by this court in Jakovich v. Mager, 283 F. 980. The question in the Lipke Case arose under section 35 of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 10138%v). Section 35 and paragraph 5, section 900, supra, are so different in language and purpose that we are of opinion that in the light of the Lipke Case it clearly appears that any exaction under the latter section must be for a tax, and not for a penalty. In fact, appellee makes no argument to show that any exactions leviable under paragraph 5, section 900, are not taxes but seems to concede that fact. It contends that slot machines alleged to be \u201cof the exclusively gambling type\u201d do not come within the language of that paragraph and section, or within any other section of the Revenue Act of 1918, and the whole argument seems to be intended to support appellee\u2019s urge that if an exaction is not authorized by some statute, even though the taxing authorities believe it to be so, its collection may be enjoined in equity. We held to the contrary in Peacock v. Reinecke, 3 F.(2d) 583, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-25\">The decree should be and is reversed, with directions to the District Court to vacate the injunction and, dismiss the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
