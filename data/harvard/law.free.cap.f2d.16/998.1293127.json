The answer denied none of the allegations of the complaint, but alleged that the action had not been begun within five years after the time when the tax became due, or before the passage of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227).</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1026-17\">The ease was heard on agreed facts, as follows: The summons was issued on November 22,1921, and on the same day lodged in the marshal\u2019s hands for service. It was served on November 29, 1921, and the complaint was filed on.

We have been unable to see the significance of the defendant\u2019s argument that the limitation in section 250 (d) is upon the right, and not upon the remedy, and that it \u201cis jurisdictional in its character.\u201d That the section is a statute of limitations appeal\u2019s to us too plain for argument, and we are as much compelled to determine when the action is \u201cbegun,\u201d if the limitation be upon the right, as if it be upon the remedy. As a statute of limitations it appears to us that it must be read as such statutes always have been, especially as we can see no difference in meaning between the word \u201cbegun,\u201d here chosen, and the usual word, \u201ccommenced,\u201d or the phrase, \u201ccommenced and sued,\u201d of the statute of James I (1623).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">It has been the general, if not the uniform, interpretation of statutes of limitation, that the action is commenced at least as soon as the writ, after issuance, has been lodged in the sheriff\u2019s hand for service. Brown v. Babbington, 2 Ld. Raymond, 880; Harris v. Woolford, 6 Term Rep. 617; Parsons v. King, 7 Term Rep. 6; Bell v. Ohio, etc., Co., Fed. Cas. No. 1,260; Burdick v. Green, 18 Johns. (N. Y.) 14; Jackson v. Brooks, 14 Wend. (N. Y.) 649; Day v. Lamb, 7 Vt. 426; McCracken v. Richardson, 46 N. J. Law, 50; Mason v. Cheney, 47 N. H. 24; Johnson v. Farwell, 7 Greenl. (7 Me.) 370, 22 Am. Dec. 203; Wood on Limitations, vol. 2, p. 570. The question is now generally expressly covered by statute, as it is in New York. Section 17 of the Civil Practice Act. Indeed, the best modern instances are those of suits in equity, which accept the statute of limitation by analogy from actions at law. Here it is the usual rule that the issuance of subpoena, after bill filed, and the lodgment of it for service in the sheriff\u2019s hands, tolls the statute. Linn <em>&amp; </em>Lane Timber Co., v. U. S., 236 U. S. 574, 35 S. Ct. 440, 59 L. Ed. 725; U. S. v. American Lumber Co., 85 F. 827 (C. C. A. 9); U. S. v. Miller (C. C.) 164 F. 444; International Paper Co. v. Commonwealth, 232 Mass. 7, 121 N. E. 510. The mere filing of the hill is at times enough, Armstrong Cork Co. v. Merchants\u2019 Refrigerating Co., 184 F. 199 (C. C. A. 8), following the Missouri statute. Why a different rule should apply to this statute we cannot see. This result is quite independent of section 17 of the New York Practice Act, which does no more than codify the prevailing construction of statutes of limitation which had preceded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Strictly, the ease does not involve the question whether the section should have a uniform meaning, wherever the action is brought, or whether the time when it is \u201cbegun\u201d is to be determined by the local law. In either ease the statute was tolled in the ease at bar, though so far as we can see, Goldenberg v. Murphy, 108 U. S. 162, 2 S. Ct. 388, 27 L. Ed. 686, is fiat for the second view, and rules. The defendant by way of distinction suggests that that was a removed suit, and that the court overlooked the jurisdictional point. But the limitation of the statute there at bar applied equally in whatever court the suit was brought, and, as we have just said, the supposed jurisdictional question had nothing to do with its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded, with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff on the agreed facts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
