During his brief life, Shamar was intermittently a patient at Montefiore Medical Center for treatments which gave rise to claims for negligence and which were ultimately settled for $240,000 for his conscious pain and suffering. Shamar\u2019s mother, Deirdre Wright, commenced a paternity proceeding against Franklin Salkey who, once a paternity test established that he was the biological father, finally admitted that he was Shamar\u2019s father on November 8, 1996. Salkey never made any support payments other than in the form of claimed cash payments to Wright or the babysitting services of his sister. Salkey did not assume responsibility for and made no contribution to Shamar\u2019s medical bills, funeral costs, headstone or coffin. Salkey did not claim that he paid rent, utility bills, or for any other items required for Shamar. Salkey alleged that he came into contact with Shamar when he visited Wright. He does not appear to have been involved in any decision whatsoever involving the circumstances of Shamar\u2019s brief life. Salkey signed a waiver and consent on February 5, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Wright petitioned the Surrogate\u2019s Court for leave to settle Shamar\u2019s wrongful death claims. She claimed that, based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>EPTL 4-1.4, Salkey was disqualified from receiving any share of the proceeds since he had failed or refused to support Shamar. She also submitted the waiver and consent signed by Salkey in which he waived his rights to any settlement proceeds and consented to their distribution to Wright. The Surrogate denied Wright\u2019s application to deem the waiver valid and ordered a trial based upon objections filed by Salkey. Salkey alleged that he had in fact supported Shamar and had been misled into signing the waiver and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">With respect to Salkey\u2019s execution of the waiver and consent, he bears an initial burden of articulating a claim of good cause to set aside the waiver based on \u201c \u2018fraud, collusion, mistake, accident, or some other ground of the same nature\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Frutiger, </em>29 NY2d 143, 150, quoting <em>Campbell v Bussing, </em>274 App Div 893). Salkey chose not to read the waiver and consent thus he chose to forego any questions about the document and the consequences of his signature. There is no indication that Wright lied or actively misled Salkey about the waiver\u2019s meaning or effect. Salkey has simply failed to meet his initial burden to demonstrate that there is any material fact in dispute regarding the execution of his waiver and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Regarding Salkey\u2019s claims that he provided support to or on behalf of Shamar, Salkey submitted insufficient proof. Until two weeks before Shamar\u2019s death, Salkey denied paternity. While Wright specifically denied receiving any support from Salkey, his allegations of providing cash to Wright are vague and unsubstantiated. Salkey is unable to explain with any detail what support he provided Shamar with the sole exception of money provided to his sister who babysat the infant, as to which there is no affidavit from the sister. Salkey\u2019s conclusory statements are insufficient to create an issue of fact as to whether he provided support <em>(Matter of Baecher, </em>198 AD2d 221). Concur \u2014 Sullivan, P. J., Nardelli, Wallach, Lerner and Buckley, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
