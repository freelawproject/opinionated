Decedent was found dead, asphyxiated by gas, in his place of employment. The evidence is that his body was found within, or partly within a large bake oven, in his employer\u2019s japanning plant, to which its supply of gas had been partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>turned on. The evidence and allowable inferences therefrom were such as to support the findings that appellants\u2019 proofs failed to overcome the statutory-presumption against suicide (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 21), and that the death was causally related to the employment.

All concur.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p>No opinion found. <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/pdf/2744364/Claim%20of%20Hughes%20v.%20Covert%20Manufacturing%20Co..pdf\">Click here to view source material.</a></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
