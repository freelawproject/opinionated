Equities v Mind Over Money, </em>261 AD2d 510; <em>RVC Assocs. v Farkas, </em>261 AD2d 383; <em>O\u2019Brien v O\u2019Brien, </em>258 AD2d 446). In opposition, the defendant failed to submit proof in admissible form sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact concerning his allegations that he was fraudulently induced to execute the promissory note (see, <em>J.L.B. Equities v Mind Over Money, supra). </em>Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the complaint. O\u2019Brien, J. P., Ritter, Sullivan and Smith, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
