At trial, the government submitted evidence and testimony establishing that Pedron\u2019s neighbor had provided amphetamines, which the neighbor allegedly obtained from Pedron, to agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), and that those amphetamines had the same purity level, unusual color, and markings as amphetamines found in Pedron\u2019s vehicle at the time of Pedron\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">In defense, Pedron argued that he was set up by his neighbor, who was attempting to force Pedron and Pedron\u2019s family to vacate their home, which had been purchased in the neighbor\u2019s name but with Pedron\u2019s money. Pedron claimed that his neighbor had attempted to interfere with Pedron\u2019s enjoyment of his home by rerouting his mail. As part of that defense, Pedron\u2019s counsel subpoenaed two postal employees, but allegedly failed to comply with various federal regulations required to subpoena federal employees. The postal employees purportedly would have testified that Pedron\u2019s wife had filed complaints about their mail being diverted to the neighbor\u2019s home. At trial, Pedron\u2019s wife testified about the problems with the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">. Pedron also testified in his own defense. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Pedron asserts that his counsel did not inform him of his rights regarding his decision to testify, including that he had the right to choose not to testify in his own defense, that he alone had the right to decide whether or not to testify, and that the jury was not allowed to consider his failure to testify. The government submitted a declaration in which Pedro\u2019s counsel stated that he did not remember the conversation exactly, but that he was sure that he had discussed Pe-dron\u2019s rights about the decision to testify with him and that they had come to a mutual agreement on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">The district court denied Pedron\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, finding that his counsel was not ineffective as to the postal witnesses because Pedron did not cite the specific regulations counsel failed to follow, and because Pedron did not establish that there was a reasonable probability that, if the postal witnesses had testified, the outcome of the trial would have been, different. The district court also concluded that Pedron did not establish that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if he had not testified. The court, however, granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to whether Pedron\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>was ineffective for either (1) failing to follow the federal regulations required to subpoena the postal employees, or (2) failing to advise Pedron about his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). We accord \u201csubstantial deference to the fact finder ... in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (ellipses in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Courts need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Under the first prong, the defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. The defendant bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable by establishing \u201cthat particular and identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of a counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and we apply a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and that counsel made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conduct an objective inquiry into the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, such that \u201ca petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. We evaluate counsel\u2019s effectiveness based on counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Under the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must establish prejudice by showing a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A \u201creasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must affirmatively prove prejudice because attorney errors are as likely to be \u201cutterly harmless\u201d as they are to be prejudicial. <em>Gilreath v. Head, </em>234 F.3d 547, 551 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err by determining that Pedron\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to comply with federal regulations in order to subpoena the postal employees, as those witnesses\u2019 purported testimony would have been duplica-tive of by Pedron\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony. Moreover, Pedron cannot show prejudice to the outcome of the proceedings because there was ample evidence for the jury to convict Pedron on all counts. The government showed that the DEA agents found amphetamine pills and cocaine both on Pe-dron\u2019s person and in his vehicle at the time of the arrest, and that those amphetamine pills matched the pills Pedron\u2019s neighbor provided to the DEA agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">A defendant can bring an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>attorney\u2019s failure to inform him fully about his right to testify. <em>See Gallego v. United States, </em>174 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.1999). When counsel does not inform the defendant of his right to testify and that the final decision belongs to the defendant alone, the defendant has not received reasonably effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Here, we conclude from the record that that the district court did not err by determining that Pedron had not received ineffective assistance of counsel as to his right to testify. Although there was a factual dispute as to whether Pedron was informed of those rights, Pedron did not establish that he was prejudiced by the alleged failure because he did not state that he would have chosen not to testify, and there was sufficient evidence to convict him, regardless of whether he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Pedron\u2019s motion to vacate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
