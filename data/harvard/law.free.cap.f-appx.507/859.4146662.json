On appeal, Hood argues that the district court incorrectly applied a four-level firearms enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, if the offense involved 3 to 7 firearms, the offense level is increased by two levels, and if the offense involved 8 to 24 firearms, the offense level is increased by four levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) &amp; (B). \u201cFor purposes of calculating the number of firearms,\u201d the district court counts \u201conly those firearms that were unlawfully sought to be ob- \u25a0 tained, unlawfully possessed, or unlawfully distributed_\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 2K2.1, </em>cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">At sentencing, Defendant Hood admitted he actually possessed four firearms. On appeal, Hood maintains that the government failed to prove he possessed more than these ' four firearms, and thus he should have received only the two-level firearms enhancement ' under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-22\">Possession of a firearm may be either actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>To demonstrate constructive possession, the government must show that the defendant: (1) was aware or knew of the firearm\u2019s presence and (2) had- the ability and intent to later exercise dominion and control over that firearm. <em>Id. </em>The second element of constructive possession is satisfied if the defendant intended to exercise dominion and control of the gun through another. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Virciglio, </em>441 F.2d 1295, 1298 (5th Cir.1971) (finding ample evidence to support a jury\u2019s finding of constructive possession where defendant planned the sale of the gun and received the money for its purchase).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Here, undisputed factual allegations in Hood\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) established that Defendant Hood, a convicted felon, facilitated the sale of a. total of eleven firearms to a confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d) and an undercover detective (\u201cUC\u201d). <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that undisputed facts in the PSI are admitted for sentencing purposes). Specifically, on seven different days in March and April 2011, Hood contacted the CS and the UC and arranged to sell them one or more firearms. During these firearms transactions, the CS and the UC met with Hood and another person. While the other per-: son handed the firearm to the UC and the CS, Hood accepted the payment from the CS and the UC. Hood often referred to these individuals who handed over the firearms as his \u201cboys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Based on these undisputed facts, the district court found that Defendant Hood constructively possessed, and thus unlawfully distributed, the seven firearms delivered by his \u201cboys\u201d to the firearms transactions. Those seven, plus the four Hood admitted actually possessing, brought him over the eight firearm threshold under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B). Further,. the district court\u2019s finding of constructive possession is not clear error. Contrary to Hood\u2019s contention, he was not merely present at these firearms transactions. Hood arranged all the firearms transactions and accepted the money for the firearms, which is' sufficient to show constructiv\u00e9 possession. <em>See Virciglio, </em>441 F.2d at 1298. Accordingly, the district court did not err in counting all eleven firearms and applying the four-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">, We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Demurest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">.
