On appeal, Parker argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court, in discussing only the fact that he dismembered his mother\u2019s body after her death, failed to explain adequately its justification for the upward variance, and failed to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-20\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will not reverse a district court so long as the district court\u2019s ruling does not constitute a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to establish that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010). In reviewing a sentencing decision, we determine, first, whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d and second, whether the sentence was \u201csubstantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We must consider several factors to determine if a sentence is procedurally reasonable, including whether the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, improperly treated the guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain its chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If the district court determines that a sentence outside the guidelines range is appropriate, it should explain why the variance is appropriate and the \u201cjustification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">After determining that the sentence, is procedurally reasonable, this court must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence is substantively reasonable if, under the totality of the circumstances, it achieves the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). While the district court must provide a sufficiently compelling justification for the variance, this Court \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d. at 1187 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court will only reverse due to a variance if it has a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">We conclude from the record that Parker\u2019s 48-month sentence is reasonable. The district court committed no procedural error. The court sufficiently explained the reasoning behind the sentence imposed to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Furthermore, the court provided a sufficiently compelling justification for the upward variance. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187. The court explained that Parker\u2019s mutilation of his mother\u2019s body in order to continue receiving her social security checks after her death merited the upward variance. As to substantive unreasonableness, Parker argues that the district court improperly considered only two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, the court explicitly stated that it had considered all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>the sentencing factors in addition to the underlying facts of the case. The weight given to each \u00a7 3558(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Parker has not met his burden to show an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as procedurally. and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
