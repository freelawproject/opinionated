The government counters that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) cannot be used to modify Harris\u2019s sentence because, in calculating his guideline range and sentence, the sentencing judge considered the crack cocaine to be powder cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-23\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope .of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u2022\u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). We review the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence based upon \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2011). However, when the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by the retroactively applicable guideline amendment, the district court does not have authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Here, in anticipation of a change in the guidelines which would modify the discrepancy between crack and powder cocaine sentences, the sentencing judge treated the crack cocaine attributable to Harris as powder cocaine for sentencing purposes. The result was that Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and related amendments, do not actually lower the guideline range relied upon by the district court in Harris\u2019s case. Indeed, because the sentencing judge treated crack cocaine the same as powder cocaine, Harris\u2019s sentence was calculated on a lower base offense level than it would have been had the amendments been in effect at the time of his sentencing. For these reasons, we cannot say that Amendment 750, or any other amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, actually lowered the guideline range in Harris\u2019s case. As a result, the district court did not err by concluding that Harris was not eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-25\">. Harris\u2019s motion before the district court sought relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although Harris only cites to \u00a7 3582(c) in his appellate brief, we assume he continues to seek relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ALu\">. The government further argues that even if \u00a7 3582(c)(2) applied,- it would not reduce Harris's sentence because his 168-month sentence was 94 months below the bottom of his advisory guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
