She argues the district court erred by determining it lacked authority to reduce her sentence because she had been sentenced as a career offender. She asserts, under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), she is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court varied from the career offender guidelines and instead based her sentence on the unenhanced guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If a defendant is a career offender, her base offense level is generally determined under the career offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. As such, a retroactive amendment to the drug quantity table at \u00a7 2D1.1 does not have the effect of lowering her career offender-based guideline range within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and district courts are not authorized to reduce a sentence on that basis. <em>See id. </em>at 1327-28,1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court decided a case involving a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), in which the defendant entered a plea agreement that recommended a particular sentence. <em>Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2690. In Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence, she determined that the defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582, because the express terms of his plea agreement based his sentence on a guideline sentencing range applicable to the charged offense. <em>Id. </em>at 2695. As such, the term of imprisonment in such a scenario is \u201cbased on\u201d the range set by the Sentencing Guidelines, and a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582 if that range is subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 2695-2700. We recently held in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit because it was not overruled by <em>Freeman, </em>as <em>Freeman </em>did not address defendants whose total offense level was calculated according to the career offender provision. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The district court properly denied King\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) request because she was sentenced as a career offender, so Amendment 750 did not lower her applicable guideline range. We held in <em>Moore, </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Lawson, </em>that defendants sentenced as career offenders are not eligible for reductions pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. Moreover, although the district court varied downward from the enhanced guideline range, it did so pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, such that the possible exception identified in <em>Moore </em>does not apply. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying King\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
