We find that the district court did not err in finding no evidence of a policy or custom giving rise to \u00a7 1983 municipal liability and, accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">Raymond began working, as a juvenile probation officer for the Ector County Youth Center (\u201cthe Center\u201d) in 1998. In October 2009, Raymond married Carl Raymond, who had been convicted of sexual misconduct involving a fifteen-year-old girl in 2005. At the time of their marriage, Raymond knew that her husband was required to register as a sex offender because of his 2005 conviction. After their marriage, Raymond allowed her husband to enter the Center on at least three occasions without notifying her employer that Mr. Raymond was on the premises or that Mr. Raymond was a registered sex offender. Although Raymond alleges that her husband had no contact with any juveniles at the Center, Louis Serrano, Director of Juvenile Services for Ector County, testified that he had observed Mr. Raymond unaccompanied at the Center on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>After learning of Mr. Raymond\u2019s sex offender status through an annual review of sex offenders\u2019 places of residence, Serrano met with Raymond on March 3, 2010 to discuss her husband. During the meeting, Raymond admitted that she was aware of Mr. Raymond\u2019s sex offender status. On March 5, 2010, after consultation with the Center\u2019s assistant director and Raymond\u2019s direct supervisor, Serrano terminated Raymond\u2019s employment. According to Serrano, the decision to fire Raymond was based on her poor professional judgment in allowing a sex offender into the Center and Serrano\u2019s belief that such judgment presented a risk to the Center\u2019s juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Raymond filed suit against the County under \u00a7 1983, alleging that the County terminated her employment in retaliation for exercising her First Amendment right to associate with her husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 19, 2012, the County moved for summary judgment on Raymond\u2019s claims and the district court granted the motion on May 15. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">This- court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>LeClerc v. Webb, </em>419 F.3d 405, 413 (5th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving par7 ty can show that \u201cthere is. no genuine dispute as to any material. fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).' Although the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u201cUnsubstantiated assertions, improbable infer-' enees, and unsupported speculation are not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Brown v. City of Houston, </em>337 F.3d 539, 541 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">A municipality may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,\u201d causes a constitutional violation. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Thus, to prevail in a \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim, a plaintiff must show the following three elements: \u201ca policymaker; an official policy; and a violation of constitutional \u2022 rights whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is the policy or custom.\u201d <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Because it requires an official policy promulgated by an authorized policymaker, \u201c[m]unicipal liability cannot be sustained under a theory of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d Rivera v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>349 F.3d 244, 247 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Flores v. Cameron Cnty., </em>92 F.3d 258, 263 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1996) (\u201c[A] local government may not be held liable under \u00a7 1988 for the unconstitutional acts of its non-policymaking employees.To determine whether a municipal official is a policymaker, we look to state law to assess whether the official had \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d over the activity at issue. <em>McMillian v. Monroe Cnty., </em>520 U.S. 781, 786, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997); <em>Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>7 F.3d 1241, 1245 (5th Cir.1993). Furthermore, \u201cpolicymaking authority \u2018may be granted directly by a legislative enactment or may be delegated by an official who possesses such authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flores, </em>92 F.3d at 269 (quoting <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 483, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986) (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">An \u201cofficial policy\u201d may arise either directly from an authorized policymaker\u2019s \u201cstatement, ordinance, regulation, or decision,\u201d or indirectly from a \u201cpersistent, widespread practice\u201d of non-policymaking municipal employees that \u201cis so common and well settled as to constitute a custom.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Slidell, </em>735 F.2d 861, 862 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc) (per curiam). With respect to direct policymaker action, a single discretionary action taken by a policy-making official does not establish an official policy unless the official is \u201cresponsible for establishing final government policy\u201d with respect to the discretionary action taken. <em>Brady v. Fort Bend Cnty., </em>145 F.3d 691, 699 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Pembaur, </em>475 U.S. at 483, 106 S.Ct. 1292). With respect to official policy arising from custom, \u201c[i]solated violations are not the persistent, often repeated, constant violations, that constitute custom\u201d and \u201c[a] customary municipal policy cannot ordinarily be inferred from single constitutional violations.\u201d <em>Piotrowski, </em>237 F.3d at 581 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In this case, Raymond asserted that the County\u2019s alleged constitutional violation arose directly from the decision of an official policymaker, namely, Lou Serrano. <em>See </em>PL Compl. 4. Accordingly, the district court viewed Raymond\u2019s claim as asserting only direct policymaker action, rather than unauthorized custom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Observing that Texas law dictates that the County\u2019s Juvenile Board, alone, is responsible for establishing county employment policies, the district court concluded that Serrano, \u201cwhile apparently possessing discretion to hire and fire employees, was not a decision maker possessing final authority to establish municipal [employment] policy.\u201d R. 218 (citing 37 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 341.3(a) (\u201cThe juvenile board shall adopt written personnel policies.\u201d); Tex. Hum. Res.Code Ann. \u00a7 142.002(a) (describing authority of juvenile board to employ probation officers and other personnel); 37 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 341.2(a)(2) (\u201cThe juvenile board shall specify the responsibilities and functions of the juvenile probation department as well as the authority, responsibility, and function of the position of the chief administrative officer.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We agree that, although Serrano had discretionary power to terminate Raymond\u2019s employment, the Juvenile Board retained final policymaking authority over employment policies, and Raymond failed to show that the Board delegated this authority to Serrano. <em>See Flores, </em>92 F.3d at 269 (finding insufficient evidence that Juvenile Board delegated final policymaking authority over employee training to Chief Probation Officer because \u201cdiscretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>making decisions is not enough to establish policymaking authority\u201d); <em>see also Pemb-aur, </em>475 U.S. at 484 n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 1292 (noting that employee with \u201cdiscretion to hire and fire employees without also being the county official responsible for establishing county employment policy\u201d does not trigger municipal liability through discretionary decisions).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, because Serrano\u2019s decision to terminate Raymond was not an official policy originating from an authorized policymaker, the district court did not err in holding that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to Raymond\u2019s \u00a7 1988 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Because we conclude that Serrano was not a policymaker with respect to the County\u2019s employment policies, we need not reach the merits of Raymond\u2019s First Amendment freedom of association claim. Moreover, even if Serrano were a policymaker, and even if his decision to terminate Raymond were an official policy, we find that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Raymond, shows that Raymond\u2019s marital status was not the basis for her termination. To prevail in her First Amendment retaliation claim, Raymond must show that \u201c(1) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action, (2) [her] interest in \u2018associating' outweighed the [County\u2019s] interest in efficiency, and (3) [her] protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). Even if Raymond proves these three elements, the County can evade liability by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cthat it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Gerhart v. Hayes, </em>217 F.3d 320, 321 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">It is undisputed that Raymond, while working as a juvenile probation officer, allowed her husband, a registered sex offender previously convicted of criminal sexual conduct involving a fifteen-year-old girl, into the Center on at least three occasions without notifying her supervisors of her husband\u2019s sex offender status or his presence in the Center. R. 92, 104,107-8. Serrano claimed that the decision to terminate Raymond was based on 1) her poor professional judgment in bringing a registered sex offender into a youth facility and 2) the belief that Raymond\u2019s poor judgment could jeopardize the Center\u2019s \u201csafe environment.\u201d R. 83-84, 87-88. Although she asserts on appeal that \u201c[a] reasonable jury could find that Serrano used the marriage as a factor in [Raymond\u2019s] termination,\u201d Br. of Appellant 11, Raymond offers no evidence that her marriage, rather than her decision to allow her husband into the Center, was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in her termination. Furthermore, even if the record permits a reasonable juror to find that Raymond\u2019s marriage was a motivating factor, the evidence shows that, even if Raymond were <em>not </em>married to her husband, Serrano would have fired Raymond for allowing a sex offender into the Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>on three occasions without notifying her supervisors. <em>See, e.g., </em>37 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 845.310(c)(1) (\u201cJuvenile justice professionals shall ... serve each child with concern for the child\u2019s welfare....\u201d). Accordingly, even if Serrano were an authorized policymaker, the absence of evidence in the record showing that Serrano terminated Raymond based on her marital status entitles the County to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">. In addition to her First Amendment claim, Raymond alleged age discrimination and a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation. Raymond does not appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment on her age discrimination claim. With respect to the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on her Fourteenth Amendment claim, Raymond summarily states that \"[(Individual decisions in marriage, family relationships, procreation [sic] are protected liberty rights.\u201d Br. of Appellant 11. Even if this argument is sufficient to overcome a finding that Raymond has waived the issue on appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a), we agree with the district court that Raymond fails to allege facts that would give rise to a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation. None of the County's alleged actions interfered with Raymond's \"independence in making certain kinds of important decisions,\u201d such as, in this case, her decision to marry Mr. Raymond. <em>Zaffuto v. City of Hammond, </em>308 F.3d 485, 489 n. 4(5th Cir.2002). (quoting <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 599-600, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">. Furthermore, even if Raymond had argued the latter theory, she has failed to show any evidence that her termination resulted from a widespread unconstitutional practice, thus insulating the County from custom-based municipal liability. <em>See Piotrowski, </em>237 F.3d at 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">. Cited by Raymond, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Van Ooteghem v. Gray, </em>which held that a county treasurer's dismissal of an employee was \u201cofficial policy,\" is distinguishable from the present case because, under Texas law, the treasurer, as an elected official, had \"complete authority for the hiring and firing of personnel within the Treasury,\u201d not merely discretionary authority constrained by the employment policies of a supervisory board. 628 F.2d 488, 495 (5th Cir.1980), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>654 F.2d 304 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Brady, </em>145 F.3d at 699 (explaining that, because Texas sheriffs have unequivocal and unreviewable power under Texas law to fill employment positions, they are \"not merely granted discretion to hire and fire employees,\u201d and, instead, have final poli-cymaking authority).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
