We granted Taylor\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-14\">(1) Whether the district court\u2019s finding that Claims 5 and 21 were procedurally defaulted was correct, in light of \u25a0 the fact that the state court reviewed these claims on direct appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-15\">(2) Whether the state post-conviction court\u2019s procedural ruling as to Claims 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 of Taylor\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition rested on independent and adequate state grounds, and, accordingly, whether the district court\u2019s finding that these claims were procedurally defaulted on federal review was correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">On appeal, Taylor first argues that the district court erroneously determined that Claims 5 and 21 were procedurally defaulted because he raised those claims, in his brief on direct appeal in state court. Taylor next argues that Claims 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 were not procedurally barred because he raised those claims in his state petition for writ of habeas corpus, in which he raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, Taylor argues the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo.\u201d Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>568 F.3d 894, 907 (11th Cir.2009). Whether a claim is subject to the doctrine of procedural default is a mixed question of fact and law that we review <em>de novo. Greene v. Upton, </em>644 F.3d 1145, 1154 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1767, 182 L.Ed.2d 550 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">A state prisoner must have \u201cexhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\u201d unless \u201cthere is an absence of available State corrective process\u201d of \u201ccircumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect [his] rights.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). \u201cIt is well established that federal courts will not review questions of federal law presented in a habeas petition when the state court\u2019s decision rests upon a state-law ground that is independent of the federal question and. adequate to support the judgment.\u201d . <em>Cone v. Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 465, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 1780, 173 L.Ed.2d 701 (2009) (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhen a petitioner fails to raise his federal claims in compliance with relevant state procedural rules, the. state court\u2019s refusal to adjudicate the claim ordinarily qualifies as an independent and adequate state ground for denying federal review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe adequacy of the procedural bar is not a matter of state law, but is itself a federal question.\u201d <em>Doorbal v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>572 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">We apply the following three-part test to determine whether a state court decision rested upon an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d ground under state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">First, the last state court rendering a .judgment in the case must clearly and expressly state that it is relying on state-procedural rules to resolve the federal claim without reaching the merits of that claim. Secondly, the state court\u2019s decision must rest solidly on state law grounds, and may not be \u201cintertwined with an interpretation of federal law.\u201d Finally, the state procedural rule must be adequate; i.e., it must not be applied in an arbitrary or unprecedented fashion or be manifestly unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-15\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">We may affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Peoples v. Campbell, </em>377 F.3d 1208, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004) (determining that the district court erred in determining that an-ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally defaulted, but opting to decide the claim instead of remanding it to the district court for an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">I. Claims 5 and 21</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Our review of the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition is.governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Windom v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>578 F.3d 1227, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). Under the AEDPA\u2019s \u201chighly deferential standard for reviewing state court judgments,\u201d we may not grant habeas relief on claims previously adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state court adjudication resulted in' a decision that was \u201c(1) contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201cThe phrase \u2018clearly established Federal law1 refers to the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at' the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d <em>Walker v. Hadi, </em>611 F.3d 720, 723. (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>The district court concluded that Claims 5 and 21 were procedurally defaulted. This finding was error because the state appellate court addressed Claims 5 and 21 on the merits of the direct appeal. <em>See Parker v. Sec\u2019y for Dept. of Corr., </em>831 F.3d 764, 771 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cThis Court has further clarified that a federal claim is not barred on federal habeas review if the state courts actually reject a claim on the merits.\u201d). However, we may affirm the district court\u2019s .ruling for any grounds supported by the record, <em>see Peoples, </em>377 F.3d at 1235-36, and we proceed below to evaluate the merits of these claims. Because we conclude that Claims 5 and 21 fail on the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition with respect to these two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">A. Claim 5</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, he argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his proposed jury instruction on lost or abandoned property. He argues that, because his defense was that he found the stolen property on the side of the road after it had already been stolen, the jury should have been instructed on the Florida Statute\u2019s definition of \u201clost property\u201d and \u201cabandoned property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The inquiry by a habeas court in a due process challenge to jury instructions \u201cis not whether the challenged instructions were undesirable, erroneous, or even universally condemned,\u201d but rather, \u201cwhether the instructions so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Jamerson v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>410 F.3d 682, 690 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhere a requested jury instruction is already covered by the charges given, failure to give the requested charge is not error at all, much less constitutional error.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Wainwright, </em>740 F.2d 884, 885 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The district court did not err in not permitting Taylor\u2019s proposed jury instruction. With respect to Taylor\u2019s theft charge, the jury was specifically instructed that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Taylor \u201cknowingly, unlawfully\u201d obtained the property and that he did so with the \u201cintent to either temporarily or permanently deprive\u201d the owner of her right to the property or to appropriate it for his or another\u2019s use. Accordingly, if the jury believed Taylor\u2019s testimony at trial that he found this property on the ground after it had been stolen and that he believed that he was able to keep the property for himself, the jury was able to find that he was not guilty of theft because he did not \u201cknowingly, unlawfully\u201d obtain the property with the intent to deprive. <em>See id. </em>The state court\u2019s ruling on Claim 5 was not a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See Window, </em>578 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">B. Claim 21</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Taylor also argued in his \u00a7 2254 petition that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to strike an African American juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">In <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory strikes to preclude persons from serving on juries on account of their race violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The Court has established a three-step analysis in evaluating a <em>Batson </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 96-98,106 S.Ct. at 1722-24.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV1\">First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose. Second, once the defendant has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. Third, if a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide ... whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><em>Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 2416, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">At the second step, the court evaluates only the \u201cfacial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation,\u201d and unless a discriminatory intent is \u201cinherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (quotation omitted). The third step \u201cinvolves evaluating \u2018the persuasiveness of the justification\u2019 proffered by the prosecutor, but \u2018the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. 333, 338, 126 S.Ct. 969, 974, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006) (citation omitted). \u201c[A] federal habeas court can only grant [a habeas] petition if it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations for the <em>Batson </em>challenge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Here, during <em>voir dire, </em>the State used a peremptory challenge to strike an African American juror because the juror\u2019s brother was a police officer. Despite Taylor\u2019s objection that it was not a fair concern for the State that a juror knew someone in law enforcement, the trial court struck the juror. The trial court\u2019s determination that the State\u2019s proffered reason was genuinely race neutral was not unreasonable as an individual\u2019s understanding of the criminal justice system could be a reason that a prosecutor would not want that individual on the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 341-42, 126 S.Ct. at 976 (\u201cReasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor\u2019s credibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to supercede the trial court\u2019s credibility determination.\u201d). The state court\u2019s ruling on Claim 21 was not a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See Window, </em>578 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as to Claims 5 and 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">II. Claims 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">As an initial matter, we have \u201calready concluded that the procedural requirements of Florida\u2019s Rule 3.850 constitute independent and adequate state grounds under the applicable law.\u201d <em>LeCroy v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>421 F.3d 1237, 1260 n. 25 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Whiddon v. Dugger, </em>894 F.2d 1266, 1267-68 (11th Cir.1990)). In <em>LeCroy, </em>we held that because the petitioner did not raise his claim on direct appeal in the state court, \u201cthe State 3.850 Court\u2019s refusal to consider\u201d the petitioner\u2019s claim \u201cas procedurally barred rested on an independent and adequate state ground that precludes federal habeas consideration of this issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Because Taylor did not raise Claims 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 on direct appeal to the state court, the district court\u2019s determination that those claims were procedurally defaulted rested on an independent and adequate state ground. Taylor further argues that these claims were not procedurally defaulted because, in his state habeas petition, he argued that his counsel had been ineffective for failing to include these claims in Taylor\u2019s brief on direct appeal. However, this argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>without merit because, for purposes of exhaustion of state remedies, a substantive claim is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the substantive claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1260 n. 24; <em>see also Pietri v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of </em>Corr., 641 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1551, 182 L.Ed.2d 181 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.1</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
