Thomas, </em>145 Fed.Appx. 88, 89 (5th Cir.2005). After the guidelines applicable to cocaine base offenses were amended, Thomas\u2019s sentence of imprisonment was reduced, on February 19, 2009, to 168 months. When the guidelines were amended again, the district court entered an order, on November 2, 2011, granting Thomas\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence, but declining to reduce the sentence further. Thomas moved for reconsideration, arguing that the district court procedurally erred in granting the motion without modifying the sentence and that the district court had failed to provide reasons for denial. The district court denied the motion. Thomas gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">Thomas contends that the district court abused its discretion in issuing an order granting his motion for a reduction of his sentence that did not reduce his sentence; that the district court did not provide adequate reasons for its decision; and that the district court\u2019s decision violated his right to due process by making it impossible for him to respond to or address in a meaningful way the concerns of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">We review the district court\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). The district court is required to apply a two-step test in determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>It must first determine whether a reduction.is authorized. Id.'If it is, the court must then determine whether a modification is warranted by considering the applicable statutory sentencing factors, \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment,\u201d and, if appropriate, the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u2018When rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ing on a motion for modification of sentence, a district court need not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or articulate its reasoning for why the factors support its decision on the motion. But, it must consider them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">As in <em>Larry, </em>the district court in the instant case found, and the parties agree, that modification of Thomas\u2019s sentence was authorized by the amendment of the cocaine base guidelines following enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act.' Unlike <em>Larry, </em>Thomas had an opportunity to present argument in support of his contention that a modification of his sentence was warranted because he raised those arguments in his motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>632 F.3d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In denying the motion for reconsideration, the district court noted' that the 168-month sentence fell within the amended sentencing range. The court stated that it had reviewed the record and that it had determined again that no further reduction was \u201cwarranted\u201d and that the 168-month sentence was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Based on these statements, it may be inferred that' the district court considered the statutory sentencing factors and other relevant factors. <em>See id. </em>at 936-37; <em>see also United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009) (inferring from court\u2019s statement that \u201cno further reductions are warranted\u201d that district court understood it could grant a reduction and that it determin\u00e9d that none was warranted); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009) (inferring that factors were considered because it had defendant\u2019s arguments before it when it ruled). The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
