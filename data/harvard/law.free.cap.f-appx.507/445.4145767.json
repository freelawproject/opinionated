He argues that the district court erred in imposing a leadership sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The facts set forth in the Presentence Report (PSR) reflect that M\u00edreles recruited his codefendant, Ernesto Fierro, and gave him instructions concerning obtaining the cocaine from two unknown persons and delivering it to a confidential informant. Although M\u00edreles identified a witness who he stated could corroborate his allegation that Fierro was the actual leader or organizer of the conspiracy, the Government interviewed the witness and determined that the witness was not credible. Because M\u00edreles did not present any evidence to rebut the facts in the PSR, the district court was entitled to rely on those facts. <em>See United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173-74 (5th Cir.2002). Those facts support the district court\u2019s finding that M\u00edreles acted as a leader or organizer. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Giraldo, </em>111 F.3d 21, 24-25 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">M\u00edreles argues that the district court erred in not considering his statement for purposes of awarding a safety valve adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. At sentencing, the Government stated that M\u00edreles had not been truthful in his debriefing; that he attempted to minimize his role in the offense by alleging that Fierro was the actual leader or organizer; and that the information in Mireles\u2019s statement was not fruitful. Thus, the record supports the district court\u2019s determination that M\u00edreles was not entitled to the safety valve adjustment because he was not truthful with the Government in his debriefing and because the district court determined that he was a leader or organizer in the conspiracy. Therefore, M\u00edreles did not meet his burden to establish that he was entitled to the safety valve adjustment. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
