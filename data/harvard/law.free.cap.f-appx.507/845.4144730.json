In her petition, Ding argues that the BIA erred in denying her motion to reopen because the record shows that persecution of Christians in China has increased since the close of her removal proceedings. She also argues that the BIA failed to meaningfully explain why it refused to reopen her case in light of the fact that, in other unpublished decisions, the BIA has reopened allegedly similar cases. Additionally, Ding requests that her case be remanded to the BIA to consider whether it should exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen an immigration petition for abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). Generally, a motion to reopen must \u201cbe filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). An exception to the time and number limitations for a motion to reopen is available if the motion is for the purpose of reapplying for relief \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (same). \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">We have held that, at a minimum, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen on the following three grounds: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; or (3) a determination that an alien is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion despite statutory eligibility for relief. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ding\u2019s motion to reopen. First, Ding\u2019s motion was untimely. On April 16, 2009, the BIA dismissed Ding\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\u2014a decision which rendered final Ding\u2019s order for removal. Ding filed her motion to reopen on October 17, 2011. Because her motion was filed more than seventeen months after the final administrative order in her case, her motion was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (requiring motion to be filed within ninety days).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Second, Ding failed to establish changed circumstances in her home country, China. As the BIA found, the evidence submitted in support of Ding\u2019s motion to reopen did not sufficiently demonstrate material evidence about changed circumstances in China concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ing the treatment of Christians. The evidence in the record indicated that, prior to, and at the time of, Ding\u2019s 2009 hearing, the Chinese government subjected unregistered churches and their members to threats, repression, harassment, detention, and sometimes physical abuse, and that the degree of restrictions varied from region to region. The 2010 Country Report and the Religious Freedom Report do not establish that conditions changed in China with regard to the treatment of unregistered churches and their members. Instead, these reports indicate that the Chinese government \u201ccontinued to\u201d scrutinize, harass, and detain members of religious groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Additionally, the BIA did not err by failing to reopen Ding\u2019s case in light of its prior unpublished decisions. The BIA\u2019s unpublished decisions have no precedential value. <em>De la Rosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>579 F.3d 1327, 1336 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Matter of Zangwill, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 22, 27 (BIA 1981), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Ozlcok, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 546 (BIA 1988)). Moreover, based on the evidence in the record, Ding has failed to show that the facts and circumstances in the unpublished cases are actually similar to her case. We deny the petition insofar as it challenges the denial of Ding\u2019s motion to reopen removal proceedings based on changed country circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Next, we turn to whether we have the power to remand Ding\u2019s case to the BIA to consider whether it should exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen her case. We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The BIA at any time can reopen or reconsider on its own motion a case in which it has rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Ding\u2019s motion to reopen her removal proceedings was titled \u201cMotion to Reopen for Changed Country Conditions, <em>Sua Sponte </em>Jurisdiction and a Stay of Removal.\u201d Despite asserting <em>sua sponte </em>jurisdiction in the title of her motion, Ding did not argue in her motion before the BIA that it should reopen her proceeding pursuant to its <em>sua sponte </em>authority. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250 (\u201cAn issue or claim does not exist in isolation; rather, each is presented in the context of argument.\u201d). Because Ding failed to present any argument relating to the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen her proceedings, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies as to this claim for remand. We thus lack the power to entertain this claim. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition with regards to Ding's request for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
