We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred when it denied, without an evidentiary hearing, Diaz\u2019s claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and discover that Diaz\u2019s codefendant had lied to the government and wanted to exculpate Diaz, thereby rendering Diaz\u2019s guilty plea not knowing and voluntary?\u201d After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">In November 2007, federal customs agents found three kilograms of heroin in Sergey Mazur\u2019s cabin on a ship docked in Savannah, Georgia. Mazur agreed to cooperate with authorities by making a controlled delivery of the heroin to Osvaldo Badosa, Diaz\u2019s cousin. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents arrested Ba-dosa when the delivery took place on December 1, 2007. At the scene of the arrest, the agents found $4,000 in cash and two rental car receipts signed by Diaz in Badosa\u2019s car. And during Badosa\u2019s arrest, Diaz called him.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">Badosa told the DEA agents that Diaz had arranged Badosa\u2019s trip to Savannah to acquire the heroin. According to Badosa, Diaz would receive the heroin from Badosa and pass it on to Gilmer Valasquez.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the day of the controlled delivery, Valas-quez called Diaz. The DEA agents prompted Badosa to make a recorded phone call to Diaz. During that call, Diaz asked Bado-sa if he was \u201cstraight,\u201d and Badosa replied that \u201c[i]t went off like it was supposed to go \u2014 all three,\u201d which presumably referred to the three kilograms of heroin involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>in the delivery. In May 2008, a grand jury indicted Diaz for one count of conspiracy to import one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963, and one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Diaz was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">DEA agents interviewed Diaz on August 5, 2008, and he admitted that both he and Badosa had been in contact with Valasquez before the controlled delivery. Diaz told the agents that Valasquez hired Badosa to pick up three kilograms of heroin on December 1, 2007, and that Valasquez had subsequently fled the country to avoid prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">On August 18, 2008, Diaz signed a plea agreement, and on August 22, 2008, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute. If Diaz had been convicted after a trial, he faced a mandatory minimum of 10 years and mandatory life imprisonment if the government had filed for an enhanced penalty under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 because Diaz had two prior felony drug convictions. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(i), 846, 960(b)(1)(A), 968. In the plea agreement, however, the government agreed to not file a sentence enhancement and Diaz was sentenced to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Between his arrest and his guilty plea, Diaz alleges he learned that Badosa wanted to talk to Diaz\u2019s lawyer and testify that Diaz had not been involved in the conspiracy. Diaz claims that his lawyer refused to speak to Badosa and continued to advise Diaz to plead guilty. After he pleaded guilty, but before sentencing, Diaz alleges his lawyer received an unsigned affidavit bearing Badosa\u2019s name, which said Badosa had misled the authorities, Diaz was not involved in the conspiracy, and Badosa would not testify against Diaz. Diaz asked his lawyer to seek a continuance of the sentencing hearing, but counsel refused and the sentencing went ahead as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Diaz subsequently filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence, arguing his lawyer was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty without investigating Badosa\u2019s alleged change of heart. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, without an evi-dentiary hearing. This is Diaz\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[I]f the petitioner alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714-15 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). \u201c[A] petitioner need only <em>allege </em>\u2014 not prove \u2014 reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n. 6. We will liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">The district court found that Diaz would not prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim even if the facts he alleged were true. We review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim <em>de novo. Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). To show ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must demonstrate that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>674 (1984). We need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052. Where, as here, the petitioner challenges his guilty plea based on his counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance, he can only show prejudice if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, 474 </em>U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate ... potentially exculpatory evidence, the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019 the defendant ... will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Diaz was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because, even assuming the facts he alleged are true, he cannot show prejudice. Diaz argues that, without Ba-dosa\u2019s testimony implicating him in the conspiracy, the government\u2019s case would have been eviscerated and he would have insisted on going to trial But the evidence the government would likely have introduced at trial was: (1) receipts proving Diaz rented the car used in the controlled delivery; (2) Diaz\u2019s call to Badosa during the delivery; (3) Valasquez\u2019s call to Diaz on the day of the delivery; (4) the recorded phone call between Diaz and Ba-dosa; and (5) Diaz\u2019s statements to the DEA agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The government had a strong case against Diaz. Although Badosa\u2019s testimony may have been the only direct evidence, \u201cit is frequently necessary to resort to circumstantial evidence to prove [conspiracy\u2019s] elements.\u201d <em>United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1426 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThere is rarely any direct evidence of an agreement to join a criminal conspiracy....\u201d <em>United States v. Gianni, 678 F.2d </em>956, 959 (11th Cir.1982). Diaz\u2019s statements to the DEA agents indicated that he had been in contact with the co-conspirators prior to the controlled delivery and that he had detailed knowledge of the delivery and subsequent events. Diaz also supplied the car used in the controlled delivery. And the phone calls between Diaz and Valasquez and Diaz and Badosa showed Diaz was in contact with both co-conspirators on the day of the controlled delivery and that Diaz checked up on Ba-dosa after the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Even if Badosa had testified that Diaz was not a member of the conspiracy, the likely outcome of a trial would not have changed. Badosa was Diaz\u2019s cousin and co-defendant, which would have undermined the persuasiveness of his testimony. The government would also likely have impeached Badosa with his prior inconsistent statements, which directly implicated Diaz. Badosa\u2019s testimony would at best have been weak and likely incapable of overcoming the evidence against'Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Diaz alleges general explanations for each piece of the government\u2019s evidence. But Diaz knew about these explanations when he pleaded, and he pleaded guilty anyway. To introduce his explanations at a trial, Diaz would have been required to testify. And if he had testified, the government would have elicited that Diaz gave Badosa the $4,000 that was to be used to buy the heroin and that Diaz had at least one prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">By pleading guilty, Diaz avoided a possible life sentence. Advising a defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>plead guilty \u201cfrequently involves highly practical considerations .... [such as] the expectation or hope of a lesser sentence .... \u201d <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 268, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). After pleading guilty, Diaz was sentenced to the comparatively minimal 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. Considering the strength of the government\u2019s case and the risk of receiving a life sentence, we cannot say, in light of the weak evidence Diaz alleges his counsel failed to invests gate adequately, that there was a reasonable probability Diaz\u2019s counsel would have advised him to go to trial. Therefore, Diaz' has not shown prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Because Diaz\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, even assuming the facts Diaz alleged are true, he is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing and properly denied Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">.
