Because Giron\u2019s sentence falls within the applicable guidelines range, it \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated guidelines range). He concedes that this court utilizes the presumption of reasonableness for sentences determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and that this court has held that failure to object to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence in the district court results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). However, he raises both of those issues to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">This court has rejected Giron\u2019s arguments that sentences determined under \u00a7 2L1.2 are unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically grounded and because prior convictions may count toward both offense level and criminal history category calculations. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. With regard to his contention that the district court failed to account sufficiently for his particular circumstances in its 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, he brought these circumstances to the attention of the district court, and this court recognizes that \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Whether we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Giron has shown no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
