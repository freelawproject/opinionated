We granted McKenzie a certificate of appeala-bility on the issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court erred by denying McKenzie\u2019s claim that his trial counsel furnished ineffective assistance by failing to object to witness Anthony Williams\u2019s testimony regarding how he became a state witness.\u201d On appeal, McKenzie argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Williams\u2019s hearsay testimony, request a limiting instruction, or move for a mistrial, and the cumulative effect of these errors, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>A habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\u201d in the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). A state court\u2019s factual determinations are presumed correct unless the petitioner can rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">\u201cThe \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases- for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if (1) the court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the U.S. Supreme Court on a question of law, or (2) the court confronts facts that are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant Supreme Court precedent, but arrives at a different result from that arrived at by the Supreme Court. <em>Id </em>An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law occurs when the state court either (1) correctly identifies the legal rule from Supreme Court precedent but unreasonably applies the rule to the facts of the case, or (2) \u201cunreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">To succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a petitioner must show that (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. Under <em>Strickland, </em>counsel\u2019s performance is deficient only if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness considering all the circumstances, and a court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a strong presumption, that counsel\u2019s representation was \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d 466 U.S. at 688-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052. With regard to the prejudice prong,' \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To make this determination, we review \u201cthe totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">With regard to McKenzie\u2019s claim relating to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Williams\u2019s hearsay testimony, the state court concluded that McKenzie\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was not \u201cunreasonably deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>requires only that a trial counsel\u2019s performance be considered \u201cdeficient,\u201d and thus, the state court\u2019s decision is arguably contrary to clearly established law on Strickland\u2019s deficiency prong. However, we need not decide if the state court\u2019s ruling was contrary to <em>Strickland </em>and therefore owed no deference under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), because we cannot say on <em>de novo </em>review that that McKenzie has established that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as to the prejudice prong. <em>See Berghuis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number><em>Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (explaining that courts can deny writs of habeas corpus by engaging in <em>de novo </em>review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a petitioner is not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo </em>review).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">.McKenzie argues that he proved both deficient performance and prejudice based on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object or to move to strike the testimony of the state\u2019s witness, Williams, who explained that it was only after the police told him that another person, Coy Evans, had already told the police what happened on the night of the murder of Derrick McKinney that he agreed to be a witness against McKenzie. He argues that Williams\u2019s testimony was not only double hearsay but prejudicial because the hearsay evidence of Evans\u2019s statement to the police corroborated Williams\u2019s version of the events surrounding the murder of McKinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We need not resolve whether McKenzie\u2019s counsel was deficient when he failed, to object to Williams\u2019s testimony because we cannot say that McKenzie has established that the error prejudiced him, i.e. that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the failure to object, the jury would have had reasonable doubt regarding McKenzie\u2019s guilt. <em>See' Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052 (explaining that a court need not address the performance component of a <em>Strickland </em>ineffective assistance of counsel claim where the defendant fails to make a sufficient showing of prejudice). By the time the allegedly prejudicial question was asked, Williams had already testified consistently with three other witnesses as to (1) the motive for the murder of McKinney; (2) McKinney being in the car with McKenzie; (3) McKinney attempting to lead McKenzie to the individuals who had earlier in the day robbed McKenzie; and (4) McKinney being unable to find the robbers for McKenzie. If anything, the testimony provided McKenzie\u2019s trial counsel with a new opportunity to attempt to impeach Williams by showing that Williams had at first lied to the police, Williams only spoke to police after Evans implicated Williams, and \u25a0 Evans was charged with' murdering a police officer. Moreover, McKenzie\u2019s trial counsel used the testimony to argue in closing that Williams was unreliable and that his testimony was motivated by pressure from the police. Accordingly, the totality of the evidence before the jury was such that, even if McKenzie\u2019s trial counsel had objected, McKenzie did not establish <em>Strickland </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
