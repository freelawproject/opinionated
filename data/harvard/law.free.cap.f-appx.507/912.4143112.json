We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The district court did not err. Harris is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 because he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Harris also cannot obtain relief based on the lower mandatory minimum sentence provided under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The Act \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and ... does not serve as a basis for a ... sentence reduction\u201d under section 3582(c)(2), and in any event, the lower mandatory sentence does not apply retroactiv\u00e9ly .to offenders who, like Harris, were sentenced before the effective date of the Act. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Harris argues, for the first time, that denying him the benefit of a reduced sentence under the Act violates his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, but we cannot consider these \u201cextraneous sentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Harris may raise his constitutional arguments in a collateral motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">We AFFIRM the denial of Harris\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
