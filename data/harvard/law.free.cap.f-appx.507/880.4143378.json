On appeal, Dixon argues that she was entitled to a sentence reduction based on her newly amended guideline range and that the district court failed to consider that her statutory mandatory minimum sentence was also amended by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for the district court to reconsider whether a sentence reduction is warranted,</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In 2006, Dixon pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii), (b)(l)(B)(iii) and 846 (\u201cCount One\u201d), and carrying and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(\u201cCount Two\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) indicated that Dixon was responsible for 2.8 kilograms of cocaine base. Because the drug quantity exceeded 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, the probation officer assigned a base offense level of 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Dixon\u2019s total offense level was 35. The offense level of 35 and her criminal history category of I resulted in a guideline range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Further, as to Count One, Dixon faced a mandatory minimum 60-month sentence, and as to Count Two, she faced a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Prior to sentencing, the government filed a motion for a sentence reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, indicating that Dixon had provided substantial assistance to the government. In consideration of Dixon\u2019s cooperation, the court granted a substantial assistance reduction as to the drug charge (Count One), but denied a reduction as to the firearm charge (Count Two). The court noted that, absent the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, it would have imposed a sentence \u201csomewhere in the mid[-]point\u201d of Dixon\u2019s guideline range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cwhich probably would have been about 180 months.\u201d Ultimately, in August 2006, the court imposed a 120-month total sentence, consisting of a 60-month sentence as to Count One with a mandatory consecutive 60-month-sentence as to Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">In March 2008, Dixon filed ' a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Through counsel, she argued that Amendment 706 lowered her base offense level from 38 to 36, which resulted in a lower guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">In December 2008, the district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court noted that the \u201cmid-point\u201d of Dixon\u2019s reduced guideline range of .135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment was still 30 months greater than the sentence that she received after her substantial assistance reduction. The court found that, \u201c[b]ased on the facts supporting the original sentence, including [Dixon\u2019s] substantial assistance, the court would not have reduced [her] sentence below 120 months even after [the] application of Amendment 706.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>In November 2011, Dixon filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. In her motion, Dixon argued that she should receive a sentence reduction based on post-sentencing, retroactive changes to the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. Dixon noted that she initially received a 67% reduction in her sentence as to the drug charge based on the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. She thus asserted that, as to the drug charge, she was entitled to a comparable 67% reduction below her amended guideline range. Accordingly, she requested that the district court reduce her sentence to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The district court denied Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, noting that it had considered the policy statement set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, \u201cto the extent they are applicable.\u201d Additionally, without further explanation, the court found that Amendment 750 did not result in a change to Dixon\u2019s \u201cguideline range and the previous sentence imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, district courts may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, except in specific circumstances delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). One such exception is for a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339 (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, makes permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) pursuant to the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Subsection lB1.10(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines, as revised by Amendment 759, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\"><em>Exception for Substantial </em>Assistance.\u2014 If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (2011). Government motions for substantial assistance under \u00a7 5K1.1 are explicitly listed as being included within the exception. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Nevertheless, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court lacks the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when the amended guideline \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">As an initial matter, because it appears that the district court erred for the reasons discussed below, we decline to review the merits of Dixon\u2019s FSA argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In denying Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court clearly erred in concluding that Amendment 750 did not have the effect of reducing her guideline range. Dixon\u2019s original base offense level was 38, and after a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, she was assigned a total offense level of 35. Her resulting guideline range was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment as to the drug count with a 60-month mandatory consecutive sentence as to the firearm count. Had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time of Dixon\u2019s sentencing, she would have received a base offense level of 36 based on the 2.8 kilograms of cocaine base for which she was held responsible. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2011). After the reduction for acceptance of responsibility, her total offense level would have been 33, which, combined with her criminal history category of I, would have yielded a reduced guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment as to the drug count.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The government suggests that, even though Dixon\u2019s earlier motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 was denied, her base offense level was reduced to 36 under that Amendment. Thus, the government contends that Dixon\u2019s instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was properly denied because Amendment 750 did not provide for a further reduction in her base offense level. However, because the district court denied Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706, her base offense level as of her last sentencing proceeding was 38. In denying her prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court found that, based on the underlying facts and circumstances of the case, Dixon was not entitled to a further reduction below the sentence that she received for her substantial assistance. In considering, upon remand, whether to grant a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750, the district court may reach a similar conclusion that a further sentence reduction is not warranted. Alternatively, the district court may decline to grant Dixon a comparable substantial assistance reduction below her amended guideline range because, regardless of the applicable guideline range, her assistance to the government did not warrant a sentence below the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence applicable to Count One. However, in denying the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court did not address these issues because it appears to have erroneously determined that Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Dixon\u2019s applicable guideline range. For the foregoing reasons, we vacate and remand to the district court to reconsider whether Dixon was entitled to a sentence reduction comparable to the reduction that she received pursuant to the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
