In light of a recent district court decision, <em>Shelton v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>802 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>F.Supp.2d 1289 (M.D.Fla.2011)(S%ei\u00a3cm /), the district court granted Collins a certif\u00ed-cate of appealability (COA) as to' the issues of whether (1) defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to move to dismiss or for a judgment of acquittal, and failing to request a special jury instruction or object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, based on the ground that the State cannot aggregate the amount of cocaine transactions when the State has failed to prove that a defendant specifically intended to sell, purchase, deliver, or possess a total of 28 grams or more of cocaine at different times; and (2) appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue that the State may not aggregate cocaine' weights, from several purchases of personal-use cocaine on different occasions to prove conspiracy to traffic or trafficking in cocaine. On ap-' peal, Collins argues we should reverse the denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Shelton I, </em>the petitioner sought federal habeas corpus relief, challenging the constitutionality of Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13, which had been amended to eliminate the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for drug offenses. 802 F.Supp.2d at 1293. The district court found that \u00a7 893.13 as amended was facially unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process Clause, and granted the petitioner habeas relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. During the pendency of Collins\u2019 appeal to us, the Florida Supreme Court upheld \u00a7 893.13 as constitutional under the due process requirements as articulated by that court and the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>State v. Adkins, </em>96 So.3d 412, 423 (Fla.2012). Also during the pendency of-Collins\u2019 appeal, we issued an opinion reversing the district court\u2019s grant of habeas relief in <em>Shelton I, </em>holding the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law, as determined by the. U.S. Supreme Court. <em>Shelton v. Sec., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>691 F.3d 1348, 1353-56 (11th Cir.2012)(Shelton <em>II). </em>In doing so, we expressed \u201cno view on the underlying constitutional question,\u201d but held that <em>Adkins </em>was not an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The district court did not err in denying Collins\u2019 \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, in light of the narrow grant of COA through which we review that denial. The district court only granted a COA for us to consider Collins\u2019 first and second grounds for relief in light of <em>Shelton I. </em>We reversed <em>Shelton I </em>in <em>Shelton II. See Shelton II, </em>691 F.3d at 1353-56. Therefore, we affirm the denial of Collins\u2019 \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998)(holding that appellate-review is limited to the issues specified in the COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
