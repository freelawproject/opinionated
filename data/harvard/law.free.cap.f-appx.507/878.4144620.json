Smith argues that: (1) the district court erred in determining that he was ineligible for a reduced sentence under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d); and (2) the district court failed to \u201cproperly assess and consider the permissible aims of punishment and whether such aims could be achieved with a lesser sentence.\u201d After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court abuses its discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or follow proper procedures in making its determination. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">Section 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, where a Guideline Amendment did not lower the career offender offense levels, it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We further explained that the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction, but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">In this case, the district court did not err in denying Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. Section \u00a7 3582 relief is not available to Smith because no Guidelines Amendment has lowered the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. See <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. In particular, Amendment 750 does not lower Smith\u2019s applicable guideline range, because that range was determined by the career offender guideline, and not the drug quantity table. A reduction of Smith\u2019s sentence, therefore, would not be consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and is not authorized under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, because Smith was ineligible for a sentence reduction, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider any other sentencing issues. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cSection </em>3582(c) ... does not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
