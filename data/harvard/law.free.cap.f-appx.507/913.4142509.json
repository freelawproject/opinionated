Ferrer, Madeleine R. Shirley, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, Nancy Vorpe Quinlan, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, West Palm Beach, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b936-5\">Antranik Keshishian, Delray Beach, FL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b936-7\">Before PRYOR, MARTIN and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b936-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Antranik Keshishian, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1) motion for early termination of supervised release. Because we conclude that the record does not show the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making its determination, we vacate and remand with instructions that the district court consider these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Keshishian was convicted in 1991 of possession of heroin with intent to distribute and conspiracy to manufacture firearms. He was sentenced to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment and 4 years\u2019 supervised release. In 1995, he escaped from custody and remained at large until 2007, when he was caught and convicted for his escape and sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. In December 2009, Keshishian was released and began supervised release \u2014 a 4-year term for his sixteen-year-old drug and firearm offenses and a 3-year term for his escape-from-custody conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">In December 2011, Keshishian filed a \u00a7 3583(e)(1) motion for early termination of supervised release. He asserted that his mother, who lived in Lebanon, had cancer and needed his care. In support of early termination, Keshishian emphasized that he had \u201cmade progressive strides towards supervision objectives, and compliance with all conditions of supervision,\u201d had \u201cno aggravated role in the offense of conviction,\u201d had \u201cno history of violence and no recent arrests or convictions ... or ongoing uninterrupted patterns of criminal conduct including no recent evidence of drug, alcohol abuse, or psychiatric episodes,\u201d and posed \u201cno identifiable risk to the safety of\u2019 anyone. The district court, without conducting a hearing, denied Keshishian\u2019s motion in a form order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is Keshishian\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">We review the denial of a motion to modify \u2014 in this case, terminate \u2014 supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). Section 3583(e)(1) permits a district court to \u201cter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>m\u00ednate a term of supervised release and discharge the defendant\u201d if, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court \u201cis satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and in the interest of justice.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). We have held, in the context of a district court\u2019s determination of whether to resentence a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which also indicates \u201cthe district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d that the court \u201cis not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cHowever, if it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is because, without an indication that the court considered these factors, \u201cwe cannot engage in meaningful appellate review and must vacate and remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Here, the record does not indicate whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Keshishian made no mention of \u00a7 3553(a) in his motion. He merely provided reasons to support early termination of his supervised release, many of which detail his post-sentencing rehabilitation and \u201cdo not implicate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1220. There is no relevant response from the government or a hearing transcript reflecting that the parties discussed or that the court considered the factors. Because nothing in the record shows the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we cannot meaningfully review the court\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the denial of Keshishian\u2019s \u00a7 3583(e)(1) motion and remand to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">. Although on appeal the government submits that the probation office filed a memorandum in opposition to Keshishian\u2019s motion, we are unable to locate this document in the record and there is no indication that the district court considered it. In any event, the portion of the memorandum the government quotes, the only portion we have access to, says nothing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or facts that would inform them and therefore does not lend support to the government\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s consideration was adequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
