On appeal, Roul-hac argues that: (1) he is entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750, even though he was originally sentenced to the mandatory minimum, because his sentence was later reduced based on his substantial assistance to the government; and (2) the lower mandatory minimum sentences, enacted by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), apply to defendants who, like him, were sentenced before the Act\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In 2006, Roulhae pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 846 (\u201cCount One\u201d), and possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii) (\u201cCount Two\u201d). Subsequently, the government filed a notice of its intent to seek a sentence enhancement based on Roulhac\u2019s six prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">According to the presentence investiga- \u25a0 tion report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Roulhac\u2019s offense involved \u201cjust over three kilograms of cocaine base.\u201d As a result, based on the. 2005 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the probation office assigned a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Roulhae received a two-level enhancement for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another in the course of fleeing from law enforcement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). Thus, his total offense level was 37. Based on this offense level and a criminal history category of VI, Roulhac\u2019s guideline range initially was 360 months to life imprisonment. However, as to Count One, Roulhae faced a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment because of his prior felony drug convictions. Accordingly, his guideline range became life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Roulhae filed no objections to the PSI, and ultimately, the court imposed concurrent life sentences for Counts One and Two. Further, the court indicated that it had adopted the PSI without change, and that it had imposed the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">\u2022 In August 2009, the government filed a motion and amended motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), advising the court of Roulhac\u2019s substantial assistance to law enforcement after sentencing, and requesting that the court determine whether his sentence should be reduced based on his assistance. The court found that Roulhae had provided substantial assistance, and granted the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion. As a result, on August 19, 2009, the court reduced Roulhac\u2019s sentence to 300 months\u2019. imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">In January 2012, Roulhae filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7. 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. In his motion, Roulhae argued that the FSA did not forbid defendants with statutory minimum sentences from obtaining a sentence reduction. Further,' this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), which, held that a substantial-assistance reduction did not eliminate the applicable mandatory minimum sentence, was distinguishable because it applied to Amendment 706. He suggested that, unlike Amendment 706, Amendment 750 specifically changed the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses. Based on principles of statutory construction, the FSA is retroactively applicable to all defendants with crack cocaine offenses. Under the FSA, Roulhae would have been subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>range of <em>120 to 150 months\u2019 </em>imprisonment, based on the 50 grams or more of cocaine to which he pled guilty. Further, his sentence should reflect the crack-to-powder cocaine disparities, which were not considered during his original sentencing proceeding. Thus, he requested that the court reduce his sentence to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The district court denied Roulhac\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court found that Roulhac did not qualify for a sentence reduction because applying Amendment 750 did not lower his applicable guideline range of life imprisonment. Additionally, Roulhac was ineligible for a sentence reduction because, due to the Rule 35(b) motion, he had already been sentenced below the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">When an applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). A court may only modify a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A sentence reduction is not authorized if an amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. Further, even if the defendant was originally sentenced below the statutory minimum due to the government\u2019s filing of a substantial-assistance motion, the district court\u2019s point of departure would be the mandatory minimum and would not \u201celiminate the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable on November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, makes permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. In <em>Glover, </em>the defendant pled guilty to crack cocaine offenses in 2005 and was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, which became his guideline range. <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1204-05. However, based on a substantial-assistance motion filed by the government, the district court departed below the applicable guideline range and sentenced Glover to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. at </em>1205. Glover filed a \u00a7 3582 motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750. <em>Id. We </em>held that Amendment 750 did not lower Glover\u2019s applicable guideline range, which \u201cwas \u2014 and still is \u2014 life in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Finally, the FSA, enacted on August 3, 2010, raised from 50 grams to 280 grams the threshold quantity of crack cocaine necessary to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment for an offender with at least two prior felony drug convictions. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010), <em>codified at </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The district court correctly denied Roulhac\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 did not lower his applicable guideline range. Similarly to the defendant in <em>Glover, </em>even though Roulhac ultimately received a below-Guidelines sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>tence based on substantial assistance, his applicable guideline range \u201cwas \u2014 and still is \u2014 life in prison.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1204-05, 1208. Thus, Roulhac was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 750, which did not alter the statutory mandatory minimum penalty as determined by Congress, does not effectively reduce his applicable guideline range of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 1206. Finally, Roulhac\u2019s reliance on the FSA is misplaced. Even if the FSA applied to Roulhac, his mandatory minimum sentence would still have been life imprisonment because he was held responsible for more than 280 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). As such, contrary to his argument, the provisions of the FSA would not have reduced the mandatory minimum sentence that applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Roulhac\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
