A jury, convicted Misher of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; he is serving 360 months of imprisonment. To support his IFP motion, Misher argues that the district court did not determine whether he was -eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>amended Guidelines, and therefore the district court erred by failing to perform the first step of the inquiry set forth in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). He also argues that the district court inappropriately based its denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on matters that were not considered at trial or sentencing and were not relevant to his underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">By moving to proceed IFP, Misher is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cAn investigation into the [IFP] movant\u2019s objective good faith, while necessitating a brief inquiry into the merits of an appeal, does not require that probable success be shown.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Rather, this court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The district court\u2019s determination that Misher was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, as set forth in <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92, was implied by its consideration of whether relief was warranted. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). Such implicit consideration of eligibility for relief is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>Also, the district court gave due consideration to Misher\u2019s motion and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its determination that a sentence reduction was not warranted. The district court\u2019s decision therefore was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-73 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l(B)(i)(ii)) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Misher has failed to demonstrate that his appeal involves non-frivolous legal issues. See <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
