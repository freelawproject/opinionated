On recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court dismissed Guerrero\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The court also denied Guerrero leave to amend, denied a motion for rehearing, and denied Guerrero leave to proceed in forma pau-peris (IFP) on appeal. . Guerrero now moves for permission from this court to proceed IFP. By doing so, Guerrero is challenging'the district court\u2019s certification that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">Guerrero\u2019s sole argument is that the Austin Police Department and the County Attorney failed to investigate and prosecute the charges he filed against his wife because she was a woman, despite evidence. she had committed,a felony, while he, a male, was convicted without evidence. Guerrero asserts that his rights under the Equal Protection Clause were, therefore, violated. Although Guerrero insists that he does not challenge his conviction, his assertion that his prosecution was based on gender discrimination' effectively challenges the constitutionality of his conviction. <em>See, e.g., Wayte v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 608, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). As a ruling in favor of Guerrero on this claim necessarily implies that his conviction was invalid, his equal protection challenge is barred unless the conviction has been reversed, expunged; declared invalid by a state tribunal, or called into question by a federal writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Guerrero\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal, <em>see Guerrero v. State, </em>No. 03-10-00218-CR, 2011 WL 2176825, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>*1 (2011), and there is no indication it has since been reversed or otherwise called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Guerrero appears to have abandoned his trial-based claims against the trial judge, his counsel, the prosecutor, and the interpreter. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, we find it appropriate to address them briefly to the extent they involve issues of immunity. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). The trial judge is absolutely immune from suit as there is no allegation that he acted outside his judicial role or in the absence of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 284-85. The prosecutor likewise enjoys absolute \u00a7 1983 immunity for actions taken in the presentation of a case. <em>See id. </em>at 285. Guerrero asserted no facts supporting a constitutional claim against the interpreter, and Guerrero\u2019s appointed counsel has no liability under \u00a7 1983 because she is not a state actor. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Guerrero also complains that the district court denied leave to amend as futile. We see no abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See McAfee v. 5th Cir. Judges, </em>884 F.2d 221, 222-23 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">As Guerrero has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Because his appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal as frivolous count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d bar of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Guerrero has previously filed two other \u00a7 1983 complaints that were dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Guerrero v. Turner, </em>No. 9:11-CV-00082, 2012 WL 760876 (E.D.Tex. Mar.7, 2012); <em>Guerrero v. King, </em>No. 9:11-CV-00081, 2011 WL 4753524 (E.D.Tex. Oct.6, 2011), <em>aff'd, </em>473 Fed.Appx. 379 (5th Cir.2012). Because Guerrero has now accumulated three or more strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or in the appeal of a judgment in a civil action while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(G) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir..
