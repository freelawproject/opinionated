Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), which the district court determined were violent felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>nies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Ramirez\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the issue of whether his prior convictions were violent felonies under the ACCA was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584 (5th Cir.2008). In <em>Constante, </em>we did not address whether burglary under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) was a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. Thus, the issue was not foreclosed by <em>Constante. See, e.g., Matter of Swift, </em>129 F.3d 792, 796 n. 18 (5th Cir.1997) (stating that we are not bound by a previous decision if that decision did not consider an issue raised in the subsequent case).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In light of the foregoing, Ramirez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
