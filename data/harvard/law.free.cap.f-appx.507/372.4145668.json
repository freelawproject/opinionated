She argues that her revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable because the district court relied on her rehabilitative needs when imposing or lengthening her sentence. She argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that the district court imposed the 24-month sentence so she could participate in the Bureau of Prison\u2019s drug rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), the Supreme Court held in a direct criminal appeal that a district court \u201cmay not impose or lengthen a- prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\u201d Even assuming that <em>Ta-pia </em>applies in the revocation context, <em>see United States v. Receskey, </em>699 F.3d 807, 810 (5th Cir.2012), Potts has not demonstrated that her sentence is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The district court clearly did not impose the revocation sentence to address Potts\u2019s rehabilitative needs as revocation in her case was mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). Moreover, as in <em>Receskey, </em>the court\u2019s concern over rehabilitation was not the \u201cdominant factor\u201d in the sentencing court\u2019s analysis, and the court discussed the opportunity for rehabilitation with Potts and recommended that she participate in a drug rehabilitation program after it imposed the sentence. <em>See Receskey, </em>699 F.3d at 812. The district court did not violate <em>Tapia </em>because the sentence was not tailored to allow her to participate in a specific drug rehabilitation program. <em>Id: </em>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
