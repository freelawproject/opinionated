Grant\u2019s initial sentencing range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on a total offense level of 34. The district court determined his amended range was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on an offense level of 32. The district court reduced Grant\u2019s sentence to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment, but expressly refused to reduce his sentence further pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), finding <em>Booker </em>was inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(e)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">On appeal, Grant disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 restricted its authority to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues the district court erred by treating the Guidelines as mandatory when ruling on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He asserts, after the <em>Booker </em>decision, all of the Guidelines, including \u00a7 1B1.10, are advisory, and the Sentencing Commission is not permitted to authorize the retroactive application of a particular guideline, allowing the district court to reimpose sentence, and then limit the district court\u2019s discretion in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). These exceptions include relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The applicable policy statement in this case is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which pertains to Guidelines amendments that may be applied retroactively, including Amendment 706. Section 1B1.10 provides, in cases in which the defendant received a within-Guidelines sentence at his original sentencing, a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) shall not be less than the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">This Court recently addressed whether <em>Booker </em>prohibits Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2009). Concluding <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">The applicable policy statement here, \u00a7 1B1.10, and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Grant\u2019s original sentence was within the Guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court was not permitted under \u00a7 1B1.10 to sentence Grant to a term below the amended Guidelines range. Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Grant\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>ment that the district court erred by concluding it lacked authority to reduce his sentence below the amended Guidelines range is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
