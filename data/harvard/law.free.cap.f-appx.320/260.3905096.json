Lockhart\u2019s application challenges the denial of credit for time that he served on parole following his conviction for aggravated robbery. We previously granted a certificate of appealability (COA) as to whether Lockhart\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Lockhart argues that the limitations period should have been tolled pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) during the pen-dency of the four time credit disputes that he filed pursuant to Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 501.0081. He contends that the requirement that he file the time credit disputes prior to bringing a state application for postconviction relief constitutes a state impediment to filing. He argues no other basis for tolling the limitations period for the time credit disputes. Lockhart\u2019s argument is without merit because he has not argued or shown that the required filing of a time credit dispute constitutes state action in violation of the Constitution or federal law. <em>See Egerton v. Cockrell, </em>334 F.3d 433, 436 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Accordingly, although we find that the district court erred in its time calculations, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lockhart\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application as time barred on the basis that he has not shown that he was entitled to tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) during the pendency of his time credit disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Lockhart\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. His motion to expedite the appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
