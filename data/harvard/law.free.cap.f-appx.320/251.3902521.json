Willie asserts that the district court abused its discretion by denying relief without first conducting an evidentia-ry hearing. He contends that he was entitled to relief on his claim that counsel was ineffective based on counsel\u2019s failure to build a trusting attorney-client relationship, which resulted in Willie\u2019s refusal to consider engaging in plea discussions. He also urges that counsel was ineffective in failing to prepare him to testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Willie fails to reassert his claims of ineffective assistance advanced in the district court regarding (1) counsel\u2019s failure to object to the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 sentence enhancement, (2) the imposition of supervised release, and (3) the sufficiency of the indictment. He also fails to reassert his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. As Willie has not briefed these issues in this court, they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Willie fails to show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different but for counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). As Willie has not shown the likely merit of his allegations, he has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
