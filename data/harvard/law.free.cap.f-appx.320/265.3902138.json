Plaintiffs have alleged that Venagas\u2019s delivery of Scott to an inmate processing center rather than to a hospital or other medical facility, constituted deliberate indifference to Scott\u2019s serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">Adopting the recommendations of the magistrate judge in her Memorandum, Recommendation and Order, the district court denied qualified immunity to Vene-gas based on the existence of a dispute of material fact, described by the magistrate judge as \u201ctwo significantly different versions of key persons of the event\u201d as to the facts leading up to Scott\u2019s death, one version being that of Venegas and the other being that of EMS paramedic Kevin Tray-nor. Concluding that the \u201cqualified immunity analysis [for Venegas] hangs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>balance of these critical fact disputes,\u201d the recommendations of the magistrate judge adopted by the district court convinces us that, indeed, one of the two widely divergent versions of the critical facts preceding Scott\u2019s death will ultimately determine entitlement of Venegas to qualified immunity. This quintessential dispute of material fact deprives us of appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s interlocutory denial of qualified immunity at this summary judgment stage of the proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Venagas\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
