Amendment 706 applies to those whose sentences were determined by calculating their guidelines offense levels in accordance with the pertinent Guideline for crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Section 3582 permits a defendant to move, under certain circumstances, for discretionary modification of his sentence if it was based on a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission later lowered, such as the Guideline for crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But Murillo\u2019s total offense level was not based on the Guideline for crack cocaine; it was instead based only on the quantity of powder cocaine that was attributable to Murillo. Amendment 706 therefore does not apply to Murillo. A defendant\u2019s prison term is not subject to reduction on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion if a particular guidelines amendment, such as Amendment 706, does not apply to the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, as the district court noted, Murillo \u201cis not eligible for a sentencing reduction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

(n.l(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-26\">. The district court accurately identified Murillo\u2019s problem as the lack of statutory basis for a federal court to entertain his motion and revisit his sentence. We construe this judgment as being jurisdictional in nature and affirm on that basis. <em>See U.S. v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
