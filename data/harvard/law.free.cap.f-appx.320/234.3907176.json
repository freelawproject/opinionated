He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. Avalos-Rios concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because the sixteen-level enhancement he received under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Avalos-Rios argues that although illegal reentry is a less serious offense than residential burglary, the fifty-seven month sentence was nearly as long as the five-year sentence he ultimately received for his prior residential burglary conviction. He also argues that the sentence was greater than necessary to deter further reentries because it would require him to serve far more imprisonment than he had for either of his two prior convictions. Although Avalos-Rios argued in the district court that a within-guidelines sentence was too harsh, he did not raise his current empirical argument. Thus, this argument is reviewed for plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>error only. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado. </em>The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The district court considered Avalos-Rios\u2019s request for a sentence below the applicable guideline range, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of that range was appropriate. Avalos-Rios\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Because Avalos-Rios has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
