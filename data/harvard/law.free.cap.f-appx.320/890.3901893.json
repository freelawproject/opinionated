Juma argues that Amendments 591 and 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines altered his guideline imprisonment range. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-24\">A federal jury convicted Juma of two counts of armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (\u201cCounts 1 and 3\u201d), and two counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (\u201cCounts 2 and 4\u201d). Before Juma\u2019s sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), using the Guidelines manual for 1997. For each of Counts 1 and 3, the probation officer (1) set Juma\u2019s base offense level at 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1; (2) applied the applicable enhancements from this section, but declined to apply the ordinary six- or seven-level enhancements for using a fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>arm in the course of a robbery, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A) and (B), because Juma was convicted of substantive offenses for this conduct; (3) set Juma\u2019s combined offense level for these offenses at 27, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4; and (4) set Juma\u2019s criminal history category at II. Per these calculations, Juma\u2019s guideline imprisonment range for Counts 1 and 3 was 78 to 97 months each. For each of Counts 2 and 4, the probation officer determined that Juma\u2019s guideline term of imprisonment was that required by statute, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(a). For Count 2, the statutory term was five years\u2019 consecutive imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c). For Count 4, the statutory term was 20 years\u2019 consecutive imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c), as it was Juma\u2019s second conviction for this offense. At Juma\u2019s sentencing, on July 30, 1998, he made no objections or statements. The district court sentenced Juma to two terms of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts 1 and 3, to run concurrently with each other; 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2, to run consecutively to all other terms; and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 4, to run consecutively to all other terms. Thus, Juma\u2019s total term of imprisonment was 397 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Juma filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for modification of sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), on December 19, 2007. Juma argued that, pursuant to Amendments 591 and 599, his use of firearms during the offenses should have resulted only in enhancements to the base offense levels for his robbery convictions, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1, rather than the penalties prescribed by statute, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c). Juma asserted that Amendment 591 instructed the district court to use \u00a7 2113(a) exclusively to sentence robbery convicts. Juma also asserted that Amendment 599 instructed the district court not to impose duplicative sentences, or to enhance a convict\u2019s sentence based on conduct already incorporated in the base offense level for his crime. Juma finally asserted that the district court\u2019s sentence was not \u201creasonable\u201d because it was greater than necessary. A magistrate judge recommended denying Juma\u2019s motion, on the grounds that Amendment 591 was inapplicable and that the district court did not violate Amendment 599 or impose a duplicative sentence because it specifically declined to enhance Juma\u2019s robbery sentences'based on his use of firearms. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation over Juma\u2019s objections and denied Juma\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to reduce a sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant\u2019s sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that subsequent retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced and if the district court has considered the applicable factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and has determined that a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). One of these considerations is that the resulting sentence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Amendment 591 altered U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a) to instruct the district court to \u201c[djetermine, pursuant to 1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction\u201d and altered U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a) to instruct the sentencing court to \u201c[rjefer to the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to determine the Chapter Two offense guideline, referenced in the Statutory Index for the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591. \u201cAmendment 591 requires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be based only on the statute or offense of conviction .... \u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). The amendment was designed, in part, to rectify confusion among circuits as to whether the sentencing court should apply the guideline section referenced in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction or select the guideline section based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, even if uncharged. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591, Reason for Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Amendment 599 altered the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.4 to clarify that, when a defendant is being sentenced for both a \u00a7 924(c) violation under the guideline, and for the offense underlying the \u00a7 924(c) violation, the sentencing court is precluded from applying a weapons enhancement under the guideline for the underlying offense. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599. The amendment explained that a sentence under \u00a7 2K2.4 already accounts for the firearm-possession portion of the conduct that comprised the underlying offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Pursuant to the Statutory Index in the Guidelines manual for 1997, one of the appropriate guideline sections for offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) was \u00a7 2B3.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A, Statutory Index (1997). Section 2B3.1 provided for a base offense level of 20 and 6- or 7-level enhancements for, respectively, discharging or otherwise using a firearm during the commission of the robbery. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a), (b)(2)(A) and (B) (1997). Pursuant to the Statutory Index, the appropriate guideline section for offenses under \u00a7 924(c) was \u00a7 2K2.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A, Statutory Index (1997). Section 2K2.4 provided that, \u201c[i]f the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) ], the term of imprisonment is that required by statute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(a) (1997). Pursuant to the version of \u00a7 924(c) in effect at Juma\u2019s sentencing, in addition to the punishment provided for the underlying crime of violence, a person convicted for the first time of possessing a firearm in the course of a crime of violence should be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, and a person convicted for the second time of possessing a firearm in the course of a crime of violence should be sentenced to a minimum of 20 year's\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (c)(l)(C)(i) (1996). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.4 also provided that, \u201c[wjhere a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm <em>(e.g., </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(f) (Robbery)) is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2)(1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Juma\u2019s motion for modification of sentence. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 759 n. 3. Amendments 591 and 599 did not lower, or otherwise alter the method of calculating, Juma\u2019s guideline imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Taken together, the amendments instruct the sentencing court to (1) determine the appropriate Chapter Two offense guideline section by looking up the statute of conviction in the Guidelines\u2019 Statutory Index; and (2) in the case of a defendant convicted of offenses under both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 924(c), remove any firearm-possession enhancement added to the former offense\u2019s base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 591, 599. The record reveals that the probation officer and district court did just that. Specifically, the district court appropriately applied \u00a7 2B3.1 to Juma\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) robbery convictions and \u00a7 2K2.4(a) to his \u00a7 924(c) firearm possession convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. A, Statutory Index (1997); U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 591. Also, the district court declined to add firearm enhancements to Juma\u2019s robbery base offense levels in light of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A), (B), 2K2.4, comment. (n.2) (1997); U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Contrary to Juma\u2019s assertions, Amendments 591 and 599 did not instruct district courts to impose one sentence, albeit modified, when a defendant used a firearm during a robbery, but rather contemplated a defendant\u2019s conviction and sentencing under both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 591, 599. Further, the amendments did not alter \u00a7 2K2.4(a)\u2019s instruction that the guideline sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction was that set by statute. <em>See id; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(a) (1997). Also, because the district court did not, therefore, err in sentencing Juma by imposing consecutive sentences for his \u00a7 924(c) convictions, it did not impose a sentence that was greater than necessary in the manner alleged by Juma. Accordingly, because application of Amendments 591 and 599 would not alter Juma\u2019s guideline imprisonment range, they offer him no basis for relief, and we affirm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 591, 599; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. We not e that the parties do not dispute that Amendments 591 and 599 are retroactive. Indeed, the amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) may be applied retroactively through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and Amendments 591 and 599 are listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999); U.S.S.G. 1B1.10(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
