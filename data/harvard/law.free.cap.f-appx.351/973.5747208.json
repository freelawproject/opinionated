He contends his classification as an aggravated felon under federal law, based on his state drug-possession convictions, is improper because: (1) his subsequent conviction did not involve a finding that he was a recidivist under state law; and (2) he was sentenced to serve less than a year in prison for this conviction. He also claims denial of his application for cancellation of removal violates his due-process and equal-protection rights. Osuagwu has failed to adequately brief his other contentions. <em>See, e.g., Perillo v. Johnson, </em>79 F.3d 441, 443 n. 1 (5th Cir.1996) (holding attempts to incorporate by reference previous briefs are insufficient to preserve error); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001) (holding we do not have jurisdiction to consider claims not presented before the BIA, such as Osuagwu\u2019s assertion that his second conviction was flawed or nonfinal).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">Our recent case law confirms the BIA correctly determined Osuagwu had committed an aggravated felony for immigration-law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>78 U.S.L.W. 3058 (U.S. 15 July 2009) (No. 09-60). \u201c[A] second state possession offense that could have been punished as a felony under federal law qualifie[s] as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67. Because Osuagwu\u2019s second offense could have been prosecuted as a felony under federal law, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (setting out certain drug offenses and punishments), he was properly determined to be ineligible for discretionary cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-15\">Osuagwu\u2019s due-process claim fails because he has no due-process rights in connection with his application for this type of discretionary relief. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (holding \u201cthe failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest\u201d, in which case no due process rights exist (quoting <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999))).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">Finally, Osuagwu\u2019s equal-protection claim fails because he has not shown \u201cthe existence of purposeful discrimination\u201d. <em>See McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>(quoting <em>Whitus v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 545, 550, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"ACB\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
