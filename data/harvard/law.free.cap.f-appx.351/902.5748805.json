Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005) because <em>SanchezVillalobos </em>contravenes prior precedent in the immigration context; and that the rule of lenity should be applied to resolve any lingering ambiguities in the statutory language. Ata\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>78 U.S.L.W. 3058 (2009) (No. 09-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Ata does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determinations regarding his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Any such challenges are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Accordingly, Ata\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
