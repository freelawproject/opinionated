Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Cir.1997)). \u201cWe review factual findings of the [BIA] to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302 (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s decision will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion\u201d. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 8 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We conclude: the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record; concomitantly, the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See id. </em>Among other things, the evidence does not establish that Benitez was persecuted for being a member of any particular social group. Moreover, Benitez\u2019 having failed to make the requisite showing for asylum, she likewise fails to meet the more stringent standard for proving eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 190 n. 7 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Benitez also claims the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision through the action of a single BIA member. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e), \u201c[u]nless a case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under [\u00a7 1003.1(e)(6) ], all cases <em>shall </em>be assigned to a single [BIA] member for disposition\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e) (emphasis added). Benitez\u2019 case does <em>not </em>meet the standards for assignment to a three-member panel. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6) (limiting review by a three-member panel to circumstances where, <em>inter alia, </em>there is a need to \u201csettle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges\u201d, \u201creview a decision by an [I J] ... that is not in conformity with the law or with applicable precedents\u201d, or \u201creview a clearly erroneous factual determination by an [IJ]\u201d). Accordingly, the affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision by a single BIA member was permissible. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (permitting a single BIA member to consider the merits of a case, and to \u201cissue a brief order affirming ... the decision under review\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Azhdaroldini v. Gonzales, </em>220 Fed.Appx. 350, 351 (5th Cir. 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
