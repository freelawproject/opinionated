Stephens appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action against a state court and three state court judges for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Roolcer/Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stephens challenges the actions of the state court judges in state court proceedings relating to a long-running custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>dial dispute involving his severely disabled adult son. <em>See In re Interdiction of Stephens, </em>930 So.2d 1222 (La.Ct.App.2006). He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for appointment of counsel. Because Stephens\u2019s action clearly was barred by the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine, his case did not present exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Stephens\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Stephens moves for appointment of counsel on appeal, for oral argument, and for media to be present at oral argument. Those motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">This is at least Stephens\u2019s second attempt in federal court to overturn the adverse judgments of the Louisiana courts in his custodial dispute. See <em>Stephens v. 4th Judicial Court, </em>No. 9:01-CV-00193 (E.D.Tex. Oct. 10, 2001). Both of his federal cases were dismissed pursuant to the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine. Moreover, his most recent substantive custodial claims have been thoroughly considered by the Louisiana state courts. <em>See In re Interdiction of Stephens, </em>930 So.2d at 1224-29. Stephens is warned that frivolous appeals in the future will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
