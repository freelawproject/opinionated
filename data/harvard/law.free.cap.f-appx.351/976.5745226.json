The petitioners first argue that the IJ improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>discounted a recent State Department \u201ccountry report\u201d that the petitioners claim demonstrates worsening human rights conditions in Senegal. They also contend that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations regarding the petitioners were unfounded because the IJ allowed Government counsel to badger the petitioners during cross-examination and confuse them with questions about other petitioners\u2019 testimony. Finally, the petitioners argue that the IJ erred by misapplying the distinct legal standards of eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">This court lacks authority to review the IJ\u2019s alleged errors. \u201cWhen considering a petition for review, this court has the authority to review only the BIA\u2019s decision, not the IJ\u2019s decision, unless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Here, the BIA conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record and did not merely adopt the IJ\u2019s findings, so our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir.2002). The BIA tracked the IJ\u2019s findings, but it also assumed the truth of petitioners\u2019 testimony while concluding that the testimony was too vague and bereft of factual support for their claims of withholding or asylum. Consequently, in failing to challenge the BIA\u2019s decision, the petitioners have waived the only issues properly before this court. <em>See United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt has long been the rule in this circuit that any issues not briefed on appeal are waived.\u201d). Accordingly, the petition for review must be DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-25\">. Due to overlapping factual and legal issues, the petitioners' cases were consolidated in proceedings before the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
