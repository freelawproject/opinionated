Howell argues that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), when imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release, a district court may consider all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as set forth in \u00a7 3583(e)(3), except for \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e); 3553(a)(2)(A). He argues that the district court plainly erred when it considered the need to achieve just punishment when imposing his sentence following revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Howell acknowledges that he did not raise this argument in the district court and that review is limited to plain error. To show plain error, Howell must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">Howell has not shown that the district court plainly erred in considering the need to achieve \u201cjust punishment\u201d in imposing a sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. We have not previously reached this issue and there is a split of authority among other circuit courts regarding whether the need for just punishment can be considered. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>498 F.3d 393, 399-400 (6th Cir.2007). Thus, any error that there may have been in the district court\u2019s consideration of just punishment, an issue we do not decide here, was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 990, 128 S.Ct. 487, 169 L.Ed.2d 339 (2007); <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 455 (5th Cir.2005). In addition, if there was error, it did not affect Howell\u2019s substantial rights; the court gave him a sentence within the guidelines range, and Howell points to nothing to show that if the court had not considered the purportedly improper factor, his sentence likely would have been different. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
