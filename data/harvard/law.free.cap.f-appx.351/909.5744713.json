Because we find there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Eggins is not disabled, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">Eggins filed for Social Security benefits in June 2005, alleging disability due to sitting limitations, shortness of breath, nose bleeds, and migraine headaches beginning in March 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the Social Security Administration denied her applications for benefits both initially and on reconsideration, Eggins requested a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ found Eggins to be not entirely credible regarding the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her alleged medical symptoms. Furthermore, the ALJ gave little weight to the opinions of Eggins\u2019 treating physicians because none supported their opinions with clinical or examination evidence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ALJ noted that the examination evidence that was on record indicated minimal physical limitations in her lungs, hips and back. The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision, finding Eggins not disabled because she retained the ability to perform a modified range of light work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The Appeals Council denied Eggins\u2019 request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Eggins appealed to the district court. A magistrate judge recommended affirming the ALJ\u2019s final administrative decision; Eggins did not file an objection to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. The district court subsequently adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Eggins now appeals, arguing the district judge abused its discretion in denying her disability benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our task on appellate review is to examine whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In evaluating a disability claim, the ALJ conducts a five-step sequential analysis to determine whether \u201c(1) the claimant is presently working; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in appendix 1 of the social security regulations; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other substantial gainful activity.\u201d <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447-48 (5th Cir.2007). If, at any step, the claimant is determined to be disabled or not disabled, the determination is conclusive and the inquiry ends. <em>Id. </em>The burden of establishing disability rests with the claimant for the first four steps, and then shifts to the Commissioner to show that there is other substantial work in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform. <em>Id. </em>Once the Commissioner shows that a claimant is able to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to rebut this finding. <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461-62 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">First, Eggins contests the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider testimony from certain treating physicians that supports Eggins\u2019 claims of physical limitation. An \u201cALJ is free to reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Bowen, </em>809 F.2d 1054, 1057 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that none of Eggins\u2019 treating physicians have been able to support their opinions with objective medical findings. For example, Eggins\u2019 1993 letter from Dr. Hrishi Maewal stated she was unable to work due to \u201cchemical bronchitis,\u201d but was not accompanied by any objective clinical or examination findings showing any degree of impairment in Eggins\u2019 pulmonary functioning. Similarly, Eggins\u2019 treating physician, Dr. Clarence Brooks, wrote two letters in 2000 stating Plaintiff was \u201cpermanently disabled\u201d without identifying any particular medical condition that rendered her unable to work. Indeed, Dr. Brooks\u2019s treatment records from March 1995 through July 2000 contained no pulmonary studies or objective clinical or examination findings showing any degree of impairment in Eggins\u2019 pulmonary functioning other than instances of wheezing. The opinions of physicians at the Allergy Envi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>ronmental Clinic were equally conclusory and supported by only a few physical examinations, which in fact showed Eggins\u2019 chest to be clear. The physicians observed wheezing only with \u201cforced exhalation,\u201d indicating these symptoms were not present with normal activities. The ALJ was not required to give these opinions substantial weight. <em>See Perez, </em>415 F.3d at 466 (finding \u201cgood cause\u201d exceptions for giving less or no weight to treating physicians\u2019 opinions exceptions, such as \u201cstatements that are brief and conclusory, not supported by medically acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques, or otherwise unsupported by the evidence\u201d); <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Furthermore, the record shows substantial evidence that Eggins retained the residual functional capacity to perform work. Eggins\u2019 medical history presents numerous contradictory findings. For instance, although Eggins reported persistent pulmonary irritation originating from an exposure to harsh chemicals while on the job in 1991, a 1996 consultative examination showed her lungs were clear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A 2000 examination by Dr. Mark Dambro noted that Eggins\u2019 lungs were clear and her chest x-ray was negative. A 2001 examination by a pulmonary specialist also showed a clear chest x-ray, wheezing only with forced exhalation, and an unimpaired lung capacity<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 none of which are disabling symptoms that would prevent Eggins from performing certain jobs within her residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Second, Eggins argues that the ALJ failed to consider her mental limitations (depression and borderline intelligence) in finding that she could perform a modified range of light work activity. However, the ALJ acknowledged that Eggins suffered from depression and noted her treatment with therapist Maria Villarreal and her 2000 psychological consultive evaluation with Dr. James Cannici. Dr. Cannici concluded Eggins suffered from a single episode of major depression; he made \u201crule out\u201d impressions of somatoform disorder and borderline intellectual functioning. Nevertheless, the report did not indicate that these diagnoses adversely impacted Eggins\u2019 ability to perform a moderate range of light work activity. The ALJ accommodated Eggins\u2019 mental impairments in his decision, noting she would be \u201climited to unskilled work secondary to depression.\u201d Any argument that Eggins\u2019 \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d should be an independent basis for establishing an inability to work is not well taken. <em>See Selders v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 614, 619 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cBelow-average intelligence alone does not constitute a non-exertional impairment.\u201d) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 683, 686 (5th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Thus, substantial evidence \u2014 including the medical evidence on record, Eggins\u2019 lack of credibility as to the persistence and limiting effects of her physical symptoms, and the vocational expert\u2019s testimony regarding the type and number of jobs available for someone with Eggins\u2019 limitations \u2014 supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Eggins can perform jobs requiring a moderate range of light work activity and is therefore denied Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Sullivan, </em>898 F.2d 1045, 1048 (5th Cir.1990) (claimants bear the burden of establishing a disabling condition before the expiration of their insured status).

Under the \"Statement of Issues,\" Eggins purports to argue the district court abused its discretion in failing to issue a certificate of appealability. However, Eggins does not make any argument to support her contention. We treat issues which the appellant fails to properly argue in an appellate brief as abandoned. Fed.
