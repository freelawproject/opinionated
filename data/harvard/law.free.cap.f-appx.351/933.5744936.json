Douglas has failed to adequately brief his other contentions. <em>See, e.g., Perillo v. Johnson, </em>79 <em>F.3d </em>441, 443 n. 1 (5th Cir.1996) (holding attempts to incorporate by reference previous briefs are insufficient to preserve error); <em>Justiss Oil Co. v. Kerr-McGee Ref. Corp., </em>75 F.3d 1057, 1067 (5th Cir.1996) (holding a failure to \u201cadvance arguments in the body of [a] brief in support of an issue ... raised on appeal\u201d constitutes abandonment of that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">Our recent case law confirms the BIA correctly determined Douglas had committed an aggravated felony for immigration-law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). \u201c[A] second state possession offense that could have been punished as a felony under federal law qualifie[s] as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266-67. Because Douglas\u2019 second offense could have been prosecuted as a felony under federal law, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (setting out certain drug offenses and punishments), he was properly determined to be ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
