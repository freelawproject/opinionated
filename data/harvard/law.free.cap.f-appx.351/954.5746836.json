Alternatively, he urges reopening because exceptional circumstances caused his failure to appear and argues that the BIA should have equitably tolled the filing deadline applicable to motions to reopen on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-18\">After review of the record on appeal, we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Illescas\u2019s motion to reopen based upon lack of notice. The petition for review on this ground is denied. Further, Illescas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he did not raise the equitable tolling argument before the BIA. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the equitable tolling claim and we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b979-20\">The briefs and the record reveal a cluttered factual and procedural background, but the facts relevant to this appeal are as follows: Illescas is a native and citizen of Ecuador. On August 10, 1994, Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) agents arrested Illescas because he entered the United States without inspection. Illescas was released on bond on September 12, 1994. On October 11, 1994, the Immigration Court sent a Notice of Hearing in Deportation Proceedings (\u201cnotice\u201d) via certified mail to Illescas\u2019s counsel of record, Thelma Garcia (\u201cGarcia\u201d). Though Garcia was present, Illescas did not appear at his November 1, 1994, hearing and the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) subsequently ordered him deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-21\">On August 20, 2008, Illescas filed a motion to reopen,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that he lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>notice of the deportation hearing due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, Illescas claimed that Garcia never notified him of the deportation hearing date. The IJ denied the motion, the BIA dismissed Illescas\u2019s appeal, and Illescas brought the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Motions to reopen immigration proceedings are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, this court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir. 2005). Under this \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard, we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c \u2018capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 (quoting <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">\n<em>A. Lack of Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Because Illescas\u2019s hearing notice was served between June 13, 1992, and April 1, 1997, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b provides the applicable administrative procedures. <em>See In re Mancera-Monroy, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 79, 82 n. 1 (BIA 1998). Subsection (a)(2) requires that \u201cwritten notice [of the time and place of the deportation proceedings] shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien or to the alien\u2019s counsel of record, if any).... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2)(A) and (B). A deportation order may be entered <em>in absentia </em>\u201cafter written notice required under subsection (a)(2) of this section has been provided to the alien or the alien\u2019s counsel of record\u201d and the alien fails to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(l). Additionally, \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B) provides that a deportation order entered <em>in absentia </em>may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Illescas argues that, although notice to counsel is sufficient to justify the initial entry of an <em>in absentia </em>order under \u00a7 1252b(c)(l), \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B)\u2019s language with regard to reopening <em>in absentia </em>proceedings is more narrow. Illescas emphasizes that subsection (c)(3)(B) allows rescission of an order if \u201cthe alien did not receive notice,\u201d and Illescas contends that receipt of notice by counsel is not receipt by the alien. Accordingly, Illescas argues that Garcia\u2019s receipt of notice by certified mail does not disqualify him from reopening based upon lack of notice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">Illescas\u2019s position ignores the remaining language of subsection(e)(3)(B), which allows motions to reopen if \u201cthe alien did not receive notice in accordance <em>with subsection (a)(2).\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The plain language of subsection (a)(2) clearly contemplates that, when personal service on the alien is impracticable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> notice may be given \u201cto the alien <em>or the alien\u2019s counsel of record.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2)(A) and (B) (emphasis added). <em>See also Scorteanu v. INS, </em>339 F.3d 407, 411-12 (6th Cir.2003) (rejecting argument that subsection (c)(3)(B) renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>notice to counsel insufficient by referring to notice \u201cto the alien\u201d rather than \u201cto the alien or his counsel\u201d and holding that, per the statutory language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(2) and (c)(3)(B), the attorney\u2019s receipt of notice constitutes notice to the alien). Not surprisingly, Illeseas points to no cases supporting his contention that, in the reopening context, counsel\u2019s receipt of notice is not equivalent to the alien\u2019s receipt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Illeseas does not dispute Garcia\u2019s receipt of notice by certified mail, we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it found that Illeseas was properly provided with notice of his deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">\n<em>B. Exceptional Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Though Garcia\u2019s receipt of notice precludes Illescas\u2019s motion to reopen under \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B) for lack of notice, Illescas\u2019s claim that Garcia rendered ineffective assistance by failing to notify him of the deportation hearing may constitute \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranting reopening. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 391 (5th Cir.2001). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A) provides that a deportation order may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances .... \u201d Assuming without deciding that Illeseas can make out an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Illescas\u2019s August 20, 2008, motion to reopen on this ground was untimely because it was filed more than 180 days after the November 1, 1994, deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">On appeal, Illeseas asserts that the BIA wrongly concluded that the 180-day filing deadline could not be equitably tolled. However, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the issue because Illeseas never presented his claim for equitable tolling to the BIA and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.2009). <em>See also Joumaa v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 244, 246 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Mahamat v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1281, 1283 (10th Cir.2005). Accordingly, this portion of Illescas\u2019s appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">For the foregoing reasons, Illescas\u2019s petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-22\">. The IJ denied an earlier-filed motion to reopen on May 19, 2008, but this decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>not appealed to the BIA and is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\">. Personal service is deemed impracticable when the respondent is not in immigration court before the IJ. <em>In re Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27, 35 (BIA 1995). Illescas does not contend that he should have been personally served.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-7\">. Illeseas cites this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009), to support his proposition that the alien, not the alien's attorney, must \"actually receive\u201d notice. In accordance with <em>GomezPalacios, </em>Illeseas correctly states that the inquiry when considering a motion to reopen is whether the alien actually received notice, not whether notice was properly mailed. In <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>neither the alien nor an attorney of record received the mailed notice. However, the issue in this case is not whether actual receipt is required but whether <em>counset's </em>actual receipt-which is undisputed-satisfies the statutory requirements of notice to the alien. The plain language of \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B) indicates that notice to counsel is sufficient, and <em>Gomez-Palacios </em>does not hold otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b981-15\">. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir.2000) (upholding the BIA's use of the procedural requirements articulated in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
