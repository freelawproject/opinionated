The district court found that Delguidice\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was not properly filed under Florida state rules, and thus, was untimely under the one-year statute of limitations of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). There is no dispute that Delguidice filed his first, and unsworn, Rule 3.850 motion before the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations was set to expire, and that he filed an amended, and sworn, Rule 3.850 motion after the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">On appeal, Delguidice argues that his unsworn Rule 3.850 motion was properly filed, because it was accepted by the state court and not dismissed as improperly filed for lacking verification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that, under Florida rules, the oath requirement need not be fulfilled at the time a motion is filed, and that other state rules allow for post-conviction motions to be amended at any time. He also argues that the oath requirement is not a rule that is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d so his Rule 3.850 motion was still \u201cproperly filed.\u201d He alternatively asserts equitable tolling and \u201cactual innocence\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claims to overcome any time-bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a federal habeas petition, including the determination that a petition is time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) and is not subject to equitable tolling. See <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (time-barred); <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (equitable tolling). A district court\u2019s findings of fact, including whether a party acted diligently, are reviewed under the clear error standard. <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1283. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this court. <em>Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The AEDPA establishes a one-year statute of limitations for filing \u00a7 2254 petitions, which begins to run following the latest of four events, one of which is the day that the judgment becomes \u201cfinal.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The judgment becomes final on the day which the United States Supreme Court issues a decision on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, denies <em>certiorari, </em>or after the expiration of the 90 days in which the petitioner could file a petition for <em>certiorari. Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 773-74 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Under either trigger date, the limitations period is tolled during the time \u201ca <em>properly filed </em>application for State post-conviction or other collateral review ... is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (emphasis added). Although the federal statute does not define \u201cproperly filed,\u201d the Supreme Court has construed those words. <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000); <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Specifically, \u201can application is <em>\u2018properly </em>filed\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Artuz, </em>531 U.S. at 8, 121 S.Ct. at 364. The <em>Artuz </em>Court explained that the laws and rules about filings \u201cusually prescribe, for example, the form of the document, the time limits upon its delivery [and] the court and office in which it must be lodged....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 121 S.Ct. at 364. Moreover, an application that was erroneously accepted without complying with procedural requirements will be pending, but it will not be \u201cproperly filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 121 S.Ct. at 364. \u201cQuite simply, the Supreme Court said that \u2018when a post-conviction petition is untimely under state law, that is the end of the matter for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2),\u2019 because, \u2018time limits, no matter their form, are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sweet v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>467 F.3d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 414, 417, 125 S.Ct. at 1812, 1814) (alterations omitted). Under <em>Artuz, </em>we give \u201cdue deference\u201d to state procedural rules governing filings to determine whether an application for state post-conviction relief is \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), <em>see Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1260 (11th Cir.2004), but those rules must be \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d <em>see Siebert v. Campbell, </em>334 F.3d 1018, 1025 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In Florida, a state prisoner may file a post-conviction motion challenging his conviction within two years from entry of a final judgment in a noncapital case. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(b). The Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure require that a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence be under oath. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. The Rules also require that motions for post-conviction relief be \u201clegibly handwritten or typewritten,\u201d signed by the defendant and contain a notarized oath. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.987. Alternatively, Rule 3.987 allows the defendant to include an unnotarized oath, which states that \u201c[u]n-der penalties of perjury, I declare that I have read the foregoing motion and that the facts stated in it are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The two-year period allowed for filing a Florida post-conviction motion does not expand the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations period. <em>Tinker v. Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2001). Importantly, a state post-conviction motion is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) if it fails to comply with Florida\u2019s written oath requirement. <em>Hurley, </em>233 F.3d at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Melson v. Allen, </em>548 F.3d 993 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 254, 175 L.Ed.2d 173 (2009), we held that an inmate\u2019s state post-conviction motion, which was dismissed by the state court for failure to comply with the rule requiring verification, was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of the tolling provision of the one-year limitations period for federal habeas corpus petitions, regardless of the fact that the verification requirement was non-jurisdictional, subject to waiver, and curable by amendment. Melson, 548 F.3d at 997 (\u201c \u2018[N]o matter their form\u2019 and regardless of whether they are \u2018jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between,\u2019 state rules which establish filing conditions fall within the meaning of \u2018properly filed\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d) (quoting <em>Allen v. Siebert, </em>552 U.S. 3, 5-7,128 S.Ct. 2, 4,169 L.Ed\u00fcd 329 (2007)) (alterations omitted). We also held that the inmate\u2019s amended state post-conviction motion, which corrected the verification deficiencies of the previously filed motion, but was filed after expiration of the one-year AEDPA limitations period, did not toll the limitations period, as the limitations period had already expired. <em>Id. </em>at 998. Moreover, we held that the inmate could not \u201cattempt to resurrect a terminated statute of limitations by subsequently filing documents that purport to \u2018relate back\u2019 to previously submitted documents that were, in themselves, insufficient to toll the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sibley, </em>377 F.3d at 1204).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u201cEquitable tolling can be applied to prevent the application of the AEDPA\u2019s statutory deadline when \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 have worked to prevent an otherwise diligent petitioner from timely filing his petition.\u201d <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1286 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Equitable toiling is an extraordinary remedy that is typically applied sparingly, and only when a petitioner establishes that he did not timely file a petition because of \u201cextraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In the absence of a showing of diligence, a petitioner is not entitled to equitable relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Although the record demonstrates that the state court accepted Delguidice\u2019s first post-conviction motion and the state court did not dismiss it as improperly filed, we conclude that, it was not \u201cproperly filed,\u201d because it failed to comply with Florida\u2019s written oath requirement. Delguidice has not demonstrated that the oath requirement is a rule that is not \u201cfirmly established and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>regularly followed.\u201d To the extent that Florida requirements were \u201cnon-jurisdictional, subject to waiver, and curable by amendment,\u201d the oath requirement is a filing condition that falls within the meaning of \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Consequently, while his amended motion, which corrected the verification deficiencies of his previously filed motion, was submitted within the two-year limitations period under Florida rules, the Florida Rules do not expand the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations period, and do not resurrect an expired limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Additionally, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Delguidice was not diligent in filing his post-conviction motion within the one-year AEDPA deadline, as he waited until two days before the expiration of that deadline to file his first Rule 3.850 motion. There was no evidence that he was prevented from filing his federal habeas petition on time, and the other reasons provided by Delguidice do not constitute extraordinary circumstances. As such, because Delguidice was not diligent in pursuing his post-conviction claims, the district court properly denied him the extraordinary remedy of equitable tolling. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">. Delguidice also argues that his attorney's signature on his Rule 3.850 motion satisfied Florida\u2019s oath requirement. He did not raise this argument below, and, therefore, it is waived. <em>See Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">. We decline to address the actual innocence claim, because the district court\u2019s Certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of Appealability (\"COA\u201d) did not include this issue, <em>see, e.g., Kuenzel v. Allen, </em>488 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2007) (declining to address a petitioner\u2019s actual innocence claim because the COA did not include this issue), and because we have never held that an actual innocence exception exists to the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations, <em>see, e.g., Sibley v. Gulliver, </em>377 F.3d 1196, 1205 (11th Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, because the evidence that Delguidice relies on was previously presented at his trial in state court, it is not \"newly discovered,\u201d and, therefore, does not support an actual innocence claim. <em>See Sib-ley, </em>377 F.3d at 1205 (holding that, before addressing whether such an exception exists, an inmate must first raise \"new facts\u201d and demonstrate that, in light of the new evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
