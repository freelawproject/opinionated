Because the BIA adopted the ruling of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In 1990, Leon-Medina was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d). In 1995, he pleaded guilty of one count of illegal transportation of aliens in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the allegations in the criminal complaint, Leon-Medina, while in Mexico, agreed to transport eight illegal aliens to Dallas, Texas, from an undetermined location; he was apprehended while transporting them within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In 2005, Leon-Medina was detained while attempting to reenter the United States from Mexico. Although the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) initially charged him with being inadmissible to the United States, it subsequently charged him with being removable from the United States because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony based on his conviction of illegal transportation of aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Leon-Medina admitted that he was removable as charged, and he sought cancellation of removal under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), which, before its repeal, was codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Leon-Medina asserted that he should not have been admitted to the United States and should have been in proceedings regarding his admissibility to the United States, not proceedings regarding his removal therefrom. The IJ rejected that argument, because a different IJ had already granted Leon-Medina bond, which would not have been allowed if he were inadmissible, and because illegal transportation of aliens within the United States is not a ground for inadmissibility. The IJ ruled that Leon-Medina was ineligible for cancellation of removal under former \u00a7 212(c), because he was removable on account of an aggravated felony conviction for which there was no corresponding ground of inadmissibility or statutory counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Leon-Medina timely appealed to the BIA, arguing that his conviction of illegally transporting aliens in violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) is an aggravated felony alien smuggling offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) that has an inadmissibility statutory counterpart in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, rendering him eligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c). He additionally asserted that the IJ improperly relied on ICE\u2019s decision to charge him with being removable instead of being inadmissible and improperly considered the bond ruling to be a binding determination that he was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">The BIA ruled that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae is not the statutory counterpart to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), because the two provisions use dissimilar language and do not describe equivalent categories of offenses. The BIA determined that a conviction of a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), standing alone, will not support a charge of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, because such a conviction concerns the transportation of aliens who were already in the United States. The BIA noted that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae is the statutory counterpart to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae, making it less likely that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae is the statutory counterpart to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s ruling and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">In this court, Leon-Medina argues that the BIA and IJ erred by ruling that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>is no inadmissibility statutory counterpart to his conviction under \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), because \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is such a statutory counterpart. He maintains that the two statutory subsections are counterparts for purposes of former INA \u00a7 212(c) eligibility, because both concern the same category of offenses, alien smuggling. Citing <em>Soriano v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 318, 320-21 (5th Cir.2007), Leon-Medina asserts that the BIA erred by ruling that a conviction for a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), standing alone, will not support a charge of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). He contends that the BIA erred by analyzing whether \u00a7 1182(a) (6) (E) (i) is the statutory counterpart to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), because the proper issue for analysis is whether \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is the statutory counterpart to \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Leon-Medina maintains that the ruling of the BIA is not entitled to deference, because the statutory provisions are unambiguous, and the BIA\u2019s ruling is unreasonable. He argues that the IJ\u2019s ruling was erroneous, because (1) the IJ determined that transporting aliens illegally within the United States is not alien smuggling, (2) the IJ relied on ICE\u2019s decision to charge him with being removable as opposed to inadmissible, and (3) the IJ improperly allowed the implication of the bond determination to control his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">We review legal arguments <em>de novo. See Beltran-Resendez v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2000). We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if that interpretation is reasonable. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006). Deference is not owed to the BIA\u2019s interpretation, however, if Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and the intent of Congress is clear. <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 542-43 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Before its repeal, former INA \u00a7 212(c) provided that aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad and who were not under an order of removal could be admitted at the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to any specified ground of inadmissibility in \u00a7 1182(a). <em>See In re Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26, 27 (BIA 1976). Although the statute was addressed to aliens in exclusion proceedings, it was interpreted by the BIA as also allowing the Attorney General to consider waivers from LPR\u2019s in removal proceedings who were similarly situated to aliens in exclusion proceedings. <em>Id. </em>To determine whether a removee was \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to a person in exclusion proceedings, the BIA set forth a \u201ccomparable grounds\u201d test that asked whether the ground of removal was also a ground of inadmissibility. <em>See In re Wadud, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 182, 184-85 (BIA 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">In 1996, Congress repealed former INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>Alvarez-Hernandez v. Acosta, </em>401 F.3d 327, 329 (5th Cir.2005). In 2001, however, the Court held in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), that relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) remained available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding their convictions, would have been eligible for former INA \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their guilty pleas. <em>Hernandez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 517-18 (citing <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">The availability of a former INA \u00a7 212(c) waiver thus revived, in 2004, the BIA-promulgated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5), which provides that a LPR is ineligible for a former INA \u00a7 212(c) waiver if the alien is removable on a ground that does not have a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 1182. Thus, under the BIA\u2019s comparable ground analysis (also known as the statutory counterpart rule), an alien who is removable on a ground that does not have a correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ing ground of inadmissibility is ineligible for former INA \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Vue v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 858, 860 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">There is no ground of inadmissibility in \u00a7 1182(a) that excludes aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies. <em>See In re Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257, 259 (BIA 1991). This, however, does not preclude an alien who is removable on account of an aggravated felony conviction from being eligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>Id. </em>Instead, eligibility for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) for an alien who is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony depends on whether the category of aggravated felony for which he was convicted has an inadmissibility statutory counterpart. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Following the revival of former INA \u00a7 212(c) relief in <em>St. Cyr, </em>the BIA reaffirmed that the procedure set forth in <em>Meza </em>is the proper method for determining whether an alien who is removable because of an aggravated felony conviction is eligible to seek relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>See In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 724-29 (BIA 2005), <em>petition for review granted and remanded, Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007). This court has upheld the procedure set forth in <em>Blake. Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 368-72 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Therefore, the pertinent issue is whether there is a comparable ground of inadmissibility, i.e., an inadmissibility statutory counterpart, to the category of aggravated felony conviction for which Leon-Medina was adjudged removable. <em>See id. </em>at 368. Leon-Medina\u2019s argument that the pertinent issue is whether his actual crime, not the category of his aggravated felony conviction, has an inadmissibility statutory counterpart is without merit. <em>See Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 259; <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 726-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">For the same reason, Leon-Medina\u2019s reliance on <em>Soriano </em>is misplaced. There, we held that an alien who had been convicted of transporting illegal aliens within the United States was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) because his conduct included participation \u201cin a scheme to aid other aliens in an illegal entry.\u201d <em>Soriano, </em>484 F.3d at 320-21. Because the court in <em>Sonano </em>merely ruled that the alien\u2019s conduct fell within the ambit of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) and did not address whether \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is the statutory counterpart of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), it is not controlling in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Whether a ground for \u201cremoval has a statutory counterpart in the provisions for exclusion or inadmissibility turns on whether Congress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.\u201d <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 728. There must be \u201ca close textual link\u201d between the ground of removal and the ground of inadmissibility to establish that the ground of inadmissibility is a statutory counterpart. <em>Vo, </em>482 F.3d at 368. That there is some overlap between the crimes comprising the category of aggravated felony and the ground of inadmissibility is insufficient to show that the ground of inadmissibility is a statutory counterpart. <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 728</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The category of Leon-Medina\u2019s aggravated felony conviction is \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), which provides that convictions for violations of \u201cparagraph (1)(A) or (2) of section 1324(a) of this title (relating to alien smuggling)\u201d are aggravated felony convictions except when the alien\u2019s offense consists solely of assisting his spouse, child, or parent. The statutory subsection that Leon-Medina asserts is the inadmissibility counterpart, \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00a9, is titled \u201cSmugglers,\u201d and it provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The BIA ruled that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is not the statutory counterpart of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), because (1) the statutory subsections use dissimilar language, (2) \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) includes offenses concerning aliens who were already in the United States but \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) does not, and (3) \u00a7 1182(a) (6) (E) (i) is the statutory counterpart of \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">[a]ny alien who (prior to the date of entry, at the time of any entry, or within 5 years of the date of any entry) knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is deportable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The BIA properly applied its comparability analysis in this case. The language used in \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) and 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae is distinct. Section 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae does not include offenses regarding aliens already within the United States, but \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) does. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A). The BIA appears to be correct that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae more closely corresponds to \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae than to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). Identical language in the two provisions renders both deportable and inadmissible \u201c[a]ny alien who ... knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae. The BIA thus correctly concluded that Congress intended the aggravated felony deportability ground at \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) to \u201cserve difference purposes and encompass a different class of conduct\u201d from \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae and 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Leon-Medina has not shown that the BIA erred by holding that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal under former INA \u00a7 212(c). Because this precludes him from receiving relief, we do not reach his remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
