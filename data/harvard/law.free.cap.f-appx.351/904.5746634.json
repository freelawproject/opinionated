Simpson, who has been convicted in state court of possession of controlled substances on more than one occasion since his admission to the United States, contends that none of his convictions constitutes an aggravated felony in its own right. He argues that he should not be deemed an aggravated felon based on his recidivism because he was not convicted of a recidivist offense in state court. Simpson also argues that the rule of lenity should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">The BIA correctly determined that Simpson had committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). The rule of lenity is not applicable given this court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 268 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Simpson\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
