The Appeals Council denied Parisi\u2019s request for administrative review. The ALJ decision hinged on its finding that Parisi was not disabled because she retained the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work The ALJ decision is based on its conclusion at step four of the five-step sequential evaluation found in the Social Security regulations for assessing disability claims. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-24\">Having reviewed the record and arguments presented in the briefs we are convinced the ALJ applied the proper legal standards in its analysis and that the decision that Parisi was not disabled under the Social Security Act is based on substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the District Court upholding the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
