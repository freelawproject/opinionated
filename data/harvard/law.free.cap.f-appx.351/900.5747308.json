Prior to trial, Banks pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of Sections 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). The district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 360 months for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and 240 months for distribution of cocaine base. We previously affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal, rejecting, among other points, the argument that due to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court committed plain error when it found certain facts relative to sentencing. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>138 Fed.Appx. 622, 625, 628 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Banks filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied. The district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility on Banks\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s failure to raise an objection to the district court\u2019s findings of drug type and quantity pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Whether counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the <em>Booker </em>issue by making an <em>Ap-prendi </em>objection constituted ineffective assistance was recently addressed in <em>United States v. Fields, </em>565 F.3d 290, 293-97 (5th Cir.2009). At the time of Banks\u2019s sentencing, the law of this circuit was settled that <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 295; <em>United States v. Randle, </em>304 F.3d 373, 378 (5th Cir.2002). The failure of counsel to anticipate that <em>Booker </em>would apply the rule of <em>Apprendi </em>to the Sentencing Guidelines or to predict \u201cthe absolute sea-change in federal sentencing wrought by <em>Booker </em>\u201d does not constitute constitutionally ineffective assistance. <em>Fields, </em>565 F.3d at 295-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">Contrary to Bank\u2019s argument, the district court did not err by denying his motion without a hearing. The facts relevant to this case are essentially undisputed and are conclusive in showing that Banks is not entitled to relief. <em>See United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
