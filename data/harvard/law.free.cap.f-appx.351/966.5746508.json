The Government moves for summary affirmance or dismissal of the appeal, or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Section 3582(e)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. GonzalezBalderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Amendment 599 became effective in 2000, five years before Laffoon was sentenced. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., app. C, Amendment 599. The presentence report reflected application of Amendment 599 in determining his sentencing range, which was adopted by the district court. Because Laffoon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not based on a sentencing range that was \u201csubsequently\u201d lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the district court did not err in denying the motion. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-14\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
