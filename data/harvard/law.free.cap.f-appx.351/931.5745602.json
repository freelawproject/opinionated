Dotson, Jr., federal prisoner # 0354-095, pleaded guilty to distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>of cocaine base and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine. He was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which was based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine. The district court reduced Dotson\u2019s sentence to 120 months, the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Dotson argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced further pursuant to Amendment 709, which addressed two areas of the Guidelines\u2019 criminal history rules. Amendment 709 is not listed by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as a Guideline amendment that applies retroactively. Dotson argues that the district court was not limited by the Guidelines\u2019 list of retroactively applicable amendments because, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Guidelines are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10. Therefore, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c) dictated that the district court was not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B.10, comment, (n.1); \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, this court has held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of Guideline \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Dotson has not shown that the district court erred in granting his motion and reducing his sentence to 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
