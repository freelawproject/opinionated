Vora appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) her \u201cpetition for removal\u201d filed on June 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">Vora filed a \u201cpetition for removal\u201d in the District Court seeking that all charges against her be dismissed. She sought federal court oversight of and protection from \u201cconspirators,\u201d including Cambria County police officers and the magisterial district court, who allegedly preyed on her obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>disability and issued false citations against her, demanding that she pay overdue fines and costs to the county despite her inability to pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She claimed that racial and religious bigotry and disregard for her age of 74 years, her handicapped condition, and her gender motivated these charges. In her petition, Vora attached a police criminal complaint dated April 29, 2009, filed by Johnstown Police Officer Killinger, which charged Vora with loitering and prowling at nighttime, disorderly conduct, interfering with the contents of a trash receptacle and scattering rubbish. She also included a summons and notice of a preliminary hearing before District Judge Michael Musulin regarding the aforementioned complaint and several letters from the Cambria Court of Common Pleas concerning past due court ordered costs, fines and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The District Court concluded that the \u201cPetition for Removal\u201d sought to attack state court proceedings over which the District Court had no jurisdiction. Vora filed a timely motion to vacate, in which she reasserted, inter alia, that she was struck by Officer Killinger on April 29, 2009, and that she suffered a perforated ear drum as a result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She attached a medical report dated June 10, 2009. <em>(See </em>Motion to Vacate at 12.) The District Court denied the motion. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Vora has been granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. Because her appeal from the dismissal of her petition for removal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">After reviewing the District Court pleadings and notice of appeal, we conclude as a matter of law that her petition was correctly denied. Vora petitioned for removal, presumably under the civil rights removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. The civil rights removal statute applies only to the removal of state court proceedings. <em>Id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(a). We doubt that any of the proceedings Vora seeks to remove qualifies as a state court proceeding. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the civil rights removal statute applies to the Johnstown Police complaint, the summons to a preliminary hearing before a district judge, and the letters concerning overdue costs, fines and fees, Vora\u2019s rambling, generalized, and unsupported allegations do not meet the specific criteria for \u00a7 1443 removal. <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 827, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966); <em>Ronan v. Stone, </em>396 F.2d 502, 503 (1st Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Having found no legal merit to this cause, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Vora\u2019s motions for injunction, \u201cto move the case,\u201d and for a stay are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">. Vora believes that the appellees are well aware that her physically disabled condition and her overall health condition \"are extremely bad\u201d because her \"neurologic pains,\u201d she believes, \"are much worse than [the type of pain associated with] cancer.\u201d <em>(See </em>Petition for removal, at 2.) She attached to her petition a copy of a medical report from 2005. <em>(Id. </em>at 86.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\">. We note that Vora\u2019s allegations that Officer Killinger assaulted her in April 2009 and continues to harass her by using his cruiser to prevent her from passing on the street and sidewalk, although troubling, were not raised in a complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
