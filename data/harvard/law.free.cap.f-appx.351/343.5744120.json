The district court dismissed Keira\u2019s amended complaint on four independent grounds: (1) a lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) a failure to comply with Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a); (3) a failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b); and (4) a failure to comply with a previous contempt order that required Keira to file a copy of the order with all future complaints filed in the Southern District of Florida. Construed liberally, Keira\u2019s appeal brief argues that: (1) the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claim; (2) his complaint was plain in accordance with Rule 8(a); and (3) his complaint was not confusing in accordance with Rule 10(b). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ochran v. United States, </em>273 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). We read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 74, 172 L.Ed.2d 67 (2008). However, even <em>pro se </em>petitioners can abandon claims by not raising issues in their initial brief. <em>Id. </em>In liberally construing whether a <em>pro se </em>appellant has raised an issue for appeal, we will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel for the appellant or otherwise rewrite a deficient pleading. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">As an initial matter, we agree with Keira that the federal district court had jurisdiction over Keira\u2019s claim. The Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) is granted jurisdiction to administer the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(a), the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(b), and the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance (\u201cFEGLI\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8716. Administrative actions or orders arising under CSRS or FERS are appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8347(d)(1) (CSRS), 8461(e)(1) (FERS). Jurisdiction over decisions rendered by the MSPB rests exclusively with the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">FEGLI, on the other hand, is governed by Chapter 87, which does not grant jurisdiction to the MSPB. Instead, Chapter 87 states, \u201c[t]he district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of a civil action or claim against the United States founded on this chapter.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8715. Thus, \u201cthe district courts and the Court of Federal Claims have jurisdiction of a claim against the Government ... under the life insurance act to the extent that the claim can be shown to involve some right created by that Act and a breach by the Government of some duty with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>301 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>F.3d 1352, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2002) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As applied here, Keira\u2019s claim for relief arises under the FEGLI. As <em>Lewis </em>makes clear, the district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over claims arising under the FEGLI. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district court erroneously dismissed Keira\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Nonetheless, we find no merit to Keira\u2019s claim on appeal. Keira has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s order dismissing his amended complaint for failure to comply with a previous contempt order. On appeal, the only somewhat related issue Keira challenges is the district court\u2019s imposition of a $1,500 bond, which the district court never actually imposed. Thus, there is simply nothing in Keira\u2019s brief that we can construe to raise this argument, without becoming Keira\u2019s <em>de facto </em>counsel. Accordingly, because this was an independent ground for dismissal, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Keira\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
