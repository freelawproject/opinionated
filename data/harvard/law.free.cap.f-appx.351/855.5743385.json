Maya, and alleged that Bertucci Industrial Services (\u201cBertucci\u201d) failed to fulfill a contract to clean the holds of the Maya, thereby damaging the Owners. After Bertucci prevailed on summary judgment, the Owners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>successfully appealed and had the case remanded to the district court. The district court\u2019s bench trial resolved in favor in Bertucci, and the Owners now appeal again. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The parties do not dispute this case\u2019s material facts, which the prior opinion details in full. <em>Butterfly Transp. Corp. v. Bertucci Indus. Servs., </em>243 Fed.Appx. 16 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished). The dispute continues to revolve around Bertucci\u2019s bid \u2014 \u201cWe offer a no cure no pay price of $145,000.00 to obtain passes for loading for USDA and NCB. We estimate the project will require 5 to 6 days for cleaning, but do not guarantee the number of days. This rate includes a crane barge to place the man-lifts in each cargo hold as well as the gear and chemicals required during mobilization.\u201d' \u2014 -and the Owners\u2019 \u201cConfirmation of Order\u201d \u2014 \u201c[W]e hereby confirm our acceptance of Bertucci ... to carry out cleaning and preparing all ship\u2019s cargo holds (8 cai\u2019go holds) for grain loading. Work to commence immediately and to terminate with issuing NCB and USDA holds acceptance certificate for loading grains.\u201d After the district court granted Bertucci\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Owners appealed, and a panel of this Court reversed the district court\u2019s order and remanded the case to the district court for determination of the contractual intent of the parties, and for consideration of the implied warranty claim. <em>Id. </em>The district court then held a bench trial, concluded that Bertucci was not liable to the Owners for damages, and entered a final judgment from which the Owners now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">\n<em>A. Intent of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The Owners first assert that the district court erred in ruling that the parties did not intend for Bertucci to remove all residues of prior cargoes. The district court concluded that the parties intended to obligate Bertucci to remove the amount of residue necessary to obtain the requisite operating certificates. The Owners contend that Bertucci had an obligation to remove all cargo residues from the holds. We review the findings of fact from a bench trial for clear error, and will \u201creverse only if we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Canal Barge Co. v. Torco Oil Co., </em>220 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">To support their assertion, the Owners rely on the testimony of Captain George Maroulis, who testified that the intended meaning of the Confirmation of Order \u201cwas not only to get the certificates issued, but to clean the holds up to the grain standards.\u201d He further explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ9K\">We believe that Bertucci ... understood what we meant when saying that we were in need of USDA certificate. What we meant was to clean the holds, all of the holds from top to bottom, to a certain extent, to the level that they would be appropriate for grain loading with no cargo damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">In contrast, Captain Alexander Dublen-nykh testified that once the USDA and NCB issued the certificates approving the holds for grain loading, neither the ship\u2019s crew nor Bertucci would be obligated to conduct further cleaning on any of the holds. Captain Dublennykh also testified that he was not going to double-check the cleanliness of the Maya\u2019s cargo holds after he received the certificates approving the holds for grain loading. Captain Elias Katsaros confirmed that Bertucci\u2019s work would end once the USDA and NCB issued their certificates, and he also stated, \u201cWhen the cleaning firm gets the passes from [the] USDA and NCB, that\u2019s the time when always their services are terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ed.\u201d Even though the testimony of Captain Maroulis may conflict with the testimony of Captain Dublennykh and Captain Katsaros, \u201c[w]e cannot second guess the district court\u2019s decision to believe one wit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ness\u2019fs] testimony over another\u2019s or to discount a witnesses] testimony.\u201d Moreover, Bertucci\u2019s work under the contract was \u201cto commence immediately and to terminate with issuing NCB and USDA holds acceptance certificate for loading grains .... with top priority to reduce delay for this cleaning operation.\u201d In light of the evidence favoring Bertucci\u2019s interpretation, we are not convinced that the district court committed any clear error when it rejected the Owners\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">\n<em>B. Implied Warranty of Workmanlike Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The Owners initially claim that the district construed the implied warranty of workmanlike performance erroneously, emphasizing that more than mere reasonable care is required. We review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Canal Barge Co., </em>220 F.3d at 375. Even though we have questioned the propriety of employing the implied warranty of workmanlike performance as the model for indemnification in non-personal-injury contexts, <em>see Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. M/V Incotrans Spirit, </em>998 F.2d 316, 319 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Bosnor, S.A. DE C.V. v. Tug L.A. Barrios, </em>796 F.2d 776, 785-86 (5th Cir.1986), we need not address that question here because, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the warranty should apply, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s holding that Bertucci failed to satisfy the warranty\u2019s elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">To recover from a contractor for breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike performance, a shipowner must prove that the contractor breached the warranty, and that the breach proximately caused the injury. <em>Parfait v. Jahncke Serv., Inc., </em>484 F.2d 296, 302 (5th Cir. 1973). More specifically, the essence of a contractor\u2019s obligation is the duty to perform the contract\u2019s obligations \u201cproperly and safely.\u201d <em>Parfait, </em>484 F.2d at 301 (quoting <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124, 133, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956)); <em>Garner v. Cities Serv. Tankers Corp., </em>456 F.2d 476, 481 (5th Cir.1972). In particular, <em>Ryan </em>concluded a party could not breach the duty if it performed the \u201cessence\u201d or \u201cinescapable elements\u201d of a contract. <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co., </em>350 U.S. at 133, 76 S.Ct. 232. Thus, Bertucci was obligated to properly perform \u201cthe essence\u201d or \u201cinescapable elements\u201d of its contract with the Owners, which in this case involved cleaning the holds enough to obtain the necessary certificates. The district court considered <em>both </em>a general standard of reasonable care and the contract\u2019s specific obligations when it considered how well Bertucci had cleaned the holds and whether Bertucci removed enough residue to obtain the necessary certificates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Owners\u2019 argument regarding the district court\u2019s failure to apply the appropriate legal standard for the implied warranty fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>The Owners next contend the district court erred in finding that Bertucci fulfilled the warranty, an issue that we review for clear error by giving \u201cdue regard\u201d to the district court\u2019s assessment of witnesses\u2019 credibility, <em>Canal Barge Co., </em>220 F.3d at 375 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)). The district court found credible the testimony of Bertucei\u2019s lead supervisor, Lawrence Murphy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had been involved personally in the ship cleaning business since 1963. Murphy testified to the equipment, materials, labor, and cleaning operations used in preparing the Maya\u2019s cargo holds for inspection; testified that he and his crew inspected and cleaned \u201cevery inch\u201d of all the Maya\u2019s cargo holds, including hold number two, the only one of the eight cargo holds in which damaged cargo was found; testified that the captain, chief mate, or a representative of the Maya was present with him when evaluating a cargo hold\u2019s condition after cleaning; and described the testing and cleaning operations used on an area in which he doubted the area\u2019s cleanliness. Based on this evidence, the district court concluded that Bertucci cleaned the holds \u201cwith sufficient amount of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Finally, after determining that the parties intended for Bertucci to remove enough residue to obtain the necessary certificates, the district court considered the issuance of USDA and NCB certificates as evidence that Bertucci satisfied the warranty. The Owners argue that the two USDA surveyors could not have performed an adequate inspection of the eight holds in one hour, and that \u201cthere was no direct evidence of what the inspectors actually did or did not do.\u201d However, the Owners\u2019 own witness, Captain Maroulis, testified he had never seen the USDA issue a certificate for cargo hold cleanliness where the USDA inspectors did not inspect the entire hold. Likewise, Captain Katsaros testified that USDA and NCB inspectors do not issue certificates certifying cargo holds as suitable for loading unless cargo hold preparation is 100 percent complete. In light of this evidence, we are not convinced that the district court clearly erred in relying on the issuance of USDA and NCB certificates in its assessment of the warranty, and are not convinced that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that Bertucci satisfied the implied warranty of workmanlike performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b880-13\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. The Owners fail to explain how or if the \u201creasonable care\u201d standard differs from our standard requiring proper performance under a contract. Specifically, the district court stated that an implied warranty of workmanlike performance means \"performing work <em>properly </em>under [the] contract.\u201d The district court also stated that under the implied warranty of workmanlike performance Bertucci owed the Owners \u201ca duty of reasonable care in performing any services,\" and the court concluded that Bertucci performed its contractual duties \u201cwith sufficient amount of care.\u201d These statements show that the district court defined the Implied warranty of workmanlike performance as performing contractual duties \u201cproperly\u201d and with \"reasonable care.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. We find unpersuasive the Owners\u2019 assertion that the district court deemed Murphy\u2019s testimony credible \"in an obvious attempt to insulate its findings from appellate review.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
