Before this court \u2014 as before the Tax Court \u2014 the Willises claim that the Paperwork Reduction Act protects them from fines and other penalties for failing timely to file them Form 1040 tax return. Our court\u2019s binding precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>forecloses their argument, so we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Willises have stipulated that they did not timely file their tax returns, so only a question of law remains: Does the Paperwork Reduction Act relieve taxpayers from their burden to pay accrued interest and penalties on their overdue tax returns? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The Paperwork Reduction Act states that \u201cno person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that ... does not display a valid control number ... or [for which] the agency fails to inform the person who is to respond ... that such person is not required to respond ... unless it displays a valid control number.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Willises contend that Tax Form 1040 \u2014 -the form they should have filed \u2014 does not in various ways comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Consequently, they claim that the government cannot subject them to \u201cany penalty\u201d for failing to submit their information.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">This court has held to the contrary. Indeed, we have stated that \u201cthe Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the statutory requirement that a taxpayer must file a return.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over the years, this court has uniformly reaffirmed that holding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Willises protest that because they face a civil penalty \u2014 in contrast to the criminal penalties imposed on the appellants in our previous cases \u2014 the precedent does not control. Any such distinction is both illogical and unsupported by the text of the Paperwork Reduction Act, which uses the generic term \u201cany penalty\u201d \u2014 so we reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
