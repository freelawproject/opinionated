Maringo also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to recuse. Finally, Maringo has moved to consolidate this case with his appeal in case no. 07-60431, which pertains to his removal from the United States and the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Maringo\u2019s complaint in the instant case alleged that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) failed to timely satisfy his request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). His first motion to recuse contended that the district court judge was biased and hostile to his interest and that she was \u201cprobably a CIA operative\u201d based on her high denial rate in immigration cases, and his second motion to recuse contended that the district court judge should be recused due to his previous condemnations of her and because he had a pending complaint with a United States senator seeking her impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">With respect to the dismissal of his suit, Maringo argues that the district court erred in determining that his suit was frivolous merely because it disbelieved his factual allegations, asserting that it is \u201cunheard of\u2019 to find as frivolous a suit for documents held for more than 15 months in contravention of FOIA and the Administrative Procedure Act. He contends that the district court failed to recognize that the \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d approach used by USCIS and ICE to satisfy FOIA requests was not applicable to his request because his request was in the \u201cfast track\u201d category of requests rather than the \u201cordinary\u201d category of requests and that a writ of mandamus was the only mechanism that would ensure he received the requested documents in light of his pending removal from the United States. Maringo also argues that his suit is not malicious because the allegations repeated in his present complaint from a prior suit were included in the prior suit merely as factual background.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Because Maringo\u2019s appeal fails with respect to the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we need not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his suit as frivolous factually or malicious. A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). Maringo\u2019s assertion factually that his request was not being answered on a first-in, first-out basis is unavailing in light of the exhibits attached to his complaint, and Maringo does not brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to state a claim under FOIA because the first-in, first-out approach applied by USCIS and ICE constituted the exercise of due diligence. Maringo also fails to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to state a claim for a writ of mandamus because his appeal of his asylum case presented another available remedy that was adequate for obtaining the documents he sought. He has thus waived any such arguments. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cAlthough we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Maringo has abandoned these issues on appeal because the failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Maringo also argues that the district court erred in finding that it lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d because he had failed to \u201cexhaust his administrative remedies\u201d concerning the agencies\u2019 processing of his FOIA request. This argument is unavailing because the district court made no such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>With respect to the denial of his motions to recuse, Maringo argues that recusal should have been granted because the district court judge\u2019s bias and hostility against him is evident in her decision in one of Maringo\u2019s previous cases; his motions to recuse \u201cautomatically\u201d would make her hostile to his interests; his past condemnations of her appointment and decisions created an inherent conflict for her; and his complaint referred to a plan by the United States government to \u201cexterminate the black race\u201d and thus rendered questionable the impartiality of any Caucasian or African-American judge. Maringo also disputes the district court\u2019s determination that his second motion to recuse failed to satisfy the affidavit requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, and he asserts that the district court judge ignored his second motion for recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The denial of a motion to recuse is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Matassarin v. Lynch, </em>174 F.3d 549, 571 (5th Cir. 1999). While Maringo did not cite a statutory basis for his motions to recuse, the district court ruled that Maringo failed to show that recusal was required by either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 or 455. To proceed under \u00a7 144, the movant must show by affidavit \u201cactual bias.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Dep\u2019t Pub. Safety and Corrs., </em>901 F.2d 1288, 1296 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cA legally sufficient affidavit must meet the following requirements: (1) the facts must be material and stated with particularity; (2) the facts must be such that if true they would convince a reasonable man that a bias exists; and (3) the facts must show the bias is personal, as opposed to judicial, in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 455, a federal judge must \u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d or \u201cwhere he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1). A movant proceeding under \u00a7 455 \u201cmust show that, if a reasonable man knew of all the circumstances, he would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana v. Harry L. Laws Co., </em>690 F.2d 1157, 1165 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Maringo\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s prior adverse judicial rulings are not sufficient to satisfy the standards of \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Maringo\u2019s remaining contentions do not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in determining that Maringo failed to satisfy the standards for recusal. <em>See Matassarin, </em>174 F.3d at 571; <em>Henderson, </em>901 F.2d at 1296; <em>Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana, </em>690 F.2d at 1165. Maringo also did not satisfy the requirements for a legally sufficient affidavit under \u00a7 144, <em>see Henderson, </em>901 F.2d at 1296, and his assertion that the district court ignored his second motion to recuse is unavailing because the district court provided thorough reasons for denying the motion. With respect to his motion to consolidate this case with case no. 07-60431, Maringo has not shown that the issues in the cases are sufficiently similar to warrant consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED, and Maringo\u2019s motion to consolidate is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b891-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
