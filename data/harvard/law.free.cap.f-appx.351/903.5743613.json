Banks filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition to challenge an alleged delay in the disposition of his direct criminal appeal. The district court interpreted his petition as seeking both \u00a7 2241 relief and mandamus relief and denied it. Banks now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">Banks asserts that his \u00a7 2241 petition was filed to challenge both a delay in his sentencing and a delay in the disposition of his appeal. We decline to consider Banks\u2019s claim concerning an alleged delay in his sentencing proceedings because it was not presented to the district court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>See Johnson v. Puckett, </em>930 F.2d 445, 448 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Banks argues that his \u00a7 2241 petition was the proper vehicle to raise his claims concerning the alleged delay in disposition of his direct criminal appeal and that a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate to raise these claims. \u201cIn an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, this court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Banks has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief or a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
