Bright argues that Amendment 706, reduced not only his base offense level, but also the applicable statutory minimum term of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">I. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">A district court may modify a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced ... <em>based on </em>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with applicable policy statements and is not authorized if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The retroactive amendment at issue here is Amendment 706, which reduces the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, a district court does not have unfettered authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. Instead, the court must determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to Bright if Amendment 706 had been in effect at the time Bright was sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (b)(1). A court shall only substitute the amendments that have been listed for retroactive application and \u201cshall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the application of a retroactive amendment did not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, then the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>court has no jurisdiction to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Here, the district court properly denied Bright\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range was not affected by Amendment 706. Instead, his sentence was based on the statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment for recidivist offenders with two or more prior felony drug convictions. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that a defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Furthermore, in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, Bright cannot challenge the district court\u2019s original sentencing determination that he was subject to the mandatory statutory minimum penalty. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 (holding that, in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Bright was subject to a statutory minimum that replaced the original sentencing guideline range to which Amendment 706 applies. As a result, his sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the amendment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bright\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
