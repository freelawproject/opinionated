Brunson, </em>276 Fed.Appx. 950 (2008). But the Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for additional consideration in the light of <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). After additional review, we see no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">Brunson received an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) based on certain of his prior convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brunson argues that his Florida conviction for fleeing or eluding law enforcement was not a violent felony and, thus, did not qualify as a predicate offense under ACCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d in relevant part, as a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment that has an element of physical force, is one of several enumerated offenses, or \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (i)-(ii). Brunson violated Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a), which provides that one commits a second-degree felony if he \u201cwillfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer in an au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>thorized law enforcement patrol vehicle ... with siren and lights activated, and during the course of the fleeing or attempted eluding: [d]rives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d Because the crime of fleeing or eluding does not have an element of physical force and is not among the enumerated offenses, whether a violation of the Florida statute is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d turns on whether such violation \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We employ a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d when determining whether an offense is a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual provision, considering \u201cwhether the <em>elements of the offense </em>are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of [a] particular offender.\u201d <em>James v. United States, 550 </em>U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1593-94, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (emphasis in original). We first look to \u201cwhether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1597. Then, we must consider whether the crime involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct similar to the offenses listed in the residual clause such that it \u201cmakes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.\u201d <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1586, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>Chambers, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that an Illinois conviction for \u201cfailure to report\u201d for penal confinement was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA\u2019s residual provision, reasoning that a failure to report did not involve the purposeful, violent and aggressive conduct \u201cpotentially at issue when an offender\u201d commits one of the enumerated offenses. <em>Chambers, </em>129 S.Ct. at 692 (citing <em>Begay, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1586). <em>Chambers </em>characterized the relevant inquiry as whether the offender who fails to report \u201cis significantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby producing a \u2018serious potential risk of physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">It is clear under the categorical approach that driving at a high speed or with disregard for the safety of others \u2014 the conduct encompassed by section 316.1935(3) \u2014 presents a serious potential risk of injury to others in an ordinary case. <em>See James, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1597; <em>see also United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1182-83 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that a violation of section 316.1935(3) is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), because it \u201cmost assuredly presented] a \u2018potential risk of physical injury\u2019 to others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">And the behavior proscribed by section 316.1935(3) involves purposeful, aggressive, and potentially violent conduct such that an offender committing this offense is more likely than others to attack or physically resist their apprehender. Willfully fleeing or eluding a police officer combined with driving at a high rate of speed or in a manner that wantonly disregards the safety of others could escalate into a high-speed chase that threatens pedestrians, other drivers, or officers. Thus, in the light of <em>Chambers, </em>we conclude that a conviction under section 316.1935(3) qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See Chambers, </em>129 S.Ct. at 692; <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1294-96 (11th Cir.2009)(concluding that a violation of section 316.1935(2) is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA because it did not have, as elements, the aggressive conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>driving at a high speed or with wanton disregard for the safety of others).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Brunson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\">. The ACCA provides \"In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) ... and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-14\">. Brunson concedes that the other two convictions qualifying him for an enhanced sentence under section 924(e) \u2014 for two separate instances of carjacking and aggravated assault \u2014 are violent felonies within the meaning of the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b427-21\">.Our current review involves only the classification of a prior state conviction under <em>Chambers. </em>Our previous rejection of Brunson's other argument that the district court violated his constitutional rights by enhancing his sentence based on prior convictions not charged in the indictment remains unchanged. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>see also United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), remains good law \u201cuntil the Supreme Court overrules it.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-19\">. Our prior opinion concluded that a violation of section 316.1935(3) was a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA based only on <em>Orisnord. </em>But in <em>Orisnord, </em>we concluded that the offense was a \"crime of violence\u201d based only on the potential risk of injury and not whether the offense additionally involved purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct like that of the enumerated offenses. 483 F.3d at 1182. Our reasoning under <em>Orisnord </em>remains sound on the first step of the \"violent felony\u201d inquiry, but we did not have the additional guidance of <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>in interpreting the ACCA in our previous opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
