Based on that review, we are convinced that the orders and rulings of the district court in this action are free of error and correct in all respects. Accordingly, for reasons set forth in that court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order filed November 22, 2008, 2008 WL 5024860, the judgment appealed from by Bernard is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
