He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt on the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-23\">The parties correctly agree that Ramirez preserved this claim through Rule 29 motions. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d 878, 882 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we \u201cmust determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in support of the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-24\">In relevant part, \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) imposes a 5-year minimum term of imprisonment upon a person who \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm.\u201d Because the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ment and jury instructions tracked this \u201cuses or carries\u201d portion of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), Ramirez\u2019s arguments regarding whether he \u201cpossessed\u201d the firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug trafficking offense are misplaced. <em>See United States v. McGilberry, </em>480 F.3d 326, 328 (5th Cir.2007) (distinguishing the evidence required to convict under the \u201cuses or carries\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) from that required under the \u201cpossesses\u201d prong).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Ramirez\u2019s argument that the Government failed to prove that he carried the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug offense is unavailing. \u201c[I]n the context of an automobile constructive possession will support a conviction under the \u2018carrying\u2019 prong of \u00a7 924(c)(1) when a firearm is transported in a vehicle and the operator of the vehicle knowingly possesses the firearm in the vehicle during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>481 F.3d 259, 263 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A gun does not have to be within easy reach of the defendant in order to sustain a carrying charge in the vehicular context. <em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Ramirez claimed ownership of the drugs and firearm, both of which were found on the passenger\u2019s side floorboard of the car he was driving. Ramirez admitted to a federal agent that he had \u201cjust recently purchased\u201d the drugs. In addition, the gun had been test fired and was found to function as designed. Although there was no direct evidence that Ramirez used the gun for protection, it \u201cobviously could have been used for protection if [he] felt it necessary,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, in any case, the Government only needed to show that Ramirez carried the gun during and in relation to his possession with intent to distribute cocaine. <em>See id. </em>at 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Finally, Ramirez intimates that his possession with intent to distribute cocaine did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), but we have held otherwise. <em>United States v. Munoz-Fabela, </em>896 F.2d 908, 911 (5th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
