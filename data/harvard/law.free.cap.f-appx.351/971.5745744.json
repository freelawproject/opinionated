He argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss attributable to him as $66,588.60 and increasing his offense level by six levels based on this amount pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(D). Specifically, Barreiro Medina asserts that there was no evidence to support the district court\u2019s calculation and, therefore, the district court\u2019s increase of his offense level violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). According to Barreiro Medina the district court should have found him responsible only for the $12,000 actual loss that he admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">Barreiro Medina has not shown that the district court erred in calculating the loss amount or in increasing his offense level based on this amount pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(D). Following <em>Booker, </em>the district court was entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a guidelines sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.2006). The district court was entitled to rely on the information in the presentence report because it had sufficient indicia of reliability, and Barreiro Medina did not present rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that this information was inaccurate or materially untrue. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 376-77 (5th Cir.2009). Further, the district court did not err in determining that Barreiro Medina should be held responsible for the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>loss amount rather than the actual charges he made because he was involved in a conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i) and (ii)) (\u201cActual loss\u201d is \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (defendant involved in \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d should be held accountable for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
