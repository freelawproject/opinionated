For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">In 1999, a federal grand jury charged Meza with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(j); and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. A jury found Meza guilty of both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Meza was accountable for 4,609 kilograms of cocaine, and his base offense level was set at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 201.1(a)(3) and (c)(1). Meza\u2019s total offense level was 42. His total offense level of 42 combined with criminal history category I to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 360 months to life. The district court adopted the factual findings and guideline calculations contained in the PSI and sentenced Meza to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 5 years of supervised release. Meza appealed his convictions and sentence and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Rincon-Hernandez, </em>32 Fed.Appx. 533 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">In July 2008, Meza filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 668 reduced his base offense level from 38 to 30. Meza also argued that the district court should resentence him under an advisory guideline scheme, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court denied Meza\u2019s motion, stating that Meza based his motion on Amendment 706. It found that Amendment 706 did not apply to Meza, because the two counts of which he was convicted involved powder cocaine rather than crack cocaine. Meza filed a motion to reconsider, noting that his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 668, rather than Amendment 706. He acknowledged that Amendment 668 was not listed in the Guidelines as a retroactive amendment, but asked the court to apply it retroactively because it was a clarifying amendment. The district court denied Meza\u2019s motion for reconsideration and Meza appealed. Meza\u2019s notice of appeal stated that he wished to appeal only the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>mission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements unless it is made pursuant to an amendment that the Commission has made retroactive through its inclusion in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Amendment 668 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as a. retroactive amendment; therefore, a district court would violate Commission policy by granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on this amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), and (c). Furthermore, even if Amendment 668 was considered to be a clarifying amendment, clarifying amendments may be applied retroactively only on direct appeal of a sentence or under a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 908-09 (11th Cir.2003) (determining that classification as a clarifying amendment \u201cbears no relevance to determining retroactivity under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Although the district court, in the denial of the motion to reconsider, did not address Meza\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was based on Amendment 668 rather than Amendment 706, any failure to address Amendment 668 was harmless, because the court lacked discretion to contravene Commission policy and grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>\u201cBooker ... </em>do[es] not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion ... imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement^]\u201d). Finally, <em>Booker </em>did not grant the district court authority to disregard the policy statements set forth in \u00a7 1B1.10(a). <em>See id. </em>(holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Accordingly, Meza\u2019s claim that Amendment 668 may serve as a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) lacks merit and we affirm the denial of Meza\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
