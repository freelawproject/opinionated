The district court dismissed these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because appellants did not exhaust administrative remedies as required by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680, and the Admiralty Extension Act (AEA), 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 740.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, appellants, former. residents of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, suffered personal and property damage from the flooding of the Industrial Canal, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, and the Gulf Intracoas-tal Waterway. Alleging that at least one breach in the canal was caused when a barge broke free from its moorings, appellants sued the barge\u2019s owner (Ingram Barge Company), the company chartering it, and the United States. Ingram filed the present action seeking exoneration or limitation of liability, and the district court consolidated the two cases, later dismissing the United States for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See In re Ingram Barge Co., </em>435 F.Supp.2d 524 (E.D.La. 2006). This court dismissed appellants\u2019 first appeal for lack of jurisdiction, <em>In re Ingram Barge Co., </em>262 Fed.Appx. 576 (5th Cir.2008), after which the district court certified the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). This appeal followed; we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001). The party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">This appeal presents nearly identical issues to another case recently decided by a different panel. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation (O\u2019Dwyer v. United </em>States), 345 Fed.Appx. 1 (5th Cir.2009). While not binding precedent, we find this case persuasive. There, we affirmed disr missal of similar claims against the United States because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the FTCA and the AEA. There, as here, the plaintiffs argued that the Suits in Admiralty Act (SAA), 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 741 <em>et seq., </em>rather than the AEA applied to their claims. For the same reasons given in that opinion, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">First, the FTCA does not admit a futility exception to its exhaustion requirement, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Gregory v. Mitchell, </em>634 F.2d 199, 203-04 (5th Cir.1981), nor have appellants demonstrated that they have met this requirement, <em>see In re Ingram Barge Co., </em>435 F.Supp.2d at 527 n. 3. Thus, the district court properly dismissed appellants\u2019 claims that arise under the FTCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Second, appellants\u2019 attempt to shoehorn their claims into the SAA fails because the alleged injuries did not occur on navigable waters. The district court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1), unaided by the AEA, extends to torts that \u201coccurred on navigable waters.\u201d <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>513 U.S. 527, 531, 115 S.Ct. 1043, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>130 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1995). \u201cIn determining whether the tort occurred on navigable water, this court looks to where the alleged wrong took effect rather than to the locus of the allegedly tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Egorov, Puchinsky, Afanasiev &amp; Juring v. Terriberry, Carroll &amp; Yancey, </em>183 F.3d 453, 456 (5th Cir.1999). Here, the alleged injuries did not occur on navigable waters and the SAA does not extend the district court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction to cover such 'injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the district court correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 admiralty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-16\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\">. The AEA has since been recodified. <em>See </em>Codification of Title 46, Pub.L. No. 109-304, 120 Stat. 1485 (2006); 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-13\">. We do not find the FTCA\u2019s third-party-practice exception applicable because appellants are not defendants in any of these proceedings. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-15\">. To the extent appellants\u2019 claims may have arisen under the AEA, they are jurisdictionally barred by appellants' failure to exhaust administrative remedies. 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 740; <em>Loeber v. Bay Tankers, Inc., 924 </em>F.2d 1340, 1342 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
