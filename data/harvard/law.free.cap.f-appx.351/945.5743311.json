In calculating Mendoza-Herrera\u2019s sentencing guidelines range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment, the district court included a nine-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C), based on the district court\u2019s finding that Mendoza-Herrera\u2019s offense conduct involved 100 or more documents. Mendoza-Herrera contends that the district court erred in applying this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-26\">The district court made clear that it would have imposed the same 34-month sentence even if it were incorrect about the application of the \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement. Because the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>not commit reversible error in imposing this alternative non-Guidelines sentence, we need not address whether the \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement was applicable here. Mendoza-Herrera argues that his sentence may not be affirmed based on the district court\u2019s alternative sentence because the district court, in deciding the alternative sentence, did not explicitly calculate or otherwise acknowledge what the guidelines range would have been without the \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement. This argument is considered under the plain error standard of review because it was not raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Arriaga, </em>565 F.3d 280, 282 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 227, 175 L.Ed.2d 157 (2009); <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">To show plain error, Mendoza-Herrera must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). If Mendoza-Herrera makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>\u201cTo satisfy the \u2018substantial rights\u2019 prong, \u2018in most cases ... the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruiz-Arriaga, </em>565 F.3d at 282 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). In light of the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing in support of its alternative sentence, Mendoza-Herrera has not met his burden of showing that the outcome of the proceedings was affected by any error by the district court in failing to consider the guidelines range that would have been applicable without the \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
