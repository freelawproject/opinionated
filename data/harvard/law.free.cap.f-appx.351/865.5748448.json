We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Matthews argues that he stated claims of ex post facto violations, discrimination and equal protection violations, and due process violations with regard to the denial of his release on parole and the \u201coff set\u201d of consideration of his release on parole. He does not address the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to state a claim because his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), but even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them, <em>Yohey v. Collins, 985 </em>F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Matthews does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his claims were barred by <em>Heck, </em>he has abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Matthews fails to challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal, his appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Matthews\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and bond/bail pending civil proceedings is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
