After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">In 1999, a jury convicted Marshall of one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and 846, and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The Presentence Investigation Report recommended that Marshall was responsible for more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, resulting in a base offense level of 38 under the sentencing guidelines then in effect. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1998). Although Marshall objected, the district court overruled the objection, finding \u201cMr. Marshall has to be held accountable for an amount in excess of one and a half kilograms, which is an offense level [of] 38.\u201d Marshall received a two-level enhancement for possessing a weapon during the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Marshall received an additional two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Marshall\u2019s total offense level of 42, combined with his category III criminal history, resulted in a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Marshall to 216 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">In 2008, Marshall filed a <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied Marshall\u2019s motion, finding that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not affect his guidelines range. On appeal, Marshall argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-18\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">After Marshall\u2019s sentencing, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which provides for a two level reduction in the base offense level for crack cocaine offenders responsible for between 1.5 and 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. The district court\u2019s finding was that Marshall was accountable for a drug quantity of \u201cin excess of one and a half kilograms.\u201d Because the district court did not say how many more kilograms in excess of 1.5 kilograms, it would be speculation to say it was more than 4.5 kilograms. Accordingly, giving Marshall the benefit of the doubt, we consider Marshall as responsible for 1.5 kilograms and Amendment 706 thus would reduce his offense level from 42 to 40. However, an offense level of 40, along with Marshall\u2019s category III criminal history, still results in the same guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, Ch. 5, Pt. A. Therefore, even if Marshall is entitled to a reduction under Amendment 706, he is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 706 does not \u201calter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Given that Marshall\u2019s guidelines sentencing range did not change, the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Marshall\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S, 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d); <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis on which to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to use <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>as a basis for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Marshall\u2019s contention that the district court denied his motion out of vindictiveness is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
