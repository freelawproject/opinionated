Cojocar argues that the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) by failing to address his claim that the Florida Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal was contrary to <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993). For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Cojocar, who is serving a 15-year sentence for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) \u2014 manslaughter and DUI- \u2014 serious bodily harm, filed the present <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition alleging (1) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in connection with the direct appeal of his convictions, (2) trial court error in dismissing the appeal of his Fla. R.Crim.P. Rule 3.800 appeal, and (3) trial court error in failing to award him credit for time served for the time he was imprisoned in Costa Rica. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Cojocar explained that a jury convicted him of DUI-manslaughter and DUI \u2014 serious bodily harm after he fled the state court\u2019s jurisdiction on the final day of his jury trial. Cojocar was sentenced <em>in absentia </em>on March 26, 1998, because he had fled the jurisdiction prior to the rendering of the guilty verdict in his case. On November 2, 2005, Cojocar was apprehended in Costa Rica, where he had been incarcerated from March 15, 2005 through November 2, 2005, based on the charges of which he had been convicted in Florida. Cojocar was extradited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>United States and, since November 2, 2005, has been imprisoned in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Upon returning from Costa Rica, Cojo-car through counsel filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, pursuant to Fla. R.Crim.P. 3.800(a). The Florida state court vacated Cojocar\u2019s original sentence of 32 years and reduced the sentence to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Cojocar\u2019s filed an appeal, raising issues that were directed to the 1998 trial and conviction. On June 13, 2006, Cojocar filed a second Rule 3.800 motion, arguing that he should be awarded credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail. The court denied this motion and Cojocar filed an appeal, which was consolidated with the appeal of his prior Rule 3.800 motion. The Florida appellate court dismissed both appeals for lack of jurisdiction. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Cojo-car argued that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to seek direct appellate review of his judgment of conviction and for raising issues related to his conviction in the appeal of his Rule 3.800 motion, rather than filing a motion for a belated appeal. Cojocar also argued that the Florida appellate court violated the rule set forth in <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>when it dismissed his appeal, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">The Fourth District Court of Appeal, <em>\u201cPer Curiam\u201d Affirmed </em>both appeals. The State court position is contrary to United States precedent. <em>See Ortega-Rodriguez v. State [United States], </em>507 U.S. 234 [113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581] (1993); \u201cit is well settled that when a defendant absconds after filing an appeal, the appellate court has the authority to dismiss the appeal. However, where the defendant absconds and returns before filing an appeal, trial courts are better suited to address the matter\u201d and the appeal must not be dismissed .... Petitioner submits that the rationale of <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>is persuasive and should be adopted by this Court.... Dismissing the appeal is not appropriate punishment when the defendant returns to custody before commencement of the appeal and has not thwarted or exhibited disrespect for the appellate process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Cojocar noted that the state argued, in its appellate brief, that his willful absconding made a mockery of the state judicial system and prejudiced the state, because certain witnesses and evidence may not be available eight years after the original trial. Finally, Cojocar asserted that the state court erred in refusing to grant him credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The state responded that Cojocar\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and failure to award credit for time served in Costa Rica were not properly before the court, because he failed to exhaust these issues in state court. Nevertheless, the state addressed the merits of these two issues. The state did not directly address Cojocar\u2019s argument that the Florida appellate court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal violated <em>Ortega-Rodriguez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">The state attached to its response an appendix containing documents filed in the Florida state courts in connection with Co-jocar\u2019s convictions and sentences and his Rule 3.800 motions. In his first Rule 3.800 motion, Cojocar argued that his sentence was illegal because (1) he was sentenced under guidelines that had been declared to be unconstitutional and (2) he was not present for the reading of the verdict or his sentencing. In a second Rule 3.800 motion, filed by different counsel, Cojocar argued that his sentence was illegal, because he was sentenced under the 1995 Florida Sentencing Guidelines, which the Florida Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The state court resentenced Cojocar to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, based on the fact that Cojocar had originally been sentenced under the unconstitutional 1995 Florida Sentencing Guidelines. Cojocar appealed \u201cthe Sentencing Orders this Court rendered in this case on January 5, 2006, which are final Orders sentencing [Cojo-car] for DUI Manslaughter (Counts I and II) and DUI Serious Bodily Injury (Count III) and the judgment of conviction of this Court rendered in this case related thereto\u201d (Case No. 4D06-489). Subsequently, Cojocar filed an additional Rule 8.800 motion, asking the court to award him credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail. The state court held a hearing and ultimately denied Cojocar\u2019s motion. Cojo-car appealed this ruling (Case No. 4D06-2841). On appeal, the state appellate court consolidated Case Nos. 4D06-489 and 4D06-2841.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In his state appellate brief, Cojocar argued that (1) his convictions were based on insufficient evidence, (2) the trial court erred in admitting certain blood-alcohol test results, (3) the prosecutor misstated the law during closing argument, and (4) the trial court erred in failing to give him credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail. The state filed a response, as well as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Case No. 4D06-489. In the motion to dismiss, the state asserted that Cojocar\u2019s notice of appeal in Case No. 4D06-489 indicated that he was appealing his 1998 conviction; however, the 30-day time limit in which to file a direct appeal of the conviction had expired on March 26, 1998. The state argued that Cojocar would not have been entitled to a belated appeal, even if he had petitioned for one, because he willfully absconded from the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Cojocar responded, citing <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>for the proposition that an appellate court has authority to dismiss an appeal if the defendant absconds <em>after </em>filing an appeal, but courts should not dismiss an appeal if the defendant absconds <em>before </em>the filing of the appeal. Cojocar argued that, because he absconded before his appeal was filed, <em>Ortegar-Rodriguez </em>prohibited the appellate court from dismissing his appeal. The appellate court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Case No. 4D06-489 and affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to Case No. 4D06-2841.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In the district court, Cojocar filed a reply to the state\u2019s response. Cojocar argued that counsel was ineffective for filing a motion to correct illegal sentence, rather than a belated appeal. He noted that the state \u201cconceded\u201d that a belated appeal would have rewarded him for fleeing and argued that he, therefore, was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to file such an appeal. Cojocar contended that the state failed to show that it would have been prejudiced by the court granting a belated appeal. He also asserted that the state appellate court erred in refusing to hear his claims regarding his original conviction and refusing to credit him with the time he served in a Costa Rican jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The magistrate issued a report and recommendation, stating that Cojocar had raised the two issues in his \u00a7 2254 petition: (1) counsel was ineffective, \u201cbecause rather than requesting a belated direct appeal from the original judgment, his counsel filed a notice of appeal from the sentencing order rendered on January 5, 2006, and second notice of appeal from the denial of his motion to correct sentencing error rendered on June 30, 2006,\u201d and (2) \u201c[Cojocar] [wa]s being confined pursuant to unlawful sentences, because the trial [court] failed to award him credit for time served for the time [he was] imprisoned in Costa Rica.\u201d The magistrate initially noted that Cojocar\u2019s first claim was unexhausted and \u201csubject to a prospective procedural bar;\u201d however, it decided \u201cnot to deny the claims on procedural grounds\u201d and instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>considered the merits of both claims. With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the magistrate determined that the failure to file a direct appeal was not the fault of counsel, but instead, was caused by Cojocar\u2019s absconding from the state court\u2019s jurisdiction. The magistrate noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">Certainly, if Cojocar had returned to the jurisdiction within the thirty-day appeal period, he would have been entitled to a direct appeal from his convictions. In Florida, when a defendant absconds <em>after </em>filing an appeal, the appellate court has the authority to dismiss the appeal; however, where the defendant absconds and returns <em>before </em>filing an appeal, the misconduct is a matter for the trial court, not the appellate courts. <em>See Griffis v. State, </em>759 So.2d 668 (Fla.2000). <em>See also Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993) (holding that when a defendant absconds after the appellate process has begun the appellate court may dismiss the appeal).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The magistrate also pointed out that Cojo-car would not have been entitled to the granting of a petition for belated appeal, because Florida law requires such petitions to be filed within two years after expiration of the time to appeal a final order. Accordingly, finding no deficient performance of prejudice, the magistrate recommended denying Cojocar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The magistrate found that Cojocar\u2019s claim that the state court should have credited him for the time he served in Costa Rica was not cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding and noted that Cojocar would not be entitled to relief even if this claim was cognizable, because \u201chis sentences are lawful pursuant to Florida sentencing law.\u201d Accordingly, the magistrate recommended denying Cojocar\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Cojocar filed the following objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations. First, Cojocar argued that counsel was ineffective for raising claims relating to his conviction and sentence in his Rule 3.800 appeal and failing to file a belated appeal. He also asserted that there was \u201cno factual basis to conclude [that he] willfully absconded with intent to flee from justice.\u201d Finally, Cojocar objected to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that he was not entitled to relief based on the trial court\u2019s failure to award him credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety and denied Cojocar\u2019s \u00a7 2254 motion. Cojocar appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition and we granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address Cojocar\u2019s claim that the Florida Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal was contrary to <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cAppellate review in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding is limited to the issues specified in the [COA].\u201d <em>Diaz v. Dept. Of Corrs., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we expressed our \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d and exercised our supervisory authority over the district courts, instructed them to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for habeas corpus, regardless of whether ha-beas relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>960 F.2d at 935-36. \u201cA claim for relief for purposes of <em>[Clisby </em>] is any allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. When a district court does not address all the constitutional claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">As an initial matter, we decline to consider Cojocar\u2019s arguments, set forth in his appellate brief, that (1) the district court and state courts failed to determine whether he absconded willfully and whether he was advised of his right to appeal, (2) dismissal of his state court appeal violated his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and due process rights, and (3) he was unaware that counsel failed to file a direct appeal, because these claims are outside the scope of the COA. <em>Diaz, </em>362 F.3d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Cojocar clearly argued that the state appellate court violated the rule set forth in <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>by dismissing his appeal. The district court failed to address this issue. The magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, which the district court adopted, addressed only two of Cojocar\u2019s claims: (1) whether counsel was ineffective for filing Rule 3.800 motions, rather than requesting a belated appeal, and (2) whether the state court erred in failing to award Cojocar credit for the time he served in a Costa Rican jail. Although the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation cited <em>Ortega-Rodriguez, </em>the citation was in reference to Cojocar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, rather than his claim that the state appellate court erroneously dismissed his appeal. Furthermore, although the state argues that Cojocar\u2019s <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>argument was raised only in the context of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a review of Cojocar\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition shows that the <em>Ortega-Rodriguez </em>claim was separate from the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Cojocar clearly states that \u201c[t]he State court[\u2019s] [dismissal of the appeal] is contrary to United States precedent. <em>See Ortega-Rodriguez v. State [United States], </em>507 U.S. 234 [113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581] (1993).\u201d This statement clearly indicates that Cojocar is challenging the state court\u2019s dismissal in addition to counsel\u2019s failure to petition for a belated appeal. Accordingly, because the district court failed to address Cojocar\u2019s claim that the state appellate court violated <em>Ortegar-Rodriguez </em>by dismissing his appeal, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand for consideration of this issue. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
