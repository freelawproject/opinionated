For the first time on appeal, Padilla contends that this offense, which falls under \u00a7 22.01 of the Texas Penal Code, does not qualify as a crime of violence and, therefore, does not qualify as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Because this issue was not raised in district court, review is only for plain error. In any event, we need not address whether this particular offense constitutes a crime of violence because Padilla has not demonstrated the sentence was unreasonable. The district court imposed a non-Guideline sentence, stating its desire to impose the 33-month sentence in the light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of this case, stating that no lesser sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence is reviewed for \u201creasonableness\u201d. \u201cA non-Guideline sentence is unreasonable where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 528 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of the record satisfies us that the district court gave proper consideration to the contentions of the parties, the information in the presentence investigation report, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id.; United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 657-59 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
