In particular, in the context of the \u201cfast food\u201d restaurant business, this appeal poses issues that test the scope of subdivision (a) of section 1105 of the Tax Law, which imposes taxes on retail sales of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d. The focus is on whether the taxpayers come within the exceptions to this impost articulated in either section 1101 (subd [b], par [4], cl [i], subcl [A]) of the Tax Law, which excludes a sale \u201cfor resale as such <em>or </em>as a physical component part of tangible personal property\u201d (emphasis added), or section 1115 (subd [a], par [12]) of the Tax Law, which exempts the sale of machinery and equipment used to produce \u201ctangible personal property\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The operative facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Burger King, a nationwide \u201cfast food\u201d chain, refused to pay sales tax on its purchases of certain paper or plastic packaging materials during the tax period March 1, 1970 through November 30, 1972. The materials consisted of wrappers for hamburgers, cups for beverages and \u201csleeves\u201d for french fries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The taxpayer insists that it bought these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>articles for the purpose of resale and that, accordingly, their purchase was tax free.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Davmor Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Burger King, manufactures restaurant equipment for sale to Burger King establishments. During the period between June 1, 1970 through November 30, 1972, it did not collect taxes on such sales of ovens, fryers, broilers, coffee urns, milk shake machinery and other similar equipment. It claims exemption because the equipment was used exclusively and directly to manufacture and otherwise process the food and beverages Burger King sells.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Edgmor, Inc., then a fully owned subsidiary of Burger King, made a bulk purchase of two self-service restaurants from a third party on January 30,1970. By the terms of the purchase agreement, Edgmor agreed to assume responsibility for the remittal of any sales taxes due the State on account of this transaction. It did not do so as to the food preparation equipment it thus acquired. The ground on which it unsuccessfully resisted the ensuing State Sales Tax Bureau\u2019s assessment is the same one urged by Davmor.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In sustaining the Burger King assessment, the commission\u2019s rationale was that the taxpayer\u2019s patrons received the paper products \u201conly as an incident to the purchase of food and drink\u201d and thus, rather than being bought by Burger King for resale \u201cas such\u201d, were consumed by Burger King in the course of consummating the \u201chybrid\u201d transactions involved in the delivery of its combined food and service. It also asserts that the food and drink is not \u201ctangible personal property\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as it is used in subdivision (a) of section 1105. On this basis, it then also reasoned, consistently, that the machinery and equipment in the Davmor and Edgmor cases, even if the processing of the restaurant food and drink could be said to be manufacturing, was not used for the \u201cproduction of tangible personal property\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In the ensuing court proceedings, Special Term confirmed the determination as to Burger King, but on a dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ferent theory. Though it held the food and drink was tangible personal property, it decided that the packaging did not qualify for the exclusion because it was neither a physical component part of the product nor sold by Burger King for resale as such and so served \u201conly to facilitate the sale of the product\u201d. As to the equipment sold by Davmor and that bought by Edgmor, having held the food was tangible personal property, the court rejected the commission\u2019s conclusion that the machinery was not exempt under section 1115 (subd [a], par [12]) of the Tax Law. For its part, the ' Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting, annulled the assessments <em>in toto. </em>For the reasons which follow, we agree with the result it reached as to Burger King, but not as to Davmor and Edgmor.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">For this purpose, we first look at whether Burger King\u2019s packaging material is excepted from the tax on the theory that it is a \u201cphysical component part\u201d of the \u201ctangible personal property\u201d Burger King sells to its patrons (Tax Law, \u00a7 1101, subd [b], par [4], cl [i], subcl [A]). To arrive at an answer, preliminarily we address the subissue of whether food sold by restaurants is \u201ctangible personal property\u201d within the reasonable intendment of the Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"> On that score, both courts below simply applied the broad definition of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d contained in the definitional section of the sales tax statute, i.e., \u201c [c] orporeal property of any nature\u201d (Tax Law, \u00a7 1101, subd [b], par [6]). This interpretation, however, creates an ambiguity in the statutory scheme. If restaurant food is merely \u201ctangible personal property\u201d, then subdivision (a) of section 1105 of the Tax Law, which imposes a tax on such retail sales, would seem to suffice. Nevertheless, there is a separate section (Tax Law, \u00a7 1105, subd [d]), which imposes a tax on the sale of restaurant food.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nowhere in this section is reference made to \u201ctangible personal property\u201d. It is a familiar and salutary canon of construction that courts, in construing apparently conflicting statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>visions, must try to harmonize them (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 98, 141).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">This principle in mind, the commission\u2019s assertion that restaurant food, within the meaning of the Tax Law, is distinct from \u201ctangible personal property\u201d, provides a ready means to reconcile the differing statutory sections. For the purchase of restaurant food is more than the mere receipt of an edible or a potable. Surely, it requires no impermissible outreach of the imagination to see it as a delivery of food and service in combination. Whether the proportion of the combination is 90% of service and 10% of food, as it might be in a gourmet restaurant which features pheasant under glass, or whether it is 10% of service and 90 % of food, as it might be at a hot dog stand, it is difficult to see why the commission could not view the totality, as it did, as a \u201chybrid\u201d transaction rather than as the sale of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d. In so saying, we recognize that where the interpretation of a statute or its application involves a special knowledge, courts regularly defer to administrative expertise <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Indeed, it is appropriate here to comment on the modern-day economic and social phenomenon which, not without cause, has come to be known as the \u201cfast food restaurant\u201d. Its universal proliferation on our national scene has made it common knowledge that such restaurants, for better or worse, are designed to mass-produce uniform, popular-priced food and drink products for consumption on ready demand on a conveyor-like, assembly-line basis. The amount of service it incorporates in its operation may be different from that of other types of restaurants, but, if anything, may be more significant. For its method of doing business requires that the food and drink it serves be in a form available for delivery whenever the unheralded patron chooses to arrive. The goal is streamlined movement of bagged food in sanitary form from restaurant to customer, who takes it in its ready-to-eat state without pause to wherever, on or off the premises, she or he wishes to consume it. Key to imparting these vaunted service features\u2014 of speed, sanitation and portability \u2014 is the use of paper or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>plastic goods in its preparation, storage and delivery (see, generally, Levitt, Production Line Approach to Service, Harv Business Rev, Sept.-Oct., 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Turning now to the applicability of the sale \u201cfor resale as such\u201d exclusion, we observe, in somewhat greater detail, that each of the prior tribunals has approached the matter differently. The commission, of the view that the suppliers\u2019 sales of the packaging to Burger King were the crucial events, ruled them retail sales on which the restaurant was to pay the tax. It reasoned that, when the packaging accompanied the edibles Burger King delivered to its customers, it did so only as \u201can incident to the purchases of the food\u201d, and not as sales of the wrappings as such. On that note, Burger King, as the first buyer who had made its purchase for other than a resale as such, was to be regarded as a retail purchaser and therefore liable for the tax in its capacity as vendee. In contrast, Special Term focused on the transactions between Burger King and its customers. It, nonetheless, concluded that Burger King was liable for the tax, but as vendor (see Tax Law, \u00a7\u00a7 1131, 1132), by taking the tack that, though the transfers of the restaurant\u2019s wrappings to the patrons constituted sales, they were ones at retail, rather than \u201csales for resale\u201d. Finally, the majority, at the Appellate Division, satisfied that the sales of the packaging material to Burger King by its supplier indeed were the controlling transactions, decided that the sales were \u201cfor resale as such\u201d and, accordingly, entitled to the benefit of the exclusion at the supplier-Burger King level.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As to this problem, decisional guidance is to be found in the so-called \u201ccontainer cases\u201d <em>(Matter of American Molasses Co. v McGoldrick, </em>281 NY 269, 273; <em>Matter of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. v Joseph, </em>308 NY 333, 338; <em>Matter of Dairylea Co-op. v State Tax Comm., </em>41 AD2d 312, 316, mot for Iv to app den 33 NY2d 513). The nub of these cases is that a sale is not one at retail when a supplier sells containers to a wholesaler or manufacturer, who then sells his product packed in these containers either to a retailer or to an ultimate consumer. The courts reasoned that the containers, although bought to be resold as \u201can incident to the sale of the contents\u201d <em>(Matter of American Molasses Co. v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>McGoldrick, supra, </em>p 274), were nonetheless sales for resale as such. The cartons, although <em>\u201cnot </em>inseparable\u201d from the contents, were, in this context, being resold <em>\u201cas </em>containers\u201d (see <em>Matter of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. v Joseph, supra, </em>p 339 [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">All the more is this so in the case of Burger King, whose packaging, as we have seen, is such a critical element of the final product sold to customers. So regarded, the packaging material is as much a part of the final price as is the food or drink item itself. It would be exalting form over substance, therefore, to hold that a resale of these paper products does not take place merely because Burger King does not list a separate price.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Now, though the relative delicacy of the paper goods employed in Burger King\u2019s \u201cfast food\u201d operation is qualitatively much different from the grosser and coarser containers (pails, wooden barrels, metal drums, wooden crates, burlap sacks and three-gallon ice cream containers) with which the courts treated in the cited cases, and though the containers in these cases were largely confined to conventional delivery functions rather than the far more intimate product association afforded to Burger Kings\u2019 wrappings, in the present case, as in the cited ones, the containers and their contents at no time become \u201cinseparably connected\u201d <em>(Matter of American Molasses Co. v McGoldrick, </em>281 NY 269, 273-274, <em>supra). </em>It follows that Burger King purchases its packaging from its suppliers for \u201cresale as such\u201d to its customers and thus is entitled to the exclusion of section 1101 (subd [b], par [4], cl [i], subcl [A]), of the Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This holding also brings that statute within the spirit underlying our sales tax law, which is to impose the tax only upon the sale to the ultimate consumer, at which time the price paid for the taxable item would presumably be at its highest. (See <em>Matter of Dairylea Co-op. v State Tax Comm., </em>41 AD2d 312, mot for lv to app den 33 NY2d 513, <em>supra). </em>Yet if Burger King were required to pay sales tax on its purchases of packaging, the consumer would end up paying a tax on the sales tax. Clearly, this pyramiding of taxes would distort the original legislative intent and is to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Lastly, we now treat with Edgmor\u2019s and Davmor\u2019s contention that section 1115 (subd [a], par [12]) of the Tax Law exempted the sale of machinery used to process food and drink. That section, as it existed during the assessment periods at issue provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201c(a) Receipts from the following shall be exempt from the tax * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c(12) Machinery or equipment for use or consumption directly and exclusively <em>in the production of tangible personal property </em>* * * for sale, <em>by manufacturing </em>[or] <em>processing\u201d </em>(emphasis added)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In effect, we have already rejected the taxpayers\u2019 claim of an exemption under this legislation. As its plain language tells us, necessary to a conclusion that the provision applies is a finding that the machinery is used to produce \u201ctangible personal property\u201d. While in another context (e.g., the production of a frozen food product to be sold in a grocery store) these machines might be said to be so used, we have already demonstrated that here the production efforts are geared to the processing and delivery of restaurant food \u2014 a category distinct from tangible personal property. Certainly, the commission is not to be faulted because, in refusing to classify restaurant food as tangible personal property, it did not allow the particular stage at which its products were being \u201cserviced\u201d to result in an inconsistent conceptualization of their nature. Consequently, we are compelled to conclude that the sales of the machinery and equipment at issue are not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">For all these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, in accordance with this writing and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\">. Only so much of these items as were used by Burger King for on-premises consumption of meals are at stake on this appeal. The commission is not pursuing a like assessment as to off-premises consumption only because it failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to give the taxpayer notice that taxes due on such sales were also to be the subject matter of his hearing. At the hearing, the taxpayer conceded liability as to outer bags, straws and coffee stirrers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. Section 1105, in fact, imposes a sales tax on six separate types of transactions ranging from the sale of tangible personal property through admission charges for the use of places of amusement. Each type of transaction is taxed by a different subdivision of section 1105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\">. Effective September 1, 1974 \u201cpredominantly\u201d was substituted for \u201cexclusively\u201d (L 1974, ch 851, \u00a7 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b664-8\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARO\">(dissenting). I would transpose the conclusions reached by the majority. The purchases by Burger King of the paper products (e.g., wrappers for sandwiches, cups to contain coffee, soda and other drinks, and sleeves for holding french fries) should be held to be subject to the sales tax (to that extent I would agree with the State Tax Commission), and the purchases by Burger King of equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for processing food and drink (e.g., ovens, fryers, broilers, coffee urns and milk shake machinery) should be held to be exempt from the sales tax (to that extent I would disagree with the commission).</p>\n<p id=\"At1\">With reference to the paper products, the commission was surely justified in determining that their purchase was a retail sale within the definition of section 1101 (subd [Jb], par [4]) of the Tax Law and did not come within the exception set forth in subclause (A) of clause (i) of that paragraph as a purchase \u201cfor resale as such or as a physical component part of tangible personal property\u201d. I agree with Mr. Justice Ellis J. Staley, Jr., at the Appellate Division, and for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion, that Burger King did not sell the paper products as such to their customers and that the paper products did not become physical component parts of the food and drink which were sold to their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">As to the processing equipment, I am persuaded that the purchase of this equipment, as a matter of law, falls within the exemption provided in section 1115 (subd [a], par [12]) of the Tax Law. That paragraph provided that receipts from the sale of \u201c [m] achinery or equipment for use or consumption directly and exclusively [since 1974, \u2018predominantly\u2019] in the production of tangible personal property\u201d were exempt from the tax imposed by subdivision (a) of section 1105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I can agree with the contention of the commission that, under the design of the sales tax law, receipts from sales of food and drink by this taxpayer were taxable under subdivision (d) of section 1105 as a hybrid sale of tangible personal property with associated service incident to their delivery to the customer, rather than under subdivision (a) as a sale of tangible personal property, and to that extent that restaurant food subject to the tax under subdivision (d) does not fall within the definition of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d set out in section 1101 (subd [b], par [6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The matter does not end there, however. The exemption provision of section 1115 (subd [a], par [12]) on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the taxpayer relies is entirely independent of subdivision (d) of section 1105 which imposes a tax on the \u201chybrid\u201d sales. The exemption granted is from the tax imposed by subdivision (a) of section 1105, not from the tax imposed by subdivision (d) of that section. No reason appears why the explicit definition of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d as \u201c[c]orporeal personal property of any nature\u201d (Tax Law, \u00a7 1101, subd [b], par [6]) should not be applied in accordance with the plain meaning of the words used. Food and drink as such would clearly fall within the sweep of that definition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hybrid concept of the taxation of sales of restaurant food and drink as a combination of tangible personal property and services within the contemplation of subdivision (d) of section 1105, on which the commission would rely, is irrevelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Even if that concept were thought to be relevant, however, it would not be applicable. The equipment in question processed only food and drink \u2014 the tangible personal property component of the hybrid \u2014 and had nothing whatsoever to do with the services component of the hybrid.
