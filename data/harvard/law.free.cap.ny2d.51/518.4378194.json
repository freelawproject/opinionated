Corp. v Acme Quilting Co., </em>46 NY2d 211; <em>Breed v Insurance Co. of North Amer., </em>46 NY2d 351; <em>Sen-row Concession v Shelton Props., </em>10 NY2d 320; <em>Spencer v VDO Instruments, </em>232 F Supp 735, 352 F2d 784; <em>Janos v Peck, </em>21 AD2d 529, 15 NY2d 509; <em>Sillman v Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>3 NY2d 395; <em>Dell Pub. Co. v Stanley Pub., </em>9 NY2d 126.) II. By accepting the benefit of the contract, plaintiff is estopped from disputing defendant\u2019s ownership of the Fraunces Tavern name. <em>(Farnsworth v Boro Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>216 NY 40; <em>Tilyou v Reynolds, </em>108 NY 558; <em>Hyatt v Dale Tile Mfg.

Co. v Hall, </em>61 NY 226.) III. The court below properly applied the doctrine of secondary meaning by reason of the fact that the service mark \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d is not arbitrary or \u201cinherently distinctive\u201d. <em>(President &amp; Trustees of Colby Coll. v Colby College-New Hampshire, </em>374 F Supp 1141; <em>Wyatt Earp Enterprises v Sackman, Inc., </em>157 F Supp 621; <em>Volkswagenwerk AG. v Richard, </em>492 F2d 474; <em>American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F2d 3; <em>United Drug Co. v Rectanus Co., </em>248 US 90.) IV. The subsequent grant of the certificate of registration for the service mark \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d for restaurant purposes makes summary judgment impossible.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b561-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b561-5\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The sole question before us on this appeal is whether Special Term properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its third counterclaim, in which defendant sought to enjoin plaintiff \u201cfrom using the name Fraunces Tavern, from using any name other than Fraunces Tavern Restaurant\u201d. We hold that defendant is entitled to such injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Defendant owns the building at 54 Pearl Street in the Borough of Manhattan which has been known since the eighteenth century as \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d. The building has been designated a national landmark and is primarily known as the site where then General George Washington bade farewell to his officers at the close of the Revolutionary War.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The plaintiff is the tenant under a lease executed in 1977 which entitles it, subject to numerous restrictions, to conduct a restaurant business on the premises. Plaintiff asserts that the Norden family has conducted a restaurant busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ness on the leased premises for over 40 years and that because of the lengthy association of their restaurant business with the name \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d that name has become synonymous with their restaurant and that they, therefore, have acquired the exclusive right to use the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">This assertion is belied by several provisions of the lease to which they consented in 1977. Specifically, paragraph 3.04 of the lease provides as follows: \u201cThe business conducted by Tenant in the premises is only to be conducted under the name \u2018Fraunces Tavern Restaurant\u2019 or such other name as Landlord shall from time to time approve in writing pursuant to the request of Tenant.\u201d Perhaps the clearest recognition of defendant\u2019s ownership of the \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d appellation is contained in paragraph 40.01, which provided: \u201cThe right to use the name \u2018Fraunces Tavern Restaurant\u2019 in connection with Tenant\u2019s business shall be limited to the restaurant business conducted in the premises and to no other business or location, and such right shall terminate upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Having recognized defendant\u2019s ownership of the name \u201cFraunces Tavern Restaurant\u201d, and having accepted the licensed use of the name upon the terms dictated by the defendant, plaintiff cannot now assert ownership of it as against defendant (see <em>Stogop Realty Co. v Marie Antoinette Hotel Co., </em>217 App Div 555).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Nor is the plaintiff\u2019s claim of ownership advanced by the fact that even as it negotiated the 1977 lease, it applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for registration of the name \u201cFraunces Tavern\u201d as a service mark and subsequently obtained such registration. It is well established that registration is not dispositive of the common-law rights of ownership of the trade-mark (see <em>Turner v HMH Pub. Co., </em>380 F2d 224, 228; <em>United States Jaycees v San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, </em>354 F Supp 61, 70, affd 513 F2d 1226), but merely grants the registrant the procedural advantage of establishing prima facie ownership. The probative value of that registration is but slight in light of the facts that plaintiff applied for the service mark at a time when it was conceding in negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tion that defendant owned the name \u201cFraunces Tavern Restaurant\u201d, and that the provisions of the lease negotiated clearly establish defendant\u2019s ownership of the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Defendant was entitled to summary judgment on its third counterclaim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The order of the Appellate Division insofar as appealed from should, therefore, be reversed and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, with costs, summary judgment granted to defendant on the third counterclaim, and question certified answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> The only issue briefed before us is whether the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the third counterclaim was proper. Accordingly, we do not consider the propriety of so much of the Special Term order as denied defendant\u2019s motion addressed to the second and fourth causes of action stated in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
