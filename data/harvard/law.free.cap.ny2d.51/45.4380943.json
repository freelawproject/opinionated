We conclude that it does not satisfy the tests for admission of a statement against penal interest laid down in <em>People v Maerling </em>(46 NY2d 289) and that the defendant\u2019s conviction, therefore, may not stand. Because we decide that the statement cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>consider whether the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The defendant was convicted after a jury trial of second degree murder and first and second degree robbery in connection with the death of a wealthy homosexual. The Appellate Division reversed the conviction and we affirm. The facts relevant to this appeal were testified to by Detectives John Toone and Carl Sgrizzi and by Thomas Gilligan, a participant in the crime who co-operated with the prosecution and was permitted to plead guilty to attempted second degree robbery. Principally as told by Gilligan the events surrounding the murder were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The victim had been at various times the friend and lover of Gilligan, Robert Hoke and one Robert Jones<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>. Gilligan, Hoke, and Jones, had become acquainted with the defendant and one Chris Denim. In October, 1975, at a party attended by Gilligan, Hoke, Jones, the defendant, the defendant\u2019s brother and possibly Denim, there was a general discussion about obtaining money without labor, by means such as robbing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The next month Denim, Gilligan, Jones, and the defendant, decided to obtain money from the victim by telling him, falsely, that bail money was needed for Jones. If that did not work, they intended to rob him. At the building the defendant and Denim went upstairs to the victim\u2019s apartment while Jones and Gilligan waited for a while in the vestibule. When they reached the apartment the defendant, holding a knife, was standing over the victim\u2019s body. After being threatened by the defendant, Gilligan opened a file cabinet which he knew to contain valuables, then fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Shortly after the murder Jones was questioned by the police, but denied his own participation or having recently seen Gilligan, and offered to help the police find Gilligan. Gilligan was arrested December 3, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The defendant and Jones were separately arrested early on December 4, 1975 by Detectives Toone and Sgrizzi. According to the detectives Jones, upon seeing Gilligan and the defendant in custody, gave an account of the crime which was basically the same as that given by Gilligan at the trial. Jones thereafter testified before the Grand Jury but refused to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial after the prosecutor declined to give consideration to his co-operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Because Jones was unavailable at trial the detectives were permitted to recount his confession without mention of the defendant, as a declaration against penal interest. Toone, however, in testifying as to Jones\u2019 confession, made one reference to \u201cthe defendant\u201d, from which the jury could infer that Jones implicated Geoghegan. It is that statement by Jones which is the focus of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In <em>People v Maerling (supra, </em>at p 298), we required that for a statement against penal interest to be admissible the interest compromised must be such as to \"all but rule out\u201d motive to falsify, the declarant must be conscious of the consequences of his statement at the time it is made, that only those parts which inculpate the declarant should be admitted, and that there should be an opportunity to show from the circumstances of its making that any indicia of apparent reliability are misleading. Those assurances of probative value, which might in a proper case substitute for cross-examination, were not present in this case. Additionally, the fact that Jones\u2019 confession was not restricted to self-inculpation, but as well implicated defendant, deprives it of admissibility under <em>Maerling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">At the time Jones\u2019 confession was made he had already been arrested for the murder and was subject to criminal prosecution. Moreover, having seen Gilligan and Geoghegan in custody at the station house he believed the police to be already fully apprised of his own role in the crime. Thus, there was more than the \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d we referred to in <em>People v Settles </em>(46 NY2d 154, 168), that he would be motivated to implicate falsely in hope of winning immunity to prosecution or a plea to a reduced charge. That achieving lenient treatment for himself was indeed Jones\u2019 goal is demonstrated by the degree of co-operation he gave the prosecution at various stages of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In his initial contact with the police Jones denied his own participation and misled the police. Only under stimulus of the belief that police already knew his role in the affair did Jones acknowledge a part in the crime, and then his \"confession\u201d carefully limited his participation to the less culpable role of -waiting with Gilligan while, without their knowledge, others accomplished the actual killing.- Jones then testified on his own behalf and against the others before the Grand Jury, and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege until shortly before trial when it became clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the prosecutor would afford him no consideration for his cooperation. That the particulars of Jones\u2019 recital of the facts may be said to mirror those to which Gilligan testified may not be remarkable either, inasmuch as Gilligan too might be expected to have been disposed to implicate defendant in exchange for acceptance of his plea to a charge of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In view of the seriousness of the charges facing him and the belief that his participation in the crime was already known, it is apparent that Jones had powerful incentives to minimize his own role and to place primary blame on others. We conclude therefore, as a matter of law, that Jones had motive to falsify, and that his declaration should not be admissible to prove the guilt of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"> Name used herein is fictitious for the purpose of publication. [Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b90-7\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALh\">(dissenting). I would hold that the confession of one participant in a crime who refuses to testify at trial should be admitted in evidence as a declaration against penal interest where there exists a clear indication of the statement\u2019s reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">It is difficult to understand the majority\u2019s view that a statement or confession made by a participant in a crime revealing his involvement therein, such as that made by Jones in this case, is not admissible in evidence as a declaration against penal interest. I had thought such a statement or confession was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule where the person making the admission is dead or beyond the jurisdiction and, thus, not available; or where he is available but refuses to testify in court on the ground of self incrimination. (E.g., <em>People v Maerling, </em>46 NY2d 289, 295-299; <em>People v Brown, </em>26 NY2d 88.) As the court below aptly observed, \u201c[Jones\u2019] statements were properly characterized as declarations against penal interest for they qualified as such under the fourfold test enunciated in <em>People v Settles </em>(46 NY2d 154, 167). First of all, [Jones] was unavailable because he refused to testify at defendant\u2019s trial. Secondly, he realized that the statements were against his penal interest when made. Thirdly, the declarant demonstrated a first-hand knowledge of the facts surrounding De Vroom\u2019s murder. Lastly, Gilligan\u2019s testimony constituted independent evidence confirming the reliability and trustworthiness of the declarations.\u201d (68 AD2d, at p 283; see, e.g., <em>People v Piazza, </em>48 NY2d 151, 157; <em>People v Maerling, </em>46 NY2d 289, 295-299, <em>supra; People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Brown, </em>26 NY2d 88, <em>supra; </em>see, generally, Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], \u00a7\u00a7 255-266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The majority, however, holds that Jones\u2019 station house confession is not admissible as a declaration against penal interest by suggesting that Jones may have bent the truth in a misguided attempt to save his own skin. I find such logic strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In the <em>Maerling </em>case, we stated \"that the interest which the declaration compromises must be one of sufficient magnitude or consequence to the declarant to all but rule out any motive to falsify.\u201d (46 NY2d 289, 298, <em>supra.) </em>I simply cannot imagine a more compelling interest than the interest of a suspect in a brutal murder to conceal his involvement therein. It seems incredible that a man would confess fully to his participation in a murder in the farfetched hope of receiving lenient treatment, especially where, as here, the very persons whom he could implicate are already in the custody of law enforcement officials. If Jones \u201cbelieved the police to be already fully apprised of his own role in the crime\u201d (at p 49), it seems far more likely that Jones was prompted to confess because he believed that remaining silent would serve little purpose, rather than to confess in furtherance of an on-the-spot, contrived plan to escape prosecution for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">To insist on more reliability than was demonstrated evinces a quest for certainty that transcends the reality of litigation. Such insistence forgets that the dozens of forms of admissible hearsay that are so essential to the trial process would disappear if insurance rather than assurance of reliability was the test. It ignores the fact that direct testimonial proof offers no guarantee of truth, and overlooks the role in our adversarial system of counsel, through whose ministrations the inherent limitations of any form of proof, hearsay or direct, may be put in appropriate perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Once it is established that Jones\u2019 confession is admissible in evidence as a declaration against penal interest, it becomes necessary to resolve the further issue \u2014 not reached by the majority due to its disposition \u2014 whether defendant\u2019s constitutional right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d (US Const, 6th Arndt; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6) was violated by the use of these statements at trial. I am convinced that defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not transgressed, and it was error for the court below to hold to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>It is fundamental that the confrontation clause does not require that all hearsay statements be excluded from evidence in criminal proceedings, even where the extrajudicial statement incriminates defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Ohio v Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 63; <em>Dutton v Evans, </em>400 US 74, 80; <em>Pointer v Texas, </em>380 US 400, 407; <em>People v Salko, </em>47 NY2d 230, 241.) This is so because the confrontation clause does not entitle criminal defendants to cross-examine witnesses against them in each and every instance (see <em>United States v King, </em>552 F2d 833, 846, cert den 430 US 966);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather, if clear indications of reliability exist independent of cross-examination and the finder of facts has sufficient basis for evaluating the truth of the statement offered, a defendant under such circumstances is not deprived of the protections accorded by the confrontation clause. As the Supreme Court wrote in the <em>Dutton </em>case, \"[t]he decisions of this Court make it clear that the mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that 'the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u2019 \u201d (400 US, at p 89, <em>supra, </em>quoting <em>California v Green, </em>399 US 149, 161.) This view has been recently reaffirmed <em>(Ohio v Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 65-66, <em>supra), </em>and, thus, it is clear that \u201cpractical concern\u201d for the reliability of inculpatory hearsay is the key to confrontation clause analysis. <em>(United States v Alvarez, </em>584 F2d 694, 701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The very predicate for this court\u2019s decision that \"[t]he rule in New York should be modernized to hold that an admission against penal interest will be received\u201d in evidence was a recognition of these statements\u2019 inherent reliability <em>(People v Brown, </em>26 NY2d 88, 94, <em>supra),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and further documentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>this well-settled observation would be mere surplusage. Suffice it to say that in <em>People v Maerling </em>(46 NY2d 289, <em>supra), </em>a case in which we undertook an extensive review of declarations against penal interest, our court unanimously held that \"in the case of declarations against interest, the theory is that such assurance [of reliability] flows from the fact that a person ordinarily does not reveal facts that are contrary to his own interest. Therefore, the reasoning goes, absent other motivations, when he does so, he is responding to a truth-revealing compulsion <em>as great as that to which he would likely be subjected if cross-examined as a witness.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We went on to say that \"[o]ne thing is clear: the severe sanctions potentially attendant upon a conviction for crime, whether by way of imprisonment or fine or both, make admissions of guilt among the most disserving of declarations. We therefore conclude that, conceptually, declarations against penal interest may be admissible against an accused.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp 295, 297.) When one recalls that the introduction of a declaration against penal interest is also dependent upon the submission of \"other evidence tending to show that the declarant or someone he implicates as his accomplice actually committed a crime\u201d <em>(People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154, 169, <em>supra), </em>the reliability of the declaration is certainly assured. Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that \"[reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>(Ohio v Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 66, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Here, not only are Jones\u2019 statements inherently reliable as declarations against penal interest, but there was clear proof, independent of these statements, to establish defendant\u2019s culpability and, thus, confirm the declarations\u2019 veracity. As the majority itself notes, \u201cJones ** * * gave an account of the crime <em>which was basically the same as that given by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Gilligan at the trial.\u201d </em>(At p 48 [emphasis added].) There can be no doubt that defendant\u2019s conviction rested almost entirely upon Gilligan\u2019s testimony at trial. His recitation of the events surrounding the brutal, slashing murder of De Vroom and defendant\u2019s involvement in this animalistic act were exposed to cross-examination and, therefore, the jury was able to assess fully the truth of these statements. Further, one Kremer Hoke testified that a discussion had taken place between defendant and his cohorts in which the victim\u2019s status as an easy prey was mentioned, and not to be forgotten is the jury\u2019s opportunity to evaluate Detective Toone\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Under these circumstances, I can only come to the conclusion that defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him was not transgressed by the introduction of Jones\u2019 declarations against penal interest. Reliability \u2014 the very essence of the confrontation clause \u2014 was certainly demonstrated as to these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Before concluding, one point should be made clear. By this dissent, I am not advocating a rule of law which contemplates that every extrajudicial statement qualifying as an exception to the hearsay rule be permitted into evidence in a criminal proceeding, for I too recognize that \"[wjhile the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause share a similarity of purpose, the protections they afford have not been viewed as entirely equatable.\u201d <em>(People v Salko, </em>47 NY2d 230, 241, <em>supra, </em>citing <em>Dutton v Evans, </em>400 US 74, 86, <em>supra; </em>see <em>California v Green, </em>399 US 149, 155, <em>supra.) </em>Phrased differently, the indicia of reliability which sustain an exception to the hearsay rule do not automatically render nugatory a defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him. However, if, as in this case, clear indications of reliability exist, I would hold that the confession of . one participant in a crime who refuses to testify at trial, even if it implicates the defendant, should be admitted into evidence. (See, generally, Fine, Declarations Against Penal Interest in New York: Carte Blanche?, 21 Syracuse L Rev 1095, 1118-1134A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">For the above-stated reasons, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division, reinstate the murder and robbery convictions, and remit the case to the Appellate Division for determination of the facts. (GPL 470.40, subd 2, par [b]; 470.25, subd 2, par [d].)</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabkielli, Jones, Wachtler and Meyer concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Fuchsberg concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">. As stated in <em>Dutton v Evans </em>(400 US 74, 80): \"It is not argued, nor could it be, that the constitutional right to confrontation requires that no hearsay evidence can ever be introduced.\u201d Phrased differently, \"[i]f one were to read [the language of the confrontation clause]' literally, it would require, on objection, the exclusion of any statement made by a declarant not present at trial. See <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U. S. 237, 243 (1895) ('[T]here could be nothing more directly contrary to the letter of the provision in question than the admission of dying declarations\u2019). But, if thus applied, the Clause would abrogate virtually every hearsay exception, a result long rejected as unintended and too extreme.\u201d <em>(Ohio v Roberts, </em>488 US 56, 63.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. I am not implying, of course, that the right of criminal defendants to question the witnesses against them is not a very important component of the confrontation clause. (E.g., <em>Bruton v United States, </em>391 US 123.) Also, I must admit that I find the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in this area less than lucid. (See Younger, Confrontation and Hearsay: A Look Backward, A Peek Forward, 1 Hofstra L Rev 32.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">. It should be noted that at the time <em>Bruton v United States </em>(391 US 123, <em>supra) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>was tried, the Federal courts did not recognize the declaration against penal interest exception. <em>(Donnelly v United States, </em>228 US 243.) However, rule 804 (subd [b], par [3]) of the Federal Rules of Evidence now provides, in pertinent part: \"The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: * * * A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability * * * that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
