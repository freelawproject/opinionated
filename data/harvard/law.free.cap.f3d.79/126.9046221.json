Coe argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 (1994). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an adjustment, this court reviews interpretations of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, United States v. Pedersen, </em>3 F.3d 1468, 1470 (11th Cir.1993), and factual determinations for clear error, <em>United States v. Kendrick, </em>22 F.3d 1066, 1068 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Section 3E1.1 requires a downward adjustment \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a). To determine whether a defendant qualifies, a sentencing court should consider whether he \u201ctruthfully ad-mitt[ed] or [did] not falsely deny[ ] any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1). Relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuC\">all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1). The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.3 further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under subseetion[ ] (a)(1) ... the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">USSG \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">Coe admitted that he used a firearm to commit a robbery, although he claimed he could not remember whether he had pulled the weapon\u2019s trigger. The government points out that Coe initially denied that he' had held the gun to the victim\u2019s head and pulled the trigger and had brandished the gun at other civilians. The district court found that Coe did not accept responsibility because he was hot forthright about brandishing the gun and pulling its trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">On appeal, Coe argues that whether he accepted responsibility for pulling the trigger and brandishing the gun is irrelevant to the acceptance of responsibility analysis because those actions do not constitute \u201crelevant conduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3. He argues that according to \u00a7 1B1.3\u2019s heading\u2014 \u201cRelevant Conduct (Factors That Determine the Guideline Range)\u201d \u2014 and note 1 of \u00a7 1B1.3\u2019s commentary, relevant conduct includes only those acts and omissions that are used to calculate the applicable guideline range prior to adjustment. However, the broad language of \u00a7 1B1.3(a) is clear: relevant conduct includes <em>all </em>acts that occurred during the commission of the offense. Moreover, note 1 must be read in its entirety and in light of the breadth of \u00a7 1B1.3(a). In context it becomes apparent that note 1 is not limiting, but merely explains that relevant conduct encompasses more than those acts directly relevant to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In this case, Coe brandished a gun and pulled its trigger during the offense for which he was convicted. Those acts are relevant conduct for which Coe is accountable, and therefore, a court may consider them in assessing whether Coe accepted responsibility for his offense. Because the court correctly interpreted the sentencing guidelines, and its factual determination that Coe had not been forthright about pulling the trigger and brandishing the gun is not clearly erroneous, we affirm Coe\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
