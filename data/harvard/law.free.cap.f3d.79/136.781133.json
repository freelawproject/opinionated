(Stin-son) appeals the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims dismissing its complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">Stinson, a law firm, while representing an accident victim in his dealings with the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Co. (Provident), learned of assertedly improper practices in Provident\u2019s Medicare billing practices. Stinson brought a <em>qui tam </em>action under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729-33, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which court transferred the action to the Eastern District of Tennessee. The Tennessee district court dismissed the complaint, finding that Stinson was not the original source of the information about Provident, as required by the statute. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4). Stinson appealed to the Sixth Circuit. While the appeal was pending Stin-son and Provident settled for a sum apparently related to Stinson\u2019s legal costs. The settlement was approved by the district court, to which the case was remanded for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">The United States had declined to intervene in Stinson\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>action. Instead, the government sued Provident separately. Provident and the United States eventually settled for approximately $27,000,000. Stin-son states that it was the source of much of the government\u2019s information concerning Provident\u2019s wrongdoing, and requested its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>statutory share of that settlement. The government refused, and Stinson sued in the Court of Federal Claims, asserting entitlement to a share of the recovery. This appeal is from the court\u2019s dismissal of that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The False Claims Act provides that a private citizen who meets certain criteria may bring a <em>qui torn </em>suit in federal district court in the name of the United States, to remedy a fraudulent claim made against the government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b). The government may at its option intervene in the suit and conduct it. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). Alternatively, the government may pursue an independent action, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(5), or take no action. If the government intervenes or pursues an independent action, the \u201crelator\u201d \u2014 the term used for a <em>qui tarn </em>plaintiff \u2014 is entitled to a portion of any recovery in an amount up to 30%, depending on circumstances set by statute. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The statute requires that only \u201can original source of the information\u201d is a proper relator. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, \u201coriginal source\u201d means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">In addition, suit must be brought in district court. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(a). In the Court of Federal Claims, Stinson was bound by the ruling of the Tennessee district court which held that Stinson was not \u201can original source\u201d under the False Claims Act. Stinson argues that its status as a relator is irrelevant, and that it is entitled to a share of the government\u2019s recovery because it provided much of the information the government used in obtaining the significant settlement and recovery from Provident. Thus Stinson states that it has brought a proper claim under the Tucker Act, wherein the False Claims Act is the money-mandating statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">The Court of Federal Claims, applying <em>LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025 (Fed.Cir.1995), dismissed the case. Stinson seeks to distinguish the facts of its case from those of <em>LeBlanc, </em>and argues that it was the government\u2019s failure to sue the wrongdoer that barred LeBlanc from receiving a statutory share of the recovery, not his failure to qualify as a relator. We do not share Stinson\u2019s view that it is not necessary to be a relator in order to share in a recovery obtained under the False Claims Act. Recovery is available only under the conditions of the False Claims Act. A person who did not satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4) in bringing a <em>qui tam </em>action can not share in a subsequent government recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">In <em>LeBlanc </em>the question of whether the claimant was a proper relator had been finally decided in the district court and affirmed by the First Circuit. <em>LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1030. Stinson, like LeBlanc, has already been adjudicated not to be a relator under the False Claims Act. Thus he has no right to claim under the Tucker Act an asserted governmental obligation incurred under the False Claims Act. Moreover, jurisdiction lies only in the district court, thus the Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed Stin-son\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\">. <em>Stinson, Lyons &amp; Bustamante, P.A. v.
