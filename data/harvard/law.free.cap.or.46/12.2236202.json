In this case the crime charged consisted of two elements, the criminal intent to steal from the person of another, accompanied by the overt act of placing his hand in the poelcet of such other. Both these must be proved. The jury found a verdict of simple assault, which is a distinct crime not charged in the information. If the assault of which he was convicted was the thrusting of his hand into the pocket of the complaining witness, then the verdict should have been guilty as charged; but if it was some other act, then he was convicted of an act with which he was not charged: 3 Enc. Pl. &amp; Pr. 98; <em>Graham </em>v. People, 181 Ill. 477 (47 L. R. A. 731, 55 N. E. 177).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-19\">II. In addition to the punishment prescribed by Section 1772, B. &amp; C. Comp., the court added the element of \u201chard labor.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>This part of the sentence is illegal and requires a reversal of . the judgment: <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Wis. 395; <em>In re Johnson </em>46 Fed. 477; <em>Harman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>50 Fed. 921; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>United States, </em>58 Fed. 766; <em>In re Christian, </em>83 Fed. 199; <em>Gardes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>87 Fed. 172; <em>Ex parte Karstendick, </em>93 U.

Some federal courts have held that the judgment may be modified by striking out the words \u201cat hard labor\u201d; this court has no such power, it can only revise the decisions of circuit courts: Const. Or. Art. VII, \u00a7 6; <em>Boone </em>v. <em>McClane, </em>2 Or. 331.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\">For the State there was an oral argument by <em>Mr. Arthur C. Spencer, </em>with a brief over the names of <em>Andrew M. Crawford, </em>Attorney General, <em>John Manning, </em>District Attorney, and <em>A. C. Spencer, </em>to this effect.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">1. We agree with counsel that to accomplish the crime of attempted larceny from the person, two elements must be established by the State, viz, a felonious intent coupled with an overt act by means of which the plan of the thief could be carried to a successful conclusion. We contend in this case the overt act was the provoking and carrying on of a fistic encounter in the midst of which the thief, seeing his - victim off his guard, by stealth attempts to take his victim\u2019s belongings. We confess that after a careful search and examination of text-books and digests we are unable to afford the court any cases analogous to the one here in question, but are confident that where the \u201cassault\u201d is charged in the information and no demurrer interposed on the ground of duplicity, the court will not disturb a verdict which finds that the assault was made as alleged, but. that no larceny was, in fact, intended. The crime of which the appellant stands convicted is charged in the information, and hence the case comes within Section 1418, B. &amp; C. Comp.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">2. Tacking the words \u201cat hard labor\u201d to the sentence imposed was not reversible error, if it was error at all. The words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>complained of did not vary the mode of punishment inflicted, it being at the worst only superfluous: B. &amp; C. Comp. \u00a7\u00a7 4864, 4865; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>74 Ala. 478; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>State, </em>24 N. J. Law, 455; <em>People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>89 N.

Dec. 55); <em>Ex parte Mooney, </em>26 <em>W. </em>Va. 36 (53 Am. Rep. 59); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Kan. 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">3. This court can correct the judgment complained of if it is deemed erroneous: <em>State </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>50 Tenn. (2 Heisk.) 135; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Tex. Cr. Rep. 82; <em>Sledd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Gratt. 813.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-20\">Section 1418, B.'&amp; C. Comp., reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-21\">\u201cIn all cases the defendant may be found gruilty of any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">Mr. Justice Wolverton</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">delivered the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The defendant, having been charged with an attempt to commit the crime of larceny from the person, was convicted upon trial of simple assault, and sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail, \u201cat hard labor,\u201d for a period of six months. He complains, first, of the conviction, and, second,' of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> As to the first, he insists that the crime of simple assault is not necessarily included in a charge of an attempt to commit the crimfe of larceny from the person,' and therefore that he was unlawfully convicted. It is difficult, to conceive how larceny from the person could be accomplished without an assault. An attempt to commit larceny from the person might or might not be accompanied with an assault, but the difficulty of \u25a0 its inclusion with the larger offense is obviated here, as the information charges that the defendant assaulted the prosecuting witness, and thrust his hand in the witness\u2019s pocket with the intent to steal, take, and carry away from his person the money and chattels, if any such he should find. The crime as alleged could not have been committed without at the same time committing an assault upon the person, and hence the latter, being the lesser offense, was necessarily included in the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The second complaint is certainly not 'without merit. The defendant having been convicted of simple assault, he was punishable only by imprisonment in .the county jail or by fine: B. &amp; C. Comp. \u00a7 1772. In this case the court went further than the statute permits. It condemned the defendant to hard labor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>as well as imprisonment, thereby adding something of material moment to the penalty prescribed by the statute. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> Nor can the words \u201cat hard labor\u201d be treated as mere surplusage. They have a distinct meaning, and qualify the judgment rendered. If they are stricken out, we have a different judgment from the one pronounced; and, if they stand as rendered, the judgment is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> We cannot make the correction here, but we can remand the cause to the trial court for that purpose: <em>State </em>v. <em>Marple, </em>15 Or. 205 (14 Pac. 521). The conviction being regular, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial, but he is entitled to a proper judgment upon the conviction had.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The judgment entered will therefore be reversed, and the-cause remanded to the court below, with directions to pass such sentence as the law authorizes. Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
