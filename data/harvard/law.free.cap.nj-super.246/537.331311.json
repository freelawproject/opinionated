Each appeals from a final decision of the Director of the Division of Economic Assistance (DEA) which affirmed the termination of some or all AFDC benefits because of the refusal of the AFDC recipients to petition the Essex County Surrogate for withdrawal of individual trust funds established for minor beneficiaries after tort judgments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be used for the minor\u2019s current or future support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Each of the AFDC recipients have minor children who have received a personal injury award stemming from either a motor vehicle accident<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or lead poisoning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>3B:15-16, 17, the net awards were deposited into trust funds with the Surrogate of Essex County. As required by <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:81-3.39, the Essex County Division of Welfare (ECDW) requested each AFDC recipient to assist that Agency in the presentation of a Surrogate\u2019s Court petition for release of these trust funds for the current and future support<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the minors for whose benefit the funds were held. All recipients were advised that failure to cooperate would result in termination of AFDC benefits for such minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Except for H.S., the remaining AFDC recipients ultimately agreed to cooperate with the ECDW provided they did not relinquish their rights to challenge the validity of <em>N.J.A: C. </em>10:81-3.39 and with the understanding that should they prevail, all monies previously withdrawn from the trust fund by ECDW would be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">One Administrative Law Judge, sitting in review of the M.B. case, recommended reversal of the decision of the ECDW to terminate benefits, holding that <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:81-3.39 conflicted with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) and was therefore nugatory. Although the Director agreed that the ECDW is precluded, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a), from considering a minor\u2019s personal injury award for <em>reimbursement </em>of past payments, she disagreed with the finding that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4 and its introductory statement expressly barred the Agency from petitioning the court for release of personal injury award trust funds for current and future support.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">A second Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision in the J.R., <em>et al. </em>and O.J. matters on September 11, 1989 and September 18, 1989, respectively, finding that (1) <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:81-3'.39(a) was not in conflict with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a); (2) the trust funds would not necessarily be depleted depending on the size of the trust, the length of time the recipient seeks AFDC benefits, and the willingness of the Surrogate\u2019s Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>allow the release of funds; and (3) application for withdrawal affecting <em>eligibility </em>to receive current and future AFDC benefits were not covered by the April 9, 1985 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) under the court\u2019s holding in <em>Hart v. Fox, </em>204 <em>NJ.Super. </em>564, 499 A 2d 553 (Law Div.1985). The Director adopted this initial decision and affirmed termination of the AFDC benefits. We note that the Director\u2019s decisions permit the Board to require application for withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On appeal, the AFDC recipients argue that ECDW cannot lawfully condition receipt of AFDC benefits upon petitioning the Surrogate\u2019s Court to release their children\u2019s personal injury based trust funds, whether for past, current or future support of such trust-benefitted children.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">AFDC is a joint federal-state welfare program established pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 601, <em>et seq., </em>to provide assistance to certain \u201cneedy\u201d dependent children and the parents and relatives who live with and care for them so they may attain self-sufficiency. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 601. Although states have wide latitude in determining the appropriate standard of need and level of assistance they wish to provide under the AFDC program, the states must administer their programs in compliance with applicable federal statutes and with regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since AFDC is financed largely by the federal government on a matching-fund basis, HHS may withhold funding from a state which fails to conform its AFDC plan to the federal scheme. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 601, \u00a7 603, \u00a7 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In order to aid the states in the efficient administration of their public assistance programs, federal regulations allow states to impose conditions upon applicants and recipients, which if not satisfied, may result in the denial or termination of such aid. 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.10(a)(l)(ii)(B). In this regard <em>N.J. A.C. </em>10:81-3.39 requires AFDC recipients to take reasonable steps to attempt to secure the release of any trust funds that may be held for the benefit of a minor on whose behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>assistance is sought, so that those funds, rather than public funds, might be used for the current and future support of the child. Failure to cooperate renders the household ineligible for AFDC benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-3.39(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Initially, we reject the AFDC recipients\u2019 contention that they cannot be compelled to petition the Surrogate\u2019s Court to release their children\u2019s trust funds. Federal and state regulations have developed a specific procedure to determine whether funds are in fact available for consideration by local welfare departments. 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">[I]ncome and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Pursuant to this regulation and its implementing provision in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:81-3.39, trust funds resulting from tort settlements on behalf of children are potentially available for their support and maintenance. Unless and until an adverse ruling on a withdrawal application proves otherwise, a trust beneficiary has the \u201clegal ability\u201d to make these funds available, and therefore bears the burden to cooperate with the ECDW for release of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We recognize that there are conflicting societal interests in those circumstances where judgment proceeds received by reason of the injury of a child could conceivably render an entire family ineligible for aid. <em>See </em>45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F). That was not done in the present cases, and the question is not before us. We note, however, that 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F) has a \u201cforgiveness clause\u201d whereby the State may shorten the period of ineligibility when \u201cthe lump sum income or a portion thereof becomes unavailable to the family for a reason beyond the control of the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In any event, it is incumbent upon AFDC recipients to petition the Surrogate so that a determination can be made as to whether funds are in fact \u201cunavailable.\u201d The acceptance of AFDC benefits imposes certain obligations upon recipients, including compliance with State regulations intended to assist in making eligibility determinations. <em>Fitzpatrick v. Illinois Department of Public Aid, </em>52 Ill.2d 218, 287 N.E.2d 666, 669 (1972); <em>see also Wyman v. James, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>309, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>381, 27 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>408 (1971) and <em>Reed v. Slaughter, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>480, 482, 541 A.2d 1352 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">As to whether these personal injury trust funds may be considered in determining a minor\u2019s current and future financial eligibility for the AFDC program, appellants urge that the Director should have been controlled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a), as amended in 1985, which provides in relevant part as to <em>repayments </em>of past assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">Whenever any parent or relative with whom a child is living applies for or is receiving assistance for such child ... and it appears that there is pending entitlement to a payment to the child or to either or both his parents of funds arising from a claim or interest legally or equitably owned by such child or by either or both his parents, <em>other than that portion of a personal injury award which a court specifically awards to a child to make him whole as a result of an injury, </em>the county welfare agency may, as a condition of eligibility or continuation of eligibility for such assistance, require such parent or parents, or relative, to execute a written promise to repay, from the funds anticipated, the amount of assistance to be granted from the date of entitlement to such payment. Upon any refusal to make repayment, including refusal by any person acting for or on behalf of such parent or parents, or relative, in accordance with such promise, the county welfare agency may take all necessary and proper action under the laws of this State to enforce such promise, and the granting or continuing of assistance, as the case may be, shall be deemed due consideration therefor. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The statement to the amending bill reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">The purpose of this bill is to see that personal injury awards to infants are properly distributed to the infant in situations where the recovery is to make the child whole. For example, if a child loses a leg, or the impairment of another part of his body, the child will be burdened throughout his life with such a problem and having more difficult times competing for the educational and occupational benefits which might get him off welfare. The child\u2019s injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>should not be considered a fortuitous event which generates a reimbursement to the government of money paid to welfare recipients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Introductory Statement, Assembly No. <em>1612\u2014L. </em>1985, <em>c. </em>120.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The policy plainly expressed in this statute leaves no question that a local welfare department is precluded from using a child\u2019s trust funds to the extent generated \u201cto make him whole as a result of an injury\u201d in order to recoup past AFDC payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">We agree that there is much, both in logic and equity, to commend a legislative and executive policy which also insulates a minor\u2019s personal injury trust funds<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from current and future use for the minor\u2019s support, just as repayment of past AFDC support is now insulated. Indeed, we would prefer that such a policy choice had been made. However, neither <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) nor <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:81-3.39 presently permits this construction, and we are not at liberty to expand upon their plain language. The 1985 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) appropriately modified earlier <em>repayment </em>policy. It left standing existing <em>financial eligibility </em>requirements such as contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-1, 10-2, and 10-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Moreover, the Director\u2019s interpretation is consistent with federal law. The New Jersey Division of Economic Assistance validly points out that half of the AFDC funding comes from Federal sources, and that the Commissioner of Human Services is under a legislative mandate to do everything necessary to secure maximum Federal financial participation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-3. The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services may withhold federal funding if the HHS statutes and regulations are not followed by a state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 601, 603, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>604; 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 233.20(b); <em>see State of N.J. v. Department of Health and Human Serv., </em>670 A. 2d 1262 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">It is clear that the Director\u2019s rulings have merely enforced the authorities under which the Division of Economic Assistance is empowered to act, as previously upheld by state and federal judicial interpretation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Among the relevant federal cases, <em>see Lukhard v. Reed, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>368, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1807, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 328 (1987) (broadly interpreting personal injury awards as income for AFDC eligibility purposes; emphasizing the requirement of state compliance with federal statutes and regulations; and holding that a \u201cmake-whole\u201d personal injury award is not a replacement of a \u201cresource\u201d for AFDC purposes); <em>Philadelphia Citizens in Action v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 877 (3d Cir.1982) (emphasizing that AFDC is a program of last resort, requiring exhaustion of the recipient\u2019s assets); <em>LaMadrid v. Hegstrom, </em>830 F.2d 1524 (9th Cir.1987) (state law cannot exempt personal injury awards from consideration as income for purpose of AFDC eligibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Our Supreme Court wrestled with the profound constitutional and human implications involved in county welfare board consideration of a minor\u2019s personal injury judgment for AFDC eligibility purposes in <em>In re Estate of Jackson, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>517, 401 A.2d 517 (1979). Although its holding respecting repayment is now mooted by virtue of the 1985 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a), <em>Jackson </em>definitively establishes the limited role of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>judicial review in this area, where the difficult social policy lines have been drawn by the legislative and executive branches of government. <em>See also Francis, et al. v. Harris, et al., </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 241 A.2d 844 (Law Div.) <em>aff'd o.b., </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 247 A.2d 492 (App.Div.1968), <em>certif. denied, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>227, 249 <em>A.</em>2d 601 (1969). <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Francis </em>point up the limited purpose and effect of the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We recognize that there is a superficial appearance of violation of the non-repayment provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-4(a) caused by the Essex County Surrogate\u2019s administrative policy of permitting only one application for withdrawal per year. Without question, the ECDW\u2019s actions in these cases were taken only with respect to current and prospective monthly payments. It has agreed not to withhold those current and prospective payments to AFDC recipients pending completion of the annual application and withdrawal process. This is in the best interests of benefit recipients. It would be counterproductive to <em>require </em>that the Board withhold such current and prospective payments (as it can do) merely to avoid the technical appearance of a prohibited repayment. Accordingly, we approve this approach so long as it is limited only to annual recovery of AFDC funds which were paid out in reliance upon the type of arrangement herein sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Finally, we observe that the Director\u2019s rulings are consistent with New Jersey trust laws, which permit the invasion of both corpus and income of a minor\u2019s trust for his necessary support and maintenance, <em>see, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-43, and even for support and maintenance of needy members of his household. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-46. <em>See also Matter of Conda, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>163, 516 A.2d 240 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The decisions of the Director are affirmed. Where a personal injury judgment is anticipated or secured on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>a minor AFDC beneficiary, and held in trust by the Surrogate, ECDW may properly condition eligibility for current or future monthly AFDC payments for that child upon making application to the Surrogate for withdrawal from the trust fund of an amount equal to such payments. As the Surrogate does not disburse trust funds except upon petition to the Superior Court, <em>see R. </em>4:48A(c), consideration of each such petition will require exploration of the extent to which funds were specifically earmarked for medical or rehabilitative expenses. <em>See </em>45 <em>C.F.R. </em>233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F). In the future, at least where there is any likelihood that a similar AFDC repayment issue will arise, judgments entered in infant\u2019s personal injury matters under <em>R. </em>4:44-3 and <em>R. </em>4:48A(a) should contain allocations consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">If the prior tort judgment has made no allocation, the judge considering a disbursement petition may make such allocation, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>supported by medical and other evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\"> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>3B:15-16, 17 and <em>R. </em>4:48A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Although these matters have not been consolidated, they will be addressed in a single opinion due to their factual and legal similarities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-15\"> O.J., H.S., S.O., L.C., M.S. and S.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-16\">J.R. and M.B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">No request for reimbursement of past AFDC awards was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">In the present cases, the Director approved the withholding of cash AFDC payments only to the extent earmarked for the trust-benefitted children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\">To the extent specifically awarded to make a child whole, <em>e.g., </em>to compensate for loss of sensory faculties, limbs, brain function, and similar permanent and non-replaceable losses, as well as for medical expenses, rehabilitation, funeral costs and the like.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">We note that the Secretary has not been made a party hereto. <em>See Bergen Pines Hosp. v.
