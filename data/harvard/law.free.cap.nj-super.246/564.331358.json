The principal issue is whether a complaint alleging that the insured committed the torts of outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress resulting in mental anguish to the claimant creates a duty to defend under the comprehensive general liability coverage of a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. An ancillary question is how the insurer\u2019s duty to defend can best be enforced where an action against the insured includes covered and non-covered claims. We hold that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as used in the policy, encompasses the mental and psychological sequelae resulting from the torts of outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress and therefore the insurer had the duty to defend. We also conclude that because the expenses incurred by the insured cannot fairly be apportioned between covered and non-covered claims, the insurer alone should bear the reasonable costs of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">In December 1985, Linda Sisto, a teacher in the Kenilworth public schools, filed a complaint in the Law Division, naming as defendants the superintendent, the principal, the board of education, two local newspapers, plaintiff Eileen Voorhees and another parent of a student. The complaint alleged that Sisto had been suspended from her teaching duties and directed to undergo psychiatric examinations as a result of the claims of several parents concerning her alleged lack of fitness. Sisto claimed that the school officials had acted unfairly and that she had been defamed by reports of the episode in the newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The fourth count of the complaint was directed against Voorhees and the other parent. Because the complaint was inartfully drafted, it is difficult to characterize accurately the specific claims made against the two defendants. The issue is an important one and we therefore quote liberally from the fourth count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">At various times and on various dates relevant to this complaint, defendants Constance Scuderi and Eileen Voorhees made false and erroneous statements about the competency and fitness of the plaintiff, such statements serving to place plaintiff before the public in a false light, further serving to interfere with her rights of privacy and to inflict upon her severe humiliation, embarrassment, emotional distress and mental anguish. The statements as well as conduct of these defendants respecting the plaintiff herein were made and carried out <em>wilfully, deliberately, recklessly and </em>negligently. Moreover, these defendants knew or should have known that their statements about plaintiff were false and would probably, as occurred, place plaintiff before the public in a false light, interfere with her rights of privacy, cause her severe humiliation, embarrassment, emotional distress and mental anguish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, plaintiff was damaged in her reputation as a professional teacher and has been unable and remains unable to function in her customary teaching assignment. Moreover, she has been placed before the public in a false light,, has had her rights of privacy interfered with and has suffered and continues to suffer embarrassment, humiliation, emotional distress and mental anguish. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Upon receipt of the complaint, Voorhees notified defendant Preferred Mutual Insurance Co. (Preferred) of the pendency of the suit and requested it to defend the action in accordance with its obligation under her homeowner\u2019s policy. In an exchange of correspondence, defendant declined Voorhees\u2019 demand. Initially, defendant asserted that Sisto\u2019s complaint sounded in defamation and that the damage to her reputation claimed did not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the policy. In a subsequent letter, defendant added that Sisto\u2019s claim fell within the policy\u2019s exclusion for intentional acts. Voorhees retained an attorney and ultimately settled the Sisto claim for the sum of $750. However, extensive discovery proceedings had occurred prior to the settlement. In the course of these proceedings, Voorhees\u2019 attorney had received a report from Sisto\u2019s psychiatrist, indicating that Sisto had experienced various physical symptoms as the result of the emotional distress allegedly caused by Voo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rhees\u2019 conduct, including headaches, nausea and stomach and body pains. According to the psychiatrist, these physical effects were consistent with Sisto\u2019s subjective complaints and were not idiosyncratic.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Following the settlement of Sisto\u2019s suit, Voorhees instituted this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Preferred was responsible for reimbursement of all defense costs, approximately $14,000. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. The Law Division judge rendered an oral opinion, finding that although Sisto\u2019s claim did not fall within the policy exclusion for intentional acts, the complaint alleged defamation, a cause of action not covered under the insuring agreement. The judge granted summary judgment in Preferred\u2019s favor and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> We commence our analysis with the well-settled principle that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend an action against the insured is measured by the allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Flanagin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>504, 512, 210 A.2d 221 (1965); <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1953), certif. granted 14 <em>N.J. </em>465, 102 A.2d 693 (1954), aff\u2019d 15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954); 8 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>(Berdal ed. 1979), \u00a7 4683 at 42. The duty to defend arises when the complaint states a claim constituting a risk falling within the purview of the policy language. <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77, 100 A.2d 198. If the pleadings state facts bringing the injury within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend regardless of the insured\u2019s ultimate liability to the complainant. 8 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 4683 at 42. The nature of the damage claim, rather than the actual details of the accident or the ultimate liability of the insured, determines whether the insurer is obliged to defend. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Flanagin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 512, 210 A.2d 221; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Hackensack Water Co. v. General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 482-483, 202 A.2d 706 (App.Div.1964); <em>Van Der Veen v. Bankers Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 217, 103 A.2d 900 (App.Div.1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Applying these principles, we first look to the policy language. The standard form policy provides that Preferred will pay all sums recovered against the insured \u201cbecause of bodily injury ... caused by an occurrence.\u201d The word \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201can accident.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d means \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease____\u201d The duty to defend clause is broader than the indemnification provision in that it does not require the \u201cbodily injury\u201d be caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d However, both clauses are subject to a policy exclusion which excepts from coverage \u201cliability ... caused intentionally by or at the direction of any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We next consider the allegations contained in Sisto\u2019s complaint. As we pointed out previously, the complaint was inartfully drafted and ambiguously phrased. The Law Division judge concluded that the fourth count alleged a cause of action for defamation. In the case of a complaint charging defamation, the plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to identify the defamatory words, their utterer and the fact of their publication. <em>Zoneraich v. Overlook Hosp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 101, 514 A.2d 53 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 107 <em>N.J. </em>32, 526 A.2d 126 (1986). A vague conclusory allegation is not enough. <em>Ibid.; see also Kotok Building v. Charvine Co., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>101, 105, 443 <em>A.2d </em>260 (Law Div.1981). Sisto\u2019s complaint does not satisfy that requirement. Of course, we have no occasion to consider the merits of Sisto\u2019s claim. Rather, our purpose is to determine whether Preferred had a duty to defend by comparing the allegations of Sisto\u2019s complaint with the coverage provisions of Voorhees\u2019 policy. We point to the defects in Sisto\u2019s pleadings to emphasize the uncertainty respecting whether it was her intention to allege defamation or some other cause of action or multiple claims. Construing the fourth count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>liberally, we conclude that the Law Division judge erred by finding only defamation alleged. In our view, the allegations set forth in the fourth count can just as well be interpreted as pleading the torts of invasion of privacy, negligent infliction of emotional distress and outrage. We must thus consider whether any or all of these causes of actions fall within the coverage of Voorhees\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In a trilogy of decisions, we have addressed the question whether emotional distress qualifies as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under an insuring agreement. We first considered the issue in <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 517 A.2d 1211 (App.Div.1986). There, the complaint in the underlying action alleged acts of sexual harassment consisting of non-consensual touching resulting in the complainant\u2019s emotional distress and mental anguish. Noting the lengthening line of cases which has recognized that emotional distress is just as real as physical pain and its valuation no more difficult, <em>see Strachan v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hosp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>523, 538 A.2d 346 (1988); <em>Saunderlin v. E.I. Dupont Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>402, 508 A.2d 1095 (1986); <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A.2d 521 (1980); <em>Berman v. Allan, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>421, 404 A.2d 8 (1979); <em>Zahorian v. Russell Fitt Real Estate Agency, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>399, 301 A.2d 754 (1973); <em>Falzone v. Busch, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>559, 214 A.2d 12 (1965); <em>Pushko v. Board of Trustees of Teachers\u2019 P. &amp; A. Fund, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 493 A.2d 1309 (App.Div.1985), on remand 208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 505 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1986); <em>Eyrich for Eyrich v. Dam, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 473 A.2d 539 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 97 <em>N.J. </em>583, 483 A.2d 127 (1984); <em>Muniz v. United Hosps. Med. Ctr. Pres. Hosp., </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 379 A.2d 57 (App.Div.1977); <em>Lemaldi v. De Tomaso of America, Inc., </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 383 A.2d 1220 (Law Div. 1978), we found it highly unrealistic to \u201cseparate a person\u2019s nerves and tensions from his body\u201d in determining whether a particular injury falls within the coverage of an insuring agreement. <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 553, 517 A.2d 1211. We observed that \u201cemotion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>al trauma can be as disabling to the body as a visible physical wound ... [and] can and often does have a direct effect on other bodily functions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We thus held that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d included \u201cclaims for emotional distress caused by an assault and battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 517 A.2d 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Our decision in <em>NPS </em>was followed by <em>Lumbermen\u2019s v. United Serv. Auto,, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 528 A.2d 64 (App.Div.1987), where the insured was sued for defamation. One of the claims made by the complainant in the underlying suit was that the insured\u2019s defamatory statements had caused him \u201cembarrassment, humiliation, anguish and distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 528 A.2d 64. Based upon that allegation, the insured forwarded the complaint to his insurer which subsequently disclaimed coverage. We held that \u201c[a] cause of action for defamation does not, without more, allege physical or emotional injury to the person defamed within the meaning of the standard homeowner\u2019s policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 528 A.2d 64. In reaching this result, we reasoned that defamation is an impairment of a \u201crelational\u201d interest in that it denigrates the opinion which others in the community have of the person defamed, and it invades his interest in his reputation and good name. <em>Id. </em>at 498, 528 A.2d 64, <em>citing Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts </em>(5th ed. 1984), \u00a7 111 at 771. We said that \u201c[u]nlike a claim for physical or mental injury, defamation \u2018is not concerned with the plaintiff\u2019s own humiliation, wrath or sorrow, except as an element of \u2018parasitic\u2019 damages attached to an independent cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lumbermen\u2019s, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498, 528 A.2d 64; <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 111 at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We last revisited this subject in <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 540 A.2d 871 (App.Div.1988), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>654, 546 A.2d 562 (1988). There, the decedent died from carbon monoxide poisoning while she sat in a car owned by the insured. The decedent\u2019s father pulled her from the automobile, contacted the local first aid squad and watched helplessly while rescue attempts failed. Members of the decedent\u2019s family, including her father, filed claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>insured for wrongful death, survivorship and emotional distress. The insurer disclaimed liability respecting the father\u2019s claim for emotional distress. We rejected the insurer\u2019s argument that the emotional distress allegedly suffered by the decedent\u2019s father did not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d covered by the policy. <em>Id. </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352, 540 A.2d 871. Viewing the policy language from the perspective of the average insurance purchaser\u2019s reasonable expectations, <em>see Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527 (1970); <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 170 A.2d 800 (1961); <em>Ellmex Const. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 204-205, 494 A.2d 339 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 103 <em>N.J. </em>453, 511 A.2d 639 (1986); <em>Great American Ins. v. Lerman Motors, Inc., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 326, 491 A.2d 729 (App.Div.1984), we held that the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the insuring agreement included claims for emotional distress. <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353, 540 A.2d 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Synthesizing these decisions, the lesson to be learned is that mental anguish qualifies as \u201cbodily injury\u201d at least to the extent that the emotional distress alleged does not constitute \u201cparasitic\u201d damages attached to an independent cause of action. <em>See Lumbermen\u2019s v. United Serv. Auto., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498, 528 A.2d 64. Where the emotional distress is the product of the impairment of a \u201crelational interest,\u201d however, it is arguable that the damages are \u201cparasitic\u201d and do not trigger the duty to defend or indemnify the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 498-499, 528 A.2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Within that analytical framework, it is clear that mental anguish resulting from the torts of outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress constitutes a risk insured against under Voorhees\u2019 policy. Our courts have long recognized the tort of outrage as a separate cause of action. <em>See, e.g., 49 Prospect Street v. Sheva Gardens, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 471, 547 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988); <em>Hume v. Bayer, </em>178 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>per. </em>310, 316-318, 428 A.2d 966 (Law Div.1981); <em>Hafner v. Hafner, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 333-334, 343 A.2d 166 (Law Div. 1975). The outlines of the cause of action are to be found in the <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 46 at 71 (1965), which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">\u00a7 46. Outrageous Conduct Causing Severe Emotional Distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\"><em>(1) One </em>who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the- other results from it, for such bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As explained in Comment b of the <em>Restatement:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">As indicated in Chapter 47, emotional distress may be an element of damages in many cases where other interests have been invaded, and tort liability has arisen apart from the emotional distress. Because of the fear of fictitious or trivial claims, distrust of the proof offered, and the difficulty of setting up any satisfactory boundaries to liability, the law has been slow to afford independent protection to the interest in freedom from emotional distress standing alone. It is only within recent years that the rule stated in this Section has been fully recognized as a separate and distinct basis of tort liability, without the presence of the elements necessary to any other tort, such as assault, battery, false imprisonment, trespass to land or the like. This Section may be regarded as an extension of the principle involved in the rules stated in \u00a7\u00a7 21-34 as to the tort of assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Additional support for the recognition of the tort of outrage as a separate cause of action is found in Dean Prosser\u2019s treatise on torts. <em>Prosser, Law of Torts </em>(3rd ed. 1964), \u00a7 11 at 41. While it is difficult to generalize as to what type of conduct is actionable, the eases cited by Prosser and our decisions disclose the elements that must be proved. They are (1) that the actor intended to inflict emotional distress on the plaintiff or acted in reckless disregard of a high degree of probability that severe emotional distress will follow, (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous, (3) that the actions of defendant were the cause of plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress, and (4) that the emotional distress that was sustained by plaintiff was severe and not idiosyncratic. <em>See, e.g., 49 Prospect Street v. Sheva Gardens, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474, 547 A.2d 1134. Reading Sisto\u2019s complaint liberally, we are convinced that the tort of outrage was alleged and that the mental anguish she claimed to suffer qualified as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under Voorhees\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>In a similar vein, negligent infliction of emotional distress has long been considered an independent cause of action in New Jersey. <em>See, e.g., Strachen v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hosp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 533-538, 538 A.2d 346; <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 90, 417 A.2d 521; <em>Falzone v. Busch, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 561, 214 A.2d 12. Although our decisions pertaining to the subject have been aptly characterized as a \u201crather confusing patchwork,\u201d emotional distress has been \u201crecognized as a source of recovery subject to rather rigid, formalistic requirements which evolved as a result of the traditional view of such claims as untrustworthy, subject to serious proof problems and bearing the potential for unjust application.\u201d <em>Strachan v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hosp., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 333-334, 507 A.2d 718 (App.Div.1986) (Long, J., dissenting), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part 109 <em>N.J. </em>523, 538 A.2d 346 (1988). As we noted earlier, we need not determine whether Sisto\u2019s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress had any merit. We merely emphasize that Sisto\u2019s complaint alleged that tort, albeit in an oblique and ambiguous manner, and therefore Preferred was contractually obliged to defend Voorhees against the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">To recapitulate, our decisions have recognized that emotional distress, either negligently inflicted or resulting from outrageous conduct, constitutes direct and not parasitic damages. While perhaps mental anguish resulting from impairment of a \u201crelational interest\u201d falls beyond the insurer\u2019s coverage obligation, a point we need not decide, Sisto\u2019s claims of outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress qualified as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under Voorhees\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We next consider Preferred\u2019s argument that Voorhees\u2019 conduct was deliberate and fell within the policy\u2019s exclusion for \u201cintentional acts.\u201d We must review Preferred\u2019s contention in light of Sisto\u2019s allegation in her complaint that Voorhees acted \u201cwillfully, deliberately, recklessly and negligently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>We have alluded previously to the principle that in deciding whether a duty to defend exists, \u201cthe complaint should be laid alongside the policy and a determination made as to whether, if the allegations are sustained, the insurer will be required to pay the resulting judgment____\u201d <em>Danek v. Hammer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77, 100 A.2d 198. This general principle is subject to several exceptions, however. When coverage, <em>i.e., </em>the duty to pay, depends upon a factual issue which may not be resolved by the trial of the third party\u2019s suit against the insured, the duty to defend may depend upon the actual facts and not upon the allegations in the complaint. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 388, 267 A.2d 7 (1970). So too, \u201c[wjhenever the [insurer\u2019s] position so diverges from the insured\u2019s that the carrier cannot defend the action with complete fidelity to the insured, there must be a proceeding in which the carrier and the insured, represented by counsel of their own choice, may fight out their differences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 267 <em>A.2d </em>7; <em>see also Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 24-25, 483 A 2d 402 (1984); <em>Heldor Inds. v. Atlantic Mut. Ins., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 399, 551 <em>A.2d </em>1001 (App.Div.1988); <em>Lyons v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 247, 310 A.2d 485 (App.Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>322, 315 A.2d 411 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Preferred asserts that these exceptions apply in this case. If Voorhees acted intentionally, the policy exclusion would apply. If she acted either negligently or recklessly, the exclusion for \u201cintentional acts\u201d would not bar coverage. It is argued that the interests of Preferred and Voorhees do not coincide. If Sisto\u2019s suit had gone to trial, obviously both the insurer and the insured would want her to fail. Yet, if Sisto were to succeed, Preferred would want the basis to be Voorhees\u2019 intentional conduct, since intentional acts are excluded under the policy. Preferred could not be expected to resist that basis of liability with the fervor or fidelity expected of an advocate selected by the insured. <em>See Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 389-390, 267 A.2d 7. It is argued that any attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>retained by Preferred to defend Voorhees against Sisto\u2019s claim and at the same time to protect Preferred against the coverage claim of Voorhees would be placed in the position of conflict which our courts have said must be avoided. <em>See Hartford Ace. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 24-25, 483 A.2d 402; <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 391, 267 A.2d 7; <em>Heldor Inds. v. Atlantic Mut. Ins., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399, 551 A.2d 1001; <em>Lyons v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 247, 310 A.2d 485. The discharge of the attorney\u2019s obligation to Preferred might well require presentation of evidence incompatible with the effective defense of Voorhees or delete its force with the jury. Since the interests of the insurer and the insured were not coextensive, Preferred argues that it was not only within its rights in refusing to defend Voorhees but was in fact ethically obliged to follow that course once it denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We disagree. Even assuming that there was a conflict of interest, the result would not be to free Preferred from its covenant to defend, but rather to translate its obligation into one to reimburse the insured if it later developed that the claim was one within the policy covenant to pay. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 390, 267 A.2d 7. The obligation of a carrier faced with a conflict of interest will be dealt with later in our opinion. Suffice it to say here, Preferred, confronted with a real or potential conflict, could not, consistent with its fiduciary obligation, and without any further investigation, <em>see Griggs v. Bertram, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>347, 357, 443 A.2d 163 (1982), or arrangement with Voorhees, simply decline liability, leaving its insured to fend for herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We do not read <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 394, 267 A.2d 7, as requiring a hearing to determine whether Voorhees\u2019 acts were intentional or only reckless or negligent. Our Supreme Court in <em>Burd </em>said that in the event the insurer declines to defend its insured because of a perceived conflict and a judgment is entered, \u201cthe carrier may be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>upon the coverage issue in a proceeding upon the policy\u201d and it \u201cwill have to reimburse the insured for the cost of the defense if the tort judgment is held to be within the covenant to pay.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We need not delve into the-question concerning what type of hearing was contemplated by the Court. Here, the Sisto suit was settled and no judgment was entered against the insured. Based on the small amount of the settlement, Voorhees can fairly argue that Sisto\u2019s claims, which encompassed both intentional and reckless or negligent conduct, were \u201cwholly defeated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 267 A.2d 7. In that situation the insurer \u201cmay fairly be required to reimburse the insured for the cost of the successful defense even though the [insurer] would not have had to pay the judgment if the case had gone against the insured on a finding of intentional injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 267 A2d 7. In any event, Preferred does not seek a hearing for a factual determination whether Voorhees\u2019 conduct was intentional. Instead, it requests a remand so that the defense costs can be apportioned between covered and non-eovered claims. We now consider Preferred\u2019s argument that a remand is necessary for proper allocation of the defense costs incurred by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Preferred argues that it should not be responsible for reimbursing Voorhees for the expenses she incurred in defending against non-eovered claims, <em>i.e., </em>defamation, invasion of privacy and outrage by intentional rather than reckless conduct. Citing <em>Dunne v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>244, 353 A.2d 508 (1976), Voorhees contends that where the complaint in the underlying action alleges both covered and non-covered claims, the insurer\u2019s duty to provide a defense extends to all of the complainant\u2019s causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Initially, we note that <em>Dunne </em>is inapposite. As our Supreme Court later observed in <em>Hartford Ace. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>\u201cthe policy invoked in <em>Dunne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>apparently imposed a duty upon the insurer to defend [all claims] if any theory of liability would fall within the policy coverage____\u201d 98 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 483 A.2d 402. Moreover, the insurer in <em>Dunne </em>had undertaken at the outset to defend the entire action pursuant to a reservation of rights agreement with its insured. <em>Dunne v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 353 A.2d 508. Therefore, the sole issue confronting the court in <em>Dunne </em>was how to enforce the insurer\u2019s previously acknowledged duty to provide a defense for its insured, in view of the possible conflict raised by the circumstance that the insured would not enjoy coverage if liability were imposed on some basis other than negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Our research discloses no reported New Jersey opinions directly on point. To be sure, we have found language in several opinions supportive of Preferred\u2019s position. In <em>Central Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Utica Nat\u2019l Ins. Group, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 557 A.2d 693 (App.Div.1989), for example, it is said that \u201c[t]he carrier\u2019s promise is to defeat or pay a claim within the policy coverage\u201d and that \u201c[t]he duty exists only as to counts stating a theory of recovery for which coverage is provided, but not as to counts not covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 557 A.2d 693. <em>See also City Council of Elizabeth v. Fumero, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 288-289, 362 A.2d 1279 (Law Div.1976). However, there is language in other cases suggestive of a contrary result. In <em>Mount Hope Inn v. Travelers Indemnity Company, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 384 A.2d 1159 (Law Div.1978), Judge Polow wrote that the \u201cduty [to defend] remains even though ambiguity may result based upon other language charged in other parts of the complaint or other allegations are made which do not come within the provisions of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 384 A.2d 1159. The judge went on to say that \u201c[i]f the claim is stated in two conflicting theories, one which requires coverage and the other which does not, the carrier has no choice. It must defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 384 A.2d 1159. In none of these decisions, however, was the question of apportionment raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Elsewhere, the courts have held that an insurer must bear the entire cost of defense when there is no reasonable means of prorating the expenses incurred between covered and non-covered claims. <em>See, e.g., Burlington Drug Co., Inc. v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>616 <em>F.Supp. </em>481, 485 (D.Vt.1985); <em>Crist v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>529 <em>F.Supp. 601, </em>604 (D.Utah 1982); <em>Tampa Electric Co. v. Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., </em>367 <em>F.Supp. </em>27, 31 (M.D.Fla.1973); <em>Hogan v. Midland Nat\u2019l Insurance Co., </em>3 <em>Cal.3d </em>553, 91 <em>Cal.Rptr. 153, </em>476 P.2d 825 (1970); <em>Jostens, Inc. v. CNA Ins./Continental Cas., </em>403 <em>N.W.</em>2d 625 (Minn.1987); <em>Home Insurance Co. v. Pinske Bros., Inc., </em>160 <em>Mont. </em>219, 500 P. 2d 945 (1972); <em>National Steel Construction Co. v. National Union Fire Insurance Co., </em>14 <em>Wash.App. </em>573, 543 P.2d 642 (1975). A different rule has been applied where defense costs can be readily apportioned. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. Southern Publishing Co., Inc., </em>894 P.2d 785, 791 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Budd Company v. Travelers Indemnity Company, </em>820 <em>F.</em>2d 787, 790 (6th Cir.1987); <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc., </em>633 P.2d 1212, 1224-1225 (6th Cir.1980), <em>cert. </em>den. 454 <em>U.S. </em>1109, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>686, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>650 (1981); <em>Waite v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, </em>77 <em>Wash.2d </em>850, 467 P.2d 847, 852 (1970) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Against this backdrop, we perceive no sound basis to remand for a hearing on apportionment of defense costs. Instead, we are convinced that in its pragmatic aspect any precise allocation of expenses would be impossible. It appears likely that a great deal of the defense costs was incurred in general preparation and cannot be separated by distinct claims or time periods. Moreover, requiring Preferred to bear responsibility for defense costs is consonant with the strong public policy in favor of requiring the provision of a defense where coverage is at least arguable. In this case, Preferred breached its contractual duty to defend when it refused coverage without taking any steps to investigate Sisto\u2019s claim or otherwise seek clarification. As we stressed previously, Voorhees was left to fend for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>herself. Under these circumstances, Preferred should be required to reimburse Voorhees for the full amount of the defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-6\">DEIGHAN, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-o5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">I respectfully disagree with my colleagues that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d as used in this homeowner\u2019s policy \u201cencompasses the mental and psychological sequelae resulting from the torts of outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress and therefore the insurer had a duty to defend.\u201d In my view, there was no \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d under the coverage provisions of the policy and, therefore, Preferred Mutual Insurance Company had no duty to defend. I further differ with the conclusion that \u201c[vjiewing the policy language from the perspective of the average insurance purchaser\u2019s reasonable expectations, ... the phrase \u2018bodily injury\u2019 in the insuring agreement included claims for emotional distress. <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[348, 353, 540 A.2d 871 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>654, 546 A.2d 562 (1988) ].\u201d Initially, there can be no question but that there is a \u201clengthening line of cases which has recognized that emotional distress is just as real as physical pain,\u201d as set forth in the case cited in the maj. opinion at 571, but the existence of mental anguish and emotional distress as a tort concept giving rise to liability for a wrongful act is irrelevant to the issue before us\u2014the construction of the terms and conditions of an insurance policy. It goes without saying that there must be an underlying wrongful act to establish liability but the question here is whether a wrongful act involving purely mental anguish and emotional distress is an \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d causing \u201cbodily harm\u201d within the coverage of the insurance policy in this matter. I would hold that there is no coverage under the facts and circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Under the pertinent coverage clause, defendant promised to pay all sums recovered against plaintiff \u201cbecause of <em>bodily injury ... </em>caused by an <em>occurrence </em>to which this coverage applies.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201can accident.\u201d The duty-to-defend clause provides that Preferred \u201cwill defend any suit seeking damages, provided the suit resulted from <em>bodily injury ... </em>not excluded under this coverage.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) My colleagues construe this language to mean that the \u201cduty-to-defend clause\u201d is broader than the indemnification provision in that it does not require the \u201cbodily injury\u201d to be caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d It seems to me that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to have damages without an \u201coccurrence\u201d or \u201caccident.\u201d As noted in <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Company, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 388-89, 267 A.2d 7 (1970), \u201c[t]he sense of the covenant is to defend suits involving claims which the carrier would have to pay if the claimant prevailed in the accident. <em>The covenant to defend is thus identified with the covenant to pay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) A requirement that a loss be accidental in some sense in order to qualify as the occasion for liability is implicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Nor do I concur that the doctrine of \u201creasonable expectation\u201d applies under the terms of the policy of insurance at issue. Our courts have endorsed the principle of \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of the insured to render a \u201cfair interpretation\u201d of the boundaries of insurance coverage. <em>DiOrio v. New Jersey Manufacturers Ins. Co., </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>257, 269, 398 A.2d 1274 (1979). Under the doctrine, the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations are brought to bear on misleading terms and conditions of insurance contracts and genuine ambiguities are resolved against the insurer. <em>Id. </em>In applying this principle, an objectively reasonable interpretation of the average policyholder is accepted so far as the language of the insurance contract will permit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The rule of liberal construction cannot however operate to authorize the perversion of the language and the intention of the contracting parties for the purpose of creating an ambi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>guity where none exists. 13 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 7486, at 622 (1976). The power to bind an insurer must be found in the written contract of insurance and the parties will be bound by the plain language of the contract. <em>Id. </em>The court cannot rewrite the contract for the parties, nor is it empowered, even under the guise of good faith and peculiar circumstances, to alter the terms of an otherwise unambiguous contract. <em>Id. </em>at 622-23. If plainly expressed, insurers are entitled to have liability limitations construed and enforced as expressed. <em>Id. </em>at 623. <em>See Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co. of New Jersey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990); <em>see also Sinopoli v. North River Ins.

Further, the term \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d in an insurance policy does not include \u201cfalse and erroneous <em>statements,\u201d </em>which interfere with \u201crights of privacy, severe humiliation, embarrassment, emotional distress and mental anguish,\u201d which damages \u201creputation as a professional teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">To begin with, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is to be given its ordinary and well-understood meaning. <em>Srebnik v. State, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 351, 585 A.2d 950 (App.Div.1991). \u201cBodily\u201d is defined as \u201c[pjertaining to or concerning the body; of or belonging to the body or the physical constitution; <em>not mental but corporal.\u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>159 (5th ed. 1979)) (emphasis supplied). \u201cBodily injury\u201d \u201c[generally refers only to injury to the body or to sickness or disease contracted by the injured as a result of injury.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>159. It cannot be denied that \u201cemotional distress is just as real as physical pain.\u201d <em>See </em>cases cited <em>ante </em>at maj. op. at 571; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>also Srebnik, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349-354, 585 A.2d 950; <em>Ayers v.

Nevertheless, here we are dealing with \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cnonobjective types of damages\u201d not related to physical injuries. In this context the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in an insurance policy is broader and more comprehensive than the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>Nuzzi v. United States Casualty Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.L. </em>249, 254, 1 A.2d 890 (E. &amp; A.1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">This distinction was recognized in <em>Lumbermen\u2019s v. United Servs. Auto.

There, as here, there was no bodily contact but the tort was purely based upon defamatory statements. We held that \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d such as false arrest, libel or slander and wrongful entry or eviction, as mental injuries, are not \u201cbodily injuries\u201d covered under the insurance policy. We noted that the United Service Auto Association policy did not cover \u201cpersonal injury\u201d but the Lumbermen\u2019s policy expressly defined \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to include physical and <em>mental harm. Id. </em>at 499, 528 A.2d 64. Coverage for personal injury liability may be obtained for protection against claims stemming from libel, slander and similar offenses; personal injury is not the same as \u201cbodily injury\u201d in insurance terminology. 7A Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4501.14, at 286 (Berdal ed. 1979). \u201cPersonal injuries\u201d from nonphysical contact may be added by endorsement to an insurance policy. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s, </em>218 <em>N.J.

Thus, the <em>Restatement </em>defines bodily harm or injury as relating to the physical condition of the body but it may include mental harm, <em>id., </em>such as emotional distress, <em>id. </em>at 457, humiliation, <em>id., </em>and fear and anxiety, <em>id. </em>at 458. Thus, while bodily harm pertains to the physical condition of the body, it may include related mental harms or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of N.A., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 517 A.2d 1211 (App.Div.1986), and <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Ins.

The case involved sexual harassment <em>based upon an assault and battery </em>in touching the insured\u2019s employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ee. This distinction was noted in <em>Lumbermen\u2019s v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 500, 528 A.2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Wolfe v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 540 A.2d 871, is unpersuasive. There, the insured\u2019s estate sued for emotional distress negligently caused when a family watched another family member die from carbon monoxide poisoning after being pulled from the insured\u2019s car. Applying the \u201creasonable expectations doctrine,\u201d the court, relying upon <em>NPS Corp., </em>found there was coverage under the \u201cbodily injury\u201d term in the insurance policy. <em>Id. </em>at 352-53, 540 A.2d 871. Curiously, the court ignored <em>Lumbermen\u2019s </em>as well as <em>Nuzzi v. United States Casualty Co., </em>which recognized that \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d in an insurance concept are broader and more comprehensive than \u201cbodily injuries.\u201d 121 <em>N.J.L. </em>254, 1 A.2d 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Furthermore, <em>Wolfe </em>relied on <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A. 2d 521 (1980), which recognized an independent cause of action for mental anguish and emotional distress by a mother in witnessing the serious injury and death to her seven-year-old son, even though she had not been subject to any risk of physical harm. The Court required the following elements to establish this type of mental and emotional harm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">The cause of action we approve today for the negligent infliction of emotional distress requires proof of the following elements: (1) the death or serious physical injury of another caused by defendant\u2019s negligence; (2) a marital or intimate, familial relationship between plaintiff and the injured person; (3) observation of the death or injury at the scene of the accident; and (4) resulting severe emotional distress. We find that a defendant\u2019s duty of reasonable care to avoid physical harm to others extends to the avoidance of this type of mental and emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 101, 417 A. 2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The Court determined that observance of \u201ceither death or this type of serious injury is necessary to permit recovery\u201d and that these elements would eliminate \u201cmere conjecture and speculation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 96, 417 A.2d 521, and establish \u201cgenuine suffering that flows from such harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 417 A.2d 521. These elements are not present here. <em>See Advisory Com \u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Diamond Shamrock, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 578 A.2d 1248 (App. Div.1990), which held that toxic chemicals without physical injuries could not support a claim for emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The observance of death or serious injury to establish \u201cgenuine suffering\u201d undoubtedly is part of the reason why there is a distinction in insurance policies between \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d and \u201cbodily injuries.\u201d In the absence of an <em>indicia </em>of genuineness provided by resulting bodily harm, such emotional disturbance may be too easily feigned, depending, as it must, very largely upon subjective testimony of the claimant. As noted above, coverage for these types of emotional disturbances may be procured by an endorsement for an additional premium to cover the additional risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I, therefore, would hold that the subjective claims of emotional distress, interference with the rights of privacy, humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish, inflicted by statements alone do not come within the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Furthermore, in my view, false and erroneous verbal <em>statements </em>concerning the competence and fitness of a claimant do not constitute an \u201caccident.\u201d \u201cIn its most commonly accepted meaning, or in its ordinary or popular sense, [accident] may be defined as meaning: a fortuitous circumstance, event or happening; an event happening without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens ... something unforeseen, unexpected, unusual, extraordinary or phenomenal, taking place not according to the usual course of things or events, out of the range of ordinary calculations.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>14. <em>See John\u2019s Cocktail Lounge, Inc. v. North River Ins. Co., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 541-42, 563 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In workmen\u2019s compensation, it is usually defined as an \u201cunlooked-for mishap or untoward event which is not expected or designed.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Dudley v. Victor Lynn Lines, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>479, 490, 161 A.2d 479 (1960). Under a general comprehensive liability policy, \u201cit is an unforeseen occurrence, <em>i.e., </em>an \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malanga v. Manufacturers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>220, 227, 146 A.2d 105 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\u201cAs used in insurance policies [an accident] is simply an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event, usually of an afflictive or unfortunate character, and often accompanied by a manifestation of force, but it does not mean the natural and ordinary consequences of a negligent act.\u201d 7A Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4492, at 17 (Berdal ed. 1979). In general, courts are inclined to give the term \u201caccident\u201d the meaning of common, ordinary and popular sense. <em>Id. </em>at 16. <em>See John\u2019s Cocktail Lounge v. North River Ins. Co., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 563 A.2d 473 (termination of a barmaid\u2019s employment not an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of a comprehensive general liability insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In my view, false or erroneous <em>statements </em>concerning the competency or fitness of a claimant or placing the claimant before the public in a false light and causing mental anguish and emotional distress is not an accident under the terms of a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
