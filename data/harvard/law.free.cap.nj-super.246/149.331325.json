The motion had been made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, commonly referred to as \u201cChapter 91\u201d <em>(L. </em>1979, c. 91, \u00a7 1), which provides that \u201c[n]o appeal shall be heard\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tax assessor\u2019s valuation with respect to income-producing property where the owner fails to respond to a request by the assessor for income and expense data within 45 days of such request. The issue raised by this appeal is whether, when the taxpayer concedes that it did not comply with the assessor\u2019s request and there is no question as to the reasonableness of the assessor\u2019s valuation, a judgment should be entered affirming the assessment or whether the judgment should dismiss the appeal. The distinction is significant since a judgment affirming the assessment may trigger application of the Freeze Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8, which provides that when a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d has been entered by the Tax Court, it is conclusive for the assessment year and for the two successive years, except as to changes in value of the property occurring after the assessment date. We agree with Bordentown that a dismissal of Southgate\u2019s appeal should have been entered. We therefore reverse and remand for the entry of a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Southgate owns an income-producing multi-family complex in Bordentown. In August 1987, Bordentown\u2019s tax assessor requested Southgate to provide \u201cincome and expense data\u201d for the tax year ending December 31, 1986 relating to the property for the purpose of making an assessment for the 1988 tax year. Southgate did not respond to the request. Based on the data available to the assessor, the property was valued at $4,378,000 for the tax year 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Southgate filed a direct appeal in the Tax Court, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21, challenging the 1988 assessment, claiming that it exceeded the property\u2019s true value, that it was in excess of the common level of assessments in the district and of the \u201cChapter 123\u201d common level range and that it was discriminatory. Bordentown moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. Accompanying Bordentown\u2019s motion was a form of order granting Bordentown dismissal of Southgate\u2019s appeal with prejudice and its assessor\u2019s affidavit stating that South-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>gate had failed to respond to his request for the income and expense data.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In response to Bordentown\u2019s motion, Southgate claimed that it had not received the assessor\u2019s notice and further that it was entitled to a hearing regarding the reasonableness of the assessor\u2019s valuation, relying on <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1, 547 A.2d 691 (1988). In <em>Ocean Pines, </em>the Supreme Court afforded the taxpayer a narrowly circumscribed remedy, notwithstanding its noncompliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. Adopting the reasoning of the Appellate Division,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the noncomplying taxpayer \u201cmust have an available remedy in those cases in which the assessor has <em>unreasonably </em>valued the property[,]\u201d but that the remedy would be limited in its scope to the reasonableness of the value based on the assessor\u2019s available data. 112 <em>N.J. </em>at 11, 547 <em>A. </em>2d 691 (emphasis in original). The court also directed that \u201c[i]n most cases such an appeal may be disposed of ... in summary fashion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 547 <em>A.</em>2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">While Bordentown's motion was pending, Southgate received notice that the assessment on its property had been increased for the tax year 1989. In hope of avoiding an increase in its 1989 assessment, counsel for Southgate advised the Tax Court that Southgate \u201chas decided not to oppose [Bordentown\u2019s] Chapter 91 motion.\u201d He later amplified Southgate\u2019s position by noting that Southgate did not oppose the motion because it \u201cbelieves that the assessment is not unreasonable within the contemplation of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34] and the Supreme Court\u2019s Opinion in <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Point Pleasant.\u201d </em>Notwithstanding the fact that Bordentown\u2019s motion was to dismiss, Southgate asked the Tax Court to enter a judgment affirming the 1988 assessment. The Tax Court, over Bordentown\u2019s objection, acquiesced to Southgate\u2019s request in view of Southgate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>stipulation as to the reasonableness of the assessment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7q\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">Every owner of real property of the taxing district shall, on written request of the assessor, made by certified mail, render a full and true account of his name and real property and the income therefrom, in the case of income-producing property, and produce his title papers, and he may be examined on oath by the assessor, and if he shall fail or refuse to respond to the written request of the assessor within 45 days of such request, or to testify on oath when required, or shall render a false or fraudulent account, the assessor shall value his property at such amount as he may, from any information in his possession or available to him, reasonably determine to be the full and fair value thereof. <em>No appeal shall be heard from the assessor\u2019s valuation and assessment with respect to income-producing property where the owner has failed or refused to respond to such written request for information within 45 days of such request </em>or to testify on oath when required, or shall have rendered a false or fraudulent account. The county board of taxation may impose such terms and conditions for furnishing the requested information where it appears that the owner, for good cause shown, could not furnish the information within the required period of time. In making such written request for information pursuant to this section the assessor shall enclose therewith a copy of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">(Emphasis supplied). A 1979 amendment to the statute added the \u201c[n]o appeal shall be heard\u201d language because of prior ambiguities in the statute regarding what remedies were available to the municipality when the taxpayer refused to comply with the assessor\u2019s request. <em>See Delran Holding Corp. v. Delran Tp., </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>80, 82 (Tax Ct.1985). Since the amendment and at least until <em>Ocean Pines, </em>the Tax Court had consistently entered judgments of dismissal, relying on the \u201c[n]o appeal shall be heard\u201d mandate, when the taxpayer failed to comply with the statute. <em>See SKG Realty Corp. v. Township of Wall, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>209 (App.Div.1985); <em>Terrace View Gardens v. Township of Dover, </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>469 (Tax Ct.1982), <em>aff'd </em>o.b., 5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>475 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>559, 468 A.2d 205 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In our view, dismissing appeals by nonresponding owners, when reasonableness of the assessment is not in issue, best serves the statutory purpose of encouraging compliance with the statute. <em>See SKG Realty Corp. v. Township of Wall, supra, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 211 (purpose of provision \u201coutlawing appeals by non-responding owners is to encourage compliance with the accounting requirement.\u201d). Compliance assists \u201cthe assessor in the first instance, to make the assessment and thereby ... to avoid unnecessary expense, time and effort in litigation.\u201d <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 547 A.2d 691, quoting <em>Terrace View Gardens v. Township of Dover, supra, 5 N.J.Tax </em>at 471-472; <em>see also Delran Holding Corp. v. Delran Tp., supra, 8 N.J.Tax </em>at 83 (purpose of statute is to provide assessor with income data because true value of income-producing property is frequently determined by capitalization approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We do not read <em>Ocean Pines </em>as requiring entry of a \u201cjudgment of affirmance\u201d upon a municipality\u2019s successful Chapter 91 motion to dismiss. As stated, <em>Ocean Pines </em>affords the noncomplying taxpayer the right to litigate the narrow question of whether the assessor has unreasonably valued the property. The Appellate Division in <em>Ocean Pines, </em>for example, posited the hypothetical where the assessment of the property was \u201c10 times its purchase price\u201d and concluded that \u201cthere is no question that the assessor could be said to have ... unreasonably determined the full and fair value of the property.\u201d 213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, 517 A.2d 472. We reasoned that such violation of the statutory standard of reasonableness \u201cmust be judicially reviewable.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Nothing in <em>Ocean Pines </em>can be read as intending to thwart the dismissal practice under Chapter 91 when, as here, the taxpayer fails to respond to the assessor\u2019s request and the reasonableness of the assessor\u2019s valuation is <em>conceded. </em>South-gate chose not to pursue its <em>Ocean Pines </em>remedy. When it stipulated as to reasonableness of the assessment, there was no need for the <em>Ocean Pines </em>summary hearing to adjudicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>issue on the merits. There was no dispute that Southgate\u2019s property was income-producing and that it had failed to respond to the assessor\u2019s request. Thus, once the stipulation was made, \u201c[n]o appeal shall be heard\u201d from the assessor\u2019s valuation and Bordentown\u2019s right to a dismissal was absolute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We reject Southgate\u2019s argument that a judgment affirming the assessment was appropriate because Bordentown placed \u201creasonableness\u201d of the assessment in issue upon making the Chapter 91 motion. Bordentown did not raise the reasonableness issue. All it did was take advantage of the statutory remedy afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 to bar Southgate\u2019s appeal because of the taxpayer\u2019s failure to comply with the assessor\u2019s request for data. It was Southgate\u2019s right under <em>Ocean Pines </em>to raise and pursue the issue but, for tactical reasons, it chose not to do so. To enter a \u201cjudgment of affirmance\u201d on the merits upon a municipality\u2019s Chapter 91 motion, when reasonableness is conceded, would discourage the municipality from availing itself of the remedy because of possible Freeze Act implications. Affirmance may also reward the taxpayer, whose very default triggered the motion, by affording Freeze Act protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We recognize that it is unsettled whether or not a taxpayer would benefit from the Freeze Act upon entry of a judgment of affirmance. <em>See, e.g., South Plainfield Bor. v. Kentile Floors, Inc., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>483, 485, 457 <em>A.</em>2d 450 (1983) (consent judgment entered pursuant to stipulation of settlement invokes provisions of Freeze Act at the option of taxpayer). We hold only that even the potential for such protection should not be afforded where the taxpayer\u2019s noncompliance with Chapter 91 and the reasonableness of the valuation are unquestioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Reversed and remanded for the entry of a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>See Ocean Pines, Ltd. v.
