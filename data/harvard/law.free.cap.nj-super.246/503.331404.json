On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Crum &amp; Forster Personal Insurance (Crum &amp; Forster). Plaintiff Harleysville Insurance Company (Harleysville) appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">In September 1986, Eugene Friedman, a Florida resident, came to New Jersey to sell a condominium he owned. While here, he took his 1984 Mercedes to Coast Imported Car Corporation (Coast) for repair work. Coast ordinarily provided van service for customers leaving their cars for repair. The van <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>was unavailable when Friedman delivered his car, so Donald Krause, a Coast employee, drove Friedman in Friedman\u2019s car to the hospital where Friedman\u2019s daughter worked. During that journey, Krause was involved in an accident in Dover Township with an automobile driven by Sharon McIntyre. McIntyre and her husband sued Friedman, Krause and Coast. Friedman\u2019s defense was handled by Crum &amp; Forster, which had issued a personal automobile policy on the Mercedes. Crum &amp; Forster, however, disclaimed coverage as to Krause and Coast under the Friedman policy; Krause and Coast thus were represented through Harleysville, which had issued a garage policy to Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">While the McIntyres\u2019 action was pending, Harleysville filed this action seeking declaratory judgment that Crum &amp; Forster\u2019s policy provided primary insurance coverage to Krause. The two carriers jointly agreed to settle the McIntyre claims for $35,000 and further agreed between themselves that Harleysville would pay the settlement without prejudice to its claim against Crum &amp; Forster.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The dispute arises out of the \u201cshop rule exclusion\u201d incorporated in the Crum &amp; Forster policy, which excludes liability coverage for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The motion judge held that Florida law was applicable because Friedman \u201cat the time in question was a resident of Florida.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Florida law, the judge found, the policy exclusion became operative once Friedman delivered his car to Coast. On this appeal, Harleysville urges that New Jersey law should have been applied, that the policy exclusion is invalid under New Jersey law and that even under Florida law the exclusion is not available in the factual setting shown here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>6.

Co. v. Simmons\u2019 Estate, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>28, 417 A.2d 488 (1980) provides the analytic framework for our resolution of the conflict of laws issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">... [T]he law of the place of the contract ordinarily governs the choice of law because this rule will generally comport with the reasonable expectations of the parties concerning the principal situs of the insured risk during the term of the policy and will furnish needed certainty and consistency in the selection of the applicable law [citations omitted]. At the same time, this choice-of-law rule should not be given controlling or dispositive effect. It should not be applied without a full comparison of the significant relationship of each state with the parties and the transaction. That assessment should encompass an evaluation of important state contacts as well as a consideration of the state policies affected by, and governmental interest in, the outcome of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">We thus hold that, in an action involving the interpretation of an automobile liability insurance contract, the law of the place of the contract will govern the determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties under the insurance policy. This rule is to be applied unless the dominant and significant relationship of another state to the parties and the underlying issue dictates that this basic rule should yield.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 37, 417 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">In determining whether a state other than the place of the contract has some \u201cdominant and significant relationship,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Supreme Court suggested that the following general factors, drawn from <em>Restatement (Second) </em>of <em>Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7 6 (1971), be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">(1) the needs of the interstate and international system, (2) the relevant policies of the forum, (3) the relevant policies of other affected states and the relevant interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue, (4) the protection of justified expectations, (5) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, (6) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and (7) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 34, 417 A.2d 488. <em>See also Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 188, 193; <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 58, 552 A.2d 644 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The relevant policies of New Jersey <em>(Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6(2)(b)) are unmistakable and compelling. The exclusion as an additional insured of any person employed or otherwise engaged in duties in connection with an automobile business \u201cviolates the clear public policy of this State and any policy provision containing such exclusion is void.\u201d <em>American Home Assur. Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 486, 464 A.2d 1128 (App.Div.1983); <em>see also Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fd. Bd. v. Clifton, </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>5, 8-10, 283 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1971). The relevant policies of Florida <em>(Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6(2)(c)), on the other hand, are somewhat equivocal. <em>See Michalek v. Shumate, </em>524 So. 2d 426 (Fla.1988); <em>Castillo v. Bickley, </em>363 So.2d 792 (Fla.1978); <em>Grilli v. Le-Bo Properties Corp., </em>553 <em>So. </em>2d 352 (Fla.App. 2 Dist.1989). If in fact Florida law would deny coverage to Krause under the Friedman policy, that law would be \u201coffensive or repugnant to local public policy.\u201d <em>State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 41, 417 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">With respect to the relative interests of New Jersey and Florida in the determination of the issue <em>(Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6(2)(c)), the Friedman car was temporarily garaged in New Jersey, not just \u201cpassing through\u201d; the accident occurred as the car was being operated in New Jersey by a New Jersey resident; the injured parties were New Jersey residents; the Friedman policy was issued by a company with a home office in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>New Jersey; the garage to which Friedman had brought his car was also in New Jersey. In our judgment, those contacts with New Jersey are far more relevant and significant in determining the choice of law than the facts that Friedman was a Florida resident, his car was principally garaged in Florida and his insurance policy was written in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Finally, application of the clear New Jersey law rather than the equivocal Florida precedents surely advances the certainty, predictability and uniformity of result and ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6(2)(f), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Our weighing of the relevant considerations thus persuades us that New Jersey has the dominant and significant relationships to the parties and to the underlying coverage issue, thus justifying application of New Jersey rather than Florida law. Under New. Jersey law, Krause, the culpable driver, was insured under both the Harieysville and the Crum &amp; Forster policies. The \u201cother insurance\u201d provision of the Crum &amp; Forster policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">If there is other applicable liability insurance we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any insurance we provide for a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The comparable provision of the Harieysville policy provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">For any covered auto you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this endorsement is excess over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">2. When two or more policies cover on the same basis, either excess or primary, we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that the limit of o\u00far policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies covering on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Crum &amp; Forster\u2019s $500,000 coverage for the Friedman vehicle thus was primary, but only for \u201cthe proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits.\u201d However, the Harieysville policy provided only excess coverage, which cannot be included in \u201cthe total of all applicable limits\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>within the meaning of the Crum &amp; Forster policy. <em>See Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>554, 561-562, 147 A.2d 529 (1959); <em>Rutgers Cas. Ins. v. State Farm, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 207, 560 A.2d 722 (App.Div.1989); <em>Avemco Ins. Co. v. United States Fire Ins.

Co., </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 189, 395 A.2d 923 (Law Div.1978). Crum &amp; Forster is thus obligated to reimburse Harleysville in full for the settlement proceeds paid to the McIntyres.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The November 17, 1989 summary judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division, Union County for entry of judgment in favor of Harleysville consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Although the trial judge did not note that Florida was the place of the contract, that appears to be undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
