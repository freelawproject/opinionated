We discern no sound reason or justification for disturbing these findings and conclusions. <em>Leimgruber v. Claridge Assocs., Ltd., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 455-56, 375 A.2d 652 (1977); <em>Rova Farms Resorts, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 163-64, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). <em>See also R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A). Moreover, all of the issues of law raised are clearly without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The termination of L.C.\u2019s and A.V.\u2019s parental rights with respect to S.C. complied with the four prong test set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A. W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 604-10, 512 A.2d 438 (1986). First, the evidence proved clearly and convincingly that the parental relationships seriously impaired S.C.\u2019s health and development. The proofs show that L.C. is unable to meet S.C.\u2019s medical needs. Therefore, placing S.C. in L.C.\u2019s custody would place S.C.\u2019s life and health at serious risk. Moreover, S.C. has a strong and powerful psychological bond with her foster family and destroying that bond would psychologically scar S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The uncontroverted proofs show that S.C. suffers from severe asthma, a life-threatening condition that requires constant and careful monitoring to ensure her survival. Dr. Aguila, Director of Pediatric Pulmonology at the Newark Children\u2019s Hospital, labeled S.C.\u2019s asthma condition \u201cextreme.\u201d Dr. Fost, a pediatrician and allergist, agreed with Dr. Aguila\u2019s assessment of S.C.\u2019s condition, testifying that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Well, I was aware before I even spoke with Dr. Aguila that <em>[S. C.] is a severe asthmatic who can quickly go into respiratory failure </em>as evidenced by her one admission where she had been seen 24 to 48 hours prior to that difficult episode as an out-patient and treated and within 24, 48\u201448 hours developed severe respiratory distress that required a tube to be inserted down to\u2014to support her\u2014her ventilation. That to me signifies that <em>she\u2019s what we call labile, can quickly go badly.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">On such a child it is <em>absolutely critical that the child be followed with the utmost care, get all the appropriate medications, and even with that </em>she\u2014 <em>she still is a powder keg that has to be taken care of by someone who will recognize when the\u2014the asthma is of such a state that more is required. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">S.C.\u2019s serious asthmatic episodes resulted in her repeated hospitalizations, including hospitalization in the intensive care unit, four to five day admissions, intubation and other rescue procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>S.C. needs vigilant care. S.C.\u2019s complicated medical regimen is subject to change. S.C.\u2019s current medical regimen consists of a bronchial dilator called Somophyllin four times a day, anti-nebulized inflammatory medications called Ventolin and Intal every six to eight hours, an atopical steroid called Azmacort every six hours and bursts of Prednisone depending on S.C.\u2019s clinical condition. These medications must be given precisely because over-medication and under-medication have dire consequences. The side effects of over-medication include rapid heartbeat (palpitations), irregular heartbeat, vomiting, convulsions, shock and steroid withdrawal. Under-medication is the major cause of asthma mortality. To appropriately care for S.C.\u2019s asthma, the caretaker must guard against the trigger factors for asthma and adapt and deal with new trigger factors and warning signs because the physician relies heavily on the information supplied by the caretaker. Dr. Aguila testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">[T]here are a lot of therapeutic options in the management of asthma. \u2022 And it needs a good team approach between the mother or the caretaker and the doctor. We have\u2014she must learn to characterize the child to us. She must give us a profile of the child. The reason is because our\u2014a lot of our decisions will depend on that</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Everyone who testified in this case, except L.C. and Jean Guarnieri, the Director of Parents and Children Together, agreed that L.C. is incapable of independently caring for S.C. Dr. Dyer, a psychologist, conducted a psychological evaluation of L.C. and concluded that L.C.\u2019s immaturity would prevent her from being an adequate parent. He explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">Based on my administration of these techniques, it is my opinion that [L.C.] suffers from a degree of personality immaturity that would exclude her being able to provide adequate parenting to a young child in terms of consistent atunement, consistent responsibility, consistent attentiveness to a young child\u2019s needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">In fact, [L.C.] tends to see herself as being in the role of a dependent child in relation to other people and that this seems to be the way in which she maintains a positively valued self-image, by clinging to this safe position of being a dependent child in relation to the adults who represent parent figures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">L.C., who is at the upper level of the borderline retarded range, spent four years at Brisbane, a New Jersey residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>psychiatric hospital for children. Dr. Dyer noted that a Learning Disability Evaluation conducted at Brisbane indicated that L.C. had severe learning problems in the areas of auditory association, visual memory and auditory memory. In Dr. Dyer\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\"><em>[TJhese [problems] were never satisfactorily addressed </em>as far as I have been able to determine from my review of the records. That is to say that [L.C.] never had any kind of specific therapy or other treatment with a learning consultant to remediate these particular specific learning disabilities, [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Based on L.C.\u2019s test results and L.C.\u2019s records, Dr. Dyer opined that L.C. does not possess adequate parenting skills, as the following excerpts of his testimony indicate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">In my opinion [L.C.] would probably be able to perceive visual cues from the environment with a substantial degree of accuracy. But <em>in terms of interpreting the significance of those cues as they dictate various courses of action that she lacks a substantial capacity to do this.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u00a1i:******#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">It is my understanding of <em>the tasks involved in [S. C. \u2019s] medical care </em>that this child is extremely fragile and <em>requires a high degree of vigilance on the part of her caretaker to recognize the various symptoms </em>of her disorder <em>that could signal a life-threatening asthmatic attack. </em>This child\u2019s situation I understand varies in terms of the care that is required, the specific procedures that are required to address different kinds of emergencies and in order to manage such a child the <em>caretaker would have to be sensitive to these variations in her requirements to the variety of symptoms </em>that appear and would have to have an adequate understanding of the implications of each particular constellation of symptoms in terms of the particular intervention that would be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">In my opinion <em>[L.C.J would not be able to accurately report her daughter\u2019s condition to a physician </em>who has been treating her unless that physician were extremely knowledgeable about [S.C.\u2019s] particular circumstances and was able to ask very specific questions designed to elicit particular information that was related to the presence or absence of any particular physical condition and which would dictate some particular form of intervention. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Dr. Dyer reached the opinion that L.C. possesses inadequate parenting skills in part because of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">[t]he fact that [L.C.] has a <em>deficiency in retaining learned information </em>would <em>suggest </em>that she would have a great deal of <em>difficulty in implementing any kind of new medical procedures </em>that she might be shown for managing [S.C.\u2019s] care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The inability to retain material and to rely specifically on\u2014on rote memory which tends to be deficient would cause somebody <em>not to be able to adjust to slight variations in procedures, </em>and I understand that <em>such variations are required in administering the\u2014the medication that [S. C.] is on </em>according to various circumstances that present themselves with her physical symptoms. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In May 1987, Ms. Haldopoulos, Chief Senior Clinician of the Family Enrichment Program, administered a psychological evaluation of L.C. The test results indicated that L.C. suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and possibly, some paranoid disorder. Ms. Haldopoulos also noted some borderline personality features such as L.C.\u2019s inability to really develop relationships, to plan and perhaps even her housing difficulties in terms of her stability. When asked to describe her assessment of L.C.\u2019s ability to parent, Ms. Haldopoulos testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">I felt that although [L.C.] had some basic parenting knowledge, she was unable to understand the complex needs of her daughter and the impact of the placement and the extended placement of her daughter. Her inability to mobilize and get her daughter back. I don\u2019t think she understood the impact of leaving her daughter in foster care. I believe that\u2019s basically it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Like Dr. Dyer, Dr. Bruey, a psychologist, believed that L.C.\u2019s intelligence test results showed a deficit which would make it difficult for her to care for S.C. in an unsupervised setting. Dr. Bruey testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">If [L.C.] has [S.C.] <em>the minimal supervision that I would suggest would be two hours a day of direct one-to-one supervision </em>from a\u2014some type of staff individual that\u2019s involved. And, <em>in addition someone that\u2019s on call 24 hours a day that either\u2014that lives in either the apartment next door or within five minutes </em>at the most away due to [S.C.\u2019s] medical condition. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Ms. Havican, a registered nurse, shared Dr. Dyer\u2019s opinion of L.C.\u2019s inability to adequately care for S.C.\u2019s medical needs. Ms. Havican reached this assessment because of L.C.\u2019s inability to count S.C.\u2019s breaths, as appears from the following excerpts of her testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">When we got to the aero chamber and <em>[L.C.] didn\u2019t know how to count the breaths, I was shocked. Because with asthma, breathing, that\u2019s the name of the game. </em>Breathing, how is the child breathing, is the child wheezing, is it labored breathing, is it easy breathing. That\u2019s the basis of the whole thing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>That\u2019s the basis of the child\u2019s survival </em>is being able to breath easily. <em>And knowing how to assess the breath sounds and all of this.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">So that when that question came up, how mechanically do I count the breaths, in my mind I thought, well, <em>how\u2014how deep now is the lack of knowledge that I\u2019m working with. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Not only will a parental relationship with L.C. impair S.C.\u2019s physical well-being, but it will also cause S.C. psychological harm. According to both Dr. Dyer and Dr. Bruey, S.C. has a strong and powerful bond with her foster family. Both doctors also agreed that S.C.\u2019s removal from the foster family would be detrimental to S.C., but they disagreed over the degree and duration of the harm. Dr. Bruey and Dr. Dyer agreed that S.C. will suffer at least short-term problems if S.C. is returned to L.C. The short-term problems include depression, crying, temper tantrums, loss of appetite and regression. If these problems are not handled quickly and sensitively, they will become chronic.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Both doctors noted that L.C. has trouble comprehending the trauma S.C. will undergo if she is removed from her foster family, and this will make it harder for L.C. to help S.C. cope with the crisis. It is also undisputed that these emotional consequences place S.C. at increased risk for exacerbation of her asthmatic condition. Dr. Dyer testified that S.C.\u2019s personality development will be severely adversely affected if she is removed from her foster home. Dr. Dyer stated that S.C.\u2019s removal from her foster home will injure her capacity for basic trust, optimism and self-esteem and will prevent S.C. from having the ability to form stable relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Second, the proofs show that L.C. is unable or unwilling to eliminate the harm to S.C. and delaying permanent placement adds to the harm. Legislative and judicial policy dictates that the child\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d be protected \u201cso far as practicable\u201d by providing welfare services to support and maintain the integrity of the biological family as a living unit. From July 1987 to January 1989, when S.C. was under the Division\u2019s care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Ms. Hughes, a Division caseworker, expended great efforts in an attempt to reunite L.C. with S.C. Ms. Hughes signed service agreements with L.C., outlining tasks and goals, and coordinated a network of people to help L.C. achieve those goals. Ms. Hughes coordinated S.C.\u2019s evaluation and participation in an early intervention program; she provided medical supervision and training; she helped place L.C. with the Association for the Advancement of the Mentally Handicapped (Association); she involved L.C. in a parenting program. Despite L.C.\u2019s attempts at compliance and improvement of her skills, she did not succeed. In Dr. Dyer\u2019s opinion, although L.C. appeared to make progress in her parenting skills, L.C. failed to internalize the information taught.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The record reveals that L.C. maintains a very unstable existence. L.C. is unable to maintain steady housing or employment. Since S.C.\u2019s birth, L.C. has lived at thirteen different locations and has held five different jobs. L.C. has been unemployed since November 1988. Dr. Dyer testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">[S]hould [S.C.] be given to [L.C.] as caretaker it\u2019s highly probable that the same pattern of rootlessness would continue and that this child would not have the benefit of a stable residence or of a caretaker who had a stable working routine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Q. Do you have an opinion on how that instability would impact upon [S.C.] if she were returned to L.C.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">A. Yes. That would have extremely adverse consequences in terms of this child\u2019s normal growth and development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Dr. Dyer believed that L.C.\u2019s constant changes in residence and employment would impair S.C.\u2019s health and development because the instability and chaos would not facilitate S.C.\u2019s recovery from the broken psychological bond with her foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">L.C.\u2019s further unwillingness or inability to eliminate the harm to S.C. is manifested by her leaving the Association to live with T.F., her boyfriend. In leaving the Association, L.C. cut herself off from a rent-free apartment, assistance in locating employment, free medical care, paid food, electric and heating bills, and a clothing and telephone allowance. L.C. quit her last two jobs and has been unemployed since November 1988. Thus, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the time of trial, L.C. was dependent upon T.F. Although T.F. is married, L.C. planned for S.C. to live with her and T.F. in a one-bedroom apartment, and she planned for T.F. to provide for her and S.C. Despite this dependence on T.F. for support, L.C. did not know T.F.\u2019s income or financial condition. Further, L.C. testified that she would give up T.F. to get S.C. back. This unstable environment is not conducive to the healing process that S.C. must undergo if the bond with her foster family is broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In addition to L.C.\u2019s inability to eliminate the harm to S.C., delaying S.C.\u2019s permanent placement adds to that harm. Dr. Dyer testified that S.C.\u2019s indeterminate status of foster child would have an increasingly detrimental impact on S.C. Furthermore, S.C. needs some permanence in her life now. S.C. has been in foster care since birth and in the current foster family\u2019s care since she was four months old. Whereas L.C. is unable to offer S.C. the permanence she needs, the foster family has consistently provided the stability that S.C. needs. Delaying S.C.\u2019s permanent placement will only work to S.C.\u2019s detriment. Thus, substantial evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">[\u201cT]o delay permanent placement will create more harm as this court is doubtful that further training, counselling or therapy could be provided to [L.C.] within a reasonable period of time to make reunification possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Third, the trial court adequately examined the alternatives to termination of parental rights and properly determined that family reunification was no longer possible and that some type of placement for S.C. with visitation by L.C. was not viable. The trial court rejected the visitation alternative stating that \u201c[ujnder the facts of this case, such visitation is inappropriate based upon this court\u2019s assessment of the harm that has occurred or would befall [S.C.] by continued contact with [L.C.]____ Termination of parental rights is best for [S.C.] and her parents under the facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">S.C. has been in foster care since birth and has been with her current foster family since she was four months old. Both Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Dyer and Dr. Bruey testified that S.C. has a strong and powerful bond with her foster family. S.C. has formed strong ties of emotion, love and dependence with her foster family. Poster care has continued for such an extended period of time that a parent-child relationship has been created, albeit not one based upon blood but upon love, affection and need. Thus, the trial court properly concluded that either the sudden or gradual disruption of that relationship would damage S.C. Nothing in New Jersey\u2019s statutory scheme requires the attempted creation of a new psychological relationship with the natural mother at the cost of a child\u2019s present well-being in an established home in which the child is happy and flourishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">L.C. suggests that because the foster mother is now dead that she and S.C.\u2019s foster father stand in relation to S.C. in the same posture as divorced parents stand in relation to their children. L.C. views herself as the. non-custodial parent and asserts that the court would not \u201cthink of terminating the visitation rights of a divorced, noncustodial parent except upon finding behavior far more distressing than can be attributed to L.C.\u201d ' L.C: contends that parental rights are divisible into rights of custody and visitation and an inability to exercise one right does not preclude exercise of the others. We disagree. What L.C. fails to recognize is that this is not a divorce case where visitation is almost invariably granted to the non-custodial spouse. This is a case for termination of parental rights. The trial court properly applied the four prong <em>A. W. </em>test and in so doing, determined that custody in the foster father with continued visitation by L.C. was not a viable alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The trial court\u2019s position is consistent with the holdings in <em>Sorentino v. Family &amp; Children\u2019s Society of Elizabeth, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>127, 367 A.2d 1168 (1976) <em>(Sorentino I) </em>and <em>Sorentino v. Family &amp; Children\u2019s Society of Elizabeth, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>313, 378 A.2d 18 (1977) <em>(Sorentino II), aff'd, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>483, 391 A.2d 497 (1978). <em>Sorentino </em>involved a three year old child who lived with adoptive parents uninterruptedly from the time she was one month old. The hearing, held as a result of <em>Sorentino I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>resulted in the conclusion that a transfer of custody would probably seriously harm the child. The Supreme Court, without a specific finding of unfitness or abandonment, severed the parental rights based primarily upon the probability of damage to the child\u2019s well-being from a change in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The facts in this case are, if anything, more compelling than they were in <em>Sorentino. </em>S.C. has never lived with L.C. S.C. has been living with her current foster family for four of her four years and four months and has a strong and powerful bond with her foster family. What was stated in <em>Sorentino </em>is equally applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Here, the passage of time permitted the roots to be nurtured and to develop fully. Hence it would appear that no policy of the Act would be ignored by the termination of plaintiffs\u2019 rights, should that eventually be deemed appropriate, because there can be no unnecessary separation from a nonexisting relationship. In that event, such termination would tend to promote the policy of preventing interference by establishing the little girl permanently in the home of her adoptive parents. [74 <em>N.J. </em>at 324-25, 378 A.2d 18],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Fourth, the termination of L.C.\u2019s parental rights will result in a permanent resolution of S.C.\u2019s status. If one thing is clear, it is that S.C. needs association with a structured, nurturing environment. \u201cSince it seems generally agreed that permanence in itself is an important part of that nurture, a court must carefully weigh that aspect of a child\u2019s life.\u201d <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A. W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 610, 512 A.2d 438. Moreover, the court must consider whether the child already developed \u201ca filial relationship [with another] that cannot be destroyed or changed without some risk of emotional harm to the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Contrary to L.C.\u2019s claim, no harm would come to S.C. if L.C.\u2019s parental rights are terminated. Sufficient credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings that termination of the parental rights will not do more harm than good. Dr. Dyer testified that S.C.\u2019s removal from her foster home would certainly have an adverse short-term effect and an adverse long-term effect on S.C. Dr. Dyer also testified that S.C. is bonded to her foster family and the foster family is likewise bonded to S.C. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>foster family provides a calm and structured environment for S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Finally, we are satisfied that the trial court properly denied L.C.\u2019s right of visitation with S.C. Once parental rights are terminated and the child is placed under the guardianship of the Division, an alternative permanent placement is made and the court\u2019s jurisdiction ends. <em>See Division of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. D.C., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>388, 394-95, 571 A.2d 1295 (1990); <em>In re Guardianship of C.W., M. W. and N.F., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 53, 443 A.2d 231 (App.Div.1982). As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Division of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. D.C., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 394-95, 571 A.2d 1295:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15 to -24 </em>differs from both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73 in that it <em>provides for a permanent remedy: termination of parental rights and placement of the child under the guardianship of DYFS. </em>Whereas temporary remedies deprive parents of custody only, leaving the extent of parental visitation for further adjudication, <em>a successful guardianship action under N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15 to -24 necessarily entails a cessation of visitation. </em>That path leads to freeing the child for adoption. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-20. [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>See also In re Guardianship of R.O.M.C. and S.A.S.C., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>631, 581 A.2d 113 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The order terminating L.C.\u2019s parental rights effectively terminates the legal relationship between L.C. and S.C. The effect of termination of parental rights should make S.C. a \u201cstranger\u201d to L.C. The clear language of the applicable statutes precludes the granting of post-termination visitation. It may well be that in certain situations post-termination visitation would be in the best interests of older children who developed a demonstrable bond with their natural parents, but that is not so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment under review substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Harper in his letter opinion of September 6, 1989, as supplemented by his oral opinion of December 20, 1989, denying L.C.\u2019s motion for a stay of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We are also satisfied that Judge Harper properly denied L.C.\u2019s motion to compel the Division to pay her expert witness fees of Dr. Bruey and Dr. Fost. First, there is no basis in law or fact to require the Division to reimburse the Community Health Law Project, which represented L.C. in this matter, for the expenses incurred in connection with the retention of expert witnesses on L.C.\u2019s behalf. There is no statutory authorization for the payment of such fees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:2-1 provides that all appropriations for the Department of Human Services, of which the Division is a part, are to be made as \u201cone item.\u201d However, this provision does not suggest that there are funds available for a court to order the payment of experts fees. Moreover, the statutory schemes for all departments, divisions, agencies and other governmental units include general appropriation clauses and to find that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:2-1 allows payment of experts fees would give the court carte blanche to compel the Division to pay for any service that the court felt the Division should provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4029 is for \u201cpayments of maintenance\u201d <em>o\u00ed the </em>Division. That provision grants the Division \u201csuch funds as shall be appropriated for the purposes of this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-29. The Department of Human Services\u2019 total expenditures cannot exceed the sums appropriated by the Legislature. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:2-2. The Division must perform its duties within the limits of the funds appropriated to it. <em>State in Interest of D.F., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 386-87, 367 A.2d 1198 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>260, 377 A.2d 665 (1977). No provision appropriates funds for experts fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Moreover, it is fundamental that the judicial branch of government cannot order appropriations in the absence of statutory authority. \u201cNo money may be drawn from the State treasury but for appropriations made by law. The judiciary [canjnot order the Legislature to appropriate money, or the Governor to approve an appropriation if one were made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Division of Youth &amp; Family Sews. v. D. C., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 399, 571 A.2d 1295 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald v. Palmer, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>106, 108, 219 A.2d 512 (1966) (citing <em>N.J. Const, of 1947 </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 2, II2)). As our Supreme Court stated in <em>City of Camden v. Byrne, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>133, 148-49, 411 A.2d 462 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">New Jersey courts have consistently adhered to the principle that the power and authority to appropriate funds lie solely and exclusively with the legislative branch of government. There can be no redress in the courts to overcome either the Legislature\u2019s action or refusal to take action pursuant to its constitutional power over state appropriations. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Thus, the Supreme Court endorsed the holding of <em>Amantia v. Cantwell, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 13, 213 A.2d 251 (App.Div.1965), which declared \u201cwhether or not petitioners receive the money to which they are clearly entitled rests with the Legislature.\u201d Secondly, the Community Health Law Project chose the experts which they determined were needed without regard to cost, funding, source or the needs of other clients. The Division certainly had no control over or input into these decisions. Since the Community Health Law Project is funded specifically to litigate cases such as this, it has the financial burden and responsibility to provide and pay counsel and necessary expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Finally, even assuming that the Division had a duty to assure L.C. access to competent experts to help examine and assist in evaluating, preparing and presenting S.C.\u2019s medical condition and L.C.\u2019s ability to parent, that duty was not violated in this case. Prior to engaging Dr. Bruey, the Community Health Law Project sought and obtained Division funds to retain an independent expert, Dr. Dyer. While it is true that L.C.\u2019s counsel suggested both Dr. Dyer and Dr. Bruey as sources for an independent examination, the parties agreed to Dr. Dyer as a joint expert to be paid by the Division. Additionally, Dr. Fost\u2019s testimony generally was consistent with the testimony given by S.C.\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Aguila, and since there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Dr. Aguila was not equally available to L.C., the Community Health Law Project should not receive funds to pay the expert fees of Dr. Fost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Indigent litigants in cases of this kind do not have a limitless right in selecting experts of their own choosing and imposing the cost thereof on the State. As the United States Supreme Court so appropriately observed in <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>68, 83, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1087, 1096, 84 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>53, 66 (1985), \u201c[t]his is not to say ... that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Since this matter involved the termination of parental rights, we accelerated the appeal and directed the Clerk of the Appellate Division to send the audiotapes of the proceedings in the trial court to an appropriate transcribing service for transcription in accordance with the Supreme Court Directive No. 98-89, dated September 20, 1989, entitled \u201cAppeal from Family Division\u2014Appellate Custody and Termination Systems (ACTS).\u201d Further, we ordered that the issue concerning who should reimburse the Administrative Office of the Courts for payment of the transcript be determined by this court or that the matter be remanded to the trial court following the determination of the merits of the appeal. Thus, while we affirm the judgment and post-trial order under review, we remand the matter to the trial court for determination as to who should pay the costs of the transcript in accordance with Directive No. 98-89.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
