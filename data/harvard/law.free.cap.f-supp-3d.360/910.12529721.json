BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs, HCI Distribution, Inc., and Rock River Manufacturing, Inc., are wholly owned subsidiaries of Ho-Chunk, Inc. Filing 1 at 6. Ho-Chunk is the economic development arm of the Winnebago Tribe. Both HCI and Rock River are incorporated under Tribal law. The Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe eligible to receive services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs with its reservation land sited within the boundaries of Nebraska. Filing 1 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C235\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 4,235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan 30, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   HCI's business consists of purchasing and reselling tobacco goods exclusively in Indian country throughout the United States. Filing 1 at 7. HCI sells to reservation-based wholesalers and retailers exclusively in Indian country. All tobacco products HCI ships are affixed with tax stamps in accordance with Tribal law. HCI employs tribal members and allocates 20 percent of its net profits to support tribal welfare programs, which in 2017 allowed HCI to contribute $ 157,381 to the tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rock River is a federally licensed cigarette manufacturer with its facilities on the Tribe's reservation. Filing 1 at 8. All Rock River's products are manufactured on the reservation. Rock River's products are distributed by HCI and other distributors, and are sold by such distributors to retailers nationwide. All Rock River's tobacco products bear the tribal stamp for each jurisdiction where its products are sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1998, Nebraska and 45 other states settled lawsuits with several tobacco manufacturers and trade organizations. The parties' Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) required the tobacco manufacturers to place restrictions on tobacco product advertising and marketing, as well as make cash payments in perpetuity to the settling states. Filing 1 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omaha Tribe of Nebraska v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253791\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/311/816/#p818\">\n    311 F.Supp.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818 (S.D. Iowa 2004). Later, additional tobacco manufacturers signed onto the MSA. These subsequent participating manufacturers, together with the original participating manufacturers are referred to collectively as the participating manufacturers. Filing 1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Not all tobacco manufacturers signed onto the MSA. Those that did not are called non-participating manufacturers. Rock River is one such non-participating manufacturer. Filing 1 at 8. The settling states became concerned that the non-participating manufacturers could avoid liability for the harm that their tobacco products could cause, and the participating manufacturers were concerned that the non-participating manufacturers would be able to unfairly compete in the market without incurring costs similar to the costs associated with participation in the MSA.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253791\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/311/816/#p818\">\n    311 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   818 ; filing 1 at 3. In response, the participating manufacturers and the settling states agreed to enact variations of a model statutory scheme that imposed fees and other regulations on non-participating manufacturers. Filing 1 at 3. Those statutes are often referred to as qualifying or escrow statutes. Filing 1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nebraska enacted its version of an escrow statute in 1999.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2069-2701\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 69-2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 69-2703.01. Section 69-2703 essentially provided that tobacco manufacturers selling cigarettes within the state could either join the MSA as a participating manufacturer or be required to fund an escrow account by placing funds into an account on a quarterly basis regarding the manufacturer's unit sales of tobacco products. Violation of the escrow requirements could result in civil penalties and possible exclusion from selling tobacco products in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The terms of the MSA required the settling states to diligently enforce their escrow statute. Filing 1 at 9-10. When enforcement proved difficult, the states enacted further model legislation referred to as the directory statute. The purpose of this legislation was to publish a list of tobacco product manufacturers and tobacco products that were in full compliance with the escrow statute and other tobacco manufacturing and licensing laws. Filing 1 at 10. Tobacco products not on the directory list could not be sold in the state. Nebraska's directory statute, enacted in 2003, is found at \u00a7\u00a7 69-2704 to 69-2707.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Together, the escrow and directory statutes are often referred to as the MSA laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Still claiming that the settling states were not diligently enforcing the escrow requirements, the participating manufacturers initiated an arbitration proceeding to reduce the payments owed to the settling states. Filing 1 at 12. Of particular concern were tobacco producer sales in Indian country. Filing 1 at 13. Some of the settling states, including Nebraska, were pressured into including new statutory provisions aimed at the tribal tobacco business. Filing 1 at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   filing 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs and the Tribe have always maintained that their sovereign authority precluded the state's authority to regulate their on-reservation tobacco manufacturing and tobacco distribution business. Filing 1 at 11. In 2011, the Nebraska Attorney General's office worked with representatives of the tobacco manufacturers to devise model legislation aimed at regulating tribal tobacco manufacturing and distribution, and require tribes to comply with Nebraska's MSA laws. Filing 1-1. That same year, legislation was enacted that purportedly brought tribal tobacco product manufacturing and distribution within the regulations imposed by the escrow statute, but also purported to provide a release of funds for \"cigarettes sold on an Indian tribe's Indian country to its tribal members\"-but only if there was an agreement with the Governor, in which a tribe was required to accept state regulation of the tribe's cigarette manufacturing and distribution business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 69-2703(2)(b)(iv) and 77-2602.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2015, the Tribe, and the plaintiffs in April 2016, entered into an agreement of their own separate from their negotiations with the State. This agreement is called the \"Universal Tobacco Settlement Agreement.\" The agreement purported to regulate cigarette sales in Indian country, as well as create a fund that would allow the tobacco product manufacturers participating in this new agreement to obtain a release of all claims that may arise out of the sale of their products. Filing 1 at 11-12; filing 1-2. In addition to regulating cigarette marketing, the agreement required the participating tobacco product manufacturers to make quarterly payments to a settling tribe regarding the number of cigarettes sold in that tribe's jurisdiction. Filing 1-2 at 6-7. In 2017, the Tribe received fees pursuant to the agreement totaling $ 31,681.00. Filing 1 at 11-12. In addition, the Tribe imposes a tax on the sale of cigarettes within its jurisdiction. In 2017 the Tribe collected $ 122,658 in cigarette tax revenue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2069-2701\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2014, at approximately the same time the Tribe was considering participation in the Universal Tobacco Settlement Agreement, the Nebraska Department of Revenue issued tax statements to several reservation-based cigarette retailers. Filing 1 at 14. According to the plaintiffs, the issuance of tax statements prompted them to engage in negotiations with the defendants to settle their disagreement regarding whether their tobacco manufacturing and distribution business was subject to Nebraska's MSA laws. The plaintiffs contend that the negotiations were unsuccessful due to the defendants' insistence that the plaintiffs were not excused from strict compliance with Nebraska's MSA laws. The plaintiffs represent that since March 2014, they have operated under a cloud of uncertainty regarding the threat of penalties and retaliation by the defendants, which has created an impediment to their business operations and ability to expand economically. Filing 1 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1. SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiffs rely on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and \u00a7 1331 for subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 1362 specifically pertains to Indian tribes and gives the district courts \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Similarly, \u00a7 1331 pertains to all civil actions and gives district courts original jurisdiction for \"actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no dispute that the plaintiffs' claims constitute a civil action arising under the Constitution. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' regulatory scheme violates both the Supremacy Clause (art. VI, cl. 2) and the Indian Commerce Clause (art. 1 \u00a7 8, cl. 3) of the Constitution. As such, subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1331 was sufficiently pled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds that at a minimum, there is subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1331. Accordingly, the Court will deny the defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) regarding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.

However, the release is conditioned on the existence of an agreement with the state in which the tribe agrees to significant state regulatory control and a limited waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-2602.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, the directory statute incorporates the taxation features of the escrow statute by requiring \"[e]very tobacco product manufacturer whose cigarettes are sold in this state\" and who is a non-participating manufacturer to certify that it has \"established and continues to maintain a qualified escrow fund that has been reviewed and approved by the Attorney General.\" And, each such non-participating manufacturer must certify it \"is in full compliance\" with the requisite quarterly contributions to its qualified escrow fund. \u00a7 69-2706(1)(d)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is true that the MSA laws on the whole are regulatory. Indeed, the directory statute incorporates participation in the escrow statutory scheme by reference, but otherwise, on its own, does not impose payment into a fund available for the state to use as it sees fit. But that does not exclude the possibility that the escrow provision effects a tax on the tribal tobacco products manufacturers. \" 'Every tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to\n   the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nat. Fed'n. of Indep.

But even if the MSA laws better fit the paradigm of a regulatory scheme, the laws would be subject to review pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   interest-balancing test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cabazon Band of Mission Indians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131060\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/202/#p215\">\n    480 U.S. at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131060\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/202/#p215\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, whether framed as taxation or as regulatory, the facts alleged in the complaint would allow the Court to conclude that Nebraska's MSA laws infringe on \"the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\"\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p142\">\n    448 U.S. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p142\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What is clear is that the plaintiffs' Indian Commerce Clause claims may not be resolved on a summary basis. Resolution of the issues concerning Indian country and tribal member taxation and regulation are exceedingly complex and context-dependent. The Court cannot determine whether the MSA laws impose a tax or regulation, or both, or the extent to which the tax or regulations interfere with a tribe's right to make and be ruled by its own laws, on the plaintiffs' complaint standing alone. The Court anticipates that a full evidentiary record will be required before it may undertake a complete resolution of the parties' claims and contentions pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause. Accordingly, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have alleged a plausible factual basis to give rise to a claim pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   5. EQUAL PROTECTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the \"State of Nebraska\" has \"targeted Indian tribes and reservation Indians for increased scrutiny and increased legal burdens under its MSA laws.\" Filing 1 at 17. The Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat similarly situated people alike.\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    473 U.S. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Accordingly, the first step in an equal protection analysis in this matter is determining whether the plaintiffs have alleged facts showing they are treated differently than other tobacco product manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klinger v. Dept. of Corrections\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527525\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/727/#p731\">\n    31 F.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (8th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that Indian tribal sovereignty requires that they must be treated differently from all other tobacco product manufacturers. As such, the plaintiffs' claim is the exact opposite of an equal protection claim. The plaintiffs claim that the Indian Commerce Clause and Indian tribal sovereign immunity require their disparate treatment from all other tobacco product manufacturers, and that they are entitled to have this disparate treatment continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although dissimilar to the model MSA statutes enacted by other states, Nebraska's MSA laws-in the same manner as other State's MSA laws-seeks to treat all tobacco product manufacturers alike, yet give some degree of deference to an Indian tribe's tobacco product manufacturing business. The deference is due to an Indian tribe's sovereignty. Because the plaintiffs' complaint seeks to achieve greater disparate treatment from other tobacco product manufacturers by enjoining the application of Nebraska's MSA laws with respect to its tobacco product manufacturing, the Court finds that plaintiffs failed to allege an equal protection violation. That claim will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   1. The defendants' motion to dismiss (filing 27) is granted in part and in part denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   2.

This matter is referred to the Magistrate Judge for case progression.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Regarding \u00a7 1362 subject matter jurisdiction, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs are not \"an Indian tribe or band\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1362. Filing 28 at 44. However, the defendants do not dispute that the plaintiffs are tribal businesses and that the Tribe is federally recognized. So, the defendants' assertion that the plaintiffs are not an Indian band or tribe is contrary to the pled facts. The plaintiffs alleged that they are incorporated under Tribal law, are wholly owned by Ho-Chunk, and that Ho-Chunk is the economic development arm of the Tribe. To argue that the economic arm of the Tribe is not part of the Tribe is like arguing that the defendants, as the law enforcement arms of the State, are not the State.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians v.
