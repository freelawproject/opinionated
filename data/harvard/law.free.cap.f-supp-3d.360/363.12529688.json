Urbanski, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Katherine Morris (Morris) brings this action against Wilmington Savings Fund Society (WSFS), asserting, in four counts, three breach of contract claims and a fourth claim for violation of federal lending laws. This matter is before the court on WSFS's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Morris's complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for the County of Page, Virginia on or about April 16, 2018 and removed to federal court on May 17, 2018. ECF No. 1, 2. The claims center on Morris's default on her mortgage on the property located at 133 Trackside Lane f/k/a 210 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Street, Shenandoah, Virginia (the Property) and WSFS's subsequent mailing of the \"Notice of Default and Intent to Accelerate\" (pre-acceleration notice) and foreclosure. ECF No. 1-2, 2. Count I alleges breach of contract by claiming that WSFS failed to give notice according to the terms of the Deed of Trust (DOT) by sending the pre-acceleration notice via certified mail, rather than first-class mail, as required by Section 15 of the DOT. Count II, also a breach of contract claim, alleges that WSFS violated Section 22 of the DOT by failing to provide a pre-acceleration notice in compliance with Section 22's terms (again because WSFS sent the notice by certified mail). Count III, Morris's final breach of contract claim, alleges that WSFS \"made it impossible under Section 19 of the DOT for [Morris] to reinstate the loan five days prior to the sale of the Property.\" Finally, Count IV alleges violations of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) associated with WSFS's alleged failure to provide payoff balances within a statutorily set period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With respect to Count I, WSFS contends Morris's breach of contract claim fails because it is directly contradicted by the pre-acceleration notice, attached as an exhibit to Morris's complaint. ECF No. 4, 5. Specifically, WSFS maintains the pre-acceleration notice sent to Morris \"Via Certified Mail\" constitutes first-class mail for purposes of the DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. WSFS moves for dismissal as to Count II, contending further that the notice sent met all the requirements of Section 22 of the DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. WSFS moves for dismissal as to Count III on the grounds that Virginia law does not recognize an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. WSFS alleges Count III therefore fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, WSFS moves for dismissal of Count IV because the statutes upon which Morris relies apply only to high-cost mortgages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. WSFS contends the subject loan is not a high-cost mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even if the statutes Morris relies upon apply, WSFS further alleges Count IV should be dismissed because Morris did\n   not allege a written request for a reinstatement quote as required by statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Katherine Morris (\"Morris\"), a resident of Virginia, alleges she owns the Page County property in dispute. Morris entered into a loan for $65,195 secured by the Property and executed by CitiMortgage, Inc. The note for that loan is now held by WSFS. Morris paid full and timely mortgage payments for 8.5 years. On October 12, 2016, loan servicer BSI Financial Services sent the post-acceleration notice, which stated that Morris needed to bring her mortgage payments current by November 16, 2016 or face acceleration of the loan and sale of the Property. Morris was sixteen mortgage payments behind at that time, which amounted to $11,447.90. Morris never received the pre-acceleration notice and did not obtain a copy of it until the day of the detainer hearing on December 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   WSFS appointed Commonwealth Trustees, LLC as substitute trustee to sell the Property on December 14, 2016. Morris received a Notice of Substitute Trustee's Sale on April 10, 2017 stating a foreclosure sale of the Property was scheduled for May 8, 2017. Morris immediately requested a reinstatement quote from the subsequent servicer, Fay Servicing, on six occasions. Morris needed a reinstatement quote in a timely manner so she could withdraw funds from her 401(k) retirement account. Fay Servicing provided the reinstatement quote on May 4, 2017. Morris's retirement account company could not release funds until May 10, 2017. Morris had the means to pay the pre-acceleration default amount, but could not access the funds by May 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   WSFS, through its substitute trustee, sold the Property by auction on May 8, 2017. After the sale, Fay Servicing offered Morris the opportunity to voluntarily vacate the Property through a \"Cash for Keys Agreement and Release\" if Morris waived all rights to the Property. Morris refused. WSFS notified Morris on July 17, 2017 that she was to vacate the Property within ten days. On August 8, 2017, WSFS filed an unlawful detainer action against Morris in Page County General District Court. Morris challenged the validity of WSFS's title to the Property based on its breach of material terms of the deed in order to sell the Property. The court determined Morris's claims would likely survive demurrer but ruled it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide validity of the title of December 8, 2017. WSFS filed another unlawful detainer action against Morris in Page County Circuit Court on January 29, 2018, which was pending at the time this complaint was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Morris then filed this action in Page County Circuit Court on April 16, 2018 alleging breach of contract as to Sections 15, 22, and 19 of the DOT and violations of TILA and RESPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint need only contain sufficient factual matter which, if accepted as true, \"state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The DOT states in Section 15, \"Any notice to Borrower in conjunction with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means.\" ECF No. 1-2, 29. Morris claims WSFS solely used \"other means\" because the pre-acceleration notice was sent via certified mail and certified mail is not first-class mail as intended by the DOT. WSFS, on the other hand, claims that certified mail is \"an optional feature of first-class mail,\" and not a separate type of mailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 9, 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While certified mail might indeed be an extra available option when attempting to send first-class mail, many courts do treat the two as separate mailing mechanisms for purposes of meeting notice requirements.

Morris contends WSFS breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because it was impossible for Morris to reinstate the loan five days before the sale. WSFS, for its part, argues that the acceleration of the loan upon Morris's default and the resulting foreclosure were nothing more than the exercise of explicit contractual rights, and that a claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires \"that the alleged breach was dishonest and in bad faith,\" rather than merely an action that is unfavorable to the plaintiff. ECF No. 4, 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enomoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229849\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/624/443/#p450\">\n    624 F.Supp.2d at 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that plaintiff's pleading of a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing due to defendant's failure to provide him with a space flight and failure to inform him of the high likelihood of medical disqualification after three or four nonrefundable payments was sufficient because it alleged dishonest, rather than merely unfavorable, conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 19 of the DOT grants to Morris the right to halt foreclosure proceedings and reinstate the terms of her loan if she cures her default and pays all fees associated with the default. At first glance, this section seems to create rights for the borrower, rather than place duties on the lender. A logical and unavoidable condition precedent to the exercise of these rights, however, is knowledge of what conditions the borrower must meet to discontinue enforcement of the Security Instrument. Indeed, Section 19 includes a long list of potential payments and fees the borrower may or may not have to meet, and even alludes to other potential payments that are not listed. The full reckoning of what a borrower must do to halt foreclosure proceedings is entirely within the control of the lender-here, WSFS through its appointed servicer, Fay Servicing. Implied by the granting of these rights, therefore, is that WSFS alert Morris of what she owes. Morris alleges that she requested a reinstatement quote on April 12, 2017. ECF No. 1-2, 4. Essentially, Morris asked what conditions she would have to meet in order to exercise her Section 19 rights. WSFS did not provide Morris with a reinstatement quote until May 4, 2017, 22 days after her request and four days before the Property was sold at auction.
