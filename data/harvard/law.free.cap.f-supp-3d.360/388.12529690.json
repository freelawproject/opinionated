Doc. 8)\n   </strong>\n   , an opposition thereto filed by Plaintiffs (Rec. Doc. 16) and Sheriff Smith's reply. (Rec. Doc. 54). Having considered the Motion and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the Motion should be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter arises from the 2015 St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's election in which Defendant, Randy Smith (\"Sheriff Smith\"), challenged the then-incumbent sheriff, Rodney \"Jack\" Strain (\"former Sheriff Strain\"). Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   served as deputy sheriffs under Sheriff Strain and campaigned on his behalf during the election. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they solicited votes door-to-door, wore campaign apparel, distributed yard signs, and attended public fundraisers and events in support of Sheriff Strain. Despite their vigorous campaign efforts, Defendant won the election on November 21, 2015. Pursuant to Louisiana law, Plaintiffs' terms as deputies expired automatically when former Sheriff Strain's tenure of office ended on July 1, 2016, the date Sheriff Smith was sworn into the office. Upon assuming office Sheriff Smith did not reinstate Plaintiffs to their former positions as deputy sheriffs, which Plaintiffs allege to be an act of retaliation by Sheriff Smith because he resented their support of his political opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 25, 2017, Plaintiffs filed suit against Sheriff Smith, individually and in his official capacity, asserting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims for violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech and political expression. The Plaintiffs also assert state law violations pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 23:961. Additionally, two of the Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Bryan Moore and Cheryl Hanson-filed claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), averring that they were entitled to return to their positions when their leave ended under Sheriff Smith's administration because they were employed by the sheriff's department under Sheriff Strain at the time they took their leave. Plaintiffs assert the state law and FMLA claims against Defendant only in his official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   arguing that Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted. (Rec. Doc. 8.) Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Defendant's motion, arguing that the complaint provided more than adequate facts to survive a motion to dismiss and requesting leave to amend the pleadings, if necessary. (Rec. Doc. 16). Defendant\n   filed a reply. (Rec. Doc. 54).

While Sheriff Smith attacks the factual basis of some of Plaintiffs' claims as insufficient and raises qualified immunity, a common argument he raises in defense to all these claims is the special relationship between sheriffs and deputies in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Courts have recognized that according to Louisiana law, there is no such\n   thing as a \"Parish Sheriff's Department\"; rather, every newly-elected sheriff creates his own department, which he leads in his official capacity as a political subdivision of Louisiana.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Grant Par.

Given their status as relatively independent subdivisions of the state, sheriffs enjoy a great degree of control over their deputies. \"The sheriff, and not the state, hires and fires deputies, exercises direct and indirect supervision and control over them, fixes their time and place of work, and generally allocates their responsibility and assigns their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

App. 4th Cir. 1978) (\"[A] deputy sheriff has no statutorily prescribed term of office, but merely serves at the pleasure of the sheriff.\"). The term of a deputy expires with the tenure of the sheriff who hired him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Plaintiffs counter that Sheriff Smith's right not to reappoint them was constrained by the United States Constitution, Louisiana statutory law, and congressional enactment. The Court must therefore examine in each of these three contexts what meaning, if any, should be given to the fact that when Sheriff Smith took office, a new subdivision of the state was effectively formed. The Court will examine each of Plaintiffs' claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIMS UNDER\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 1983\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they were improperly dismissed for their support of Sheriff Smith's political rival. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment does not allow \"a nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential government employee [to] be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Elrod v.

There is no doubt that then, that the U.S. Constitution does curtail what appears to be the plenary authority of Louisiana sheriffs in hiring and firing.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Furthermore, the federal courts have long rejected the argument that newly-elected sheriffs are not subject to this First Amendment limitation simply because they must rehire deputies at the beginning of their tenure. \"For [First Amendment purposes], there is no difference between firing and declining to re-appoint.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , 145 F.3d at 703 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Warnock v.

Accordingly, courts have found that a deputy has a valid claim under \u00a7 1983, if he was not re-commissioned because he expressed support for an elected sheriff's opponent.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Facial Plausibility of Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sheriff Smith apparently concedes that it would violate the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights to decline rehiring them on the basis of their political support for former Sheriff Strain; he instead argues that there is an insufficient factual basis for their claims. Specifically, Sheriff Smith argues that the \u00a7 1983 claims fail, because each of the Plaintiffs have failed to put forth sufficient facts demonstrating a political motive behind their respective terminations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant admits that each of the Plaintiffs provided sufficient factual allegations that they supported Sheriff Strain during his re-election efforts. However, Sheriff Smith contends that he recommissioned hundreds of deputies who served under Sheriff Strain, \"some of whom [he] likely would have recognized as supporting former Sheriff Strain.\" (Rec. Doc. 8-1 at 4). Thus, Sheriff Smith argues that the Plaintiffs' allegations that they were not recommissioned due to that political activity are \"rank speculation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sheriff Smith's position appears to be that dismissal is appropriate unless a plaintiff alleges that he flat out told the deputy he was firing him or her out of political animus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is obviously does not capture the level of scrutiny applied at the 12(b)(6) stage.

Each of the three wore a shirt to the rally expressing his support for former Sheriff Strain. Plaintiffs allege that then-candidate Smith approached the three deputies and \"pointed his finger ... and said[,] 'you're fired.' \" (Rec. Doc. 1 at 12). Upon being questioned about this bizarre remark, Defendant allegedly laughed and walked away.

Upon careful reading of the \u00a7 23:961, the Court is not convinced the Louisiana Supreme Court would apply the statute in a case such as this one, where a defendant sheriff refused to re-appoint deputies. \"[I]nterpretation of any statutory provision begins with the language of the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Arabie v.

Civ. Code art. 9. As Sheriff Smith notes, a common sense reading of the statute does not make clear a sheriff would be liable for policies or conduct affecting deputies he never hired. Section 23:961 repeatedly hinges the possibility of criminal penalties on an employer affecting the political activities or affiliations of \"his employees.\" This Court does not understand the word \"his\" preceding \"employee\" to be meaningless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oubre v.

No such direct relationship-whether it be categorized as employer-employee or appointer-appointee-existed between Sheriff Smith and Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9631121\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/364/1338/#p1340\">\n    364 So.2d at 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, it is Plaintiffs who ask this court to upset the status quo by diverging from Louisiana case law that has stood for forty years.

Acknowledging that section 1981 must be construed according federal and not state law, the Fifth Circuit concluded that \"despite the indefinite tenure of the job of deputy sheriff, the sheriff and his deputies had expectations arising from the deputy's employment.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1492117\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/695/104/#p106\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1492117\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/695/104/#p106\">\n     at 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In determining whether \u00a7 23:961 applied to deputies, the\n    <em>\n     Boyer\n    </em>\n    court essentially adopted\n    <em>\n     Kyles\n    </em>\n    reasoning as its own.\n    <em>\n     Boyer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9631121\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/364/1338/#p1340\">\n     364 So.2d at 1340-41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It then concluded, \"In the absence of an employer/employee relationship, R.S. 23:961 cannot be applicable.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9631121\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/364/1338/#p1340\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9631121\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/364/1338/#p1340\">\n     at 1341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court further opined, \"Without any contractual rights in his employment, a deputy, or other political appointee,\n    <em>\n     has no right to expect nor basis for expecting continued employment.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9631121\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/364/1338/#p1340\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). This reasoning is obviously at odds with the Fifth Circuit's in\n    <em>\n     Adams\n    </em>\n    , where the Court found the deputies\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    have certain expectations arising from the deputies' employment.\n    <em>\n     Adams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1492117\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/695/104/#p106\">\n     695 F.2d at 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The sheriff promised to pay his deputies a stated salary. In return the deputies promised to perform their jobs.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    However, the Fifth Circuit's strong disapproval of the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Kyles\n    </em>\n    , which the\n    <em>\n     Boyer\n    </em>\n    court depended upon, arguably only goes as far as federal law is concerned-the Fifth Circuit concluded that the\n    <em>\n     Kyles\n    </em>\n    court was incorrect in finding it was bound by state law, not that the district court had interpreted state law incorrectly. Thus,\n    <em>\n     Boyer's\n    </em>\n    application of\n    <em>\n     state law principles\n    </em>\n    to\n    <em>\n     state law\n    </em>\n    may be said to remain unchallenged. In any case, for reasons explained above, the Court finds it unnecessary to reexamine whether deputies are employees or appointees for purposes of state law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    A court cannot waffle between opposing interpretations of a statute depending on a civil or criminal context, so, civil defendants may sometimes benefit from the rule of lenity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Leocal v.
