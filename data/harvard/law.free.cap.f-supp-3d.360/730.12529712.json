The health plan has a contract with ESI, which requires ESI to collect payments for the price of Acthar. In a contract between Rockford and ESI (the \"PBM Agreement\" or the \"contract\") that the parties entered into on January 1, 2015, ESI agreed to provide Rockford certain services, including \"cost containment,\" although \"cost containment\" is not defined in the agreement. Mallinckrodt charged Rockford for Acthar at a discounted rate of 13.5% off the \"average wholesale price\" as set forth in the PBM Agreement. Mallinckrodt set the average wholesale prices of Acthar used by Express Scripts for reimbursement. Accordingly, on April 1, 2015, Mallinckrodt had Acthar shipped directly to the children of two Rockford employees.

Federal Antitrust Claims (Counts VI and VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The gravamen of plaintiffs' antitrust claims is that defendants acted and conspired to raise Acthar prices exorbitantly high as part of a vertical price-fixing scheme and did so by implementing the ASAP, restricting distribution, not seeking low-cost alternatives to Acthar, and, in the case of the Synacthen Acquisition, eliminating viable competitors from entering the ACTH market in order to unlawfully preserve Mallinckrodt's monopoly for its and Express Scripts' pecuniary benefit. The antitrust conspiracy, as plaintiffs allege, injured plaintiffs by forcing them to pay higher costs for Acthar than they would have but for defendants' conduct. For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that Rockford has plausibly stated that defendants' conduct amounted to violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 and that it was injured by this conduct, but that Acument does not plausibly allege that it has antitrust standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

First, there is no risk of duplicative liability or potentially inconsistent judgments because plaintiffs and Express Scripts would not be suing for the same injury given plaintiffs' allegations that Express Scripts took part in the price-fixing that allegedly injured plaintiffs. Second, permitting plaintiffs to sue would not cause inefficient enforcement of the antitrust laws by diluting the ultimate\n   recovery and thus decreasing direct purchasers' incentive to sue. Though the court notes that there are no allegations that would lead Express Scripts to seek recovery for any such overcharge in subsequent lawsuits, it would still be able to recover the same amount on their hypothetical lost profits claim even if plaintiffs recovered on their separate price-fixing claims. Third,\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   warned against requiring courts to ascertain the portion of an overcharge that was passed on. But here, plaintiffs do not allege that defendants' agreement in fact included a \"pass-on\" payment. Rather, plaintiffs allege that defendants agreed on what share of the payment Express Scripts would receive, and then Express Scripts would simply deduct its agreed-upon share before forwarding the remainder to Mallinckrodt,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 20; the court would simply look to the amount deducted by Express Scripts to ascertain the portion of the overcharge. While plaintiffs do not allege what that amount is, defendants do not explain why that amount would be difficult to ascertain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs allege circumstantial evidence to support their argument that defendants agreed to a vertical price-fixing scheme. Discovery may illuminate that Express Scripts did not in fact play a role in the Synacthen Acquisition, that defendants had no intention of effecting harm to the market through the exclusive dealing arrangement, and/or that Mallinckrodt conducted its allegedly unlawful conduct separate and apart from its business associations with Express Scripts.

To reiterate this opinion's section on the application of\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   to Acument's federal antitrust claims, the SAC lacks sufficient allegations to allow the court to determine how Acument's injuries in Tennessee are connected to defendants' conduct.

The twenty-four state statutes invoked in the SAC are those of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. Defendants cite limitations specific to some of these states that defendants contend defeat most of plaintiffs' state-law claims.

Mallinckrodt simply argues that \"[t]he antitrust laws of these states limit their reach to activities which occur within the state. Because Plaintiffs fail to allege conduct within those states that would violate the respective statutes, each claim should be dismissed.\" Similarly, for the consumer protection statutes, defendants argue that those statutes only concern \"intrastate\" activity. The court finds that plaintiffs have met their bare pleading requirements at this stage that unnamed class members purchased Acthar in these states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 260-266, 269-289, 293-336, 341-348, 353-356.

It is not logically narrower, however, because it is not a logical subset of the opinion of the other Justices in the majority. Those Justices do not implicitly approve of its rationale for sometimes allowing state procedural rules to control-on the contrary, they explicitly reject that rationale-and it therefore does not represent the common denominator of the Court's reasoning.

[E]ven though Stevens joined the majority to hold that Rule 23 trumps New York's class-action bar, he agreed with the dissent that some state procedural rules-when sufficiently intertwined with the state's substantive rights and remedies-can control in federal court. The\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   Court infers from that agreement that there were five votes for Stevens's approach.

It is true, as Rockford contends, that \"cost containment is one of the \"PBM Services\" noted in the recitals and the term \"PBM Services\" is referred to throughout the operative portion of the contract.

This may support the conclusion that any reference to \"cost containment\" was not intended by the parties to impose an actionable obligation on Express Scripts under the terms of the contract. In later proceedings, with the benefit of discovery and applicable rules of contract interpretation, the court may be able to determine whether \"cost containment\" programs were merely an example of what \"PBM Services\" may generally include or whether, and to what extent, they constitute an enforceable obligation of Express Scripts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Rockford, the court concludes that \"cost containment\" is alluded to in the operative terms of the PBM Agreement and therefore the court will not dismiss Rockford's claim based upon Express Scripts' \"prefatory language\" argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Turning to another issue, under Illinois law contractual terms that are too vague or indefinite are not enforceable.

Rockford does not explain the meaning of \"cost containment.\" Instead, Rockford argues that Express Scripts already, in an unrelated case, admitted that \"cost containment\" is a definite term because in that case Express Scripts argued that the \"goal\" of its decision to end insurance coverage for certain medications was based on its effort to reduce costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Precision Rx Compounding, LLC v.

The SAC states that Express Scripts breached the contract by failing to provide cost containment\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   . SAC \u00b6 83. However, this is at odds with the plain language of the contract. The contract states only that Express Scripts engages in pharmacy benefit management services, including cost containment\n   <em>\n    programs\n   </em>\n   . At this stage of the proceedings, the court must accept all of the well-pleaded allegations of the SAC as true; however, in a contract action, if the language of the contract is plainly inconsistent with the plaintiff's representations, the court may decline to afford the presumption of truth. \"[W]here the allegations of a pleading are inconsistent with the terms of a written contract attached as an exhibit, the terms of the latter, fairly construed, must prevail over the averments differing therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Vendor Fin., Inc. v.

Of course, an unenforceable provision in a contract cannot be made enforceable by the application of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The Int'l Amateur Athletic Fed'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119528\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/580/\">\n     244 F.3d 580\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 599 n.10 (7th Cir. 2001). But even beyond the RICO counts, the court does not assume any responsibility to wade through hundreds of paragraphs of pleadings comprising fifteen counts plus a request for injunctive to cull out paragraphs or fragments of paragraphs in an effort to assist plaintiffs in plausibly alleging their causes of action. This court has dismissed cases in certain circumstances on this basis, though the court declines to do so today.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stanard v. Nygren\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836737\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/792/#p800\">\n     658 F.3d 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 800 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"A federal court is not obligated to sift through a complaint to extract some merit when the attorney who drafted it has failed to do so himself.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    In \u00b6 203 of the SAC, plaintiffs also allege that defendants' acts \"violate the common law against negligent misrepresentation\" in addition to fraud. \"Negligent misrepresentation\" is a separate cause of action from fraud in both Illinois and Tennessee. However, neither party addresses this claim in their briefs. Thus, the court concludes that neither plaintiff is pursuing a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    As to Acument, the SAC suggests that Acument has \"contracts\" with CVS that provide for cost containment, SAC \u00b6 209, that presumably support their contention that defendants made false representations that amount to fraud. Although it is unclear whether Acument is holding Express Scripts, Mallinckrodt, or perhaps a non-defendant, CVS, responsible for making the false representations. Plaintiffs have not provided any of these contracts and thus the court is unable to make any determination as to whether plaintiffs' allegations satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have not adequately pled reliance. Plaintiffs allege that they and the class \"justifiably relied upon false misrepresentations in purchasing and/or reimbursing Acthar at the amount charged by Express Scripts and CVS Caremark based on the price set by Mallinckrodt.\" SAC \u00b6 208. But in this factual scenario that concerns only one manufacturer and one drug, the issue of the reasonableness of plaintiffs' reliance is problematic. Plaintiffs assert that they would not have paid or reimbursed the cost of Acthar if they were aware of the alleged misrepresentations.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 210. Are plaintiffs saying that rather than pay exorbitant prices they would have left the Acthar patients without treatment? Regardless, at this juncture the court concludes that reliance is sufficiently pled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
