The document ordered Mr. Quijada-Gomez to appear before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") in Tacoma, Washington, on \"a date to be set\" and at \"a time to be set.\" On June 17, 2010, Mr. Quijada-Gomez filed a notice\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the immigration court requesting an opportunity for voluntary departure or, alternatively, an expedited removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 16, 2010, Mr. Quijada-Gomez appeared before an IJ at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, for his removal proceedings. At the hearing, the IJ informed Mr. Quijada-Gomez that she could not grant him voluntary departure because he had received it once before in 2008. The IJ found Mr. Quijada-Gomez had no other relief available to him and ordered that he be removed from the United States to Mexico.

Thus, he argues, the immigration court was never vested with jurisdiction.

This Court disagrees, and holds it is bound by\n   <em>\n    Pereira.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   took care to describe the contours of its holding. It noted that the question presented by the petitioner swept in all the requirements listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), but that the notice to appear included all of the information required except for the time requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i).\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/#p2116\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Supreme Court expressly reserved for another day the determination of whether a putative Notice to Appear that omits other information listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) may nonetheless satisfy the statutory requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , n.5. Having thus narrowed the scope of the question presented to only the time and place requirement, the Court held that a \"document that fails to include such information is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a) ', and thus does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 2118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding is narrow in that it only addresses date and time information, it operates as a firm and clear syllogism. The first clause (\"A putative ... 1229(a)' \") interprets \u00a7 1229(a), and the second clause (\"and thus ... stop-time rule\") constructs \u00a7 1229(b)(d)(1). While the construction of the stop-time rule does not apply to this case, the interpretation of the definiton of a Notice to Appear does, and is binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MK Hillside Partners v.

The Government argues that the Supreme Court would not have remanded the matter to the immigration\n   court unless it impliedly held that the immigration court had jurisdiction. The Supreme Court did not reach the issue of jurisdiction because neither party raised it.

Those requirements presume the existence of some proceeding through which the defendant could have raised the basis for the challenge. Just as that collateral attack limitation\n   would not bar a defendant from pointing out that what the prosecutor alleges is a prior deportation order is in fact a blank piece of paper, it does not bar a challenge to an immigration court's jurisdiction that would give the deportation order the same legal effect.
