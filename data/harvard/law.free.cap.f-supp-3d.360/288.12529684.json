The government's supplemental brief is docketed at ECF 41. It adheres to its position that the State lacks standing. Moreover, it points out that HHS, the agency charged with enforcing the ACA, \"has expressed its commitment to continue to enforce the ACA until there is a final decision or other judicial order directing otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527934\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/340/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Several amici curiae also filed memoranda.

It maintains that \"the stay issued by Judge O'Connor confirms that the State of Maryland has neither standing nor a cause of action to sue on the basis that the State will be harmed by Defendants' alleged non-enforcement of the ACA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Conversely, the State claims in its memorandum (ECF 51) that the stay in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case\"does not eliminate Maryland's standing to pursue its claims regarding the continuing validity of the [ACA].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I shall grant the State's Motion for Leave (ECF 29).

Alternatively, the government has moved to dismiss the State's Declaratory Judgment Act claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that \"the State has failed to identify a cause of action for this suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, the State maintains that, based on the allegations of the Amended Complaint, it has standing to bring suit. However, if the Court deems the allegations presented in the Amended Complaint deficient, Maryland seeks leave to file the Second Amended Complaint. ECF 29; ECF 29-3.

Of relevance here, \"as part of a larger revision of federal income tax laws,\" Congress amended the tax code by reducing to zero the shared responsibility payment of the ACA, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(b), \"for individuals failing to demonstrate health insurance coverage, which is based on a percentage of the taxpayer's household income.\" ECF 29-3, \u00b6 8. Notably, the TCJA \"did not repeal any provision of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, it \"reduced the shared responsibility percentage from '2.5%' to 'zero percent,' and the applicable dollar amount from '$ 695' to '$ 0.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Pub.

Whereas the executive agencies are responsible for enforcing the law and can therefore be expected to bring enforcement actions, they are categorically prohibited from flouting the law.

Additionally, in response to an emergency request for a ruling to compel the Trump Administration to continue making the payments, another court in the Northern District of California concluded that \"although it's a close question, it appears initially that the Trump Administration has the stronger legal argument.\"\n   <em>\n    California v.

Even if the Trump Administration improperly used that litigation as a ploy to terminate CSR payments, it would seem unlikely that it could use the same maneuver in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case. There, several states have intervened as defendants to uphold the constitutionality of the Individual Mandate and the ACA, and it is unlikely that the Trump Administration could settle the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case without the agreement of the intervening defendant states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The State also inflates the significance of the Sessions Letter informing Congress that DOJ would not defend the ACA in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case. Maryland focuses on the omission from the letter of any representation by Sessions that he would continue to enforce the provisions that DOJ views as unconstitutional or inseverable. ECF 29-3, \u00b6 10. In plaintiff's view, this omission supports an \"inference that Defendants will refuse to enforce the statute regardless of any court order.\" ECF 27 at 11. However, the Trump Administration's decision not to defend parts of the ACA in court is not the same as failing to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   it.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 530D(a)(1)(B)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 530D(a)(1)(i).

As the State notes in the proposed Second Amended Complain, \"at oral argument [in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case ] on September 5, 2018,\n   <em>\n    DOJ professed that 'the current administration supports protections for people with pre-existing health conditions,' \"\n   </em>\n   but DOJ then \"reaffirm[ed] its position that the minimum coverage requirement will be unconstitutional and that the community rating and guaranteed issue provisions-including pre-existing condition\n   protections-'must fall' as well.\" ECF 29-3, \u00b6 10 (emphasis added). During that same hearing, which predates the commencement of this case, the government also stated that a court ruling during the ACA's open enrollment period for health insurance would threaten to destabilize the insurance markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:18-cv-00167-O, No. ECF 228. As a consequence, it specifically asked the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   court to defer ruling until after the end of the enrollment period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266481\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/1119/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That conduct is inconsistent with a claim of imminent failure to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Indeed, even after the entry of judgment in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , the government did not terminate enforcement of the ACA. In a press release issued by HHS on December 17, 2018, concerning the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case, HHS said:\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   The recent U.S. District Court decision regarding the Affordable Care Act is not an injunction that halts the enforcement of the law and not a final judgment. Therefore, HHS will continue administering and enforcing all aspects of the ACA as it had before the court issued its decision. This decision does not require that HHS make any changes to any of the ACA programs it administers or its enforcement of any portion of the ACA at this time. As always, the Trump Administration stands ready to work with Congress on policy solutions that will deliver more insurance choices, better healthcare, and lower costs while continuing to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   It is also noteworthy that the government did not oppose a stay of the judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   Case, \"pending appeal, given the potential for disruption to the healthcare markets if immediate implementation were required.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:18-cv-00167-O, ECF 216, at 15-16. And, with the judgment now stayed pending the appeal in the Fifth Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:18-cv-00167-O, ECF 223 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 31, 2018), the prospect of the government suddenly ceasing to enforce the ACA is further diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In sum, the State points to the President's rhetoric, his legislative agenda, his regulatory agenda, and his litigation positions to demonstrate that he might possibly terminate enforcement of the ACA. But, its claim consists of little more than supposition and conjecture about President Trump's possible actions. In effect, the State proclaims that the sky is falling. But, falling acorns, even several of them, do not amount to a falling sky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Moreover, the State has not pointed to any actual threat by the President to terminate enforcement of the ACA.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Jeff Mason &amp; Richard Cowan,\n   <em>\n    Trump Threatens To Use Emergency Power To Build Wall. End Shutdown\n   </em>\n   , REUTERS (Jan. 10, 2019) (\" 'I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'I'm not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to, I will.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The State's suit is tantamount to a request for an advisory opinion to thwart the possibility of the President deciding not to enforce the Act. Yet, \"it is quite clear that the oldest and most consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability is that the federal courts will not give advisory opinions.\"\n   <em>\n    Flast v.
