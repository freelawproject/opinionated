(\"Morris &amp; Dickson\") is a full-line pharmaceutical wholesaler, part of whose business consists of distributing controlled substances. [Record Document 1 at 6]. Concerned that Morris &amp; Dickson had an insufficient program in place to prevent diversion of hydrocodone and oxycodone, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began proceedings to revoke Morris &amp; Dickson's authorization to distribute controlled substances. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Morris &amp; Dickson filed the instant action, seeking to enjoin further proceedings before the DEA's Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") on the grounds that he was unconstitutionally appointed and is unconstitutionally shielded from removal at will. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16]. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Morris &amp; Dickson's challenge to the ongoing administrative adjudication, this case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Morris &amp; Dickson holds two DEA registrations that allow it to distribute controlled substances. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5]. On May 2, 2018, the Acting Administrator of the DEA began the process of revoking these registrations by issuing an Order to Show Cause and an Immediate Suspension of Registration (\"ISO\"), which asserted that Morris &amp; Dickson maintained an inadequate anti-diversion program. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. In response, Morris &amp; Dickson filed suit to enjoin enforcement of the ISO. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Following a hearing before the undersigned, this Court temporarily restrained enforcement of the ISO, but allowed the revocation proceeding to go forward. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9]. Before a hearing could be held on the motion for a preliminary injunction against the ISO, the DEA rescinded that order. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].

In order to prevent the hearing from going forward, Morris &amp; Dickson filed this suit, which seeks an injunction and a declaratory judgment that further proceedings before Judge Dorman would violate the Constitution.

If they are, then they must be appointed by one of the three authorities listed in the Appointments Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/#p2051\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Record Document 1 at 14]. Morris &amp; Dickson contends the DEA is not an executive department for purposes of the Appointments Clause because the DEA resides within the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15]. If that is true, then the department head with the appointing power is the Attorney General, not the DEA Administrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20503\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Morris &amp; Dickson argues that this double layer of for-cause protection unconstitutionally interferes with the President's obligation to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. [Record Document 1 at 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After reviewing Morris &amp; Dickson's complaint, this Court ordered briefing on the question of jurisdiction. [Record Document 15]. Two days later, Judge Dorman cancelled the show-cause hearing, thereby mooting Morris &amp; Dickson's request for an interim order enjoining it. [Record Documents 22 at 3 and 23 at 1]. After this Court set a schedule for ruling on jurisdiction and, if necessary, on the merits, Judge Dorman stayed the enforcement proceeding pending this Court's resolution of Morris &amp; Dickson's constitutional case. [Record Documents 27, 28, and 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants Matthew G. Whitaker (the Acting Attorney General), Uttam Dhillon (the Acting Administrator of the DEA), the DEA, the DOJ, and the United States (collectively, \"Defendants\") argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction and that Morris &amp; Dickson's claims are unripe. [Record Document 24 at 7-19]. They believe that Supreme Court precedent requires Morris &amp; Dickson to complete the administrative process and obtain a final order from the DEA Administrator before pursuing its constitutional claims in an appeals court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-14]. Morris &amp; Dickson contends that this Court has jurisdiction to enjoin unconstitutional administrative proceedings at any time and that, if this Court declines to exercise jurisdiction, Morris &amp; Dickson will face the irreparable harm of forced participation in such a proceeding.

In Morris &amp; Dickson's view,\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that district courts have jurisdiction over any separation-of-powers challenge to agency structure. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10]. Although the\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund\n   </em>\n   Court did conclude that jurisdiction existed for a pre-enforcement challenge to agency structure, it did not state that jurisdiction existed simply because the petitioners raised separation-of-powers arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    561 U.S. at 489-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund\n   </em>\n   , an enforcement proceeding against the accounting firm had not begun, and there was no guarantee that the PCAOB's investigation would lead to a reviewable SEC order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    at 487, 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, here it is certain that the proceeding before Judge Dorman will lead to a recommendation that the\n   DEA Administrator will accept or modify when making his order; this order will be reviewable in the D.C. Circuit or the Fifth Circuit. Morris &amp; Dickson need only wait for this review to occur. As the Fourth Circuit held when distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund\n   </em>\n   , one who is \"already embroiled in an enforcement proceeding\" faces no\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   risk by waiting to have a constitutional claim adjudicated at the end of the agency proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175167\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/174/#p182\">\n    844 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, assuming that the administrative process does not terminate in Morris &amp; Dickson's favor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the company will receive Article III review of its constitutional claims. Because the DEA began the revocation process in response to Morris &amp; Dickson's past conduct, continued participation in the enforcement proceeding results from risks that the company assumed before the proceeding started; Morris &amp; Dickson need assume no new risks in order to guarantee judicial review. This Court thus rejects Morris &amp; Dickson's overly broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When interpreting the provision of the Securities Exchange Act that is analogous to \u00a7 877 of the CSA, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits have held that meaningful review of separation-of-powers challenges can be had in an appeals court following agency adjudication.\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175167\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/174/#p182\">\n    844 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   186 ;\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323427\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1236/#p1244\">\n    825 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1250 ;\n   <em>\n    Tilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322357\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/276/#p282\">\n    824 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   286 ;\n   <em>\n    Bebo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340948\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/765/#p767\">\n    799 F.3d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such review in this case might not restore resources spent defending against the enforcement action. But no authority holds that that expenditures of time and money suffice to make post-agency review unmeaningful. Morris &amp; Dickson's separation-of-powers challenges will have their day in court without the need for Morris &amp; Dickson to do anything other than participate in the show-cause hearing before Judge Dorman.
