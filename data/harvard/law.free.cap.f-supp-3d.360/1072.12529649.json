Plaintiff is a Fortune 500 company that owns and operates several properties as casinos and maintains websites on which it markets its hotel and casino services and enables customers to book hotel reservations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (\"Mot. for PI\") 3:5-19, ECF No. 5). Plaintiff owns a series of trademark applications and registrations for its Sands and Venetian trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:20-4:8). One of the Sands marks, over which Plaintiff asserts exclusive, common law trademark rights, depicts two Chinese language characters known as a \"Jinsha\" in connection with its casino and entertainment services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:9-4:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Defendants have \"set up a network of Internet websites that are accessible to U.S. citizens and are designed to drive Internet users to one or more online casinos unlawfully using\" Plaintiff's marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:22-24). Defendants have further allegedly registered domains (the \"Infringing Domains\") for unlawful use of Plaintiff's Sands mark \"to falsely affiliate the casinos with [Plaintiff] and confuse customers into believing that the websites are\" operated or endorsed by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:25-5:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 governs preliminary injunctions.

With respect to the \"VENETIAN\" mark, Plaintiff does not advance any reasoning for its conclusion that the mark is suggestive.

First, Plaintiff states the infringement impacts Plaintiff's goodwill and reputation because Plaintiff opposes legalized Internet gambling and has received complaints from customers who have used similar websites only to be \"duped into paying money or gambling on these websites.\" (Mot. for PI 10:16-25). Second, Plaintiff asserts that because Defendants have no domestic presence, it may be impossible to recover monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11:17-12:2). Third, Plaintiff contends that the potential for Defendants transferring the domains to\n   another registrant during the pendency of this case constitutes a credible risk of irreparable harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12:3-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the Court's order on Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, the Court recognized these are sufficient grounds to support a finding of irreparable harm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 9:19-10:8, ECF No. 7). At the hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Court noted that one of Plaintiff's arguments to establish irreparable harm-consumer confusion and the corresponding damage to reputation-apparently conflated the likelihood-of-success inquiry with the irreparable-harm question. (Mins. of Proceedings, ECF No. 11). The Court requested a supplemental brief discussing the standard in light of the Ninth Circuit's pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed\n   </em>\n   , where the Court affirmed that a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, standing alone, is insufficient to establish irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed Enters., LLC v.

Br. 1:22-25, ECF No. 13). Plaintiff contends that the relevant inquiry is whether irreparable harm will arise \"if the Court does not order the registrar to maintain the lock on the domain names.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1:26-28). Therefore, according to Plaintiff, irreparable harm may be shown based upon Plaintiff's inability to \"recover a monetary judgment against a foreign defendant with no presence in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:14-15). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In cases that postdate\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed\n   </em>\n   , Courts in this District have concluded irreparable harm may be demonstrated, in part, where a defendant \"has no presence in the United States,\" making it \"difficult or impossible ... to recover a money judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Omix-ADA, Inc. v.

Additionally, where, as here, the evidence suggests that a defendant is using the plaintiff's actual trademark-as opposed to a similar mark-the plaintiff's loss of control over its business reputation supports a finding of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2Die4Kourt v.

Defendants in this matter are believed to be Chinese residents whose identities are unknown because they registered the Infringing Domains through a privacy service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McCue Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, Ex. 3 to Mot. for PI, ECF No. 5-3). The potential for Plaintiff's inability to recover based upon this fact, the risk that Defendants may transfer the domains to registrars outside this Court's jurisdiction, and Defendants' unwillingness to participate in this case all counsel in favor of a finding of irreparable harm. Additionally, as noted above, the Court agrees that loss of goodwill and control over Plaintiff's reputation can reasonably be inferred because of the distinct similarities between the marks and their use in a manner contrary to Plaintiff's public stance against online gaming.

The Court agrees that the scope of the relief Plaintiff seeks respects an equitable balance by temporarily locking Defendants' domain names. Additionally, as discussed above, Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction due its loss of control over its goodwill and reputation and the credible risk that monetary damages may be unavailable absent an injunction. Finally, because the Court is satisfied that the similarity of the marks gives rise to an inference of intent, the Court concludes that the equities weigh in favor of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
