(\"TowerBrook\"), Paula Bennett, David Biese, Michael Rahamim, Andrew Rolfe, Travis Nelson, Marka Hansen, Michael Eck, and Michael Recht. Doc. No. 44. The other was filed by the \"Underwriter Defendants\": Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC, and Jefferies LLC. Doc. No. 46.

No. 40 \u00b6 16. In May 2015, TowerBrook purchased J.Jill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. In February 2017, J.Jill filed a Registration Statement and Prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") in preparation for its upcoming initial public offering (\"IPO\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. J.Jill held its IPO on March 9, 2017,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, selling approximately 12.5 million shares at $ 13 per share,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the end of May 2017, \"J.Jill announced its financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2017,\" reporting that \"total net sales had increased by 12.5% to $ 166.1 million, while its total comparable store sales had increased by approximately 9.9%, and the Company's gross margin had increased to 69.6% for the quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. However, J.Jill \"provided surprisingly conservative guidance for the remainder of the year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It predicted \"total comparable store sales to increase in the high single digits for the year, which implied a deceleration in the Company's sales growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Its report indicated that J.Jill's \"growth margin rate was expected to decline for the remainder of the year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On an earnings conference call held the same day to discuss the reported results, a UBS analyst \"expressed 'puzzlement' at the new expectations for the remainder of the year provided by the Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The analyst said, \"it kind of leaves the back half of the year part of the puzzle lower than what we spoke to - lower than what you spoke to when you gave us the components during the IPO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, J.Jill's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), David Biese, \"admitted that 'the math isn't perfect' and stated that nothing had changed from the conditions impacting the Company's growth and prospects at the time of the IPO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He said, \"I would tell you that we don't feel differently about the back half of the year ...

Similarly, analysts on the call \"expressed concern about the additional store closures, which would bring the total store closures to seven or eight for the year compared to just one in fiscal year 2016, and the ability of the Company to service its sizeable debt given the slowdown in profit growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff asserts that on the call, J.Jill's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), Paula Bennett, \"admitted that the Company's already disappointing margin guidance for the quarter had been 'too optimistic.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On \"October 11, 2017, J.Jill issued a press release updating its guidance for the third quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. In this press release, Bennett stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   We have experienced a lower than expected sales trend across both our retail and direct channels, and are updating our guidance for the quarter.

The plaintiff filed suit on October 13, 2017, at which time J.Jill stock closed at $ 5.11 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The amended complaint, Doc.

No. 40 \u00b6 26. However, the complaint does not identify any statements in either the Registration Statement or Prospectus which the plaintiff asserts were factually untrue. Rather, the complaint asserts that the Registration Statement \"created the misleading impression that the Company's unique business strategy had insulated it from adverse industry trends.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Therefore, the complaint alleges an actionable omission based on the failure to disclose five statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) that J.Jill's purportedly unique and superior sales and marketing approach had not insulated the Company from adverse trends affecting the overall retail industry; (ii) that J.Jill's historic\n   gross margin growth was not sustainable and would not continue, as it relied on revenues from shipping fees, increased promotional efforts and other short-term boosts to revenues; (iii) that the Company was carrying increasing amounts of slow moving inventory and would need to significantly mark down sales items and increase promotional efforts in an attempt to continue its sales growth; (iv) that the Company's brick-and-mortar stores were failing, as they were experiencing difficulty attracting customers and maintaining profitability, which would result in the Company shuttering up to eight stores in fiscal year 2017, with the rate of store closures accelerating; and (v) that J.Jill's business, prospects and ability to service its long-term debt had been materially impaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Using virtually the same language, the complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus violated Items 303 and 503 by failing to disclose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) that the Company's purportedly unique business strategy had not insulated J.Jill from adverse trends affecting the wider industry; (ii) that the Company would in fact have to increase promotions and markdowns to continue the rate of sales growth; and (iii) that J.Jill would have to shutter up to eight times the number of stores closed in fiscal year 2016 in the months following the IPO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the complaint also quotes the earnings conference call held in May 2017 to discuss the results of J.Jill's first fiscal quarter of 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Specifically, the complaint alleges that J.Jill \"provided surprisingly conservative guidance for the remainder of the year ... which implied a deceleration in the Company's sales growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. On the conference call, when an analyst asked about these conservative guidelines, Biese said, \"I would tell you that we don't feel differently about the back half of the year ... I don't see that there is anything different about the second half.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.

Furthermore, the Court also considers the alleged omissions together with Biese's statements, to determine whether, if taken collectively, the complaint alleges an actionable violation of \u00a7 11 or \u00a7 12(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    May 31 Earnings Call\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The complaint alleges that Biese's statements in the May 31 earnings call are indicative of \"circumstances impacting the Company's business and prospects\" which \"existed at the time of the IPO,\" but which \"the Registration Statements did not accurately detail.\" Doc. No. 40 \u00b6 43. In support, the plaintiff points to J.Jill's lower than expected performance, as reported on the August 29 and October 11 earnings calls, including decreasing gross margins, increasing promotional activities, and additional store closures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-47. The plaintiff argues that Biese's statements on the May 31 earnings call support the inference that as of May 31, J.Jill \"had effectively admitted that these problems already existed at the time of the IPO.\" Doc. No. 53 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, the statements offered in the complaint do not reasonably support such an inference. Nor does Biese's full answer,\n   especially when considered in context of the call as a whole. The entire question and answer of the earnings call to which the plaintiff refers in the complaint is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Michael Charles Binetti\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n   </em>\n   : Okay.

No. 57-1 at 14. Nothing here plausibly supports the inference that CFO Biese was stating that the then-existing conditions causing the projection for the second quarter existed at the time of the IPO. Indeed, a few questions earlier, the following telling exchange occurred, providing additional context for Biese's statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Kate Bridget Fitzsimons\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\n   </em>\n   : This is Kate on for Brian.

Nothing about Biese's statements indicate that he is admitting J.Jill knew about existing risks, problems, or uncertainties at the date of the IPO which it failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors about. Indeed, there is nothing about the rest of the earnings call which indicates anyone present on the call understood his statements to indicate what the plaintiff suggests they do. At most, the call suggests what the executives said expressly, that in light of\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   -current adverse general economic conditions, they were providing cautious guidance for the remainder of the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, the complaint alleges no facts which could support the assertion that Biese's statements on the May 31 earnings call gave rise to the inference the plaintiff asks the Court to draw. In reality, the facts suggest the opposite. The day before the earnings call, May 30, 2017, J.Jill's stock price closed at $ 11.27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The day of the earnings call, at which time the plaintiff argues that Biese revealed J.Jill's knowledge of the problems in existence at the time of the IPO, the stock price closed at $ 12.75. As defendants note, J.Jill's \"stock closed above $ 11.27 (the price at which it closed the day prior to the earnings call) every single day until August 10, 2017 (when it closed at $ 11.22).\" Doc. No. 56 at 12. Neither the express statements made in the earnings call nor the facts of which the Court may take judicial notice (nor other non-conclusory allegations) supports the interpretation of the earnings call for which the plaintiff argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The plaintiff points to two more circumstances which it argues augment its claims. First, the plaintiff points to the timing of various events with respect to the date of the IPO. In terms of the May 31 earnings call, which was just under three months after the IPO, the plaintiff argues that the proximity in time between the IPO and the call permit the Court to draw the inference previously discussed. In terms of the August earnings call, which discussed the results of the first full quarter after the IPO, the plaintiff notes that J.Jill reported negative results. The plaintiff argues that the timing of these two calls with respect to the IPO gives rise to the inference that there were known uncertainties which J.Jill failed to disclose at the time of the IPO which negatively affected its performance in the second quarter. In this case, no such inference arises. The IPO occurred two-thirds of the way through the first quarter. The results of that quarter were indisputably positive. Without more (and there is not more), adverse results in the second quarter, which were fully revealed and discussed on the mid-quarter call, support only the inference that these problems arose in the second quarter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition, the plaintiff points to the fact that TowerBrook purchased J.Jill for $ 396 million, Doc. No. 40 \u00b6 18, increased J.Jill's long-term debt to $ 274 million,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, and then reaped the entire benefit of the IPO. These facts, the plaintiff argues, indicate that TowerBrook knew of uncertainties at the time of the IPO which it failed to disclose in either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. However, these facts give rise only to the possibility that TowerBrook may have known of such uncertainties, not to a plausible inference that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the statements do not support the conclusion that defendants made untrue statements or omissions at the time\n   of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and therefore they do not give rise to an actionable \u00a7 11 or \u00a7 12(a)(2) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Alleged Untrue Statements of Material Fact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus \"created the misleading impression that the Company's unique business strategy had insulated it from adverse industry trends and, as a result, J.Jill would be able to continue to grow its gross profits.\" Doc.

Such statements include: \"we believe we will continue to drive profitable growth over time,\" \"[w]e have established a solid foundation to support long-term, sustainable growth,\" \"we believe our customer-focused strategy, foundational investments and data insights have resulted in consistent, profitable growth and industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA margins,\" \"[we have] created significant brand trust and an emotional connection with [our] customers that [we] believe will facilitate sustainable sales growth and market share gains over time,\" and \"[w]e believe we will continue to develop long-term customer relationships that will drive profitable sales growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, \"[a] plaintiff may not plead 'fraud by hindsight'; i.e., a complaint 'may not simply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results' in support of a claim of securities fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Fin.

The plaintiff has identified no particular and material facts relating to the inquiry J.Jill purportedly did not conduct. Nor has the plaintiff identified any particular and material facts relating to the knowledge J.Jill purportedly had which would make the Registration Statement and Prospectus misleading to a reasonable person. Consequently, the statements cited in the complaint are statements of opinion which do not give rise to \u00a7 11 liability.

First, the plaintiff alleges that the Registration Statement fails to disclose \"that J.Jill's purportedly unique and superior sales and marketing approach had not insulated the Company from adverse trends affecting the overall retail industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. However, multiple statements in the 22 page \"Risk Factors\" section of the Registration Statement belie this claim.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Our business is sensitive to economic conditions and consumer spending ... The retail industry is cyclical and consumer purchases of discretionary retail items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other times when disposable income is lower. Factors impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions ... and other macroeconomic factors ... It is difficult to predict when or for how long any of these conditions can affect our business and a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and shifts in fashion and industry trends in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations ...

No. 45-1 at 17, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, plaintiff alleges that the Registration Statement fails to disclose \"that J.Jill's historic gross margin growth was not sustainable and would not continue, as it relied on revenues from shipping fees, increased promotional efforts and other short-term boosts to revenues.\" Doc. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   40 \u00b6 27. Again, the Registration Statement itself demonstrates this is not so.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected, we may have to increase the number of promotional sales or otherwise dispose of inventory for which we have previously paid to manufacture, which could further adversely affect our profitability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [O]ur failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in customer preferences, tastes and trends and economic conditions could lead to, among other things ... markdowns and write-offs ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Competitive pricing pressures with respect to shipping our merchandise to our customers may harm our business and results of operations ... To remain competitive, we may be required to offer discounted, free or other more competitive shipping options ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Doc. No. 45-1 at 17, 22. Additionally, the plaintiff's assertion that J.Jill should have disclosed that its \"historic gross margin growth was not sustainable and would not continue,\" Doc. No. 40 \u00b6 27, is a \"fraud by hindsight\" argument which cannot serve as the basis for liability without more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, the plaintiff alleges J.Jill failed to disclose \"that the Company was carrying increasing amounts of slow moving inventory and would need to significantly mark down sales items and increase promotional efforts in an attempt to continue its sales growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bare conclusory allegations such as the assertion that J.Jill had increasing amounts of slow-moving inventory are not the type of factual allegations the Court need accept as true.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, J.Jill's Registration Statement specifically noted the risks that it would have excess inventory and that it might need to resort to promotional efforts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   We enter into agreements to manufacture and purchase our merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season and our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in customer preferences, tastes and trends and economic conditions could lead to, among other things, missed opportunities, excess inventory or inventory shortages, markdowns and write-offs, all of which could negatively impact our profitability ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Our inability to manage our inventory levels and merchandise mix, including with respect to our omni-channel retail operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations ... Customer demand is difficult to predict and the lead times required for a substantial portion of our merchandise make it challenging to respond quickly to changes ... Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in lower than planned profitability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Reductions in the volume of mall traffic or the closing of shopping malls as a result of changing economic conditions or demographic patterns could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Doc. No. 45-1 at 17, 18, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Fourth, the plaintiff alleges that J.Jill's Registration Statement failed to disclose \"that the Company's brick-and-mortar stores were failing, as they were experiencing difficulty attracting customers and maintaining profitability, which would result in the Company shuttering up to eight stores in fiscal year 2017, with the rate of store closures accelerating.\" Doc. No. 40 \u00b6 27. However, the \"Prospectus Summary\" portion of the Registration Statement specifically says that J.Jill \"plan[ned] to selectively close underperforming stores on an annual basis, including one in 2016.\" Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   No. 45-1 at 5. Additionally, the \"Risk Factors\" section included the following disclosures:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   We lease all of our store locations, our corporate headquarters and our distribution and customer contact center ... If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially harm our business. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate favorable lease terms. Our inability to do so may ... force us to close stores in desirable locations. If we are unable to renew our store leases, we may be forced to close or relocate a store ... Closing a store, even for a brief period of time to permit relocation, would reduce the revenue contribution of that store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open and operate new retail stores on a profitable basis ... There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals ... If our stores fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable revenue, profitability and cash flow levels, we may incur ... significant costs associated with closing those stores ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 21. This purported omission also crosses the line into a \"fraud by hindsight\" analysis. The plaintiff asserts J.Jill should have disclosed that its rate of store closures would accelerate over the next year. Without any facts to support the contention that J.Jill knew\n   <em>\n    at the time\n   </em>\n   of the IPO that this would happen, this claim amounts to nothing more than a \"fraud by hindsight\" argument, especially since J.Jill disclosed its plans to close some stores and the risks that might require it to close more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff alleges that J.Jill should have disclosed that its \"business, prospects and ability to service its long-term debt had been materially impaired.\" Doc. No 40 \u00b6 27. That assertion assumes a fact not pled plausibly in the Complaint; that at the time of the two disclosures J.Jill's ability to service its debt was then materially impaired. The plaintiff provides no facts to support the allegation that J.Jill's \"business, prospects and ability to service its long-term debt\" had in fact \"been materially impaired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There are no facts alleged in the complaint which indicate the plausibility of this assertion, and without more, this type of conclusory statement is insufficient to plausibly plead a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff has not alleged facts which state a plausible claim for relief under \u00a7 11 or \u00a7 12(a)(2) on the basis of material omissions in the Registration Statement or Prospectus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Collective Allegations in Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, the Court considers Biese's statements on the May 31 earnings call collectively with the Registration Statement, Prospectus, and alleged material omissions. Even so, the plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient \"to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Section 15 Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The complaint asserts a claim against the Company Defendants on the\n   basis of \u00a7 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o).

Furthermore, the complaint quotes substantial portions of an earnings call made on May 31, 2017. Doc. No. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The plaintiff quoted select statements from the earnings call in the complaint as evidence of \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 12(a)(2) violations but did not include the full question and answer nor a transcript of the call. Defendants argue that, when considered in context, the statements cited in the complaint do not support the inference the plaintiff suggests they do. Doc. No. 56 at 12. The Company Defendants attached a transcript of the earnings call, Doc. No. 57-1, to their Reply Brief, Doc. No. 56. The plaintiff has not objected to the authenticity of the transcript nor moved to strike it from the record for purposes of the motions to dismiss. Therefore, the Court may properly consider the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and the transcript of the earnings call in resolving the pending motions to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Court takes judicial notice of J.Jill's stock price from May 30 through August 10, 2017.

No. 47 at 5. However, because the plaintiff has not plausibly pled a claim for relief even if it had statutory standing, the Court declines to reach the question of whether the plaintiff has statutory standing under \u00a7 12(a)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The plaintiff seeks leave to amend the complaint, \"[s]hould the Court find [it] to be deficient in any respect,\" citing the language of Rule 15 that leave to amend is to be freely given. Doc. No. 53 at 44 n.94. However, the complaint before the Court on these motions to dismiss is already the plaintiff's second complaint. Additionally, in the seven months the motions have been pending, the plaintiff has not submitted a proposed second amended complaint nor has plaintiff explained how amending the complaint again would address the issues raised by Defendants' motions to dismiss. Therefore, the request for leave to amend is denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
