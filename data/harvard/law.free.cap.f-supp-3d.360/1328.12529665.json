Nevertheless, the terms of the restitution order make clear that compliance with the payment schedule has no bearing on the Government's ability to collect on the unpaid restitution through other means. The restitution provision which is set forth in the criminal Judgment entered against Vico provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Restitution with Imprisonment\n   </em>\n   - It is further ordered that the defendant shall pay restitution with the codefendant (Jharildan Vico) in the amount of $ 1,921,632.21. During the period of incarceration, payment shall be made as follows: (1) if the defendant earns wages in a Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR) job, then the defendant must pay 50% of wages earned toward the financial obligations imposed by this Judgment in a Criminal Case; (2) if the defendant does not work in a UNICOR job, then the defendant must pay a minimum of $ 25.00 per quarter toward the financial obligations imposed in this order. Upon release of incarceration, the defendant shall pay restitution at the rate of 10% of monthly gross earnings, until such time as the court may alter that payment schedule in the interests of justice. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Probation Office and U.S. Attorney's Office shall monitor the payment of restitution and report to the court any material change in the defendant's ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    These payments do not preclude the government from using other assets or income of the defendant to satisfy the restitution obligations\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added). Thus, the restitution provision makes clear that its terms apply only to Vico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Sept. 21, 2010) (explaining that a payment schedule \"does not affect the United States' ability to enforce the restitution judgment, which exists independently of any court-ordered schedule\"). Upon entry of Judgment, the restitution order created a lien in favor of the United States on virtually all of Vico's assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c).

The Government's Complaint alleges that Vico has paid only $ 639.66 toward the restitution obligation, \u00b6 11, so over $ 1.9 million remains to be collected. Consequently, the Government filed this Complaint seeking to foreclose on the lien attached to Vico's Property so it can apply any proceeds that flow from the sale thereof to the unpaid restitution amount. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 9, 2018, Vico filed an Answer to the Complaint. DE 15. The Answer denied that the Property could be foreclosed because, according to Vico, he is in compliance with the payment schedule and\n   thus has not defaulted on his obligation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n    at \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Answer also denied that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction and that venue was proper.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n    at \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That same day, Vico filed the instant Motion to Dismiss (DE 16) along with supporting brief (DE 17). The Motion to Dismiss asserted that the District Court's ability to adjudicate the Government's claim was precluded by a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a plausible claim. Vico also moved for dismissal on the ground that the Government's commencement of this action violates his due process rights because he is entitled to notice and a hearing. Citing to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(i), Vico requested a decision on his motion before trial. In moving for dismissal based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Vico argues that modification of the payment schedule is required before the Government can initiate foreclosure to satisfy the restitution order. According to Vico, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because adjudication of the Government's claim lies exclusively with the District Judge who presided over the underlying criminal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Vico's next argument is that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the Government has not alleged satisfaction of the elements necessary to foreclose on the lien. According to Vico, the elements that must be pleaded are: (1) the date of the lien, (2) notice to the owner, (3) demand for payment and offer of payment schedule, (4) default on payments, (5) default notice and payment demand, and (6) notice of foreclosure based on refusal to cure default. As part of this argument, Vico asserts that foreclosure is improper because the triggering event-default of the restitution obligation-has not occurred. The final argument Vico raises in his Motion to Dismiss is that the Government is using an improper procedural vehicle to its attempt to foreclose on lien. Vico's position is that in bringing this claim, the Government must elect either to proceed under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act or the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and here the Government has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be filed at any time.

The Court can, however, consider the filing a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12(c).

Here, Vico argues that because the Government has brought this claim under Sections 3613 and 3664, and not the FDCPA, the only court with subject matter is the court that sentenced him and implemented the restitution order.

Because Vico is\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the undersigned will consider the merits of this argument as part of the Rule 12(b)(6) discussion set forth below. For these reasons the undersigned recommends that the District Court deny the Motion to Dismiss based on Vico's perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Vico contends that because he is current on his monthly installments, the Government cannot use any other methods to attempt to collect the restitution debt. This argument must be rejected because it is well-settled that an action \"for civil enforcement by the United States for the collection of fines and restitution does not require a showing that the defendant is in default, but rather requires only the entry of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Before addressing this issue, it is helpful to review the precise legal mechanisms at work here. A lien is a security interest, that is, a \"legal right or interest that a creditor has in another's property, lasting [usually] until a debt or duty that it secures is satisfied.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th Ed.) at 1006;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20671.201\">\n    Fla.

Under this statute, no tax lien exists until a specific amount of tax is determined to be due and owing, the computed tax amount is assessed against the taxpayer, a demand for payment of that tax is made, and the taxpayer neglects or refuses to pay the tax. All of these steps must occur before the federal tax lien can come into existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There are material differences between a criminal restitution lien and a federal tax lien. For a criminal restitution lien, the amount of restitution due and owing (i.e. the underlying debt) is computed prior to the criminal judgment being entered, and is incorporated into that judgment. The criminal restitution lien thus arises by operation of law at the time the criminal judgment is entered. No additional notice, demand, or non-payment is required for the criminal restitution lien to take effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Removing the\n   <em>\n    Blakeman/Toll\n   </em>\n   elements that are unique to a federal tax lien leaves the following elements: (1) the date of the restitution order; (2) the amount of the restitution ordered by the sentencing judge; (3) the filing of the lien with the proper authority;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) a statement that the relief the government seeks is foreclosure of the lien on specified property. These elements are consistent with what must be proven to effectuate a foreclosure: the existence of an enforceable security interest of a particular amount against a specific property. The Government's Complaint alleges each of these elements: the date of the restitution order, \u00b6 7; the amount of restitution ordered, \u00b6 7; the fact that the lien was recorded in the Public Records of Palm Beach County, \u00b6 9; and the Government's intent to foreclose the lien on the Property. \u00b6 8.

Vico's argument necessarily fails however, because the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that \"[a]lthough the procedures prescribed are 'exclusive,' the Act does not 'curtail or limit the right of the United States under any other Federal law or any State law ... to collect any fine, penalty, assessment, restitution, or forfeiture arising in a criminal case.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Failure to timely file objections shall constitute a waiver of a party's \"right to challenge on appeal the district court's order based on unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions.\" 11th Cir.

There, the Court again noted, \"Defendants have not clearly stated the elements they believe the Government must allege to state a claim for foreclosure of a criminal restitution lien against real property. Additionally, Defendants have not provided the Court with a single case in which a comparable complaint was dismissed on account of the pleading deficiencies asserted in their Motion. This lack of guidance is significant because in order to adjudicate any Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must first determine the elements necessary for the plaintiff's claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Toll II\n    </em>\n    at 4-5\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Government's Response also cited\n    <em>\n     Johansen v.
