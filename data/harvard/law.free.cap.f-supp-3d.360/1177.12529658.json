The Court held a\n   hearing on September 25, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether Board of County Commissioners of Curry County, New Mexico (\"Curry County\") violated Plaintiff Amanda Sinfuego's First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America rights to freedom of speech, to petition for redress of grievances, and to freedom of association when Sinfuego's employment with Curry County Detention Center (\"Curry Detention\") was terminated after she petitioned Defendant Lance Pyle, the Curry County Detention Manager, about workplace conditions; met with Pyle about collective bargaining and workplace concerns; texted Curry County Detention Officers (\"Curry Officers\") notifying them that Pyle wanted to speak with them individually to prevent collective bargaining; signed the Petition from the Curry Officers to Administrator Tori Sandoval at 1, filed June 27, 2018 (Doc. 125-10)(\"Petition from Curry Officers to Sandoval\"), and reported sexual harassment; (ii) whether Curry County took adverse employment actions against Sinfuego when it terminated her employment, removed her from the Special Operations Response Team (\"S.O.R.T.\"), gave her night shifts and shifts in the women's annex, and interfered with her ability to choose her shifts; (iii) whether the Court should find Curry County liable for violating Sinfuego's First Amendment rights when Curry County had no custom dictating retaliation against union activities; (iv) whether Curry County violated the New Mexico Whistleblower Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -16C-3(A) (\"NMWPA\"), when it terminated Sinfuego after she complained about Pyle attempting to meet individually with Curry Officers seeking to create a union. Regarding Sinfuego's First Amendment claims, the Court concludes that: (i) Sinfuego's activities related to safety at Curry Detention touch matters of public concern, but Sinfuego's actions and statements related to pay, unionizing, shift bids, and sexual harassment do not involve public concerns; (ii) a jury could find that Curry County engaged in adverse employment actions when it terminated Sinfuego and removed her from S.O.R.T. but not that Curry County took adverse employment actions when it interfered with Sinfuego's ability to choose her shift, and assigned her to the night shift and women's annex; (iii) Sinfuego has not demonstrated a genuine question of fact whether Sinfuego's activities motivated Curry County's actions; and (iv) Sinfuego has not established a genuine question of fact whether Curry County terminated Sinfuego's employment, because she engaged in inappropriate sexual conversations and drawings during work hours in violation of the Curry County sexual harassment policy. Sinfuego has also not established a genuine factual question whether Curry County had a practice of retaliating against individuals engaged in union activities. Having resolved all of Sinfuego's federal claims, the Court will dismiss the state law claims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court draws the factual background from the parties' undisputed material facts in the Memorandum Brief in Support of Defendant Curry County's Motion for Summary Judgment, filed June 12, 2018 (Doc. 122)(\"Memo.\"); in the Plaintiff Amanda Sinfuego's Response to \"Defendant Curry County's Motion for Summary Judgment\" and \"Memorandum Brief in Support of Defendant Curry County's Motion for Summary Judgment\" [Doc. 121-122], filed June 27, 2018 (Doc. 125)(\"Response\"); and in the Reply Brief in Support of Defendant Curry County's Motion for Summary Judgment at 2, filed July 13, 2018 (Doc. 127)(\"Reply\").

As to the first prong, Curry County argues that Sinfuego has never identified any \"formal regulation or policy\" of \"retaliation against individuals involved in collective bargaining.\" Memo. at 26.

This report, which contains Curry Detention employees' out-of-court complaints about Curry Detention, is inadmissible hearsay, because Sinfuego seeks to introduce it for the truth of the statements the employees make about Curry Detention's leadership, such as the Sandoval's relationship to Pyle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) ; Response at 21. Sinfuego also speculates as to Morrison's and Farkas' transfers from the main Curry Detention facility,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 22, but she cannot produce more than speculation for the reasons behind their transfers. Even if Curry County transferred Morrison and Farkas because they were \"associated with Mr. Billy,\" Response at 20, such an assertion does not bolster Sinfuego's unrelated contention that Curry County acted against her because she complained about Curry Detention's conditions, and it particularly does not do so when she has no other evidence to support her allegation. Further, Sinfuego cites Sandoval's awareness\n   of the conditions at Curry Detention, and of Borjas' and Benavidez' sexual conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 22. Sinfuego presumably references such evidence to suggest that Curry County's alleged reasons for terminating Sinfuego are pretextual and that other concerns motivated Curry County's actions. \"When an employer disciplines an employee who has engaged in protected activity more harshly than it treats similarly situated employees who commit comparable or more serious offenses, an inference of improper motive may be drawn.\"\n   <em>\n    Cillo v.

These assertions, therefore, do not further Sinfuego's argument.

Sinfuego's reliance on this argument is misplaced, because the argument does not overcome Pyle's lack of involvement in changing Sinfuego's duties and Sandoval's lack of knowledge about Sinfuego's activities. Sinfuego, therefore, has presented no evidence establishing a genuine factual question whether Curry County terminated her for her allegedly protected union activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Third, Sinfuego alleges that Curry County retaliated against her for reporting Hughes' sexual comment. Sinfuego has not demonstrated a genuine issue of fact regarding this question. Sinfuego supports this contention with Billy's speculation whether Curry County retaliated against her for collective bargaining,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 23 (citing Billy Depo.

Comparing Sinfuego's termination to the actions that Curry County took against Borjas and Benavidez, thus, does not show whether Curry County treated Sinfuego differently and that factors other than Sinfuego's sexual conduct motivated Curry County's actions. Sinfuego also has not provided sufficient evidence demonstrating how or whether Curry County reacted to other instances of sexual conduct or crude language, or any evidence linking her statement about Hughes' comments to her termination. Sinfuego looks to her recounting of the events from 2012, and 2013, before her statement about Hughes' sexual comments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 23 (citing Plaintiff Amanda Sinfuego's Answers to \"Defendant Curry County's First Set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production to Plaintiff Amanda Sinfuego\" at 14-15 (dated November 18, 2016), filed June 27, 2018 (Doc. 125-13); her own speculation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 23 (citing Sinfuego Depo.

To support her arguments, Sinfuego relies on the Spear Notes for the truth of employees' statements about sexual conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 27.

At the Sinfuego Deposition, Sinfuego admitted that she does know personally that a \"female officer was caught performing fellatio on another officer,\" Response at 27; rather, Sinfuego heard about the event through coworkers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sinfuego Depo.

Accordingly, the Court is unconvinced that Sinfuego, through these assertions, has established a genuine issue of fact whether Curry County would have terminated Sinfuego's employment absent a desire to retaliate against her for union-related activities.

If Sinfuego had established a genuine factual question regarding this fact, she would then need to demonstrate that there exists a genuine factual question whether Curry County had a municipal custom or policy of retaliation. To establish an informal policy or custom, the plaintiff must show that the conduct was \"widespread\" -- i.e., that it involved a \"series of decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    City of St. Louis v.

These assertions do not demonstrate a genuine factual question whether Curry County had a policy encouraging retaliation. In arguing about the reputation and vengefulness of Curry Detention's leaders, Sinfuego relies on the truth of the employees' statements in the Spear Notes.

Sinfuego's contentions regarding the two other Curry officers, Morrison and Farkas, are conclusory at best, as she only can guess to Sandoval's motivation in assigning them to different positions. That Billy's refusal to discipline Sinfuego motivated Curry County to terminate his employment is not sufficient, on its own, to establish that there was a widespread practice of endorsing retaliation. Billy's employment status, plus Sinfuego's employment termination, is not sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Curry County has a policy that rises to the level of \"persistent and widespread,\" which the Tenth Circuit has mandated\n   for plaintiffs to establish a customary practice of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Lankford v.
