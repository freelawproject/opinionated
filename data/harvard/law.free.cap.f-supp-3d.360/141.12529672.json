Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This memorandum deals with an offense that the federal courts are increasingly addressing by criminal prosecutions: illegal reentry into the United States. Elton Hittman Abrams is charged with illegally reentering the United States following his removal in 1999. He moves to dismiss the indictment, contending that his Maryland criminal conviction for maintaining a common nuisance, \"to wit: cocaine,\" was an improper basis for removal because it was not an aggravated felony or relating to a controlled substance. The government contends that the immigration judge correctly concluded that the conviction was an appropriate basis for removal. Though the offense was not an aggravated felony, the removal order is a valid basis for the present prosecution because the offense relates to a controlled substance-cocaine. Defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Kurland contended that the offense of common nuisance was not sufficiently relating to a controlled substance and was not within the definition of an aggravated felony. Reply Mem. L.

At a hearing in January 1999, however, he conceded that the underlying offense was an aggravated felony and relating to a controlled substance. Tr. Removal Proceedings 9; Reply Mem. L.

Several months later, however, Defendant received a notice from INS requiring him to present himself for removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. He contacted Kurland, who told Abrams that he had not filed an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.
