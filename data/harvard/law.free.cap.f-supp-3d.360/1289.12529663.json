Alternatively, Best Rate argues, if the Court determines that gateway questions of arbitrability are for the Court to decide instead of the arbitrator, then the Court should hold that arbitration is required pursuant to the agreement between Best Rate and Plaintiff. In response, Plaintiff argues that the agreement is not enforceable and that, even if it were, his claim falls outside the scope of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its motion, Lending Tree argues that it can also enforce Best Rate's and Plaintiff's agreement and compel arbitration because it is an intended third-party beneficiary. Alternatively, Lending Tree argues, Plaintiff should be estopped from avoiding arbitration with Lending Tree because Plaintiff's claim against Lending Tree is combined with his claim against Best Rate. Plaintiff disagrees with both contentions. The Court, having considered the motions and being fully advised in the premises, will grant the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

First, Best Rate reproduces a portion of the Arbitration Provision itself, stating: \"Should a dispute arise\n   <em>\n    concerning the... terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same\n   </em>\n   by any party hereto... the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the [AAA].\" Doc. 18 at pp. 5-6 (bold emphasis deleted, italic emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rather than support Best Rate's argument, however, careful reading of the Arbitration Provision, as reproduced by Best Rate, requires the conclusion that the Arbitration Provision is narrow. The Arbitration Provision applies to a specific part of the Agreement-the terms and conditions-not the entirety of the Agreement. Unlike the broad arbitration provisions discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Arbitration Provision here does not provide sweeping language, for example, that the parties are subject to arbitration based on any dispute or controversy \"arising with respect to this agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    Contec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9028221\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/205/#p208\">\n    398 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or \"arising under or related to this agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    New Avex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201998193\">\n    2002 WL 1998193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, Best Rate's reproduction of the Arbitration Provision omits additional limiting language. Read more fully, the Arbitration Provision provides that the parties agree to submit their claims for arbitration \"[s]hould a dispute arise\n   <em>\n    concerning the Site Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same\n   </em>\n   by any party hereto.\" Doc. 18-1 at p. 14 (bold emphasis deleted, italic emphasis added). Read in context, the Arbitration Provision limits arbitration to disputes concerning a list of specific items-the Site Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement, or the breach of same-lending further weight to the conclusion that the Arbitration Provision is narrow rather than broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further review of the Arbitration Provision also supports the conclusion that it is narrow rather than broad. In the same paragraph, the Arbitration Provision states: \"Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.\" Doc. 18-1 at p. 15. Accordingly, the Arbitration Provision, \"taken as a whole,\" does not evidence \"the parties' intent to have arbitration serve as the primary recourse for disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Arshad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20442\">\n    183 F.Supp.3d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Arbitration Provision specifically authorizes the parties to utilize other avenues of adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The other sentence in the Agreement that Best Rate points to in support of its contention that the Arbitration Provision is broad and presents a valid delegation clause is located on the first page of the Agreement and is set apart from the Arbitration Provision. It states: \"The Agreement contains...the requirement to arbitrate any and all claims that may arise hereunder.\" Doc. 18-1 at p. 7 (emphasis deleted). Indeed, this sentence (the \"introductory sentence\") is more like the broad arbitration provisions found in\n   <em>\n    Contec\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New Avex.\n   </em>\n   But the introductory sentence is also set apart from the Arbitration Provision by more than twenty paragraphs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-1 at pp. 7-16. Rather than set forth any specific rules regarding arbitration, the introductory sentence merely foreshadows the Agreement's contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even if the introductory sentence was relevant, however, its consideration would not change the finding here that the Agreement does not contain a valid delegation clause. The Second Circuit previously had the opportunity to analyze the effect of two inconsistent arbitration provisions in one agreement.\n   <em>\n    Katz v. Feinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432468\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/95/#p97\">\n    290 F.3d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (2d Cir. 2002). In\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that the presence of two arbitration provisions in the same agreement, one provision broad and the other narrow, created an ambiguity, therefore precluding a determination that the parties had clearly and unmistakably delegated arbitrability to the arbitrator.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432468\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/95/#p97\">\n    290 F.3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [W]e cannot conclude that in this case where a single agreement contains both a broadly worded arbitration clause and a specific clause... that the parties' intention to arbitrate questions of arbitrability under the broad clause remains clear.

Applying the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   , the Court could conclude only that the\n   Agreement is ambiguous with respect to arbitration and, therefore, that there is not evidence of the parties' clear and unmistakable intent to designate the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the Arbitration Provision is narrow, or, alternatively, because it is ambiguous, there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    First Options\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p943\">\n    514 U.S. at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p943\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432468\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/95/#p97\">\n    290 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   97 ;\n   <em>\n    Zachariou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954976\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/68/539/\">\n    68 A.D. 3d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954976\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/68/539/\">\n    891 N.Y.S.2d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, some of the content in the arbitration provision in\n   <em>\n    Concepcion\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff points to as being \"consumer-friendly\"-for example AT&amp;T's payment to consumers if they obtain an arbitration award greater than AT&amp;T's last settlement offer-are similar to the content of the Arbitration Provision here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-1 at p. 15 (allowing consumer to recover attorney's fees and other costs if the arbitrator awarded the consumer more than the amount of Best Rate's final settlement offer). Finally, even if Plaintiff's argument had merit, it does not logically follow that because the Arbitration Provision here is \"less-even\" that it must be substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiff's argument is strained, at best. Plaintiff's Complaint states that he entered his contact information in the fields on the website to \"learn more\" about mortgage products. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 26. Plaintiff received the alleged contact from Defendants as a result of providing his information and assenting to the terms of the Agreement. Indeed, the text on the website above the \"Get a Quote\" button informed Plaintiff that entering his contact information and clicking \"Get a Quote\" would mean he agreed to share his information with lenders and agreed to be contacted by them. Doc. 18-1 at p. 3. Defendants' alleged text messages to Plaintiff were clearly precipitated by Plaintiff's utilization of a contact form on the website, a feature described in the Agreement as part of the \"Contact Services.\" Plaintiff offers no other explanation for why he would receive such contact. The \"Contact Services,\" which are part of the \"Site Offerings,\" are subject to arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    2. Injunctive relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff contends that even if the Court sends this action to arbitration, it should maintain jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim for injunctive relief. In support, Plaintiff points to the part of the Arbitration Provision stating: \"Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.\" Doc. 18-1 at p. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Best Rate argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief because it has not sent any text messages to Plaintiff since becoming aware of the Complaint. Accordingly, Best Rate argues, Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue injunctive relief because there is no real or immediate threat of receiving another text message. But whether Plaintiff has standing to bring or would prevail on a claim for injunctive relief is not before the Court at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Instead, the only issue before the Court is whether, and to what extent, this action should be referred to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Notably, there are no injunction motions pending before the Court in this case. And, although the Arbitration Provision preserves the parties' rights to seek injunctive relief, it does not specify\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   a party may seek injunctive relief. That is, the Arbitration Provision does not specify that a party has a right to seek injunctive relief from a court. And, the Commercial Arbitration rules of the AAA, referenced in the Arbitration Provision, specifically empower the arbitrator to \"take whatever interim measure he or she deems necessary, including injunctive relief.\" Am. Arbitration Ass'n, Commercial Arbitration Rules, at p. 24 (2013), https://adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web.pdf. Thus, there is no basis for the Court to decide that it is better suited to adjudicate a claim for injunctive relief than the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Given the lack of any pending motions for injunctive relief before the Court, that Plaintiff's claim fits within the scope of arbitration, and the federal presumption in favor of arbitrability, the Court finds it appropriate for the arbitrator to determine the imposition of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Non-Signatory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Lending Tree also seeks to compel arbitration. Lending Tree argues it has authority to do so, despite not being a signatory to the Agreement, for two reasons. First, Lending Tree argues, it may enforce the Arbitration Provision because it is a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement. Second, Lending Tree argues, it may enforce the Arbitration Provision under an estoppel theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Lending Tree cites to a number of cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in support of its first argument that it is a third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce the Agreement. However, on this particular point, the cases Lending Tree cites are inapposite. That is because those cases: (1) discuss general contract rules outside the context of arbitration, (2) analyze the FAA in combination with additional rules and regulations not relevant here, (3) deal with the question of whether\n   <em>\n    signatories\n   </em>\n   to an arbitration provision may compel\n   <em>\n    non-signatories\n   </em>\n   to arbitrate, rather than whether\n   <em>\n    non-signatories\n   </em>\n   may compel\n   <em>\n    signatories\n   </em>\n   , and/or (4) analyze the issue under an estoppel theory (relevant to Lending Tree's second argument), rather than a beneficiary theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Vleet v.

The terms \"lenders\" and \"partners\" were underlined, containing hyperlinks. Doc. 18-1 at p. 4. Those hyperlinks, when clicked, led the user to a list of names which included Lending Tree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 31 at p. 5 (alleging that Lending Tree was identified as a lender); Doc. 26-2 at p. 6 (showing a list of lenders, including Lending Tree).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This conclusion that Plaintiff should be estopped from avoiding arbitration with Lending Tree comports with the general principle of estoppel theory, in the context of compelling arbitration, as articulated by the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   In each case [employing the estoppel theory], the promise to arbitrate by [signatory 1], the entity opposing arbitration, was reasonably seen on the basis of the relationships among the parties as extending not only to [signatory 2], its contractual counterparty, but also to [the non-signatory], an entity that was, or would predictably become, with [signatory 1's] knowledge and consent, affiliated or associated with [signatory 2] in such a manner as to make it unfair to allow [signatory 1] to avoid its commitment to arbitrate on the ground that [the non-signatory] was not the very entity with which [signatory 1] had a contract. The estoppel did not flow merely from [signatory 1's] agreement to arbitrate with someone [signatory 2] in disputes relating to the agreement. It flowed rather from the conclusion that the relationships among the parties developed in a manner that made it unfair for [signatory 1] to claim that its agreement to arbitrate ran only to [signatory 2] and not to [the non-signatory].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    Centocor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205082883\">\n    2008 WL 5082883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sokol Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840545\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/354/#p359\">\n    542 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   361 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In short, this is not a case where a non-signatory is a \"complete stranger\" to a contract.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050824\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/137/#p143\">\n    547 F.3d at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the entire reason for the Contact Services-and the Agreement's-existence was for Best Rate to connect Plaintiff with one or more possible entities within a specified group, potentially including Lending Tree. That is, there would be no Contact Services for Plaintiff to utilize and no Agreement between Plaintiff and Best Rate were it not for Best Rate's relationships with the group of third parties, including Lending Tree.\n   <em>\n    Centocor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205082883\">\n    2008 WL 5082883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Indeed, Plaintiff acknowledges that Best Rate and Lending Tree had a business relationship whereby Best Rate would provide Lending Tree with \"marketing leads\" and \"contact lists.\" Doc. 26 at p. 3; Doc. 1. Plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that he could not know of Lending Tree's affiliation with Best Rate. Thus, the manner in which the parties' relationships have developed would instruct that Plaintiff should be estopped from claiming that the Arbitration Agreement runs only between it and Best Rate.\n   <em>\n    Centocor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205082883\">\n    2008 WL 5082883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As a final matter, the Second Circuit has held in at least one case that a plaintiff who alleges that a signatory and non-signatory acted in concert cannot then claim a lack of the requisite close relationship.\n   <em>\n    Denney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8967885\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/58/#p70\">\n    412 F.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Having alleged...that [the non-signatory defendant and the signatory defendant] acted in concert to defraud plaintiffs... plaintiffs cannot now escape the consequences of those allegations by arguing that [the non-signatory defendant and the signatory defendant] lack the requisite close relationship....\" (internal citation omitted) ). The same reasoning applies to Plaintiff's claim. As discussed above, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges one claim against both Defendants and is based entirely on the notion that Best Rate and Lending Tree acted together to send Plaintiff text messages in violation of the TCPA. To allow Plaintiff to make such allegations but to deny Lending Tree the ability to arbitrate the same dispute along with Plaintiff and Best Rate would run contrary to the purposes of estoppel theory and federal policy favoring arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Best Rate and Lending Tree request that the Court stay this action pending the conclusion of arbitration. Pursuant to \u00a7 3 of the FAA,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court will stay this proceeding pending the arbitration of Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Because the Arbitration Provision does not contain a valid delegation clause under New York law, the Court decides issues of arbitrability. After careful review, the Court holds that the Agreement and Arbitration Provision are enforceable and that Plaintiff's claim fits within the scope of the Arbitration Provision. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim is subject to arbitration. Moreover, given the relationship among the three parties, Plaintiff is also compelled to arbitrate his claim with Lending Tree. Therefore, Best Rate's and Lending Tree's motions will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED that:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   1. Defendant Best Rate's Motion to Compel Arbitration (Doc. 18) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   2. Defendant Lending Tree's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings (Doc. 20) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   3. Plaintiff is compelled to arbitrate his claims against Defendants Best Rate and Lending Tree as asserted herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   4. This action is\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   pending the completion of arbitration. The parties shall file a notice informing the Court that the arbitration has been concluded, or that their dispute has otherwise been resolved, within\n   <strong>\n    FOURTEEN (14) DAYS\n   </strong>\n   of either of such event and immediately dismiss this case, if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   5.
