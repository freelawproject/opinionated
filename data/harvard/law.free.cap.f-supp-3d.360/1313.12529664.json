The Court held a hearing on the Motion to Conditionally Certify on December 21, 2018. Doc. 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the Motion to Conditionally Certify, Plaintiff contends that conditional certification is appropriate and requests that the Court (1) order Defendants to produce information pertaining to each collective member, (2) authorize notice with a form of consent to join to members of the proposed collective, and (3) approve Plaintiff's proposed reminder notice. Doc. 108. Defendants oppose conditional certification, arguing that Plaintiff has not shown they are joint employers, a more stringent standard applies to conditional certification based on the procedural posture of this case, Plaintiff has not met the standard for conditional certification, and even if he has, his proposed notice is insufficient. Doc. 123. The Court, having considered the motion and being fully advised in the premises, will grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Conditionally Certify an FLSA Collective Action and Authorize Notice to Putative Opt-In Plaintiffs and Incorporated Memorandum of Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Class and Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This is a collective action filed pursuant to \u00a7 216(b) of the FLSA by Plaintiff Alfred W. Thomas (\"Thomas\" or \"Plaintiff\") pertaining to the pay of certain \"Helpers\" employed by Defendants Waste Pro USA, Inc. (\"Waste Pro USA\"), and Waste Pro of Florida, Inc. (\"Waste Pro of Florida\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), which alleges willful violations of the FLSA. Doc. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 64, 72. Waste Pro USA is the parent company to various subsidiaries who provide professional solid waste collection and disposal and recycling services in nine states pursuant to various commercial, municipal, subscription or military contracts. Doc. 123-1 \u00b6 2. One of\n   those subsidiaries is Waste Pro of Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the action is brought on behalf of himself and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the National Collective Action Members who have worked for Defendant Waste Pro USA as Helpers, however variously titled, anywhere in the United States, between September 28, 2014 and the date of final judgment in this matter who elect to opt-in to this action and who, at any point during this time, were paid a day rate and also worked at a location that had a policy or practice to either pay a half-day rate or pay non-discretionary bonuses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doc. 111 \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff defines the Proposed FLSA Collective nearly identically in the instant Motion to Conditionally Certify, stating that he and the Opt-In Plaintiffs\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   request the entry of an Order conditionally certifying a[n FLSA] collective of and permitting Court-supervised notice to all Helpers nationwide who work or worked for Defendants ... at any time since September 27, 2014 ... to the present (the \"FLSA Collective Period\") who are or were paid via the day rate method for at least one workweek during the FLSA Collective Period (the \"Proposed FLSA Collective\") and also worked at a location that had a policy or practice to either pay a half-day rate or pay non-discretionary bonuses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doc. 108 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint raises two causes of action: (1) violation of the FLSA by Defendants, jointly and severally, by failing to pay Plaintiff and the National Collective Action Members time and a half overtime premium pay when they work more than forty hours per week, and (2) violation of the FLSA by Waste Pro USA by failing to pay Plaintiff and the National Collective Action Members time and a half overtime premium pay when they work more than forty hours per week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To support these claims, Plaintiff alleges that he worked more than forty hours per week as a \"Helper\" and was paid bi-weekly. Doc. 111 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. Plaintiff's pay was a flat rate for a day's work, and the rate was cut in half or converted to an hourly rate if he worked less than four hours in a day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. When Plaintiff worked overtime hours, his regular rate was calculated by dividing his total pay for the two-week pay period by the total number of hours worked and overtime wages were paid at a half-time rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Thus, during a two-week/ten-day period during which Plaintiff's regular day-rate was $ 100 per day, his regular pay would be $ 1,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. However, in a week when he worked 97.42 hours, Defendants divided his regular pay of $ 1,000 by 97.42, determined his regular rate to be $ 10.26 per hour, and paid him $ 5.13 per hour for the 17.42 hours of overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This calculation appears to be intended to pay Plaintiff for a normal work day of eight hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.112\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires a day rate plan to pay a flat sum for a day's work without regard to the number of hours worked in the day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.112\">\n    \u00b6 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 108 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The remaining factors-whether the plaintiffs were subjected to the same policies and practices, whether the policies and practices were established in the same manner and by the same decision maker, and the degree to which the actions constituted the claimed violations are similar-are more difficult. The parties both submitted evidence regarding the applicability of Waste Pro USA's policies to its subsidiaries, and similarities and dissimilarities between regions and divisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants submitted the declaration of Michael Allen, a Waste Pro USA employee, who stated that each of the subsidiaries \"determines how to staff the various locations including operations management, accounting and marketing personnel, and laborers such as mechanics, drivers and various types of helpers.\" Doc. 123-1 \u00b6 5. Each region contains multiple divisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   According to Banasiak, Waste Pro of Florida consists of five regions: the southeast region, west coast region, northeast\n   region, the central region, and the panhandle. Doc. 123-2 at 14:4-7. Each region is managed by a Regional Vice President, who \"are theoretically the CEOs in the field ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:8-10. Regional Vice Presidents had access to Waste Pro USA documents, such as its employee handbook or training materials, which contain policies that they could adopt or alter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:15-25, 144:4-145:12. For example, Banasiak's region added an extra holiday, provides higher insurance coverage, and increased the allowed vacation time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179:19-181:1. In the whole of Waste Pro USA, there are eight Regional Vice Presidents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:8-10. Ultimately, the Regional Vice Presidents report to the CEO of Defendants, John Jennings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Waste Pro USA has various departments that provide services or resources to its subsidiaries. Waste Pro USA maintains an intranet that provides forms, data, and information to its subsidiaries. Doc. 123-2 at 90:7-15. Waste Pro USA provides human resources support, which provides guidance and support when questions arise at a local level for Waste Pro of Florida. Doc. 123-2 at 58:21-24. Additionally, Waste Pro USA has a safety department responsible for informing subsidiaries of changes in safety, behaviors, habits, and things of that nature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:19-22. It also has a maintenance department \"responsible for changes in equipment [and] service levels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72:15-73:13. Waste Pro USA also maintains an accounting department that handles financial results performance and asset management based on financial information provided by each region.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:12-77:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants submitted a declaration by David Schneider, the Regional Vice President for the Northeast Region of Waste Pro of Florida, who stated that his region has dedicated management, accounting, marketing, operations, and human resources teams who report to him, and who he has complete discretion to replace. Doc. 123-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4. He makes operational and financial decisions, markets their services, decides which contracts to pursue and negotiates the terms, obtains trucks and equipment, prepares budgets, makes staffing decisions, decides compensation, and interfaces with customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Schneider's region does not employ any Helpers who assist on commercial beachfront routes, such as Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The Helpers who are employed in his region have schedules decided based on the terms of municipal and commercial contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He was previously a division manager, and filled and trained for Helper positions within his discretion without use of Waste Pro USA's program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. Additionally, within his region, Helpers are not paid a weekly or bi-weekly safety bonus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Certain divisions pay bonuses for performing extra tasks, but the determination is not based on a uniform policy or practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants also submitted the declaration of Ralph Mills, the Regional Vice President for the Coastal Region of Waste Pro of Florida, where Plaintiff works. Doc. 123-4. He stated that as Regional Vice President, his is responsible for all aspects of the operations and finances for all divisions in his region, which includes landfill, transfer stations, and hauling divisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. His responsibilities include bidding on and negotiating contracts, staffing and equipping divisions, budgeting, and performing solid waste collection and disposal and recycling services in a professional manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The types of Helpers hired differs by division according to the terms of the municipal and commercial contracts within those divisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Helpers within Mills' region receive on-the-job training in lieu of classroom training, and training for commercial Helpers\n   differs from that of residential Helpers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Where commercial Helpers ensure that a Driver can access a dumpster with mechanical forks, a residential helper rides on the back of a truck, jumps down, and lifts and dumps a container into the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Helpers were not paid weekly or bi-weekly safety bonuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Indeed, Mills indicated that many of the employment policy suggestions from Waste Pro USA are not used for Helpers because the suggestions are not useful for that position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants also submitted the declaration of Russell Mackie, the Regional Vice President for the Southeast Region of Waste Pro of Florida. Doc. 123-5. He stated that he personally made all operations and financial decisions, and that he has dedicated management, accounting, marketing, operations, and human resources personnel in the divisions within his region.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Under his leadership, the decisions determine what contracts to pursue, decide how to price bids, decide how to market services, and make personnel and equipment decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Mackie uses Jennings as a sounding board, he stated that he ultimately sets decisions regarding what policies are appropriate for the Southeast Region of Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Within Mackie's region, Waste Pro of Florida employs residential Helpers, workers who help at the transfer station, beachfront commercial Helpers, roll off Helpers, and Helpers in the yard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. These Helpers receive on-the-job training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The number of hours and days, and the shift times are determined in each division depending on the route assigned to a Helper, which decision is made locally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Regarding pay structure, Allen stated that Waste Pro USA's sole role was to ensure payrolls were timely submitted. Doc. 123-1 \u00b6 10. Prior to 2014, local offices employed their own payroll personnel, and even after 2014, the Regional Vice Presidents hired Human Resources Specialists to oversee all human resource functions at a local level, but the subsidiaries remained autonomous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Allen stated that Waste Pro USA does not mandate that the day rate or other form of compensation be used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. However, Banasiak testified that the daily rate pay methodology is used by all regions of Waste Pro USA. Doc. 108-3 at 90:7-15. With respect to bonuses, Allen stated that Waste Pro USA did not mandate that subsidiaries pay non-discretionary weekly or bi-weekly bonuses, nor was it aware of which divisions did or did not do so. Doc. 123-1 \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Banasiak testified that the half day rate was a compensation for work that was less than a daily task, and he had heard the term in multiple regions within Florida. Doc. 108-3 at 124:1-8. Banasiak indicated that the half day rate has not been used since approximately 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124:15-19. Use of the half day rate was discussed during a teleconference and the regional vice presidents determined that there was no benefit to paying it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124:22-125:6. Banasiak's discussions with other Regional Vice Presidents indicated that the half day rate was used in regions other than Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125:14-21. Banasiak indicated that the half day rate was used if a Helper performed a task other than his or her normal daily task.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Benefits, including 401(k) and health insurance, are provided by Waste Pro USA. Doc. 123-2 at 108:18-20. Bonuses are paid by the region and health reimbursement accounts are managed locally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109:2, 109:25-110:2. Workers who work on route and take a lunch break receive a paid lunch break in all regions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:7-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Division managers set starting pay for Helpers and the amount is not consistent across Waste Pro of Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181:2-10. No set policy exists and in some divisions,\n   Helpers are paid the same regardless of experience level, whereas Helpers in other divisions may be paid more if they have experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:12-183:3. For example, within the Northeast Region of Florida, Helpers in Gainesville have a starting day rate of $ 105, regardless of their experience level, whereas the starting day rate in Jacksonville is $ 115, with Helpers in Jacksonville being eligible for a 2% higher rate of pay. Doc. 123-3 \u00b6 10. Similarly, within the Coastal Division of Florida, the starting pay in Tallahassee is a day rate of $ 115, regardless of experience level, in Crestview it is $ 110, regardless of experience level, and in Pensacola, it is $ 115 for inexperienced Helpers and $ 120 for experienced Helpers. Doc. 123-4 \u00b6 15. Within the Southeast Region of Florida, Helpers in Fort Pierce receive a starting day rate of $ 105, with experienced Helpers being eligible for up to a 2% higher rate of pay, whereas Helpers in Palm Beach receive a starting day rate of $ 110 regardless of experience level, and Helpers in Pembroke Pines receive a starting day rate of $ 120, regardless of experience level. Doc. 123-5 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this vein, Defendants submitted the declaration of Frank Kramer, the Division Manager for the Lake City Division of Waste Pro of Florida. Doc. 123-8. Kramer stated that he has the sole discretion to hire residential Helpers within his division and sets the pay himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Residential Helpers in his division never receive a non-discretionary bonus for performing extra work, and no help or bump pay is paid in his division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. However, at one point, residential Helpers within his division were paid safety bonuses, but this stopped on November 25, 2012, when he decided to roll the safety bonus into the daily job rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff submitted a Human Resources Audit Report which states that it was \"Prepared For Waste Pro USA, Inc.\" by Ford Harrison. Doc. 108-8. One section within the Report is an \"Analysis of Time and Payroll Records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In this analysis, Ford Harrison indicates that overtime wages should be calculated by taking the gross wages earned in a workweek, including bonuses, dividing the figure by the total hours work, and multiplying this rate by 0.5. Doc. 108-8 at 8. That rate should be paid for the time worked over forty hours in the workweek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ford Harrison wrote that \"Waste Pro does pay its employees a half time premium for all hours worked over 40 but appears to be calculating its employees regular rate incorrectly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Time and Pay Analysis also contains information related to the bump pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 10. However, Allen indicated that the information used by Ford Harrison applied to the Pembroke Pines division and was not provided to Waste Pro USA for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The evidence submitted meets the fairly lenient standard to show that Helpers held similar positions and were subjected to the same compensation policies. The uniform job description, dissemination of policies, use of the same policy of compensating Helpers at a daily rate, and use of bonuses demonstrate common treatment of Helpers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nonetheless, Defendants contend that conditional certification is inappropriate because the proposed class included those who were only possibly affected by either the half-day practice or who received bonuses, and may include people who were not affected by either policy. Doc. 123 at 15-16. Mills stated in his declaration that Plaintiff's payroll records show that despite working less than four hours on June 15, 2018, he was paid a full day. Doc. 123-4 \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mackie stated in his declaration that Opt-In Plaintiff Moreland worked four\n   hours on March 12, 2016, but a review of his payroll records show that he received pay for a full day, and that Moreland's declaration stating that he would be paid half of his typical flat rate for working four hours or less in a day is incorrect. Doc. 123-5 \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants submitted the declaration of Roland Joyner, the Regional Vice President of Waste Pro of Mississippi, Inc., who stated that Tyler and Bethley worked as Residential Helpers. Doc. 123-6 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Joyner stated that, based on a review of their payroll records, neither Opt-In Plaintiff were ever paid a half day during their employment, were never paid safety bonuses, and were never paid weekly or bi-weekly bonuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants also submitted the declaration of Adolfo Covelli, the Division Manager for the Fort Pierce Division of Waste Pro of Florida, where Carter was employed. Doc. 123-7. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Carter initially worked as a residential Helper, but in September 2015, he became a non-CDL Driver, at which point he alternated positions and his duties varied by week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Carter's payroll records show that on eight different occasions he worked four hours and was paid his full daily or job rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   These factual issues showing variations are not dispositive at the stage for conditional certification.\n   <em>\n    Vondriska v.

Defendants do not provide authority for why the Court should depart from its precedent, and the Court declines to do so. Plaintiff has supplied evidence that subsidiaries of Waste Pro USA have access to the same policy and procedure documents, there are resources available from Waste Pro USA for its subsidiaries, the companies have the same CEO, and Regional Vice Presidents attend meetings together.
