The Chamber of Commerce argued that the ordinance was preempted by\n   <em>\n    Garmon\n   </em>\n   , because it \"requires local officials and state courts to decide whether for-hire drivers are employees under the NLRA.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit rejected the Chamber's preemption argument, holding that the Chamber had not proffered evidence that the Uber and Lyft drivers were employees, and thus had not demonstrated that it was \"reasonably arguable\" that the drivers were employees under the NLRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    at 794-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Similarly here, for this Court to find preemption, Plaintiffs must proffer evidence demonstrating that (1) Consumer Affairs will be required to resolve arguable questions as to whether an organization is a labor organization; or (2) Consumer Affairs has registered an organization to receive remittances under the Deductions Law where it is \"reasonably arguable\" that the organization is a \"labor organization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Deductions Law is Preempted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Facial Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   To sustain a facial challenge here, Plaintiffs must show that every application of the Deductions Law will present - or is likely to present - Consumer Affairs with a determination as to labor organization status that is arguable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Plaintiffs have not met this standard. In enacting the Deductions Law, the City Council took steps to make the \"labor organization\" determination as clear as possible. As noted above, the Deductions Law explicitly incorporates the federal definition of \"labor organization\" and the Board's interpretation of that term: it defines a \"labor organization\" as,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a 'labor organization' within the meaning of subsection (5) of section 152 of title 29 of the United States code... as such definition is interpreted by the [N]ational [L]abor [R]elations [B]oard.\" N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-1310(b)(3). Moreover, the Deductions Law directs Consumer Affairs to \"promulgate rules necessary to ensure that this law will be applied in a manner consistent with federal or state labor law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-1310(c). Finally, Consumer Affairs consults a variety of federal sources in determining whether an entity is a \"labor organization.\" For example, when Consumer Affairs receives a registration application under the Deductions Law, it checks the NLRB's website to determine whether the Board has made a determination as to whether the organization is a labor organization, and whether the organization appears in the Board's lists of affiliated or unaffiliated unions. (Maxwell Decl. (Dkt. No. 60) \u00b6\u00b6 14-16) Consumer Affairs also examines the organization's IRS Form 990 to see whether it was formed under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(5) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17) - which exempts \"[l]abor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations\" from taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5). If any of these sources indicate that the organization is a labor organization, Consumer Affairs will deny the registration application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Given the extent to which the Deductions Law and Consumer Affairs incorporate and utilize federal law, standards, interpretations, and reasoning, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to demonstrate that it is inevitable - or even likely - that the Deductions Law will require Consumer Affairs to decide arguable questions of whether an organization is a labor organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, however, that \"registering and remitting payments to arguable 'labor organizations' was the purpose of the [Deductions Law].\" (Pltf. Reply (Dkt. No. 51) at 26) In support of this argument, Plaintiffs assert that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   [t]he City does not dispute that the [Service Employees International Union (\"SEIU\") ] lobbied for the [Deductions Law]. Nor can there be a dispute that the City and SEIU co-drafted the [Deductions Law]; nearly 100 pages of email correspondence reveal the collaboration of the City and SEIU to design the Bill for the benefit of the SEIU and to further its union organizing efforts. Indeed, the Bill also expressly deters not-for-profits other than [Fast Food Justice] from receiving payments under the Bill by refusing registration unless the organization can provide \"facially valid\" written authorizations from at least 500 fast food employees, echoing the very \"showing of support\" the NLRB requires for a union itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27 (citing Pltf.

Moreover, in adopting well-established federal law and standards concerning the \"labor organization\" determination, the City Council has taken steps to prevent the erroneous registration of a labor organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Finally, as discussed below, Fast Food Justice is not arguably a \"labor organization.\" And even assuming that the City's motive in enacting the Deductions Law was to promote organizations such as Fast Food Justice, such a motive is not impermissible, because the registration of Fast Food Justice and similar organizations under the Deductions Law does not arguably or actually conflict with federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     As-Applied Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In addition to their facial challenge, Plaintiffs argue that Fast Food Justice - which has registered under the Deductions Law (Pltf.

If the evidence establishes such a pattern or practice, or that the group exists for a purpose of following such a pattern or practice, the element of dealing is present.
