Am. Ans. \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex. C. Mr. Lorenzo did not disclose to the Office the July 20, 2016 refusal of the Tom Brady joke. Am.

Ans. \u00b6 55;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 70. In their motion, Defendants argued, among other things, that Plaintiff \"failed to produce any evidence proving that he registered the Tom Brady\" joke and that Plaintiff's \"monologue-style jokes are ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   only entitled to thin copyright protection.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 70-1 at 8-9, 13-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

The Court therefore ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing as to whether Plaintiff's failure timely to disclose the applications should be outcome-determinative. Am.

Am. Ans. \u00b6 58;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 131. As to the registrations, the Court determined that Plaintiff's failure timely to disclose them to Defendants should not be outcome-determinative because \"reopening discovery and permitting a late-filed dispositive motion-if warranted-sufficiently neutralizes any potential prejudice Defendants may have suffered.\" ECF No. 131 at 8-10. As to \"the amount of protection Plaintiff's works should be afforded,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, the Court wrote that, \"[i]n the present case, there is little doubt that the jokes at issue merit copyright protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v.

Plaintiff purports to base this argument on the plain language of section 411(b)(1)(A), which provides that \"[a] certificate of registration satisfies the requirements of this section and section 412 regardless of whether the certificate contains any inaccurate information, unless ... the inaccurate information\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     was included on the application for copyright registration with knowledge that it was inaccurate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 4-5 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ) (emphasis in original).

Section 409 of the Copyright Act specifies that \"[t]he application for copyright registration ... shall include ... any other information regarded by the Register of Copyrights as bearing upon ... the existence, ownership, or duration of the copyright.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20409\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10). Correspondence with the Register seeking reconsideration of a refusal of registration would appear to fit within the plain language of this definition. As explained in the Code of Federal Regulations, \"[a] request for reconsideration must include the reasons the applicant believes registration was improperly refused, including any legal arguments in support of those reasons and any supplementary information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20202.5\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 202.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), (c)(1).

It would appear that Congress intended fraud on the Copyright Office to encompass more than just the application form itself, but also the additional registration materials.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Copyright Registration Practice \u00a7 4:25 (2018) (explaining that \"the application, the deposit copy(ies), the filing fee, all other material that has been submitted to the Office, and all communications between the applicant and the Office relating to the registration of the claim ... are collectively known as the 'registration materials' \") (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, to conclude that the reconsideration requests were not part of the \"application\" for registration for purposes of fraud on the Copyright Office would subvert the policies underlying the defense.

Allowing an applicant to lie with impunity in subsequent registration materials so long as she is candid in the application form itself would defeat these policies and eviscerate the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's cases do not stand for the proposition that \"a misstatement [must] be made in the application for registration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3. Plaintiff cannot extrapolate from cases in which the defense was predicated on misstatements made in the application form that the defense can\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be predicated on misstatement made in the application form.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 5 (\"Plaintiff has been unable to locate any authority supporting Defendants['] claim that there can be fraud on the copyright office related to argument made in a reconsideration/appeal.\").

Defendants' allegations are predicated on Plaintiff's \"mischaracteriz[ation of] the holding in the Court's May 12, 2017 summary judgment order in correspondence to the Copyright Office, [and] omi[ssion of] key facts and details which led the Review Board to issue the registration.\" Am. Ans. \u00b6 65(d). In particular, Defendants allege that, in his second reconsideration request, Plaintiff \"falsely stat[ed] that '[t]he basis for this second reconsideration is that the Court ruled at Summary Judgment on May 9, 2017, that \"there is little doubt that the jokes at issue merit copyright protection,\" ' and that, \"[i]n light of the Court's [sic] that my client's material has met the originality requirement for copyright protection, and the previous joke registrations, my client respectfully requests that the work listed above be allowed to register,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60, whereas \"the Court's summary judgment order made no such determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The issue therefore is whether the Court \"ruled\" that the Tom Brady joke merited copyright protection, as Plaintiff claims and represented to the Office, or whether these statements were \"dicta,\" as Defendants contend, rendering Plaintiff's representation inaccurate. Some would say that \"no satisfactory definition [for 'holding'] has yet to emerge.\" Michael Abramowicz &amp; Maxwell Stearns,\n   <em>\n    Defining Dicta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20953\">\n    57 Stan.

Abramowicz and Stearns suggest that \"[a] holding consists of those propositions along the chosen decisional path or paths of reasoning that (1) are actually decided, (2) are based upon the facts of the case, and (3) lead to the judgment. If not a holding, a proposition stated in a case counts as dicta.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20953\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1065 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ultimately, the Court agrees with Plaintiff: \"There can be no [ruling as to] 'thin' or 'broad' protection ... unless [the Court first] reach[es] the threshold issue of whether the material merits copyright protection.\" Reply at 10. Here, the level of copyright protection to which Plaintiff's jokes are entitled was clearly before the Court, with Defendants arguing in their motion for summary judgment that, \"to the extent that Kaseberg's jokes are entitled to any copyright protection, such protection is 'thin.' \" ECF No. 70-1 at 15. The Court agreed with Defendants, \"conclud[ing] that Plaintiff's joke are entitled to only 'thin' copyright protection.\" ECF No. 131 at 21.

Perhaps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even if omission of the Court's ultimate conclusion that the jokes were entitled only to thin copyright protection were misleading, however, the Court would have to conclude that there was no intent to defraud here.
