Baez-Sanchez has been detained by DHS for over four years without an individualized bond hearing and alleges his continued detention violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. He seeks a writ ordering his immediate release or alternatively ordering an individualized bond hearing in which DHS bears the burden of showing his continued detention is justified.

He entered the United States without being admitted or paroled. On September 24, 2014, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), an agency within DHS, administratively arrested Baez-Sanchez. He was placed into removal proceedings before the Chicago Immigration Court and charged with removability from the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i), for arriving in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(II), due to his criminal record in the United States.

After hearings, the IJ entered a written decision denying Baez-Sanchez's other applications for relief, but granting Baez-Sanchez's waiver of inadmissibility on June 24, 2015. Pet. Ex. C, Decision of IJ (Doc. 1-1). The written decision also ordered Baez-Sanchez removed to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since this initial decision of the IJ, there has been numerous appeals and remands complicating the case and calling into question whether the order of removal has become and/or remained final. The IJ's\n   initial decision was not appealed, but DHS filed a motion to reconsider the IJ's order granting Baez-Sanchez's inadmissibility waiver. On August 18, 2015, the IJ denied DHS's motion. Pet. Ex. C, Aug. 18, 2015 IJ Decision (Doc. 1-1). DHS appealed the denial to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). On February 23, 2016, the BIA sustained DHS's appeal and remanded the case to the IJ to assess the waiver of inadmissibility under a heightened standard. The IJ issued a second written decision on April 28, 2016, using the heighted standard and again granting the waiver of inadmissibility. DHS again appealed the decision to the BIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the second BIA appeal was pending, the BIA decided\n   <em>\n    Matter of Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20797\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Accordingly, on October 7, 2016, when the BIA decided Baez-Sanchez's case on appeal for the second time, it held that the IJ lacked authority to grant the waiver and ordered Baez-Sanchez removed. Baez-Sanchez appealed the BIA's decision to the Seventh Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 6, 2017, the Seventh Circuit granted Baez-Sanchez's appeal, rejected\n   <em>\n    Matter of Khan\n   </em>\n   , and remanded the case to the BIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baez-Sanchez v.

After the Seventh Circuit's decision, Baez-Sanchez sought to be released from custody. On December 15, 2017, the IJ denied Baez-Sanchez's request for a change in custody status, finding that his detention was mandatory under INA \u00a7 236(c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Reply Ex., Order of IJ with Respect to Custody (Doc. 6-3). Baez-Sanchez then filed a habeas petition on December 22, 2017, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where he was being held at that time.\n   <em>\n    See Baez-Sanchez v. Nielsen et. al.\n   </em>\n   , 4:17-cv-02165-VEH-SGC (N.D. A.L.).

Reply Ex., Joint Stipulation of Dismissal (Doc. 6-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Baez-Sanchez filed this Petition (Doc. 1) on May 18, 2018, seeking habeas relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Baez-Sanchez argues that: (1) mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c), is unconstitutional as applied to people with substantial legal defenses to removal; (2) that, even if mandatory detention was permissible at the outset of proceedings, it became unreasonable and unconstitutional once detention became prolonged; and (3) his ongoing detention violates substantive due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chad Kolitwenzew, as Chief of Corrections for the Kankakee Sheriff's Office, is the proper respondent in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 18, 2018 Order, (Doc. 2) (noting the proper respondent in a \u00a7 2241 petition is the warden of the state jail where the alien is being kept). However, the Court has also designated the United States government as an Interested Party in this case. The Government responded to Baez-Sanchez's Petition on July 17, 2018 (Doc. 3), and Respondent Kolitwenzew has adopted the Government's Response (Doc. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Government's Response does not address the constitutionality of Baez-Sanchez's\n   detention under \u00a7 1226(c), but instead argues that Baez-Sanchez is being held pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which governs detention for aliens after a final order of removal has been entered. The Government further argues that detention under \u00a7 1231(a) is statutorily and constitutionally permissible under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v.

However, Baez-Sanchez argues that under either statute, his prolonged detention without a bond determination is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties submitted a joint status report (Doc. 7) on September 18, 2018. The parties informed the Court that the BIA has clarified that Baez-Sanchez's removal is stayed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), but that the parties still dispute which statute governs Baez-Sanchez's detention.

If, however, there is no final order of removal in Baez-Sanchez's case, then he is being held under the authority of \u00a7 1226(c), which mandates an alien's detention during their immigration proceedings if they have been convicted of certain crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Government argues that there is a final order of removal because the IJ's decision on June 24, 2015, was not appealed by either party and became administratively final on July 24, 2015, when the appeal deadline passed. Resp. at pp. 5 (Doc. 3). As Baez-Sanchez has noted, the Government's current position is contrary to its position in previous litigation before both the IJ and the North District of Alabama, where it argued that Baez-Sanchez was not subject to a final order of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at pp. 3-5 (Doc. 6); Reply Ex. L, DHS's Opposition to [Baez-Sanchez's] Motion for Bond Redetermination, (Doc. 6-3); Reply Ex. J, [Government's] Response to the Order to Show Cause, (Doc. 6-2). The Government has not argued that any new factual or legal information has changed since it took these positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Baez-Sanchez agrees that the IJ's initial removal order \"became administratively final on July 24, 2015, when neither party filed a timely appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at pp. 2 (Doc. 6). However, Baez-Sanchez argues that as a result of the BIA granting the Government's appeal of the IJ's denial of\n   the Motion for Reconsideration, the IJ's first decision was \"undone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second decision of the IJ was appealed directly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the order of removal itself has never been challenged on appeal, the BIA has held that when a decision is appealed the order \"in its entirety\" is appealed, \"not simply the specific aspect of the order that was challenged on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Cerna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20399\">\n    20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 406-07 (BIA 1991). Thus, the key to the parties' dispute is whether the first decision of the IJ was rendered \"undone\" by the BIA's initial February 23, 2016, decision reversing the IJ and remanding to the IJ for \"the entry of a new decision,\" and whether the BIA's October 7, 2016, removal order was rendered \"undone\" by the Seventh Circuit's decision overturning the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite the use of the term \"final,\" there are many situations where a final order of removal can be \"undone.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (allowing for motions to reopen final orders of removal);\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. McDonald\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-11673-ADB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208679219\">\n    2016 WL 8679219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Mass. Sept. 23, 2016) (collecting cases holding that even when a final order of removal had been entered, an alien's later application for withholding of removal negates the final status of the removal order). Here, when the BIA sustained the appeal of the IJ, the record was remanded to the IJ for \"the entry of a new decision.\" Gov't Resp. Ex. 4, Order of BIA at pp. 4 (Doc. 3-4). In this new decision, the IJ entered a renewed order of removal. Following the logic of the cases above, while the first decision of the IJ itself was not challenged, when the BIA remanded the case, reopened the record, and required a new decision, the IJ's previous order was no longer final. Similarly, when the Seventh Circuit overturned the BIA's decision, the BIA's previous removal order could no longer be considered final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government seeks to compare Baez-Sanchez's procedural state to those who are subject to reinstated removal orders that are \"not subject to being reopened or reviewed\" under \u00a7 1231(a)(5) and subsequently file for withholding of removal. Gov't Resp. at pp. 21 (Doc. 3). While this procedural state may be analogous to the procedural state Baez-Sanchez will be in if and when there is a final order of removal in his case, it does nothing to answer the question of\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   his removal order is final.

Baez-Sanchez has now been detained by DHS for four years-far longer than the average time of 90 days that\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   assumed individuals in his position would be subject to and far longer than the six-month period presumed reasonable under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   While Baez-Sanchez appears to at times have been under a final order of removal, during at least the 14 months-since the Seventh Circuit overturned the BIA's decision on October 6, 2017-he has been held in mandatory detention without a bond hearing pursuant to \u00a7 1226(c). Detention under this statute is by its nature \"finite,\" but the Government has given the Court no indication of when the BIA or the IJ will render their final decision. The Court need not decide the exact temporal limit, but, at some point during these past four years, Baez-Sanchez's \"continued detention became unreasonable and unjustified\" and he is now \"entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (J. Kennedy, concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court recognizes that the Government has a valid interest in requiring detention during removal hearings to ensure that removable aliens appear for their removal hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the additional safeguard of a bond hearing to make an individualized determination as to Baez-Sanchez's flight risk and dangerousness would not impede this purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207293598\">\n    2015 WL 7293598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The Government's interest in detention does not outweigh Baez-Sanchez's right to an individualized bond hearing given Baez-Sanchez's good-faith belief that removal may not happen and given his lengthy detention. Therefore, at this point, the due process clause now requires an individualized bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Baez-Sanchez's Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Doc. 1) is GRANTED. The Court orders Chad Kolitwenzew to release Baez-Sanchez from the custody of Jerome Combs Detention Center within 30 days of this order, unless he receives an order from an Immigration Judge who has determined, after an individualized hearing, that Baez-Sanchez's continue detention is necessary to prevent a risk of flight or a threat to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This matter is now CLOSED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Citations to documents filed in this case are styled as \"Doc. __.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    As dictated by the analogous federal habeas corpus rules for proceedings under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and \u00a7 2255, the facts recounted here are taken from Respondent's Response to the Petition, (Doc. 3), unless otherwise noted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202248\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
