(Dkt. # 1). Sanders alleges claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and New York State statutory and common law, all of which arise out of the execution of a no-knock search warrant at her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently pending are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. ## 35; 39).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both motions are opposed. (Dkt. ## 40; 41). For the reasons stated below, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted, and Sanders's motion for summary judgment is denied. Sanders's Complaint (Dkt. # 1), therefore, is dismissed in its entirety and with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Search Warrant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 2, 2013, the RPD began an investigation into the murder of Kemari \"Mills\" Hodrick, which occurred in Rochester, New York, on that day. (Dkt. # 35-1 at Ex. C). Dante \"Shalanta\" Rankin was the prime suspect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result of information obtained through that investigation, LoFaso presented a search warrant affidavit to Monroe County Court Judge Victoria M. Argento (\"Judge Argento\"), seeking a no-knock search warrant for 18 Gladstone Street, Rochester, New York, 14611 (\"18 Gladstone\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. D; Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   # 39-3 at 3-6) (the \"Affidavit\" or \"Aff.\"). At that time, 18 Gladstone was Sanders's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Affidavit, LoFaso reasonably believed that certain items relevant to the homicide might be found at 18 Gladstone, including a black knit hat worn by Rankin when he shot Hodrick, handguns, ammunition, gun cleaning equipment, magazines, and holsters, photographs of Rankin holding weapons, and computers and cells phones. (Aff. at \u00b6 A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   LoFaso explained that after the murder on December 2, 2013, Rochester Police Investigator Jennifer Morales (\"Morales\") spoke with a confidential informant (the \"C.I.\"). (Aff. at \u00b6 5). The C.I. was \"known to Investigator Morales and other members of law enforcement,\" and the C.I. had been \"providing reliable information since 2005, which ha[d] led to the arrests of several individuals on narcotics, weapons, assault, and murder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The C.I. told Morales that \"a male who the CI kn[ew] by the name of Shalanta Rankin called the CI's house at approximately 3:38 p.m.\" on December 2, 2013. (Aff. at \u00b6 5). The C.I. stated that he \"kn[ew] Rankin, kn[ew] Rankin['s] voice, and ha[d] talked to Rankin on numerous other occasions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During the phone call, the C.I. apparently \"overheard\" Rankin tell another participant on the call, who was in the C.I.'s house, that Rankin had \"just shot 'Mills' in the chest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Morales Dep. at 64).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the C.I. indicated that \"Rankin called from telephone # 585-355-4606, which the CI observed on his/her caller identification box.\" (Aff. at \u00b6 5). An investigation conducted by the Monroe Crime Analysis Center subsequent to Morales's conversation with the C.I., but prior to LoFaso drafting the Affidavit, revealed that the telephone number observed by the C.I. was the Time Warner landline for 18 Gladstone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LoFaso represented to Judge Argento in the Affidavit that the RPD had Rankin in custody. (Aff. at \u00b6 7). However, LoFaso believed probable cause existed to search 18 Gladstone for the items specified in the Affidavit \"because 18 Gladstone Street, which is close in location to the murder scene, is upon information and belief a known drug location as well as the first known location to which the suspect [went] after the murder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The homicide investigation revealed that Rankin went to 18 Gladstone based on the phone call placed to the C.I.'s residence, and the fact that the phone number viewed by the C.I. returned to 18 Gladstone. (Morales Dep. at 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LoFaso also requested that the search warrant be designated as a \"no knock\" warrant, pursuant to New York law. (Aff. at \u00b6 9). LoFaso stated that 18 Gladstone was \"a known drug location and the residence of a parolee named Darrell Taylor, who [was] believed to be selling drugs out of the location[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In LoFaso's view, it was \"reasonable to believe the giving of notice and authority may endanger the life or safety of the executing officers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). LoFaso and Morales testified that the search warrant for 18 Gladstone was a \"high-risk warrant.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morales Dep. at 119; LoFaso Dep. at 38). This was due, in\n   part, to the fact that the murder weapon was still outstanding at the time LoFaso applied for the search warrant, and that Rankin may have secreted the weapon at 18 Gladstone given the belief, based on the RPD's investigation, that he went to that location after the murder. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is indisputable that Judge Argento signed and issued the no-knock search warrant for 18 Gladstone on the basis of the Affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. ## 35-1 at Ex. D; 39-3 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Execution of the Search Warrant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties do not dispute that RPD executed the no-knock search warrant on 18 Gladstone before noon on December 3, 2013. When the officers entered the house, Sanders was upstairs lying in bed with her baby grandson. (Sanders Dep. at 13-15). Some of the officers instructed her to come downstairs, which she did while only wearing a t-shirt and carrying jeans on her arm and her grandson on her hip. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As soon as Sanders came downstairs, Morales handcuffed her in front of her body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Sanders could still cradle her grandson while handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Morales also \"assisted [Sanders] in dressing the baby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sanders testified that she was handcuffed for about two hours while officers searched 18 Gladstone, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30), and that the \"handcuffs w[eren't] comfortable period,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50). Morales testified that \"it is common practice for entry on any search warrant that every individual for the safety of themselves and for [the executing officers], [be] handcuffed. And they are usually asked to go to the ground and handcuffed behind their back. Ms. Sanders was handcuffed in the front and never taken to the ground.\" (Morales Dep. at 114). Sanders does not dispute this. Moreover, based on Sanders's account of the incident, she never complained to the officers about the handcuffs while the officers conducted the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After entering the house, two officers, Investigator Swain and Sergeant Lee, attempted to search the basement from the kitchen. (Lee Dep. at 26). When Lee opened the basement door, the two officers were confronted by Sanders's pit bull dog that was approaching the threshold of the basement door. (Lee Dep. at 28; Swain Dep. at 41-44). Swain described the dog as approaching the officers in a \"quick,\" \"aggressive[ ]\" manner, with its \"[t]eeth bared.\" (Swain Dep. at 44, 46). Lee testified that the dog was running up the stairs \"in an attacking manner,\" at \"full speed, growling, coming right towards [himself] and Investigator Swain.\" (Lee Dep. at 28). As a result, and within a matter of seconds of opening the basement door, Swain shot and killed the dog. (Swain Dep. at 44). Sanders did not witness this shooting. (Sanders Dep. at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   No items identified in the search warrant were found at 18 Gladstone, except two cell phones, which the RPD took as\n   evidence. (Dkt. # 35-1 at Ex. I). In addition, the officers seized other items from 18 Gladstone, including new/unused baggies, an electronic scale, and a notebook containing \"drug plans\" of Darrell Taylor, which the officers viewed as drug paraphernalia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Taylor was present at 18 Gladstone and also detained during the search. (Sanders Dep. at 19-20). Sanders disputes that these items were used for illegal purposes. (Dkt. # 41 at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sanders testified that the officers damaged her residence during the search. (Sanders Dep. at 35). Specifically, the door frame where the officers entered the house was damaged such that the door was not secured at all. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). Moreover, there was blood in the kitchen and on the basement stairs from the dog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sanders stated that the officers \"flipped upside-down\" every bedroom, took out every dresser drawer and threw clothes everywhere, and scattered the contents of boxes Sanders had packed in preparation for her upcoming move. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sanders also indicated that food from the refrigerator and cabinets had been thrown around in the kitchen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In short, the house was \"tore up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sanders also claims that her wrists were injured as a result of the handcuffs. (Sanders Dep. at 48). She testified that the day after the search, her wrists were bruised and she had rings around them, and she could not hold anything in her hands, apparently as a result of the pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After \"a couple days\" of \"trying to figure it out by [her]self,\" she went to urgent care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49). There, she was given \"some pills\" to \"help with [her] hands,\" and wrist braces for stabilization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49). Since that appointment, Sanders indicated that \"some days are good, some days are bad with [her] wrists [and] with [her] hands,\" and she has only returned to the doctor to get her medicine refilled, and only uses her wrist braces when she starts to feel pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Other than the wrist injury, Sanders suffered no other physical injuries as a result of the search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Rule 37 Discovery Sanctions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sanders devotes much of her papers to issues relating to discovery and seeks Rule 37 sanctions against defendants. The Court will begin with these issues as certain of those requests, if granted, could have a material impact on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glencore Denrees Paris v.

Based on defendants' alleged noncompliance, Sanders seeks to have certain, unspecified facts be taken as established, pursuant to Rule 37(2)(b)(2)(A)(i), and to have defendants' Answer stricken, pursuant to Rule 37(2)(b)(2)(A)(iii). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. ## 39-12 at 18-22; 41-6 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 37(b) sanctions \"appl[y] to a party's disobedience with a Court Order to compel production of some sort.

(Dkt # 19). But Judge Payson explicitly denied that motion.

First, the Court is not convinced that Sanders has raised a genuine issue of material fact that the assertions in the Affidavit were, in fact, false or that LoFaso recklessly disregarded the truth in making the Affidavit. Although no drugs were found at 18 Gladstone, the officers found items they viewed as drug paraphernalia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morales Dep. at 88). Moreover, even if 18 Gladstone was not, in fact, Taylor's residence, he was nonetheless at that location when the officers executed the search warrant. (Sanders Dep. at 19-20). Errors contained in a search warrant affidavit caused by mere negligence or innocent mistakes do not establish falsity or reckless disregard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calderon v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202079405\">\n    2015 WL 2079405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In any event, Sanders has not demonstrated that the statements regarding 18 Gladstone being a drug house or Taylor's residence were material to the finding of\n   probable cause. As mentioned above, the phone number from which Rankin supposedly called the C.I.'s house after the murder was linked to 18 Gladstone by the Monroe Crime Analysis Center. Indeed, Sanders testified that phone number was, in fact, the landline for 18 Gladstone. (Sanders Dep. at 36). This clarifies the accuracy of the information provided by the Monroe Crime Analysis Center to the RPD based on the phone number described by the C.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition, 18 Gladstone was close in proximity to the murder scene, a statement that Sanders does not dispute. Finally, the existing facts known to LoFaso at the time he drafted the Affidavit led to the conclusion that 18 Gladstone was the \"first known location\" Rankin went after the murder. This was at least a reasonable conclusion even if 18 Gladstone was not, in fact, the first place visited by Rankin, because, again, the phone number from which Rankin supposedly called the C.I.'s house was the landline for 18 Gladstone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In my view, then, even removing the disputed statements from the Affidavit, probable cause existed for Judge Argento to issue the search warrant for 18 Gladstone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     \"No-Knock\" Designation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To the extent that Sanders argues the \"no-knock\" designation was inappropriate, (Dkt. ## 39-12 at 12-18; 41-6 at 8-10), that argument is also without merit. No-knock warrants, under certain circumstances, are constitutional and permitted by New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20CRIM.%20PROC.%20%C2%A7%20690.35\">\n    N.Y.

Here, LoFaso requested a no-knock warrant because he believed giving notice of the search \"may endanger the life or safety of the executing officers.\" (Aff. at \u00b6 9). Because the warrant sought, among other things, firearms and firearm equipment related to a murder that was committed a day prior to LoFaso drafting the Affidavit, it was reasonable for Judge Argento to approve the no-knock entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20CRIM.%20PROC.%20%C2%A7%20690.35\">\n    N.Y.

The officers were also permitted to search for such items as guns and ammunition, gun cleaning equipment, a knit hat, photographs, and cell phones. It was reasonable for the officers to search places within 18 Gladstone where such items might be hidden, such as dresser drawers and boxes.
