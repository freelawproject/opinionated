The predicate felony for the first-degree murder conviction is arson. The prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing argument by commenting on\n   the credibility of witnesses, repeatedly labeling Petitioner, who did not testify, a liar, and misrepresenting the facts of the case. Trial counsel's failure to object to the misconduct was constitutionally ineffective as was counsel's failure to consult a fire investigation expert. To the extent that the state court denied these claims on the merits, the state court's determination to the contrary was an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court grants a conditional writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary of Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner's convictions arise from the death of her husband Todd Stermer. He died from injuries suffered in a fire on January 7, 2007, at the rural home he and Petitioner shared in Lawrence Township. Petitioner and her husband were both home when the fire started. Petitioner was in the basement laundry room and managed to escape with no injuries. Her husband escaped from the home's first floor, but was badly burned and died at the scene. He also suffered blunt force injuries which were consistent with having been struck or run over by a vehicle. Petitioner was arrested and charged on June 5, 2009 - over two years after the fire occurred. The prosecution's theory of the case was that Petitioner intentionally set the fire, and that, when her husband escaped from the fire, Petitioner intentionally ran him over. The defense contended that the fire was either accidentally set or intentionally set by Mr. Stermer. The defense also argued that Petitioner accidentally struck her husband with a vehicle when she was attempting to drive to a neighbor's house for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   No accelerants were detected inside the home. Mr. Stermer's clothing tested positive for an accelerant (gasoline), but Petitioner's did not. The prosecution's expert concluded that the fire was intentionally set and that Mr. Stermer had been at the center of the fire. Petitioner argued that this evidence, when considered alongside the fact that two of Mr. Stermer's previous homes were destroyed by suspected arson fires, supported her defense. She also argued that an oil lamp and burning candles present in the family room might have accidentally started the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Trial Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Michael Markey performed an autopsy of Todd Stermer and testified as an expert in forensic pathology. He identified the cause of Mr. Stermer's death as burns and smoke inhalation. He found the injuries consistent with Mr. Stermer being on fire rather than simply being present in the burning house. Dr. Markey also found lacerations and blunt force injuries to the head which were consistent with being run over by a vehicle. No prescription drugs or controlled substances were found in his blood, but Vicodin was found in his urine. Vicodin remains detectable in urine longer than in blood, so it was possible that he took Vicodin several hours or days before his death, such that it was no longer detectable in his blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sandra Stermer, the deceased's mother, testified that two of her son's previous homes had been destroyed by fire. He owned the first, located in Portage, Michigan. The second, located in Three Rivers, was destroyed by fire when he was in the process of buying the home from his grandmother. Her son suffered significant financial problems over the years and she had loaned him tens of thousands of dollars. Other family members had also loaned him money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Steven Leach, who, in 2007, was the Fire Chief for Lawrence Township, lived on the same street as the Stermers and\n   was the first emergency responder at the scene. He testified that the amount of smoke and fire he saw were indicative of a fast-moving fire or one that had been burning for a long time. Leach drove to the Stermers' home and parked his vehicle on the grass in front of the home. He noted that the ground was \"sloppy.\" Leach rendered first-aid to Todd Stermer and noted that Linda Stermer was crying and hysterical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Van Buren Deputy Sheriff Tony Evans arrived at the Stermer house at approximately 3:30 p.m, roughly seven minutes after dispatch received the call. When he arrived, the home appeared fully engulfed in flames. He observed Linda Stermer, Steven Leach, and several neighbors on the north side of the residence. Deputy Evans also observed Mr. Stermer lying on the ground. He appeared to be badly burned and wore only a pair of grey sweatpants which were pulled down around his ankles. A number of clothing items were draped over him. In addition to burns, Deputy Evans noted that Mr. Stermer was bleeding from his head and had a laceration to the back of his head. Linda Stermer was lying over him and yelling his name repeatedly. Deputy Evans assisted others in moving Mr. Stermer to a location farther from the home and adjacent oil tank in case the oil tank became engulfed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Deputy Evans noticed a Ford van parked behind the home. The van appeared to be running. As he approached, he saw what he thought was blood on the front driver's side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Stermers' neighbor Mike Matheny testified that, as he and his girlfriend Connie Calhoun were leaving their home on January 7, 2007. They noticed smoke and flames coming from the direction of the Stermers' home. Matheny drove his vehicle up the Stermers' long driveway and saw the Stermer family van backing away from the house and then moving forward again. Petitioner stepped out of the van. She was hysterical, but managed to tell Matheny that her children were not in the home. Matheny advised Calhoun to call 911. Petitioner then pointed out her husband lying on the ground. Matheny had walked past Mr. Stermer two or three times without seeing him. He appeared to be unclothed except for boots and to be severely burned. Matheny grabbed clothing from his own vehicle and placed the clothing on top of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Detective Gabrielle Rought interviewed Petitioner on the day of the fire and two days later. Petitioner told Detective Rought that, on the day of the fire, her husband awoke at 10:00 a.m. feeling ill. They briefly argued. Petitioner did not want their three sons to hear the argument, so she sent them to the mall. Mr. Stermer was watching television in the living room when she went to do laundry in the basement. She heard her husband scream. She ran up the stairs and saw smoke and fire. Petitioner ran outside and got in the family van to go for help. She saw her husband on fire in the side yard. She attempted to turn the van around, then, when she did not see him anymore she exited the van and found him lying on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   James Shinsky was employed as a private fire investigator in January 2007. His employer was contacted by State Farm Insurance Company to conduct a cause and origin investigation of the fire. As part of his investigation, he interviewed Petitioner on January 9 and 10, 2007. Both interviews took place in vehicles parked in the driveway of the Stermer home. The interviews were transcribed and the entire transcript was admitted as a trial exhibit. Shinsky read from substantial portions of the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner's narrative of what occurred on the day of the fire was told to the jury\n   during Shinsky's reading of the transcript. Petitioner told Shinsky that, on the morning of the fire, her husband was angry because she failed to record purchases in the checkbook. At some point in the morning, Petitioner went to a nearby Marathon gas station, purchased breakfast, and filled her Chevy Blazer with gasoline. She told their three sons that she would give them money so they could go to the mall because she and Mr. Stermer needed to discuss some things. After doing some chores and taking a short nap, Petitioner gave her husband medication for an ear infection and then she went to the basement to do laundry. There was a towel in the laundry that smelled like fuel or gas, which her husband had placed there. Petitioner heard her husband yelling at her and then heard him scream. She ran up the stairs and saw fire spanning from their bedroom to the living room. She could not see very well because of the smoke and flames, but saw that her husband's entire upper body was on fire. She ran out the door and jumped in the van to get help. Petitioner then saw her husband in the yard. He was completely covered in flames. Petitioner jumped out of the van and tried to get him to lie down, but he would not do so. Instead, he was trying to pull off his pants and socks. Petitioner realized that she needed help, so she jumped back in the van. The van was stuck in the mud, so Petitioner drove forward in an attempt to get a running start but was unsuccessful. Petitioner reported she jumped out of the van again. She found her husband lying on the ground. Her neighbors then arrived at the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition to reading from a substantial portion of Petitioner's interview, Shinsky testified that, as part of his investigation, he took two red towels that had been in the home's washing machine. Both towels tested positive for gasoline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the morning of January 7, 2007, Cindy DeLoach was working as a cashier at the Marathon gas station near the Stermer home. She recalled Petitioner purchasing some items from the store and gasoline. DeLoach saw Petitioner standing near the rear of her vehicle with the gas hose. It appeared to DeLoach that Petitioner was pumping gas through the rear of the vehicle, not where the gas tank would be located. But DeLoach could not see whether the gas was pumped into a container.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The prosecution presented two jailhouse informants: Veronica Navarro Tracy and Dardeda Gordon. Tracy testified that in July 2009 she overheard a conversation between a woman she later said was Linda Stermer and another woman. According to Tracy, Petitioner mumbled something about hitting her husband in the head with a frying pan and being very sorry. On cross-examination, however, Tracy testified that she was uncertain whether the person she overheard was Petitioner and whether she had heard anything other than Petitioner repeating how sorry she was. Tracy admitted to suffering from mental illness and being off her medication while incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dardeda Gordon testified that she was incarcerated with Petitioner in the Van Buren County Jail. She heard several conflicting stories from Petitioner about Mr. Stermer's death and the fire. Eventually, Petitioner told Gordon that she and her husband argued on the day of the fire. According to Gordon, Petitioner said she struck him in the head with something, and that she intentionally started the fire with gasoline while her husband was sleeping. On cross-examination, Gordon testified that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder. She admitted that she had suffered and continued to suffer from\n   memory problems because of her psychiatric disorders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Gordon also testified that when police first contacted her in October 2009, the only thing she could remember was that Petitioner asked for forgiveness. It was only after Detective Macyauski suggested to Gordon that Petitioner may have struck her husband, perhaps with a frying pan, that Gordon remembered Petitioner saying she hit her husband with an object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kate Fox testified that she and Petitioner became friends in 2006 and car pooled to work together nearly every day. Petitioner confided to Fox that she was unhappy in her marriage, that her husband was physically and emotionally abusive, and that she had contacted a divorce attorney. Fox testified that Petitioner said she had spent years thinking about how to get rid of him and had considered running him over with a car. Fox also said Petitioner called Fox one night after the fire and asked if Fox had a flashlight because she needed to get into the house to remove a coffee cup with sedative before the police came to the house looking for evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On cross-examination, Fox admitted that her friendship with Petitioner dissolved in February 2007 when Petitioner transferred to first shift and the two could no longer car pool. Fox was angry because the plan had been for the two of them to move to first shift together. She also admitted that, on July 31, 2007, the two argued about $ 5,000 Fox claimed Petitioner owed her; Fox was ultimately charged with assaulting Petitioner. Fox testified that she had mental health problems and that she was admitted to psychiatric institutions twice, including in January 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Detective Sergeant Scott Leroy, who was employed by the Michigan State Police Fire Investigation Unit, testified for the prosecution as an expert in the field of determining cause and origin of fires. He investigated the Stermer house fire. Detective Leroy concluded that the fire originated in the first-floor living room and was intentionally set. Detective Leroy based these conclusions on the speed of the fire, a comparison of areas with the most damage versus areas with the least damage, the time of day, and the fact that two adults were at home. He could not determine whether accelerants were present on the living room floor because the floor was consumed by the fire. A canine search team found no ignitable liquid residue in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Chris Williams testified that he and Petitioner became romantically involved in the summer of 2006. They continued their relationship after Mr. Stermer's death. At some point after the fire, Petitioner told Williams that she was downstairs when she heard her husband holler. She ran to see what was happening and found the entire upstairs engulfed in flames. Petitioner was very upset when they discussed the fire. She told Williams she had no involvement in setting the fire or causing her husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stephen Berry, Kate Fox's brother, testified for the defense. He characterized Fox as untrustworthy. Fox is self-centered and believes \"the sun revolves around her and when it doesn't she can be very angry and very vindictive\" to the point of lying about someone. (1/12/2010 Tr. at 97, ECF No. 24-11 at Pg. ID 1692.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Seven defense witnesses attested to Petitioner's honesty and peaceable nature. Several jail inmates housed with Petitioner testified that she never discussed her case and never spoke with Dardeda Gordon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Petitioner was convicted by a Van Buren Circuit Court jury of first-degree premeditated murder and felony murder. On February 8, 2010, the trial court vacated the\n   premeditated murder conviction and sentenced Petitioner to life imprisonment on the felony-murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Petitioner filed an appeal of right in the Michigan Court of Appeals raising the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I. The district court abused its discretion in binding over to circuit court and the circuit court erred in refusing to quash the bindover.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   II. The trial court erred in denying the motion for a directed verdict. Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and felony murder must therefore be vacated because the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the house fire was caused by arson,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   a deliberately set fire or (2) that it was defendant who started the fire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   III. The trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed Petitioner's conviction.\n   <em>\n    People v.

This Court held the petition in abeyance while Petitioner exhausted state court remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioner filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for relief from judgment in the trial court, raising these claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I. Defendant was denied her Fourteenth Amendment right to a fair trial when the court allowed Scott Leroy to testify as an expert on cause and origin. The court did not fulfill its role as \"gate keeper\" when Leroy was allowed to present unreliable testimony to the jury as an expert, which did not comport with MRE/ FRE 702. The allowance of Leroy's testimony was an abuse of discretion and prejudicial to Stermer under MRE/ FRE 403.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   II. The prosecutor prejudiced defendant and committed reversible error when he engaged in improper conduct:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Vouching for and bolstering the credibility and testimony of seven State's witnesses during closing arguments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   B. Offered facts not in evidence, he knew to be false, and mischaracterized facts during closing arguments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   C. Denigrated the defendant and appealed to the passions and emotions of the jury with repeated, impermissible name calling and character assassination of Stermer during closing arguments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   D. Eliciting known false testimony from State's witness Cory Pierce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   E. Elicited testimonial evidence from Detective Rought, which could not be supported with documents due to destruction of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   III. Defense counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient under the Sixth Amendment and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20, and precluded defendant from mounting a substantive and effective defense. This is a violation of guaranteed due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20 where counsel failed to: Challenge the theory of arson on a scientific level, investigate and prepare, to consult with an expert to rebut the prosecution's arson\n   expert, to interview any State's witnesses or experts, to question potential witnesses and to object to improper conduct by the prosecutor, and failure to be aware of rules critical to the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   IV. Appellate counsel raised weak issues on appeal while ignoring stronger, more meritorious arguments. Counsel's deficient performance prejudiced Stermer and violated her Sixth Amendment due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   V. Defendant's conviction should be reversed because the evidence was legally insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire was intentionally set or that defendant intentionally set the fire that resulted in the felony murder charge. The verdict was contrary to the great weight of the evidence and MRE/ FRE 702.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The trial court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner and file additional papers. After appointed counsel failed to supplement the record, the trial court denied the motion for relief from judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2/28/14 Order, ECF No. 29-3. The trial court also denied Petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/10/14 Order, ECF No. 29-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Petitioner's applications for leave to appeal were denied by the Michigan Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    People v.

The Court granted her request. This petition raises the following claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I. There was insufficient evidence to sustain petitioner's conviction of arson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   II. Petitioner's conviction was based upon incompetent, unreliable evidence that misled the jury, supplanted jury fact finding, was manifestly unjust, and denied due process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   III. Petitioner was denied due process and fundamental fairness by prosecutorial misconduct in vouching, bolstering, providing evidence, and deliberately misleading the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   IV. Ineffective assistance of counsel denied petitioner a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   V. Petitioner was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On June 28, 2018, the Court issued an Order Scheduling Evidentiary Hearing on Petitioner's claims that her trial and appellate attorneys rendered ineffective assistance and that admission of expert witness Scott Leroy's testimony violated her rights under the Due Process Clause.

The Court is particularly concerned with the prosecutor's inflammatory remarks in light of the fact that Petitioner did not testify at trial. That the jury did not have the opportunity to watch and listen to Petitioner on the witness stand renders the prosecutor's conduct even more egregious. This is because the prosecutor shared with the jury his personal belief that Petitioner was a \"diabolical, scheming, and manipulative liar,\" despite knowing that the jury lacked precisely the evidence it would have needed to make such a credibility determination - Petitioner's live testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court also considers the prosecutor's commentary on the witnesses who did in fact testify. With respect to the gas station attendant, Cindy DeLoach, the prosecutor stated: \"I would submit that she certainly appears to be a very credible person who has recall of the incident[.]\" (1/12/10 Tr. at 113; Pg.

Moreover, with respect to the two jailhouse witnesses, Veronica Tracy and Dardeda Gordon, the prosecutor argued that they had \"no incentive to lie\" and \"there is absolutely nothing in it for them to make this up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126, Pg.

The prosecutor created this significant detail out of thin air to make the argument that Petitioner consciously chose not to call for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This was not an isolated incident. In an attempt to undermine perhaps the most critical evidence supporting Petitioner's defense theory - that Mr. Stermer started the fire - the prosecutor told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   One of the other things that I want to clear up right away, and Mr. Getting keeps making reference to two previous fires, two previous fires, two previous fires, the second of which Linda Stermer is living with him and even by her own version it's not an arson, nor was the first one. There is no evidence of that either. Okay. For a moment we want to start making arguments, well, hey, somebody had a prior fire. She was there too so she knows about fires, you know.

(1/5/10 Tr. at 283, ECF No. 24-7 at Pg.

She explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   What I remember her telling me is that there was a property owned by Bertha Stermer and that Todd was in the process of purchasing that and that it burned. Prior to that that [sic] Hilmer Stermer purchased the property back and he himself was in the process of selling it but passed away prior to that sale being completed. Once that property was settled upon, Bertha Stermer received money as well as Sandy Stermer and I believe she told me that all of her children, including Todd, she gave some of the money to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (1/8/10 Tr. at 83, ECF No. 24-10 at Pg. ID 1449.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In addition to misstating the testimonies of Sandra Stermer and Detective Rought, the prosecutor lied to the jury when he said there was no evidence of arson in the previous two fires. A Portage Police report, which was in the State's possession at the time of trial, indicated that the fire at the house in Portage \"was definitely an arson\" for which the insured party, Todd Stermer, \"was regarded as the suspect.\" Police Dep't Supp. Rep., Mar. 31, 1992, Pet.'s Ex. 10. Although not admitted into evidence at trial, the report directly contradicts the prosecutor's statement that Mr. Stermer had never been involved with suspected arson. Thus, the prosecutor acted improperly by arguing that any evidence of prior arson was \"nonsense\" because he not only misrepresented the testimony at trial, but also gave the jury information which he knew, or had reason to know, was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   2.

Just before the jury began to deliberate, Petitioner was branded a diabolical liar, while the\n   State's witnesses were categorized as trustworthy - the prosecutor's personal beliefs were among the last words the jury heard before finding Petitioner guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987316\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/475/51/#p59\">\n    475 F.

It is a prosecutor's duty as a \"servant of the law\" to tread cautiously around racial issues. The prosecutor here took no such care. He called Chris Williams, a black man from Kalamazoo, to testify about his extramarital-and interracial-affair with Petitioner, a white woman. But the prosecutor did not need to call Williams to the stand to introduce evidence of the affair; he introduced this evidence, without objection, through several other witnesses. The prosecutor mentioned Williams only once in closing, demonstrating that he did not rely on this testimony to argue his case. Ultimately, the prosecutor chose to present Williams \"with no apparent justification\" and with the possibility of arousing prejudice in a predominantly white jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Substantial evidence pointed the finger at Mr. Stermer as the potential arsonist. He was involved in two prior fires where arson was strongly suspected and he was identified as a suspect in one. He was present at the point of origin of the fire and gasoline was detected on his clothing. The gasoline on his clothing also raised a substantial possibility that the fire started accidentally perhaps\n   by contact with the open flame in the living room. Moreover, the two jailhouse informants had significant mental health issues, with Veronica Tracy's testimony almost incomprehensible. Kate Fox provided significant incriminating evidence against Petitioner. But her cross-examination testimony revealed troubling aspects of her testimony and relationship with Petitioner: she had been twice hospitalized for mental health issues, including once in January 2007; she dissolved her friendship with Petitioner because Petitioner changed work shifts; and she was arrested for assaulting Petitioner. Kate Fox's brother testified that she was known to be untruthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \"[T]he egregious and inflammatory nature of the [prosecutor's] behavior\" leaves this Court with \"grave doubt,\" at a minimum, as to whether his misconduct had \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757382\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/711/#p717\">\n    201 F.3d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Trenkle was retained by Petitioner to testify as an expert in fire science. After reviewing Scott Leroy's preliminary examination testimony, trial testimony, and written report, Trenkle concluded that the evidence did not support Leroy's arson determination. Trenkle testified that the evidence Leroy relied upon was insufficient to allow for a determination as to the fire's cause. He also testified that, assuming the fire was intentionally set, it was more likely set by Mr. Stermer than by Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Trenkle pointed to a number of deficiencies in Leroy's methodology. First, Leroy incorrectly concluded that the fire's speed supported the theory that an accelerant was used. He explained that many other factors could have contributed to the fire's speed, including the exposed trusses, lack of drywall, and type of wood used in the home's construction. Second, the degree of damage to the home and the collapse of the first floor onto the basement floor rendered it impossible to eliminate every possible accidental cause, such as an electrical fire, a candle, or oil lamp. Third, Leroy failed to sample or move the debris in the basement, which was approximately two feet deep. Because the first floor fell into the basement, testing that debris would have been useful in a cause determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Finally, Trenkle testified that an expert would have been helpful to the defense to, at a minimum, assist in the cross-examination of the prosecution's expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Jack Hooker, retained by Respondent, testified as an expert in the investigation of fires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that he was asked to evaluate Leroy's origin and cause investigation. He agreed with Leroy's methodology, which, in his opinion, complied with industry standards. Hooker testified that he did not independently investigate the cause of the fire, but nevertheless agreed with Leroy's arson conclusion. Hooker believed Leroy's conclusion was supported both by the elimination of the living room fireplace as a possible cause and by the fact that gasoline had been in the area of origin (on Mr. Stermer's pants). He also testified that whether the fire had been set by Petitioner or Mr. Stermer, the physical evidence would appear the same to a fire investigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Petitioner's trial attorney, Jeffrey Getting, testified that he was retained shortly after the fire to represent Petitioner. At that time, no criminal charges had been filed. In fact, charges were not filed until June 2009, over two years after the fire. Prior to representing Petitioner, Getting had not represented a person charged with felony-murder with a predicate felony of arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Getting presented two defense theories: the fire was accidentally set; or Mr. Stermer intentionally set the fire to gain the insurance proceeds and accidentally killed himself in the process. He determined that he did not need to consult an expert because he believed Leroy's testimony could be used to support both defense theories, even though Leroy's testimony contradicted\n   the defense that the fire was accidentally set. Despite his limited experience with arson prosecutions, he did not consult an expert to assist him in preparing to cross-examine Leroy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Petitioner testified that she \"begged\" defense counsel on numerous occasions to hire an expert witness. (10/24/18 Tr. at 47, ECF No. 54 at Pg. ID 3193.) She assured him that the family would pay for an expert. She also asked her therapist to speak to defense counsel on her behalf about hiring an expert. Defense counsel told Petitioner he did not need an expert because he would \"use the prosecutor's expert\" for the defense's need. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48, Pg.

He did not return phone calls. She was so frustrated with her inability to contact counsel that she took to visiting his office several times a week and staying for hours at a time in an attempt to meet with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Martee Bakhuyzen, Petitioner's mother, testified that she asked defense counsel several times to hire an expert witness, but he would not. Defense counsel told her that they did not need an expert because there was \"no way\" a jury would convict Petitioner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126, Pg. ID 3272.) Bakhuyzen also testified that defense counsel was unavailable to meet with her daughter or her prior to the trial. He failed to show up for several appointments with Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Ashley Gibson, Petitioner's daughter, testified that defense counsel was asked to retain an expert witness.

Even assuming the jury believed that the fire was intentionally set, significant evidence pointed the finger of suspicion at Mr. Stermer. He may have been motivated by money, by anger at Petitioner, and/or by a desire for revenge over Petitioner's suspected infidelity.
