Mem. at 9-10; Pl. Rep. at 4-5. State responds that it has not admitted that the WikiLeaks documents in question are authentic State documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Dec. 2 \u00b6 24. Osen points to two specific statements as official acknowledgments: remarks made by State Assistant Secretary Philip J. Crowley in a press briefing in December 2010 (\"press statement\") and an Information Review Task Force Report issued by the Department of Defense in June 2011 (\"IRTF report\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, neither the IRTF report nor the press statement meet the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test's matching or specificity requirements. The press statement merely acknowledges that a leak occurred without discussing specifically any of the documents leaked or their content.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRTF report describes the documents only in cumulative terms, finding that \"[t]he compromised diplomatic cables are derived from the [State] database,\" but making no reference to the identity of the specific cables at issue, their contents, or whether the versions on WikiLeaks were identical to, as opposed to merely \"derived from,\" State documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Radine Dec., Ex. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test is a difficult fit for Osen's argument, which is not that\n   the government has officially disclosed the information in the cables, but that, by acknowledging that the unauthorized publication of government documents on WikiLeaks occurred, the government has converted all leaked documents available on WikiLeaks into official disclosures. The difficulty of trying to force this argument into the terms of the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test is not coincidental. Acknowledging the existence and scope of a leak does not have the same effect as officially disclosing the leaked information. As long as the information itself has not been officially disclosed, the justifications for the distinction between unofficially and officially disclosed information remain, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n    586 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that \"foreign governments can often ignore unofficial disclosures of CIA activities that might be viewed as embarrassing or harmful to their interests\" but \"cannot, however, so easily cast a blind eye on official disclosures made by the CIA itself\"). Holding otherwise would be tantamount to forcing the government to make an official disclosure of any leaked information if it wanted to acknowledge and investigate the leak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Osen argues that much of the redacted information has been disclosed in other non-WikiLeaks-related government disclosures, supplying a series of examples of State and Department of Defense documents containing information concerning,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , Iranian involvement in Iraq, Iranian agents, and military actions in Iraq.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 13-14 (citing exhibits). However, the cables here at issue are different from the official disclosures listed by plaintiff because the instant cables, unlike the disclosed documents, discuss \"specific engagements between U.S. Government officials and foreign interlocutors, relating each side's noteworthy remarks and in some cases commenting on them and analyzing them.\" Stein Dec. 2 \u00b6 20. While the Second Circuit has clarified that the \"matching requirement\" does not \"require absolute identity\" (as a \"FOIA requester would have little need for undisclosed information if it had to match precisely information previously disclosed\"), this does not imply that any overlap in information satisfies the matching requirement or that courts should not consider the specific nuances and contexts of the documents being compared.\n   <em>\n    N.Y. Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p114\">\n    756 F.3d at 116, 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 n.20 (affirming that the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test \"remains the law of this Circuit\" and finding the documents there in question \"virtually parallel[ed]\" each other). Here, the disclosed documents, while they may overlap to some degree with the subjects of conversation in the cables, do not relate the same discussions and, accordingly, by no means match or are as specific as the information redacted from the cables, as required by\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the information at issue has not been officially disclosed and that State has not waived its right to assert exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exemption 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government argues that it has properly withheld information in all the documents concerned pursuant to FOIA exemption 1. Exemption 1 permits the government to withhold records that are \"(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Executive Order 13526 allows an agency to withhold information that is (1) classified by an \"original classification authority,\" (2) \"owned by, produced by or for or [ ] under the control of the United States Government;\" (3) \"pertains to\" one of the categories of information specified in the Executive order,\" and (4) if \"unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable and describable damage to the national security.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%20707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.1 (a) (1)-(4). The specific categories relevant here are \"(a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations; (b) foreign government information; (c) intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology,\" and \"(d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources.\" E.O. 13526 \u00a7 1.1(a) (1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The rationales given in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index for the various redactions fall into two general categories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Dec.; Stein Dec. 2. First, the Government argues that disclosure of some of the redacted information would result in general harms to U.S. national security, such as \"reducing the likelihood that senior foreign officials will be willing to convey sensitive information to the U.S. government\" because the government did not keep the information confidential here, or \"revealing diplomatic strategies, including points of leverage and influence,\" and accordingly reducing these strategies' future effectiveness. Second, the Government argues that disclosure of some of the withheld information would result in specific harms in the Iraqi context, by either damaging U.S. relationships with foreign officials, some of whom remain active in Iraqi politics, or damaging stability in Iraq by revealing U.S. assessments or Iraqi officials' comments that could inflame political tensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Osen contends that the Government cannot plausibly claim either general or specific harms from disclosing this information as it already exists in the public domain on WikiLeaks. Osen argues that \"[i]t is a matter of common sense that the presence of information in the public domain makes the disclosures of that information less likely to cause damage to the national security.\" Pl. Br. at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wash. Post v.

But, as the D.C. District Court case Osen cites for this point makes clear, \"[i]t does not, however, follow that agencies must always disclose information already in the public domain,\" and courts have accordingly \"treated agency justifications for withholding information already in the public domain with the same deference [they] accord[ ] to all agency justifications under Exemption 1.\"\n   <em>\n    Wash.

Holding otherwise would afford unwarranted power to leakers to force official government disclosure. It would, in effect, reward theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this case, State's submissions clearly and plausibly outline why the harms it traces from official disclosure of the redacted information remain a risk despite any unofficial disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Dec. 2\n   \u00b6 26 (detailing the national security risks of official disclosures with regards to the various types of information withheld, such as removing plausible deniability or forcing a response or retaliation from a foreign government). These rationales are consistent with the Second Circuit's recognition in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   that anything short of an official acknowledgement \"necessarily preserves some increment of doubt regarding the reliability of the publicly available information,\" which serves the purpose of protecting \"the accuracy of the facts stated ... and whether there is anything left to hide on the subject.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n    586 F.3d at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   Court explicitly \"decline[d] to discount the importance of such 'lingering doubts' to maintaining the secrecy of CIA sources and methods ... and to preserving the options of deniability and professed ignorance that remain important niceties of international relations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These same concerns are fairly raised here by State's confidential exchanges with foreign government officials and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's remaining arguments simply dispute State's assertions regarding the risks posed by disclosure, for instance, arguing that so much information about the conflict in Iraq is in the public domain already that adding more information would have no effect. But such bald assertions are not sufficient to overcome the detailed affidavits submitted by State to the contrary, which are afforded a presumption of good faith as there is no evidence of bad faith and no contradicting evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686855\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/60/#p69\">\n    592 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   69 ;\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518307\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/125/#p133\">\n    901 F.3d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
