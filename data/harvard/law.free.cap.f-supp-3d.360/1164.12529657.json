(ECF No. 125.) Plaintiffs filed a version of a motion for reconsideration titled \"Motion for Partial Relief from Order Granting In Part Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration\" (\"Relief Motion\") asking the Court to strike the cost-shifting provisions in the arbitration contracts of Mantooth and the remaining opt-in plaintiffs. (ECF No. 127.) Defendants then filed a motion to strike certain exhibits attached to Plaintiffs' reply in support of the Relief Motion or, in the alternative, to allow a sur-reply (\"Motion to Strike\"). (ECF No. 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court grants in part Defendants' Reconsideration Motion; grants in part Defendants' Motion to Strike; and grants in part Plaintiffs' Relief Motion in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The underlying factual basis for these motions is discussed in the Order. Familiarity with that factual background is presumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In relevant summary, named Plaintiffs and opt-in plaintiffs Darr and Jessica Lopez signed \"Entertainment License Agreements\" to work at Shotgun Willie's. These agreements contained an arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 57-2 \u00b6 22.) That provision delegated exclusive authority to resolve disputes over the validity or enforceability of the agreement to the arbitrator; allowed Defendants to insist on an arbitrator \"experienced in the adult entertainment industry\"; and contained four provisions concerning arbitration fees and costs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the entertainer and the club unless the arbitrator concludes that a different allocation is required by law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.A.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"In the event that any party challenges, or is required to initiate proceedings to enforce, the arbitration requirements of this paragraph 22, the prevailing party to such challenges and/or enforcement proceedings shall be entitled to an award of all costs, including actual and reasonable attorney fees, incurred in litigation such issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.D.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"Any ruling arising out of a claim between the parties shall, to the extent not precluded by applicable law, award costs incurred for the proceedings and reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.E.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The arbitrator \"shall be permitted to award, subject only to the restrictions contained in this paragraph 22, any relief available in a court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.A.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 16, 2017, Defendants moved to compel \"Plaintiffs\"-defined as \"named Plaintiffs, Alexandra Darr and Jessica Lopez\"-to arbitrate their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 57 at 2 n.2.) In response, \"Plaintiffs\"-defined as \"Named and Opt-in Plaintiffs,\n   and putative class/collective action members\"-objected to the motion to compel in part because the fee- and cost-shifting provisions of their arbitration agreements prevented \"Plaintiffs\" from effectively vindicating their claims. (ECF No. 86 at 1 n.1, 11.) In support, these Plaintiffs submitted evidence from Bujok, Darr, Nagle, and Raffaele about their ability to share arbitration costs, as well as the financial hardship the cost-sharing provision would impose. (ECF Nos. 86-5, 86-6, 86-8 &amp; 86-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In its Order, the Court granted in part the motion to compel. (ECF No. 124.) The Court also found that, for Bujok, Darr, Nagle, and Raffaele, arbitration costs would be thousands to tens of thousands of dollars; \"the cost-sharing provisions of the arbitration clause would prevent effective vindication of their claims\"; and thus the Court severed the cost-sharing provisions for those individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) The Court did not, however, sever the cost-sharing provisions for Mantooth or Lopez because they did not submit evidence of financial hardship. The Court also severed certain fee-shifting provisions and the arbitrator selection clause-a provision that would have allowed Defendants to demand an arbitrator \"experienced in the adult entertainment industry\"-for named Plaintiffs, Darr, and Lopez because in the Court's view such clauses would have prevented effective vindication of Plaintiffs' rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Five days after the Court's Order, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems Corporation v.

The Supreme Court held that the National Labor Relations Act, which \"secures to employees rights to organize unions and bargain collectively,\" did not \"manifest[ ] a clear intention to displace the Arbitration Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/#p1619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/#p1619\">\n    at 1619, 1632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the arbitration contracts at issue in\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   -which required employees to arbitrate individually rather than collectively- were to be enforced as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   , Defendants filed their Reconsideration Motion arguing that\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   eviscerated the effective vindication doctrine. (ECF No. 125.) Defendants asked that the Court revisit its decision to strike the fee- and cost-shifting provisions under the effective vindication doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Relief Motion asking the Court to invalidate the cost-sharing requirement for \"the remaining Plaintiffs (named Plaintiff Chada Mantooth and opt-in Plaintiffs Ariel Cline, Samantha Hattlestad, Ashley Howard, Jessica Lopez, and Allison Bonham)\" as \" 'similarly situated employees' to the Plaintiffs who previously submitted declarations.\" (ECF No. 127 at 2.) Plaintiffs attached affidavits from Mantooth, Cline, Hattlestad, Howard, Lopez, and Bonham about their inability to pay arbitration costs. (ECF Nos. 127-1, 127-2, 127-3, 127-4, 127-5 &amp; 127-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs attached two exhibits to their reply in support of their Relief Motion about the expense of arbitration. (ECF Nos. 140-1 &amp; 140-2.) Defendants then filed the Motion to Strike those exhibits and asked that the Court disregard any new arguments that relied on the newly-included information.

Colo. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before analyzing the parties' motions, the Court addresses two preliminary matters. First, the subject Order directed the Clerk of Court to administratively close this case, subject to reopening for good cause shown after the conclusion of the individual arbitration proceedings. The parties have not specifically requested reopening of the case in their motions currently pending before the Court. Nonetheless, the Court finds that good cause exists for reopening this matter and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   orders that the case be reopened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the Court clarifies the scope of the initial Order compelling arbitration. On October 16, 2017, Defendants sought to compel \"Plaintiffs\"-defined as Mantooth, Bujok, Darr, Lopez, Nagle, and Raffaele-to arbitrate their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 57.) At that time, Bonham, Cline, Hattlestad, and Howard had also opted into the litigation by filing notices of consent to join.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nos. 12, 15, 16 &amp; 17.) Because Defendants moved for arbitration only as to Mantooth, Bujok, Darr, Lopez, Nagle, and Raffaele, the Court's corresponding Order therefore applies only to those individuals, and does not apply to Bonham, Cline, Hattlestad, and Howard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Motion to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants ask the Court to reconsider its Order severing the fee- and cost-shifting provisions in light of\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   , issued a mere five days after the May 16, 2018 Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Bus.

The effective vindication doctrine remains viable after\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   . As discussed in the Order and further discussed below, Plaintiffs have made sufficient financial showings that the burden of fees and costs will effectively and prospectively prevent them from bringing their claims in arbitration. Thus, the Court will not revisit its conclusion that those provisions, as applied to Plaintiffs, prospectively prevent Plaintiffs from effectively vindicating their statutory FLSA rights in arbitration and that severance of those provisions is appropriate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Clarifying Scope of the Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants raise a question about the scope of the Court's prior Order. The Court ordered that \"the fee-shifting provision in the arbitration clause are unenforceable and will be severed\" (ECF No. 124 at 14), but later stated that \"[a]ny portion of any Agreement that any Plaintiff may have with Defendants is SEVERED to the extent it (a) establishes a fee-shifting obligation different from those established [under the FLSA]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that none of the severed provisions directly conflict with the FLSA, and thus the Court improperly severed the provisions. To the extent these rulings have created any ambiguity on this point, the Court will clarify its prior Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court previously found that the fee-shifting provisions, which allowed Defendants to recover fees and costs for arbitrating Plaintiffs' FLSA claims, erected a barrier to the effective vindication of Plaintiffs' FLSA claims. It was the Court's intent to sever all fee- and cost-shifting obligations because they prevented effective vindication of Plaintiffs' FLSA claims, but to nonetheless allow Plaintiffs to recover attorneys' fees and costs in the event they are prevailing parties, consistent with the private attorney general enforcement scheme of the FLSA. In other words, the arbitrator will be free to award any manner of relief otherwise available in the federal court litigation of FLSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Defendants ask the Court to reconsider its prior Order based on arguments other than the\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   decision, Defendants have failed to provide any new facts, law, or circumstances, or argued mistake of law or fact, or otherwise plausibly argued why such relief is appropriate and necessary to effect the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Servants of the Paraclete\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11476121\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1005/#p1012\">\n    204 F.3d at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs previously established, and the Court credited, that the cost of arbitration was likely to be at least thousands of dollars. (ECF No. 124 at 15.) The Court concludes, therefore, that the cost-shifting provision of the arbitration agreements would prevent Mantooth and Lopez from effectively vindicating their rights under the FLSA. In the interest of justice and toward the end of promoting resolution of remedial claims under the FLSA on their merits, the Court grants Plaintiffs' Relief Motion as to Mantooth and Lopez, and severs the cost-shifting provisions of their arbitration contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the Court grants the Relief Motion in the interest of justice, it does not address, nor express any opinion on, the merits of Plaintiffs' alternative excusable neglect and mistake of fact or law arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Court DIRECTS the Clerk of Court to reopen the case for good cause shown;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2. Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED IN PART (ECF No. 125) to clarify the scope of the Court's prior Order (ECF No. 124) with respect to the fee-and cost-shifting clauses as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   a.

Any portion of any Agreement that Plaintiffs Mantooth or Lopez may have with Defendants is SEVERED to the extent that it establishes an obligation to split the costs of arbitration equally between Plaintiffs and Defendants; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   b. The remainder of Plaintiffs' Motion is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   4. Defendants' Motion to Strike (ECF No. 142) is GRANTED IN PART, and the attachments to Plaintiffs' reply in support of their Relief Motion are stricken, and the remainder of Defendants' Motion is DENIED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   5. The claims of the named Plaintiffs, as well as of opt-in plaintiffs Darr and Lopez, REMAIN STAYED pending the conclusion of their individual arbitration proceedings. The claims of opt-in plaintiffs Bonham, Cline, Hattlestad, and Howard remain pending before this Court; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   6. Counsel are directed to contact the Chambers of U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty to set a status conference in this matter on the claims of opt-in plaintiffs Bonham, Cline, Hattlestad, and Howard.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The arbitration provisions in the operative versions of each agreement signed by the named Plaintiffs are identical. (ECF Nos. 57-2, 57-4, 57-8 &amp; 57-10.) Defendants also imply that Darr and Lopez had identical arbitration agreements, although those agreements are not before the Court. (ECF No. 57 at 2 n.2.) Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that implicit claim. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 82.) Thus, for purposes of analysis, the Court will assume that the arbitration clauses in the contracts of the named Plaintiffs, Darr, and Lopez are identical.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The named Plaintiffs in this action are Mantooth, Bujok, Nagle, and Raffaele.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    It should be noted that Defendants do not seek reconsideration of the portion of the Court's Order severing the arbitrator selection clause, even though it was severed under the same effective vindication rationale as the fee- and cost-shifting provisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Defendants' motion to compel was, in fact, a renewed motion to compel. Defendants initially moved to compel arbitration on June 26, 2017. On July 19, 2017, the Court denied Defendants' initial motion without prejudice subject to later refiling after limited, expedited discovery. (ECF No. 38.) The renewed motion to compel was not a replica of the prior motion. Defendants added to their definition of \"Plaintiffs\" both Darr and Lopez, who filed notices of consent to join on July 12, 2017, and September 5, 2017, respectively, after Defendants' initial motion to compel.

In the broad discretion reserved to courts for reconsideration of their interlocutory orders, the Court looks to Rule 60 for guidance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In their reply in support of the Relief Motion, Plaintiffs submit two exhibits regarding the cost of arbitration, which are the subject of Defendants' Motion to Strike. (ECF Nos. 140-1, 140-2 &amp; 142.) Defendants alternatively move to file a sur-reply. (ECF No. 142.) The Court has already credited Plaintiffs' evidence and found that arbitration costs range from \"thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, to '\n    <em>\n     fifty\n    </em>\n    times the basic costs of litigating in a judicial, rather than arbitral forum.' \" (ECF No. 124 at 15 (citing ECF No. 86 at 12) (emphasis in original).) The Court sees no reason to revisit that finding, even though Defendants question its premise in their response to the Relief Motion. Thus, the Court need not rely on the exhibits because it has already found the cost of arbitration to be much greater than the cost of litigating before this Court. In addition, because the exhibits were attached to Plaintiffs' reply brief, Defendants have not had an opportunity to respond to the arguments that depend on these exhibits, and thus seek to exclude them from the Court's consideration. Because of the belated inclusion of these exhibits and because the Court's decision today does not rely on them, the Court grants Defendants' Motion to Strike (ECF No. 142). Because the Court grants the primary relief Defendants request, the Court denies the alternative relief requested.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
