EOS has sued defendant Derek Pew, an officer and director of Mediacast, who signed the agreement on behalf of the company. EOS seeks to recover its share of monies it contends Mediacast\n   failed to turn over from the proceeds from the distribution and showing of three films it had produced. Having already obtained a judgment against Mediacast on the agreement, EOS now seeks to collect from Pew, contending he is a trustee of the monies owed EOS under the agreement. In short, EOS argues the agreement created a trust to hold EOS's share of the proceeds and Pew failed to turn over the trust funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pew has moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. He argues that EOS has not stated a cause of action for breach of trust because there was no trust. Pew contends that even if one had been created, he cannot be liable because the agreement was between EOS and Mediacast, not between EOS and him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that EOS has failed to state a cause of action against Pew for breach of trust. Pew was not a trustee of the trust created to hold EOS's share of theater receipts. Therefore, we shall grant Pew's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   EOS produces documentary films about famous artists and their works.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The films are presented through distributors who arrange showings with theaters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mediacast agreed to distribute three films produced by EOS in North America.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   EOS and Mediacast entered into a distributorship agreement on November 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the agreement, Mediacast contracted with theaters to screen the films and generate box office receipts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   From the box office receipts, each theatre retained its share and remitted the balance to Mediacast.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   From that amount, Mediacast deducted its share and costs, yielding \"Net Receipts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement provided that the net receipts were to be \"held in trust for EOS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite its repeated demands, EOS received no payments, books, or records of the films.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mediacast closed its business in January 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 29, 2017, EOS filed a related suit against Mediacast to recover its share of the receipts generated by the screenings of its films arranged by Mediacast.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mediacast never responded.

The parties to the agreement, EOS and Mediacast, expressly stated their intention that Mediacast would hold EOS's share of the box\n   office receipts in trust. Consequently, the net receipts were to be segregated and not commingled with Mediacast's funds. The subject matter was clearly defined as \"Net Receipts.\" The trustee was designated as Mediacast. Thus, a trust was created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even though the agreement created a trust with EOS as beneficiary, EOS has not stated a cause of action against Pew for a breach of the trust. The complaint does not allege that Pew agreed to serve as the trustee or personally assume any duties. Pew was not a party to the agreement. Mediacast, not Pew, agreed to hold the receipts in trust for EOS. Although Pew signed the agreement, he did so \"for and on behalf\" of Mediacast.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Pew unambiguously signed on behalf of Mediacast, he is not personally liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   13 Pa.

Noting receipt of funds, a ministerial act, does not make Pew a trustee. Even if it did, EOS does not allege that Pew accepted them as a trustee.

Stated differently, for the agent for the corporation to be held personally liable, \"he must have made promises while acting in his individual capacity-that is, intending to bind himself personally.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Fed.%20Appx.%20399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nowhere in the complaint does EOS allege Pew, in his individual capacity, made promises or intended to bind himself personally to Mediacast's contract. The acts EOS attributes to Pew were done as Mediacast's agent. The complaint alleges that Pew \"personally negotiated, and executed, an agreement on behalf of Mediacast\" and that it was \"Defendant's company's agreement to hold\" the funds on trust for EOS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, it alleges Pew\n   \"stated his company declare[s] that it shall hold [net receipts] on trust for EOS,\" instructed the accounting department to document receipts, failed to preserve the trust funds, and had ultimate control of the financial and accounting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   These alleged facts do not provide a basis for holding Pew liable under a participation theory. Pew cannot be liable for Mediacast's breach of its contractual duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   EOS seeks to hold Pew personally liable by alleging that in failing to preserve the trust funds, he breached \"his fiduciary duty\" as a corporate officer and director. If Pew owed a fiduciary duty, it was to Mediacast with whom he had a relationship, not to EOS, with whom he had no relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   EOS requests leave to amend its complaint under Rule 15(a)(2) to cure any deficiencies. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Pew does not address EOS's request for leave to amend, nor does he argue that he would suffer any prejudice by an amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Given the liberality of Rule 15(a), we shall allow EOS to file an amended complaint. If it elects to do so, EOS must state with particularity the facts upon which it relies to show that Pew, in his personal capacity, is liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   EOS has not stated a cause of action against Pew for breach of trust. Therefore, we shall grant Pew's motion to dismiss and grant EOS leave to file a motion to amend its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9 (ECF No. 1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 12.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27-33, 42.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 28.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Exhibition on Screen, Ltd. v.
