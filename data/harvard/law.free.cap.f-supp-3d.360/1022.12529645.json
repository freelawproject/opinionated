However, as Defendant points out, most of those cases have a key feature that this case lacks, and one that \u00a7 3142(a) requires: that the person whom the government urges should be detained have\n   been \"charged with an offense,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That distinction matters, Defendant urges, because the basis for possible detention under \u00a7 3142 is the existence of an indictment to supply such a charged offense, and, here, there is no such indictment upon which detention could be based.

Properly interpreted, Section 3142 does not allow the Government to detain an individual who is not \"charged with an offense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   That reasoning applies here. As in\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sales\n   </em>\n   , once this Court granted Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, there was no \"charged ... offense\" on which the Court could order him detained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; Order Granting Mot. to Dismiss.

Opp. at 4. It offers three arguments for that position. First, it urges, \"these decisions suggest that appeals from dismissals of single-count indictments are somehow different from multi-count indictments, at least as far as the Bail Reform Act is concerned. These statutes do not support such a distinction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not distinguish between types of government appeals.

And as to that question, for the reasons\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   explained, the answer is clear: A person may only be detained under \u00a7 3142 when they are \"charged with an offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137216\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/772/#p790\">\n    3 F.Supp.3d at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As it stands, Defendant is not charged with an offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Mot. to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, the government argues, \" \u00a7 3143(c) does not distinguish between multi-count and single-count indictments when directing the courts to apply the Bail Reform Act pending appeal under section 3731.\" Gov. Opp. at 5. As with the Government's first argument, however, while this is true, it has no effect on this Court's analysis. And that is because the basis for this Court's continued ability to determine whether to detain the Defendant does not turn on the type of appeal under \u00a7 3143, but on whether there is a pending charge that could supply this Court with the authority, under \u00a7 3142, to detain him. Section 3143(c)(2) simply directs the court to \"treat a defendant in a case in which an appeal has been taken by the United States ... in accordance with section 3142.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203143\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). As already explained, because \u00a7 3142 recognizes as a threshold matter the need for a charged offense on which to premise a defendant's potential detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203143\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3142(a), there is a difference between an appeal taken from the dismissal of an entire indictment and the dismissal of one count of a multi-count indictment. In the latter case, there is still a pending charge that provides the requisite basis for the \u00a7 3142 inquiry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203143\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the former, by contrast, once a Court dismisses the indictment, a defendant is no longer \"charged with an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   , 3 F.Supp. at 790. So, the nature of the appeal-from the dismissal of an entire indictment or from other types of orders-is relevant not to \u00a7 3143 but to \u00a7 3142(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 3143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Third and finally, the government argues that, as a practical matter, if the Ninth Circuit reinstates the indictment or this Court grants a motion for reconsideration as to the indictment, \"[t]he government will not need to re-file any charges, or otherwise initiate proceedings, which underscores that there is a charge on which to hold the defendant and on which to reach the question of detention.\" Opp. at 5. But the Government provides no support, or indeed, explanation, for the claim that because an indictment might be reinstated, the dismissed indictment can be the basis of a \"charged ... offense\" under \u00a7 3142(a). The Court thus finds the Government's arguments unpersuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court thus concludes that it lacks the authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to detain Defendant.

Stay of Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although, for the reasons explained above, the Court lacks the authority under \u00a7 3142 to continue to detain Defendant, the Court recognizes that the Government is in the process of requesting that the Ninth Circuit remand this case for further proceedings. Gov. Resp. to Court's Request (Dkt. 50).

Gov. Opp. at 4. The first, a footnote from a dissent in an\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    Seventh Circuit decision, merely states the noncontroversial proposition that \"[f]or purposes of pretrial release, when the government takes an appeal pursuant to section 3731,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203143\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) requires the district court to treat the defendant as if the case were still active and apply the criteria set forth in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Opp. at 4, 5. While true, the statement that the case must be viewed as \"active\" and that \u00a7 3142 must be applied to it does not provide support for the Government's claim that a defendant without any charged offense may nevertheless be detained. It simply instructs courts to apply \u00a7 3142 while the government's appeal is pending.\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277252\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/712/\">\n     793 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    729 n.5 (Rovner, J., dissenting). In the second, the court dismissed all but one count against the defendant-and so there remained one offense with which the defendant was charged.\n    <em>\n     United States v. Ailemen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7847735\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/165/571/#p574\">\n     165 F.R.D. 571\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 574 (N.D. Cal. 1996). Finally, in the third, when the indictment was dismissed in its entirety, the Court did not detain him.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Mich. 2018). While\n    <em>\n     McMichael\n    </em>\n    also determined that \"the terms of release\" on the defendant pending a possible notice of appeal,\n    <em>\n     McMichael\n    </em>\n    neither addressed, as this Court does, a motion for release from custody, nor it did offer any explanation as to whether that decision was consistent with the requirement of \u00a7 3142(a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
