Batiste's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 35. Chief Batiste moves for summary judgment on all claims made by Plaintiff Jade Wilcox, who opposes Chief Batiste's motion, ECF No. 56. The Court has considered the parties' arguments, briefings, and the record, and is fully informed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the state of Washington, the Washington State Patrol (\"WSP\") creates Police Traffic Collision Reports (\"PTCRs\") when responding to the scene of a car accident. ECF No. 3-6. The PTCRs include, among other things, the name, address, driver's license number, telephone number, and other identifying information about the drivers involved in the car accidents, as well as the names and information of any witness to the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The WSP creates the PTCRs using a program called SECTOR. ECF No. 5-4 at 2. SECTOR is a program installed on a WSP officer's computer that works by scanning the bar code on a driver's license or motor vehicle registration to auto-populate the information into the PTCR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-3 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The WSP allows public access to PTCRs on the Washington Requests for Electronic Collision Reports website. ECF No. 5-1 at 2. This website allows members of the public to search through PTCRs and request access to them for a fee of $ 10.50 for each collision report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the requestor was not an involved party or a representative of an involved party, the WSP would redact birth date and driver's license numbers from the report, but otherwise would leave uncensored the rest of the document, including the parties' names, addresses, and telephone numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Wilcox was involved in a car accident on July 9, 2016. ECF No. 3-1 at 2. Five days later, Ms. Wilcox received a letter from a law firm in Spokane soliciting her business for its automobile injury practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The letter explained that the law firm obtained Ms. Wilcox's information from the PTCR public records request process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Collision Records Manager for the WSP later confirmed that the WSP disclosed Ms. Wilcox's July 9, 2016, PTCR to the law firm pursuant to a request on the Washington Requests for Electronic Collision Report website. ECF No. 5-1 at 2-3. The WSP redacted Ms. Wilcox's birth date and driver's license number, but otherwise left Ms. Wilcox's name, address, and telephone number uncensored.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following these events, Ms. Wilcox filed this class action complaint against Chief Batiste, the head of the WSP, and 300 John Does. ECF No. 1. Ms. Wilcox alleged that Chief Batiste's policies with the WSP violated the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2725, because he knowingly disclosed personal information from motor vehicle records of Ms. Wilcox and others by providing uncensored PTCRs to third parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Wilcox also alleged that Chief Batiste violated her and others' constitutional right to privacy and committed the common law tort of invasion of privacy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    at 33-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Wilcox later re-alleged these claims in an amended complaint. ECF No. 39. Ms. Wilcox seeks monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Wilcox also moved for a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 3. In her motion for a preliminary injunction, she argued that Chief Batiste violated the DPPA and that\n   she and the class would suffer irreparable harm if the disclosure policies were not enjoined because their personal information could be dangerously disseminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Chief Batiste opposed the motion. ECF No. 5. Following a hearing, ECF No. 13, this Court instituted a preliminary injunction, finding that Ms. Wilcox and the putative class were likely to succeed on the merits, that they would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, and that the balance of equities and the public interest weighed in favor of granting the injunction. ECF No. 14. The Court ordered Chief Batiste to redact addresses, driver's license numbers, dates of birth, information about sex, height, and weight from PTCRs before distribution to third parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Chief Batiste now moves this Court for summary judgment on all of Ms. Wilcox's and the putative class's claims.

Ms. Wilcox failed to respond to these arguments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 56.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The failure to respond to arguments on a motion can be construed as consent to the entry of an order against the party that failed to respond. LCivR 7(e). Because Ms. Wilcox failed to respond to Chief Batiste's motion for summary judgment on the constitutional privacy claim or common law invasion of privacy claim, the Court grants summary judgment for both claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Additionally, even if Ms. Wilcox did not abandon her claim for invasion of privacy, Ms. Wilcox failed to show that she filed a claim with the Office of Risk Management (\"ORM\") prior to filing this lawsuit.
