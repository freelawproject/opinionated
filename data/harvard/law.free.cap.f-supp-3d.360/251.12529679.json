On November 8, 2018, after receiving full briefing and oral argument from both sides, the Court denied WCF's motion to confirm the order of attachment and lifted the attachment already in place.

WCF first contends that an award of fees is not merited as Shrem was \"not a prevailing party on attachment.\" Plaintiff Winklevoss Capital Fund, LLC's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs (\"Opp.\"), Dkt. 83, at 2-3. WCF relies on case law interpreting private parties' fee agreements and statutory fee provisions other than Rule 6212(e) for this argument since the language of \"prevailing parties\" is nowhere to be found in Rule 6212(e), which conditions a fee award solely on an attachment and a subsequent vacatur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Even assuming, contrary to the plain language of Rule 6212(e), that an additional \"prevailing party\" element must be shown, Shrem has clearly made such a showing here, since, as a result of his submissions, WCF's motion was denied and the attachment vacated. Yet WCF argues that it too \"prevailed\" because, at the oral argument on the motion to confirm attachment, Shrem's counsel offered to put $ 61,000 into an escrow account pending judgment in this matter and the Court ordered Shrem to do so, clarifying that the order was \"independent of where [the Court] come[s] out on the attachment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Transcript dated November 8, 2018, at 19:15-20. As WCF had only managed to attach assets of a de minimis value before the attachment was vacated, WCF takes the position that it \"partially prevailed\" on the issue of attachment as it attained more financial security after the attachment order was vacated than while it was in effect. Opp. at 3-4. It may be the case that WCF found itself in a better\n   financial position immediately after the hearing than immediately before,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, it is irrelevant as the controlling fact is that attachment was granted and then vacated. The funds in escrow are unrelated to the attachment issue, as the Court stated; moreover, New York courts have explicitly distinguished between funds placed in escrow and funds subjected to an order of attachment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds no merit to WCF's argument that it \"partially prevailed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Next, WCF argues that fees should not be awarded as \"Shrem suffered no actual attachment to speak of\" as WCF only succeeded in attaching a \"de minimis\" amount of assets (less than $ 5) prior to the vacatur. Opp. at 4. However, Rule 6212(e) is clear: plaintiff is liable \"for all costs and damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees\" where plaintiff is granted an attachment and later found unentitled to that attachment. Of course, as WCF points out, a defendant is not entitled to fees where no order of attachment was ever granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Augsbury v.

The facts in\n   <em>\n    Kidder\n   </em>\n   were unusual.

Accordingly, the legislature has structured the statutory scheme governing attachments to encourage appropriately sparing use of ex parte attachment, both by providing an alternative means of securing property (through a temporary restraining order issued pursuant to C.P.L.R. \u00a7 6210 )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by shifting the costs of an improper attachment to the plaintiff through Rule 6212(e). Rule 6212(e) explicitly includes attorneys' fees as part of these costs on the understanding that attorneys' fees incurred attempting to remove an attachment are damages resulting from that attachment. Here, while plaintiff failed to attach anywhere near the amount of property that it hoped to with the ex parte attachment order, it did receive such an order, pursue attachment for over a month, successfully attach some amount of property, and force the defendant to incur legal costs in seeking to vacate the attachment. This is exactly the kind of endeavor that Rule 6212(e) seeks to deter where there is no valid legal basis for attachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, WCF argues that fees should be denied as the attachment was vacated for a \"technical\" rather than a \"substantive\" reason. Opp. at 6. This is incorrect. As the Court clearly stated in its memorandum explaining the denial of the motion to confirm attachment, it denied the motion because WCF \"failed to meet its burden to establish that either of the[ ] [claimed] grounds for attachment applies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum dated November 15, 2018, Dkt. 59, at 3. It is difficult to imagine a more substantive reason for vacatur. WCF argues, despite this explanation, that the vacatur was \"technical\" because Shrem's offer to place $ 61,000 in escrow \"obviated the need for attachment.\" Opp. at 6-7. As discussed above, $ 61,000 in escrow hardly substitutes for the attachment of $ 31,362,500 worth of bitcoin sought by WCF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Shrem is entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Rule 6212(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A determination that an attachment is unwarranted is not a determination on the merits of the underlying action, and does not entitle a party to its attorneys' fees in its conduct of the case as a whole, but only to those fees incurred as a direct result of the wrongful attachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, Shrem's fee request fails to isolate those tasks specific to the order of attachment and instead includes a number of hours more properly allocated to the general conduct of the case. For instance, the billing records submitted to the Court include time spent pursuing unsealing of\n   the case and working with plaintiff's counsel to create a joint discovery plan. These activities are largely or wholly unrelated to the issue of attachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The billing records also include time spent checking the docket, reading the complaint, and reviewing the Court's rules. Shrem argues that this time is appropriately included as \"[n]o reasonable or prudent attorney would undertake to oppose an attachment motion without first reviewing the operative complaint...\". Opp. at 10-11. This is, of course, true. However, in the Court's view, a reasonable defense attorney must always review the complaint in the case, regardless of whether or not there is an order of attachment at issue. This is a cost of litigation, not a cost incurred by an improper attachment of assets. The same holds true for activities such as checking the docket and reviewing the Court's rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The billing records also include a number of entries for client calls and strategy meetings of unspecified subject matter. It is doubtful that the sole focus of these meetings and calls was the order of attachment, particularly as the time period concerned covers Shrem's initial retention of counsel and their preliminary investigation and development of their case as a whole, which would have to be undertaken regardless of any order of attachment. Similarly, the time billed to investigation of WCF's allegations in the complaint concerning the transfer of 5,000 bitcoin, while relevant to Shrem's argument on attachment and, accordingly, properly included in this fee request in part, was an expense that Shrem would have surely undertaken in any circumstances as part of his defense on the merits and should not be included in full in this fee request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Without multiplying examples, the Court finds that the claimed fees should be reduced by 40%. Accordingly, the Court finds a fee award of $ 44,986.80 appropriate, which represents 60% of Shrem's adjusted lodestar request. The Court finds such a reduction warranted given the inclusion of litigation activities not properly attributable to the attachment order in the fee request. The Court finds Shrem's request for costs reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, Shrem is hereby awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $ 44,986.80 and costs in the amount of $ 1,053.
