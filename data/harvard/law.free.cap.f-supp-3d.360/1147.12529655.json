Dkt. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 28, 2018, the Court requested supplemental briefing on whether the entry of Officer Brusseau and Bogey onto Edmiston's property constituted a search, whether the search would have been reasonable, and whether Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity. Dkts. 25, 29. On October 19, 2018, the parties filed supplemental briefs. Dkts. 31, 37. On October 26, 2018, the parties responded. Dkts. 41, 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Edmiston asserts that an accidental dog bite committed by a police canine violated his right to be free of unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Edmiston offers two theories towards establishing a seizure and one towards establishing a search, but devotes much of his briefing discussing the reasonableness of the police intrusion-inapplicable arguments if he fails to establish that a search or seizure occurred. Defendants move for judgment, arguing that Edmiston cannot support a cognizable \u00a7 1983 action when, as here, an unintentional tort is committed by someone who happens to be a government actor. Bogey did \"seize\" upon Edmiston, at least within the meaning of common vernacular, when he bit Edmiston's leg while tracking an unrelated suspect. The issue thus turns on whether that mistaken \"seizure\" can support Edmiston's \u00a7 1983 action under the Fourth Amendment. The Court agrees with Defendants and concludes that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Fourth Amendment Seizure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Violation of the Fourth Amendment requires an intentional acquisition of physical control. A seizure occurs even when an unintended person or thing is the object of the detention or taking, but the detention or taking itself must be willful.\"\n   <em>\n    Brower v. Cty. of Inyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    489 U.S. 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (internal citations omitted). This principle distinguishes intentional seizures that support Fourth Amendment claims from unintentional or accidental mistakes that support liability in tort. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   , the Court described a hypothetical tort where an unoccupied police car slips a brake and pins a passerby against a wall, then concluded that it would not be a Fourth Amendment violation because, although the passerby was detained, the government had not interfered with the passerby's freedom \"\n   <em>\n    through means intentionally applied.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    489 U.S. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Edmiston uses\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   to argue that because PAPD intended to use Bogey and because Edmiston was stopped by the very instrumentality (Bogey) that PAPD used, a seizure is established. But Edmiston's argument ignores the\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   court's key distinction between intentional actions and accidental mistakes-i.e., that the police in\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   acted with intent, both in pursuing Brower as a suspect, and in deploying the roadblock means that ultimately stopped him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is undisputed that Officer Brusseau deployed Bogey, and this deployment was intentional. Dkts. 12, 20. Officer Brusseau, however, did not deploy Bogey with an intent to seize Edmiston, but rather to pursue a suspect driver of a stolen vehicle. While Edmiston was harmed by the precise means PAPD deployed, the distinction here turns not on the means used, but whether PAPD intentionally used Bogey\n   <em>\n    to detain Edmiston.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The entirety of the evidence submitted by Edmiston and taken in the light most favorable to him plainly demonstrates the unintentional nature of his detention. A conclusion that Edmiston establishes a seizure simply because PAPD intended to use Bogey at all would eliminate any meaningful distinction between intentional and unintentional government action, which is clearly contrary to the authority in this area of law. Accordingly, Edmiston fails to establish that he was subject to an intentional Fourth Amendment seizure under the theory that PAPD and Officer Brusseau intentionally deployed Bogey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Edmiston next attempts to establish an intentional seizure by arguing that he was mistakenly subjected to police detention, relying on the principle that a Fourth Amendment seizure occurs even when police subject an unintended person to their detention.

Under these principles, Edmiston's second theory of seizure also fails because he again ignores the requirement of intentional government action. Certainly, Edmiston conflates a police officer's\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   detention of an innocent person mistaken for a suspect with an officer's\n   <em>\n    unintentional or negligent\n   </em>\n   mistake, like the hypothetical car that slipped its brake, which subjects an innocent party to detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Andrade\n   </em>\n   is particularly instructive as to why Edmiston has not established a seizure.

Dkt. 15, 17-19.\n   <em>\n    Andrade\n   </em>\n   , however, is easily distinguishable, because it involved an intentional seizure of mistaken suspects and an accidental bite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    Andrade\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that Officer Brusseau never intended to pursue Edmiston. Edmiston, an innocent party, was never the subject of Officer Brusseau's search. And Officer Brusseau never confused Edmiston for the suspect, let alone going so far as to intentionally seize Edmiston on a mistaken belief that Edmiston was actually the suspect fleeing from the stolen vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Further, in comparison to the officer in\n   <em>\n    Andrade\n   </em>\n   , Officer Brusseau did not order Bogey to bite Edmiston or otherwise use Bogey to intentionally inhibit Edmiston's freedom in any way. Indeed, the facts taken in the light most favorable to Edmiston are devoid of any reference to action taken by Officer Brusseau that could possibly be construed as intentional\n   <em>\n    in regards to Edmiston.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Edmiston was not subject to intentional action by PAPD or Officer Brusseau that would support a seizure under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fourth Amendment Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finding no seizure, the Court next turns to Edmiston's theory of a search. The Fourth Amendment prohibits officers from entering enclosed curtilage without a warrant to the same extent that it prohibits them from entering a home.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Perea-Rey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881002\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1179/#p1184\">\n    680 F.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1184 (9th Cir. 2012). Edmiston argues that a search occurred because Bogey and Officers Brusseau and Fernie came onto the deck attached to his home and, he alleges, entered his home. Dkt. 15 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court notes that the search issue is fundamentally different than the seizure issue. This is because a seizure requires an intentional acquisition of physical control, while a search occurs when police \"physically occup[y] private property for the purpose of obtaining information.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, it is undisputed that Officer Brusseau and Bogey entered Edmiston's attached deck. Dkt. 42 at 3. Thus, Edmiston establishes that police physically occupied his private property. Edmiston argues that this physical entry alone is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   41 at 1-3. Defendants, however, focus on the gathering of information-contending that because Officer Brusseau neither investigated Edmiston's home nor sought to gather incriminating evidence as he passed briefly through its curtilage while tracking an unrelated suspect, then no Fourth Amendment search occurred.

Therefore, the question before this Court is whether Officer Brusseau's use of Bogey, who was following the organic materials sloughing off the suspect's body, constituted the gathering of evidence. Dkt. 38, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is not entirely clear to the Court what evidence, if any, Officer Brusseau gathered from Edmiston's curtilage. On the one hand, it could be argued that \"skin rafts,\" organic materials which are shed from the body and waft off a suspect, as well as the ground disturbed by a suspect's footfalls, are evidence. Dkt. 38, \u00b6 3. Under this broad definition, Officer Brusseau's use of Bogey, who relied on these signals to track the suspect and lead Officer Brusseau, could constitute information gathering under\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the other hand, if following a suspect's scent trail across an otherwise unrelated residential property does not constitute the gathering of evidence, then a Fourth Amendment search did not occur. Edmiston appears to concede that Officer Brusseau did not gather evidence by following the suspect's scent trail alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41 at 6 (\"A scent trail, by itself, is not 'evidence.' \"). If Edmiston concedes that a scent trail made up of organic materials is not evidence on its own, and so far, there is no controlling precedent before the Court that it is, then Officer Brusseau's use of Bogey to follow a suspect's scent trail across a residential property would not constitute the gathering of evidence. If Officer Brusseau did not gather evidence while he briefly occupied Edmiston's deck, then he did not \"search\" Edmiston's curtilage under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court, however, need not reach the question of the constitutional violation. This is because even if Officer Brusseau and Bogey searched Edmiston's curtilage as they crossed his deck while pursuing an unrelated suspect, Officer Brusseau would be afforded qualified immunity. Although Defendants did not explicitly raise the affirmative defense of qualified immunity, they implicitly referred to both questions a court must consider in their original briefing, and explicitly argued that it applies in their supplemental briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 11 at 1, 4, 8; 21 at 2, 6-9; 37 at 10-12; 42 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Qualified immunity immunizes police officers acting under color of law, as long as their conduct \"does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Indeed, in these cases, like most other Fourth Amendment authority cited by the parties, the police intentionally intruded into the suspect's constitutionally protected area while searching for incriminating evidence against the suspect: information gathering was thus presumed. No such conclusion can be drawn here, where Bogey, following the suspect's scent trail, directed Officer Brusseau through Edmiston's neighborhood. Dkt. 12 at 2, 7-8. Despite the lack of controlling precedent, however, under Edmiston's reasoning Officer Brusseau should have known that using a police dog to track a person suspected of committing a felony property crime through the curtilage of an otherwise unrelated residence violates clearly established law. Dkts. 31, 41. Yet, despite the opportunity for supplemental briefing, there is no such law before this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without direct authority, the Court cannot conclude that the right to be free from the warrantless entry of police and a police dog into one's curtilage-when the dog is following the scent trail of an unrelated felony suspect through a neighborhood during the day-was clearly established at the time Officer Brusseau entered Edmiston's deck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    555 U.S. at 243-244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An officer conducting a search is entitled to qualified immunity where clearly established law does not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\"). The Court therefore agrees with Defendants that the dearth of controlling precedent, coupled with the fact that the Court requested supplemental briefing, demonstrates the legal uncertainty surrounding this factual scenario. Dkt. 37 at 10-12. Thus, even if Officer Brusseau searched Edmiston's curtilage, he is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   While Edmiston argues that the lack of analogous case law on this issue actually supports his position that a search occurred, he relies on the fundamental Fourth Amendment protection against government intrusion in the home. Dkt. 41 at 2. The Supreme Court, however, has repeatedly warned courts not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality for purposes of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd\n   </em>\n   at 743,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Stanton v.

Moreover, although the Supreme Court does not require a factually identical case to find that a right is clearly established, \"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela v.

As demonstrated here, the question of whether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by crossing the curtilage of a residential home, while using a police dog to track a suspect unrelated to the residential home, is highly debatable. The lack of authority further concerns the Court given that the warrantless use of police dogs in residential neighborhoods and across private property is a common factual scenario. Dkt. 38, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Therefore, in the absence of authority demonstrating that the right was clearly established, Officer Brusseau is entitled to qualified immunity. To hold otherwise may risk subjecting police to \u00a7 1983 liability every time an officer using a police dog trespasses in a residential yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, Edmiston has failed to establish that a police officer's path across curtilage while pursuing an unrelated suspect is a search under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, even if an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurred, it was neither a knowing constitutional violation, nor plainly incompetent under current precedent. Thus, even if Officer Brusseau's entry to Edmiston's deck was a warrantless, unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Officer Brusseau is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Excessive Force\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Edmiston makes a claim under the Fourth Amendment for excessive use of force. But here, Edmiston skips over the establishment of a Fourth Amendment violation completely, presuming without citation that the City's deployment of a police canine in a residential neighborhood is an excessive use of force. Dkt. 15, 10-14. Defendants counter that this reasoning would subject PAPD to liability from every homeowner in Edmiston's neighborhood. Dkt. 21 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   All claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \"seizure\" of a citizen who is not in custody are analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \"reasonableness\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Connor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ;\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. City and Cty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221423\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/528/#p537\">\n    598 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (9th Cir. 2010). Thus, the first question to be addressed in analyzing Edmiston's excessive force claim is whether a seizure occurred, not whether the presumed seizure was reasonable. As discussed above, a seizure requires \"an intentional acquisition of physical control.\"\n   <em>\n    Brower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    489 U.S. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Officer Brusseau did not intentionally acquire control over Edmiston, no seizure supporting his\n   \u00a7 1983 claim occurred, and the excessive force claim should also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Edmiston cannot maintain a wrongful seizure claim under the Fourth Amendment based on the unintentional or accidental actions of Officer Brusseau. Nor can Edmiston negate that Officer Brusseau is entitled to qualified immunity on the search issue, if a search indeed occurred, in the absence of clearly established law. Defendants are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the federal claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Remaining State Law Claims for Strict Liability, Negligence, and Constitutional Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants also move to dismiss Edmiston's state law claim for strict liability under Washington's dog bite statute, RCW Chapter 16.08. The parties dispute whether Officer Brusseau had control over Bogey's leash lead when he bit Edmiston.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 12, 18, 20. This factual issue is both genuine and material to the outcome of Edmiston's strict liability claim because it governs the application of state statutory immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants also move to dismiss Edmiston's state constitutional claim for violation of due process of law under Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3. Dkt. 15, 23-24. Defendants argue that absent specific enabling legislation, there is no private cause of action in Washington for state constitutional violations. Dkt. 11 at 11. Edmiston makes the argument that his due process claim has been augmented by legislation, at least within the context of rights for victims of dog bites and the use of police dogs. Dkt. 15 at 23. Edmiston admits that this argument is novel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032830\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/593/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Generally, a state court is in a better position to resolve novel issues of state law. Further, a federal court has discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state law claims when the only federal claims are extinguished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    Parra v.

In addition, a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if it is novel or complex.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Because the Court has dismissed all of the federal claims and given the nature of the remaining state law tort claims and unusual nature of the constitutional due process claim, the Court finds that all of Edmiston's state law claims would be better adjudicated in a state forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and, given that they were originally filed in this court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismisses them without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
