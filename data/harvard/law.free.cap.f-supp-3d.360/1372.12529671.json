Also pending on the docket are Plaintiff's Motion for Order to Release 911 Recordings [46]; Defendant Colonial Pipeline's Motion to Stay Discovery [56]; and Colonial's Motion for Oral Argument [60].

Federal Question Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court does not have federal question jurisdiction over this case. Although Colonial went to great lengths to avoid the forum-defendant rule, it argues that jurisdiction is proper regardless of the rule because \"certain claims asserted by Plaintiffs raise a federal question under regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (Def. Notice of Removal, Dkt. [1], at 2.) Plaintiffs maintain that federal question jurisdiction is improper because their complaint includes only state law claims, and federal law is not essential to any of those claims. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The determination of whether federal question jurisdiction exists \"is governed by the well-pleaded complaint rule, which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Behlen v.

Although Colonial claims Plaintiffs \"invoke federal law, rules, or regulations\" at least twenty-six times, they focus on Plaintiffs' negligence per se claims. (Colonial's\n   Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Remand, Dtk. [39] at 20, 21-26.) According to Colonial, adjudication of those claims requires the interpretation of various Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\"PHMSA\") federal regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs' negligence per se claim does invoke the PHMSA, however, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that application of the PHMSA here does not give rise to a federal question such that exercise of federal question jurisdiction would be proper. This is for two primary reasons. First, Plaintiffs' claim does not require judicial interpretation of the federal statute, and second Plaintiffs' negligence per se claim is an alternative theory of liability for ordinary negligence. Here, the state court need only assess whether Defendants violated the well-established regulations; which, as Plaintiffs point out, is entirely \"fact-bound and situation-specific\" and does not trigger federal question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adventure Outdoors, Inc. v. Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011900\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1290/#p1299\">\n    552 F.3d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1299 (2008). Further, as this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Stephens Cty. v. Wilbros, LLC\n   </em>\n   , 2:12-CV-0201-RWS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204888425\">\n    2012 WL 4888425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 6, 2012) even if Plaintiffs' negligence per se claim were predicated on resolution of a federal issue, Defendants' potential negligence liability is not. Thus, Colonial cannot claim that resolution of Plaintiffs' claims depends on resolution of a substantial federal issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, Defendants, as the removing party, bear the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction and overcoming the preference towards remand. The Court perceives no federal question that exists on the face of Plaintiff's Complaint. This is a case primarily concerning Alabama state law. Plaintiffs' allegations concerning violation of a federal statute in a negligence per se claim asserted as an alternative means for establishing negligence is not an essential element of a claim and therefore is not enough to support federal question jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Without federal question jurisdiction, Defendants must overcome the forum-defendant rule to remain in federal court on diversity jurisdiction. The Court will now address the issue of snap removal and the procedural appropriateness of it as applied to these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Snap Removal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Colonial removed this case using a controversial tactic called \"snap removal.\" Generally, defendants may remove an action on the basis of diversity of citizenship if there is complete diversity between all named plaintiffs and all named defendants, and no defendant is a citizen of the forum state.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The latter limitation, also known as the \"forum-defendant rule,\" is a major removal restraint. The rule reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest\n   <em>\n    properly joined and served\n   </em>\n   as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00a7 1441(b)(2) (emphasis added). Forum defendants looking to remove point to the \"properly joined and served\" language in the statute and argue that a forum defendant can remove on the basis of diversity if removed before service of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Now referred to as snap removals, this litigation tactic has become increasingly popular in recent years due in part to the increased ease of electronic docket monitoring. District courts are in disagreement over snap removals, and only the Third Circuit has definitively come down on one side of the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Encompass Ins.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , though snap removal was not a dispositive issue before the court, the court expressed distaste towards snap removal to support its dismissal of the case, giving plaintiffs another chance to serve forum defendants in state court before removal. In doing so, the court noted that the purpose of the forum-defendant rule is to \"prevent gamesmanship by plaintiffs-to prevent plaintiffs from blocking removal by joining a forum defendant against whom the plaintiff does not intend to proceed against.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206470698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125992\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1216/\">\n    757 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1221 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, there are district court cases in this Circuit following the plain language approach.\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20999679\">\n    2018 WL 999679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Notably, in this line of decisions, non-resident defendants had been properly joined and served at the time of\n   removal.

In fact, also like\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' first case without prejudice to allow them to accomplish this goal. The only reason this case is in federal court is that the same day the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint, Colonial changed its registered agent from CSC to Northwest, without notifying Plaintiffs. As a result, Plaintiffs were unable to serve Colonial until over a month after filing their complaint in state court. Perhaps predictably, as soon as Plaintiffs's service to CSC failed, Defendants removed to federal court, before service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' interpretation of \u00a7 1441(b)(2) would tie the Court's \"hands in the face of such gamesmanship on the part of Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125992\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1216/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the Court agrees with Colonial that service before removal is not always required,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   snap removals uniquely undermine the purpose of the forum-defendant rule and contravene the removal legal standard articulated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The purpose of the forum-defendant rule and Congress's intent in enacting the statute, as well as including the \"properly joined and served\" language, has been widely analyzed by district courts across the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , 251 F.Supp.3d at 1221 (M.D. Tenn. 2017) (providing a calculated analysis of the issue and noting the forum-defendant rule's reinforcement of \"the underlying reason behind the perceived need for diversity jurisdiction, to wit, protecting out-of-state defendants from homegrown, local juries.\");\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v.

As the Middle District of Tennessee articulated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The inclusion of the \"properly joined and served\" language in \u00a7 1441(b)(2) also helps to insure that plaintiffs do not manufacture state court jurisdiction \"by naming as a second defendant in the Complaint (i.e. 'joining') an in-state defendant that the plaintiff had no honest intention of pursuing in litigation, never intended to serve, and in fact did not serve with process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , 251 F.Supp.3d at 1222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, \"[b]ecause the likely purpose of this language is to prevent gamesmanship by plaintiffs\" the Court cannot accept that it is prevented from undoing Defendants' gamesmanship, especially under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125992\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1216/\">\n    757 F.3d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the facts before the Court, gamesmanship\n   is evidenced by Colonial's pre-service electronic monitoring of the docket and last-minute service change. The Court does not criticize Colonial for applying a now wide-spread litigation tactic. Rules will inherently empower sharp lawyers to find ways around them, and that is not inappropriate. Instead, this decision is meant to close an absurd loophole in the forum-defendant rule and to uphold the purpose and integrity of the rule. The fact that the very words included to prevent gamesmanship have opened an avenue for more gamesmanship is an ironic absurdity that the Court will not enforce simply because the words \"properly joined and served\" appear unambiguous in isolation, and Congress has not provided more guidance on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A small step back from the phrase provides the explanation needed for the snap removal issue, which is further supported by traditional removal rules and standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Applying the removal standard, \"removal statutes should be construed narrowly,\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142912\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/1290/#p1293\">\n    327 F.3d at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the removing party bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957672\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/1350/#p1353\">\n    410 F.3d at 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
