Further, it is well settled that Defendants, who have removed the action to federal court, bear the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

The Court will now address each of Plaintiff's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Failure to Comply with Georgia Superior Court Rule 4.2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that the Optum Defendants failed to comply with Georgia Superior Court Rule 4.2 prior to removal, which provides in relevant part that \"[n]o attorney shall appear in that capacity before a superior court until the attorney has entered an appearance by\n   filing a signed entry of appearance form or by filing a signed pleading in a pending action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the Optum Defendants \"never filed an entry of appearance with the Gwinnett County Superior Court nor did they sign the Notice of Removal which would have fulfilled the requirement of Rule 4.2.\" Because the Aetna Defendants alleged the Optum Defendants' consented to removal, Plaintiff argues that it amounted to the Optum Defendants' counsel \"appearing in the capacity of an attorney before a superior court without proper compliance with Rule 4.2.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's argument, however, is entirely without merit. As Defendants correctly point out, the Optum Defendants' counsel was not required to appear in Gwinnett County Superior Court because the case had already been removed to\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [13], p. 16.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) requires only the \"defendant or defendants\" who filed the \"notice of removal\" to \"file a copy of the notice with the clerk of [the] State Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Further, upon the Aetna Defendants' submission of the Notice of Removal, the Gwinnett County Superior Court entered an order acknowledging that the \"matter has been removed\" to this Court and thus \"administratively terminat[ing] this action.\" Doc. No. [13], pp. 16-17. The Court therefore rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Failure to Properly and Timely Consent to Removal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that the Optum Defendants failed to properly and timely consent to removal. Doc. No. [11], p. 7. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the Optum Defendants' failure to sign the Aetna Defendants' May 18, 2018, Notice of Removal (Doc. No. [1] ) is insufficient and does not constitute proper consent to removal. Doc. No. [11], p. 9. Plaintiff additionally argues that the Optum Defendants' subsequent Notice of Consent to Removal (Doc. No. [9] ), filed on May 24, 2018, falls outside of the statutory deadline to consent and is thus untimely. Doc. No. [11], p. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) provides that \"[t]he notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) also provides that \"[w]hen a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A).

In this case, while the Optum Defendants did not sign the May 18, 2018, Notice of Removal, the Aetna Defendants did allege the consent of the Optum Defendants. Doc. No. [1], p. 12, \u00b6 16. Finding this allegation to be sufficient, the Court therefore finds that the Optum Defendants' consent to removal was both proper and timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, even if the Optum Defendants' consent was untimely, remand would still not be warranted. The Eleventh Circuit has previously held that \"a defect other than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction\" does not necessarily require remand.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

In other words, if an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant's actions, then the individual's cause of action is completely pre-empted by ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v.

In other words, the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   two-prong test requires two inquiries: (1) whether the plaintiff could have brought its claim under Section 502(a); and (2) whether no other legal duty supports the plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In applying the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   test, the Court must inquire as to whether Plaintiff \"at some point in time\" could have brought her claims under Section 502(a) of ERISA.

In this case, as Defendants correctly point out, not only could Plaintiff have brought her claims under ERISA, Plaintiff originally\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   bring her claims under ERISA in her initial complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Although Plaintiff ultimately withdrew the ERISA claim in the first amended complaint, her remaining state law claims still rest on the exact same or similar allegations based entirely on her ERISA plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [2], p. 2 (\"The pattern of racketeering activity perpetrated against Plaintiff resulted in the equivalent of approximately one-half (\"1/2\") the dollar amount legitimately paid to her physical therapy provider,\n   <strong>\n    from Plaintiff's insurance benefits\n   </strong>\n   , being fraudulently paid to Optum.\") (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court finds that the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   test is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, in applying the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   test, the Court must inquire as to whether any other independent legal duty is implicated by Defendants' actions.
