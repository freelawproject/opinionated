Lanza, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2015, the City of Glendale (the \"City\") entered into a six-figure contract with a staffing company operated by Michelle and Jeffery Griffin to obtain temporary workers for various municipal projects. What was the name of the staffing company? That's the key disputed issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Griffins are actually affiliated with two different staffing companies with very similar names. The first, JG Staffing, Inc., is a Texas corporation that was formed in 2005, and the second, JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, is an Arizona limited liability company that was formed in 2012. Here, although the original bid for the contract was submitted by Mr. Griffin, who identified himself as the CEO of \"JG Staffing, Inc.\", and although the City responded by sending a notice of intent to award the contract to \"JG Staffing. Inc.\", Ms. Griffin later informed the City that she \"would prefer everything be under JG AZ since this is an Arizona account\" and Mr. Griffin submitted a \"Best and Final Offer\" on behalf of \"JG Staffing AZ.\" Thus, the final contract identified the City's counterparty as \"JG Staffing Inc., a Arizona Corporation\" and the contract was signed by Ms. Griffin as the vice president of \"JG Staffing Inc., an Arizona corporation.\" There is, unfortunately, no such company as \"JG Staffing Inc., an Arizona corporation\"-this appears to be a jumble of the two real companies' names. About a year later, Ms. Griffin sent the City a letter stating that \"JG Staffing Inc....was incorrectly used by our sales manager to bid on the contract\" and that \"the correct entity\" was \"JG Staffing AZ.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   How does Plaintiff ARA Incorporated (\"ARA\") fit into all of this? In 2011, ARA entered into a factoring agreement with JG Staffing, Inc. (the Texas corporation). In July 2016, following a default under the factoring agreement, ARA sent a letter to the City. This letter explained that ARA, as a secured creditor of JG Staffing, Inc., was entitled to receive all future payments owed to JG Staffing, Inc. under the staffing contract. The City, however, failed to remit the future payments to ARA-it kept sending them to a bank account associated with JG Staffing Arizona, LLC. This lawsuit ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now pending before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by ARA (Docs. 54 &amp; 56) and the City (Doc. 67).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to quarreling over whether ARA actually had a security interest in the staffing contract, whether ARA properly notified the City of that interest, and whether this lawsuit was filed within the statute of limitations, the parties ask the Court to determine, as a matter of law, the identity of the City's counterparty under the staffing contract-ARA argues it had to be JG Staffing, Inc. and the City argues it had to be JG Staffing Arizona, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As explained below, the Court will deny both parties' motions in significant part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case involves an array of conflicting evidence concerning the identity of the City's counterparty. Although ARA and the City have each identified certain pieces of evidence that tend to support their position, it should be a factfinder-not the Court at summary judgment-that decides how to weigh those pieces of evidence and resolve any conflicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The JG Entities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   JG Staffing, Inc. is a Texas corporation that was incorporated in 2005. (Doc. 68-3 [Griffin Decl.] at 2 \u00b6 3.) It provides temporary staffing services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) JG Staffing Arizona, LLC is a limited liability company that was organized and formed in Arizona in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 \u00b6 4.) It also provides temporary staffing services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Griffin was involved with the management and operations of JG Staffing, Inc. and was a member of JG Staffing Arizona, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 2.) Her husband, Mr. Griffin, is the President of JG Staffing, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Factoring Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about May 4, 2011, ARA and JG Staffing, Inc. entered into the Factoring Agreement, under which ARA received \"[a]s security for the Obligations [under the Factoring Agreement],\" \"a security interest in [JG Staffing, Inc.'s] business assets, including, without limitation, all accounts, contract rights and other rights to payment, and all proceeds of the foregoing.\" (Doc. 58-5 at 31, 33 \u00a7 8, 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March 2015, ARA learned that JG Staffing, Inc. breached the Factoring Agreement. The parties thereafter sued each other in Minnesota state court. The jury found JG Staffing, Inc. liable on multiple claims and found ARA was not liable on any of JG Staffing, Inc.'s claims. (Doc. 57-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Staffing Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In November 2014, the City issued a request for proposal with the solicitation number \"RFP 15-17\" and the description \"Temporary Workers for Recycling Facility, Landfill and Public Works Department.\" (Doc. 58-6 at 46-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 1, 2014, \"JG Staffing Inc.\" submitted a proposal for RFP 15-17. (Doc. 58-6 at 74-114.) This proposal was signed by \"Jeffery Griffin\" as \"CEO\" of \"JG Staffing Inc.\" and included the email address \"jgriffin@jgstaffinginc.com\" and the federal taxpayer ID number 20-1936759. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.) Every page of this proposal also noted \"JG Staffing Inc.\" in the footer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The \"Best and Final Offer\" (likely mistakenly dated April 7, 2014) submitted in connection with this proposal was signed\n   by \"Jeff Griffin\" as \"Sales Manager\" of \"JG Staffing AZ.\" (Doc. 58-6 at 196-203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 30, 2015, the City wrote a letter to \"Mr. Jeffery Griffin,\" as \"CEO\" of \"JG Staffing, Inc.,\" notifying him that the City was offering JG Staffing, Inc. a \"Notice of Intent to Award\" a contract under RFP 15-17, pending any bid protests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Ms. Griffin sent the City an email requesting to change the Employer Identification Number for the submitting party. The email stated: \"The reason I want to change the EIN is because our sales person used the 20-number and I would prefer everything be under JG AZ since this is an Arizona account.\" (Doc. 68-3 at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about August 25, 2015, there was a request for the City Council \"to authorize the Acting City Manager to enter into an agreement with J.G. Staffing, Inc., to provide temporary staffing services for the Public Works Department in an amount not to exceed $ 875,153 annually.\" (Doc. 58-6 at 117.) The City's 30(b)(6) designee testified in her deposition that this authorization was provided and that \"[t]he City Council approved the City Manager to enter into a contract with JG Staffing, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:2-12, 43:5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 28, 2015, the City entered into a contract (the \"staffing contract\") with \"JG Staffing Inc., a Arizona Corporation,\" which incorporated RFP 15-17. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119.) Ms. Griffin signed the contract as \"Vice President\" of \"JG Staffing Inc., an Arizona corporation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 16, 2015, Ms. Griffin submitted a form to the City identifying JG Staffing Arizona, LLC's EIN and bank account information, so that payments under the staffing contract could be deposited into that account. (Doc. 68-3 [Griffin Decl.] at 4-5 \u00b6 15; 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On or about July 1, 2016, the City stated that it wished to renew the staffing contract for a second year. (Doc. 58-4.) On July 12, 2016, Mr. Griffin executed the one-year contract extension on behalf of \"J G Staffing, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 16, 2016, ARA became aware of the staffing contract. (Doc. 58-5 [Reid Dep.] at 43:22-45:2, 58:9-14.) On July 19, 2016, ARA sent the City a letter. (Doc. 58-6 at 204.) The letter indicated in the first line that it was regarding the \"Agreement for Temporary Workers for Recycling Facility, Landfill &amp; Public Works.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next paragraph stated: \"ARA has a pre-existing relationship with JG Staffing Inc. as a source of capital funding. Related to this relationship, JG Staffing Inc. has pledged a security interest in its business assets (including, without limitation, rights to payment on JG Staffing Inc. invoicing) to ARA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter went on to state that \"ARA has teamed with AGR Funding Inc., a specialist in the staffing industry, to manage payments related to JG Staffing Inc. Please make all payments for JG Staffing Inc. to [AGR Funding Inc.]....The foregoing irrevocable payment instructions shall not be modified without ARA's prior written consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 21, 2016, the City sent ARA an email acknowledging receipt of ARA's letter and notifying ARA that \"[i]n order for [the City] to accept this update into [the City's] system,\" the City needed to \"receive a completed COG TIN to support this change,\" which was available at the link provided in the email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205.) AGR filled out the initial form, but the City asked for the form to be corrected. (Doc. 68-1 at [Reid Dep.] 67:2-10.) In a July 26, 2016 email, the City again asked ARA, in filling out the COG TIN form, to \"confirm that the tax liability of the JG Staffing invoices will be the responsibility of ARA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82.) ARA returned a COG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   TIN form dated July 26, 2016 with JG Staffing Inc.'s TIN listed, but without a signature of anyone representing JG Staffing, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:24-71:21, 80, 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a July 29, 2016 email exchange, Mr. Griffin told a City employee that the EIN the City should be using for the staffing contract is the number for JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, not JG Staffing, Inc. (Doc. 58-6 at 212.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On August 1, 2016, Ms. Griffin sent the City a letter stating that \"JG Staffing Inc. (20-1936759) was incorrectly used by our sales manager to bid on the contract\" and that \"[p]rior to the inception of the contract this was formally changed to the correct entity JG Staffing AZ (46-0807153).\" (Doc. 58-2.) She further claimed that \"[t]he correct TIN number 46-0807153 has been used by finance etc., since the inception of the contract\" and that \"[i]t appears as if there may be a miscommunication and it was not changed in another area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the City issued a second amendment to the staffing contract. (Doc. 58-6 at 214-17.) This amendment purported to formally change the contracting party from \"JG Stafing [sic] Inc., TIN 20-1936759\" to \"JG Staffing AZ, TIN 46-0807153.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The certificates of liability insurance that were submitted to the City in connection with the staffing contract identified JG Staffing Arizona, LLC as the insured party. (Doc. 68-3 at 78-79.) The invoices sent to the City were submitted on behalf of \"JG Staffing of AZ.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Griffin now claims in a declaration that \"the response to the RFP that was submitted by JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC] mistakenly used the name of JG [Staffing,] Inc.\" and that \"[a]t all times, JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC] was the company that was intended to enter into a contract with the City in connection with [RFP 15-17].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10.) She further claims that \"the substantive information contained within the response to [RFP 15-17] (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pricing, compliance, management team, experience, references, etc.) pertained to JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the only example identified in Ms. Griffin's declaration is a piece of information that \"pertains to both JG [Staffing,] Inc. and to JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In her declaration, Ms. Griffin also asserts that \"JG [Staffing,] Inc. did not perform any services under the Glendale Contract; no invoices were ever submitted in the name of JG [Staffing,] Inc.; and the City never made any payment to JG [Staffing,] Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 \u00b6 20 (emphasis omitted).) However, Ms. Griffin also concedes that \"[t]he time sheets used by the temporary worker[s] were generic time sheets\" that were \"used interchangeably by both JG [Staffing,] Inc. and JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ARA initiated this lawsuit in July 2017. (Doc. 1.) The complaint asserts four causes of action against the City. Count I is a claim under Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-607 ( A.R.S. \u00a7 47-9607 ). Count II is a claim under Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-406 ( A.R.S. \u00a7 47-9406 ). Count III is a claim for breach of contract.

This argument is unavailing. The contract refers twice to an Arizona corporation called JG Staffing, Inc. This entity does not exist. This party name could reasonably be construed to refer either to JG Staffing, Inc., the Texas corporation, or JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, the Arizona LLC. Thus, the Court will examine parol evidence in an attempt to ascertain the intent of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ARA's position is supported by documents from both before and after the contract was made. The original proposal was submitted on behalf of \"JG Staffing Inc.\" using JG Staffing, Inc.'s TIN, and the City then sent a \"Notice of Intent to Award\" a contract letter to Mr. Griffin as \"CEO\" of \"JG Staffing, Inc.\" Additionally, the parties' later efforts to amend the contract, to change the counterparty's name from JG Staffing, Inc. to JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, tend to suggest the original counterparty was indeed JG Staffing, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City, however, argues the \"most compelling evidence\" of the parties' intent that the contract be with JG Staffing Arizona, LLC \"is the parties' actual performance\" under the staffing contract. (Doc. 65 at 8; Doc. 67 at 8.)

The acts of the parties here do indeed provide some support for the City's position, but they do not make it clear that the counterparty was JG Staffing Arizona, LLC rather than JG Staffing, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For example, the City was paying JG Staffing Arizona, LLC under the staffing contract. (Doc. 66-1 at 84.) Although this fact tends to support the City's position, it is not dispositive-JG Staffing Arizona, LLC's account statement (Doc. 66-1 at 84) suggests that JG Staffing Arizona, LLC was receiving payments from other entities on behalf of JG Staffing, Inc. Thus, the mere fact that JG Staffing Arizona, LLC was receiving payments from the City does not conclusively establish that JG Staffing Arizona, LLC had to be the City's counterparty under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is also true that the the certificates of liability insurance showed JG Staffing Arizona, LLC was the insured party. (Doc. 68-3 at 78-79.) But the City cites only Ms. Griffin's declaration (Doc. 68-3 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20) for its claim that \"JG Arizona performed\n   all of the services under the Glendale Contract, including furnishing and paying temporary workers.\" (Doc. 65 at 8; Doc. 67 at 8.) Yet Ms. Griffin concedes in her declaration that \"[t]he time sheets used by the temporary worker[s] were generic time sheets\" that were \"used interchangeably by both JG [Staffing,] Inc. and JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC].\" (Doc. 68-3 at 5-6 \u00b6 21.) And as ARA notes in its reply, \"[t]here is...nothing indicating that the City would have been able to distinguish whether JG [Staffing,] Inc. or JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] LLC performed any tasks.\" (Doc. 69 at 9.) Finally, the invoices requested payment to \"JG Staffing of AZ\" (Doc. 66-1 at 81), an entity that, again, does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Some of the City's proffered evidence also suffers from a temporal defect.

Although Ms. Griffin-an individual with an interest in both entities-now claims that \"the response to the RFP that was submitted by JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC] mistakenly used the name of JG [Staffing,] Inc\" (Doc. 68-3 at 2-3 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7), she was unable to identify any contemporaneous information in the response that pertained solely to JG Staffing Arizona, LLC-the sole example she provided \"pertain[ed] to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   JG [Staffing,] Inc. and JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, emphasis added). Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the City, the other party to the contract, intended to contract with JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, rather than JG Staffing, Inc. Indeed, the City sought authorization for the City Manager \"to enter into an agreement with J.G. Staffing, Inc.,\" not JG Staffing Arizona, LLC, and the City's 30(b)(6) designee testified in her deposition that \"[t]he City Council approved the City Manager to enter into a contract with JG Staffing, Inc.\" (Doc. 58-6 at 29:2-12, 43:5-6, 117.) Thus, contrary to the City's claim, the evidence is not clear that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties\n   <em>\n    at the time the contract was made\n   </em>\n   intended for the contract to be with JG Staffing Arizona, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court need not go through all the evidence cited by the parties to conclude there is a genuine dispute as to the intended counterparty. The Court, thus, denies ARA's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. For this, and the reasons that follow, the Court also denies the City's motion for summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Notice and Proof of Assignment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The City argues that, regardless of which company qualifies as the counterparty under the staffing contract, it is entitled to summary judgment on Count III because ARA didn't provide sufficient notice or proof of the assignment to the City. (Doc. 65 at 9-10; Doc. 67 at 13-14.) In response, ARA asserts that: (1) its notice was sufficient even though it did not use any variation of the term \"assign,\" (2) the City did not ask for proof of the assignment and therefore ARA was not required to furnish any proof, and (3) even if the City had asked for proof, ARA provided sufficient proof. (Doc. 69 at 10-11; Doc. 72 at 9-11.) The Court agrees with ARA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Once \"the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee,\" the account debtor must pay the\n   assignee rather than the assignor.

That letter provided that: (1) \"ARA has a pre-existing relationship with JG Staffing Inc. as a source of capital funding\"; (2) \"[r]elated to this relationship, JG Staffing Inc. has pledged a security interest in its business assets (including, without limitation, rights to payment on JG Staffing Inc. invoicing) to ARA\"; and (3) the City should \"make all payments for JG Staffing Inc. to [AGR Funding Inc.].\" (Doc. 58-6 at 204.) The subject line of this letter was \"Agreement for Temporary Workers for Recycling Facility, Landfill &amp; Public Works Between JO Staffing Inc. and the City of Glendale,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the staffing contract, and the first line of the letter notes that the letter is in reference to the staffing contract.

Here, a jury could find that the City is a sophisticated party, not an ordinary consumer, and thus can be charged with understanding that ARA was claiming a security interest in the payments under the staffing contract and requesting that these payments be made to it (through AGR Funding Inc.), effectively constituting an assignment. Further, as the U.C.C. comments provide: \"If an account debtor has doubt as to the adequacy of a notification, it may not be safe in disregarding the notification unless it notifies the assignee with reasonable promptness as to the respects in which the account debtor considers the notification defective.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 9-406, cmt. 3.

As the City concedes, it asked ARA only to \"complete a form identifying which party would assume the tax liability for any payments from the City.\" (Doc. 65 at 10; Doc. 67 at 14.) The City fashions an after-the-fact explanation for requesting the tax liability form, contending that this request constituted a \"request[ ] [for] proof of the alleged assignment.\" (Doc. 77 at 9-10.) Yet the Court need not uncritically accept such a self-serving interpretation of a piece of evidence at the summary judgment stage.

The City contends, on the other hand, that ARA has no claim for account stated because (1) there was never an account or agreement between JG Staffing, Inc. and the City; (2) even if there had been such an agreement, ARA \"failed to produce any evidence that the City and JG [Staffing,] Inc. mutually agreed to settle and strike a balance as to any 'account' between them; (3) ARA does not \"offer any proof of an agreement between the City and JG [Staffing,] Inc. as to what the settled amount would be\"; and (4) \"the City and [ARA] never mutually agreed to settle and strike a balance as to the City's account with JG Arizona.\" (Doc. 67 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As noted above, there is a dispute of material fact as to the identity of the City's counterparty under the staffing contract.

The City asserts that because ARA first learned of the staffing contract on July 16, 2016, and \"promptly notified\" the City of its claim for payment through a letter dated July 19, 2016, \"as of July 16, 2016, or July 19, 2016, at the very latest, [ARA] was aware that the City had not made any payments allegedly due under the Glendale Contract to [ARA]\" and \"[t]herefore, [ARA's] cause of action for such payments accrued at least as early as July 19, 2016.\" (Doc. 67 at 15.)

The City has failed to present any evidence as to when ARA realized it had been\n   <em>\n    damaged.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds the City has not met its initial burden and, thus, denies the City's motion on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Factoring Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The City also renews its argument, from its motion to dismiss, that ARA did not have a security interest in accounts arising after the Factoring Agreement was executed (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   after 2011) because the Factoring Agreement lacked an after-acquired clause and ARA and JG Staffing, Inc. didn't enter into additional security agreements covering subsequently-acquired property.

These facts, however, have no bearing on the legal issue on which the Court already ruled. The City contends that \"[ARA] understood the necessity of including express language in order for a security interest to attach to after-acquired accounts\" because \"[b]oth the Factoring Agreement that [ARA] entered into with JG [Staffing] Arizona[,] [LLC] and the Loan and Security Agreement that [ARA] prepared for execution by JG [Staffing,] Inc. expressly conveyed a security interest in present and future accounts receivable.\" (Doc. 67 at 16 (emphasis omitted).)
