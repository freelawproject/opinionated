In his opposition, Gantt clarified that he is only pursuing general maritime negligence claims against the LLOG defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court will not consider the LLOG defendants' arguments as to Gantt's Jones Act negligence and unseaworthiness claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the date of the March 2015 fire, Gantt was working aboard the vessel as an assistant crane operator employed by defendant Seadrill Americas, Inc.

(\"Seadrill Deepwater\"), the drilling contractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the daywork drilling contract, Seadrill Deepwater-which is not a party to this lawsuit-was to furnish the vessel, as well as the drilling equipment, insurance, and personnel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is uncontested that the LLOG defendants had no ownership interest in the vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the vessel was owned by Seadrill Neptune Hungary Kft. (\"Seadrill Neptune\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gantt alleges that the LLOG defendants, as the leaseholder party to the daywork drilling contract, \"held all rights and obligations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He seeks to hold the LLOG defendants liable under a theory of general maritime negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when, after reviewing the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits, the Court determines that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The critical question is whether the language that Gantt cites from the bridging agreement (noting that \"LLOG will confirm\" that third-party owned equipment is \"fit for [its] purpose\") is evidence of a separate, relevant duty that the LLOG defendants owed to Gantt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The LLOG defendants argue that there is nothing in the record to support Gantt's argument that they violated the terms of the bridging agreement or that the air handling unit was third-party owned equipment as contemplated by the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this argument, the LLOG defendants submitted two declarations-one from each party to the bridging agreement. The first declaration is from LLOG Exploration Company, L.L.C.'s general counsel, George Gilly (\"Gilly\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gilly attests that \"[t]his provision pertains, not to appurtenances of the drill ship or equipment owned by Seadrill [Neptune] or any of its affiliated entities, but to equipment owned and brought on board the WEST NEPTUNE by vendors with which LLOG contracts directly to provide exploration and production services, such as wireline, completion and cementing, for its wells.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Gilly states that Gantt's interpretation of the bridging agreement is not only incorrect, but that it is \"inconsistent with the [agreement's] plain intent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Gilly, \"Gantt's proposed interpretation would mean that LLOG agreed to be responsible for insuring that the WEST NEPTUNE and all of its appurtenances were fit for their intended purposes and met all regulatory requirements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Gilly and the LLOG defendants are adamant that \"LLOG ... made no such undertaking.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second declaration is from Jon Olav Osthus (\"Osthus\"), director of Seadrill Deepwater. Osthus states that he \"concur[s] with [Gilly's] interpretation\" of the bridging agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The WEST NEPTUNE's No. 2 air handling unit and its component parts ... are not '3rd party equipment' as contemplated by the [bridging agreement], and it was not the intent of the parties to the [daywork drilling contract] to make LLOG responsible for insuring that the WEST NEPTUNE, including her No. 2 air handling unit and its component parts, were fit for their intended purposes and met regulatory requirements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The LLOG defendants further argue that nothing in the bridging agreement indicates that it was intended to supersede any other agreements between the contracting parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bridging agreement says as much: \"This Agreement does not supersede the requirements of any applicable regulations or any other Service Agreements between the Operator and the Contractor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also provides that the agreement was \"entered into by the parties for clarification purpose only and it [was] not intended to modify any of LLOG's or Seadrill [Deepwater's] rights, obligations, and liabilities under the original contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considering that the contract provides that Seadrill Deepwater is \"obliged to assume the defense and indemnity of LLOG for claims of the type asserted by [Gantt],\" the LLOG defendants argue that Gantt's interpretation of the bridging agreement \"flies in the [face] of the parties' obvious intent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court need not interpret the indemnity provision of the daywork drilling contract. The bridging agreement was entered into between two sophisticated parties, both of whom attest that \"third party equipment\" as it is used in the agreement did not include the vessel's air handling unit. Although Gantt says otherwise, he was not a party to the bridging agreement, and he has not pointed to any evidence in the record that directly contradicts the declarations provided as evidence by the LLOG defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Gilly and Osthus's interpretation of third-party owned equipment is supported by additional provisions of the daywork drilling contract and the bridging agreement. Describing what is required of Seadrill Deepwater, the daywork drilling contract states that \"all materials, equipment, goods, supplies or manufactured articles\n   <em>\n    furnished by\n   </em>\n   Contractor in the performance of the work or services shall be suitable quality and workmanship for their intended purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The daywork drilling contract explicitly states that Seadrill Deepwater was obligated to furnish the vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the bridging agreement indicates that Seadrill Deepwater was the entity responsible for a \"rig hazards analysis,\" and an \"X\" is placed under Seadrill Deepwater's name alongside the item \"OIM responsible for vessel safety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the contract, \"OIM\" refers to the offshore installation manager, who the contract includes in a list of personnel to be provided by Seadrill Deepwater.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The evidence demonstrates that the LLOG defendants did not take on an additional duty to ensure the safety of the vessel or its appurtenances through the bridging agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concludes that Gantt's unsupported assertion that the air handling unit constitutes third-party owned equipment, as contemplated by bridging agreement, does not create a genuine dispute as to the existence of a duty that the LLOG defendants owed to Gantt.
