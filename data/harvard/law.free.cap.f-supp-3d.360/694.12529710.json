(Doc. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As charged, Count 2 carries a mandatory minimum of five years imprisonment up to life.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i). Defendant also faces terms of imprisonment of up to twenty years on each controlled substance offense (Counts 1, 4, 6) and up to ten years for each count of felon in possession of a firearm (Counts 3, 5, 7).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's initial appearance on the indictment occurred on May 25, 2017. (Doc. 8). At that time, the Government moved for Defendant's detention pending trial. (Doc. 30 at 7). Defendant objected to pretrial detention and affirmed his desire to proceed with a detention hearing, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant was ordered temporarily detained pending the detention hearing, which hearing was set for May 30, 2017, based on the availability of the parties and the Pretrial Officer. (Docs. 8, 11). The Court set arraignment for the same day. (Doc. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Defendant's arraignment and detention hearing proceeded as scheduled before the federal magistrate judge. (Doc. 12). As to arraignment, Defendant entered pleas of not guilty as to all counts of the Indictment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to Defendant's detention, the magistrate judge found that no conditions of bond would assure the safety of any person or the community if Defendant were released, nor would any conditions assure Defendant's subsequent appearance in court as required. (Doc. 13 at 1). The magistrate judge noted the severe penalties applicable to the charged offenses, as well as Defendant's prior criminal history, including prior failures to appear in court as ordered, prior attempts to evade law enforcement, and prior violations while under supervision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Accordingly, Defendant was ordered detained pending trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 2, 2017, this Court held Defendant's preliminary pretrial conference. (Min. Entry, June 2, 2017). During the conference, the Court set a trial calendar pursuant to the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act and the requests of the parties. (Doc. 15). Specifically, the Court set a status report deadline of June 23, 2017, a pretrial motion filing deadline of June 26, 2017, and a jury trial commencing on August 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As required, on June 23, 2017, the Court received Defendant's status report via email from defense counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The status report stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I am writing to provide an update on Mr. Criswell's case. The government and\n   <em>\n    Mr. Criswell are in active plea negotiations at this time and it appears as though the case will likely get resolved pretrial\n   </em>\n   . I know that we have a pending motions deadline this Monday. I am going to see Mr. Criswell this afternoon to discuss that deadline (as well as the trial date) and the logic of filing a motion to continue everything. If I confirm with him that a continuance is in fact his\n   desire, I will file a formal motion with the Court on Monday morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Email Status Report, June 23, 2017) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 26, 2017, Defendant filed a motion for a four-week extension of the motion filing deadline. (Doc. 16). Defense counsel explained that \"additional time is needed to engage in negotiations with the government and see if a pretrial disposition can be reached.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Moreover, defense counsel stated that she and Defendant had reviewed the discovery-which the Government provided on June 2, 2017-and were still determining how to proceed in the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although Defendant did not, at that time, request a new trial date, the motion stated that \"[s]hould [Defendant] ultimately determine that pretrial motions are necessary, he understands that the filing of said motions will result in a continuance of the current trial date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 7, 2017, the Court granted Defendant's motion and extended the motion filing deadline to July 24, 2017. (Not. Order, July 7, 2017). In its Notation Order granting Defendant's motion, the Court specifically noted that plea negotiations-which were characterized as active and ongoing both in Defendant's June 23, 2017 email status report and in his June 26, 2017 motion-serve to exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5736392\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/395/177/#p182\">\n    395 F. App'x 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (6th Cir. 2010) (\"plea negotiations are an example of 'other proceedings' not specifically listed in \u00a7 3161(h)(1) which may be excluded from the Speedy Trial Act calculation\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court additionally made an ends-of-justice finding, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7)(A), (B)(i) and (iv), stating that \"failure to grant the continuance would deprive the parties of adequate time to work toward a pretrial resolution or alternatively prepare for trial and ... would likely result in a miscarriage of justice.\" (Not. Order, July 7, 2017). Thus, time was tolled on the speedy trial clock until July 24, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 24, 2017, Defendant once again moved for a four-week extension of the motion filing deadline. (Doc. 17). In his motion, Defendant explained that the parties had been engaged in ongoing plea negotiations, but stated that \"[c]urrently, negotiations have broken down and ... [t]hus, [Defendant] needs additional time to prepare for trial and determine what, if any, pretrial motions are necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Defendant acknowledged that his request to continue the motion deadline would now require a continuance of the August 7, 2017 trial date, and further noted that the Government had no objection to the continuance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's motion continued, however, to further request an order compelling the Government to provide video and audio recordings of Defendant's interactions with a confidential informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Defense counsel stated that the Government refused to provide Defendant with the recordings, because the informant's face was visible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant acknowledged the Government's concern regarding the informant's identity and therefore stated he would not object to the informant's face being blocked or distorted in the videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant did not represent that the Government had agreed to production under any such circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 25, 2017, this Court entered the following notation order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   NOTATION ORDER: This case is before the Court on Defendant's omnibus motion for: (1) a four-week extension of the pretrial motion deadline; and (2) an order compelling the Government \"to produce the video and audio recordings of [Defendant's] interactions with the confidential informant.\" (Doc. 17).\n   <strong>\n    As to the request for a four-week extension of time,\n   </strong>\n   which request is unopposed, Defendant states that the parties have been unable to reach a plea agreement and, accordingly, Defendant \"needs additional time to prepare for trial and determine what, if any, pretrial motions are necessary.\" (Id.) Defendant acknowledges that an extension of the motion deadline will disrupt the trial date as well. (Id.) For good cause shown, and as the extension is unopposed, Defendant's motion for a four-week extension of the motion deadline is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Court hereby VACATES the previously established trial calendar (Doc. 15) and establishes a new motion filing deadline of 8/21/2017.\n   <em>\n    The Court will confer with the parties to establish a new trial date after pretrial motions have been filed and resolved\n   </em>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    As to Defendant's request for an order compelling production of the recordings,\n   </strong>\n   the Court establishes the following briefing schedule: the Government shall file a response on or before 8/14/2017; Defendant's reply (if any) shall be filed on or before 8/28/2017.\n   <em>\n    Assuming the motion to compel is ultimately granted, and to the extent the recordings prove to be valuable in the preparation of Defendant's pretrial motions, Defendant is granted leave to request an additional extension as to those specific motions.\n   </em>\n   As Defendant's motion to compel remains pending, the time elapsing from the date of the motion (7/24/2017), through resolution of the motion, shall be tolled pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(D). Additionally, the Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting Defendant's requested extension of the motion deadline, outweigh the interests of the public and Defendant in a speedy trial, as failure to grant such a continuance would deprive counsel of adequate time to prepare. Accordingly, the time elapsing from 7/24/2017 through 8/28/2017 is further TOLLED pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7)(A), (B)(iv). IT IS SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Timothy S. Black.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Not. Order, July 25, 2017) (bold in original; underline emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 14, 2017, the Government filed a motion requesting a three-day extension of its deadline to respond to Defendant's motion to compel. (Doc. 18). In relevant part, the Government stated that it required additional time to determine whether the video could be redacted adequately enough to resolve concerns for the informant's safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three days later, on August 17, 2017, the Government filed an unopposed motion for a protective order. (Doc. 19). At that time, the Court had not yet acted on the Government's motion for an extension of its response deadline. However, the Government's motion for a protective order noted that, while it disputed having any obligation to provide the redacted recordings, \"[s]hould the Court approve the proposed protective order, the Government will promptly produce a redacted copy of the requested videos to Defense counsel as requested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2). In short, entry of the protective order would effectively moot both Defendant's motion to compel (Doc. 17) and the Government's motion for an extension of time to respond (Doc. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 21, 2017, while the motion for a protective order was still pending, Defendant filed a motion seeking leave to file pretrial motions after the receipt of additional discovery. (Doc. 20). Notably, Defendant did not request an extension of specified duration as he had previously done. Rather, Defendant stated generally that he required additional time, as he would not be in a position to meaningfully assess which motions to file until he had received the redacted recordings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Defendant also noted, for the first time, that he was awaiting the receipt of other items of discovery from the Government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 31, 2017, Defendant also filed a motion for bond (Doc. 21), to which the Government responded in opposition (Doc. 22). Defendant did not file a reply in support of his motion for bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court did not immediately act on Defendant's August 21, 2017 motion for extension of the motion deadline. From the Court's perspective, the notation order entered on July 25, 2017 already granted Defendant leave to seek a later motion deadline\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   , upon receipt and review of the recordings, Defendant found the additional discovery warranted filing new or amended motions. In other words, the Court was waiting for Defendant to actually review the discovery and to notify the Court whether a new motion deadline was needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To that end, the Court entered the protective order on September 22, 2017. (Doc. 23). Accordingly, as of September 23, 2017, the Government was in a position to provide Defendant with the redacted recordings. The Court continued to anticipate hearing from the defense after the videos were reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 23, 2017, the Court received several\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   communications from Defendant, including seven\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motions, a letter to the Court, and more notably, two letters intended for defense counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this Court does not accept\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings from represented parties. Thus, pursuant to the Court's standard practice, on October 25, 2017, the Court reached out to defense counsel via email to inform her\n   of Defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   communications. The Court explained that it would send the originals back to Defendant and copies to defense counsel, and further offered to scan and email counsel the documents. On October 30, 2017, defense counsel responded to the Court's email and stated that she believed Defendant had copied her on all communications already and the Court could simply send the originals back to her client. Accordingly, on November 2, 2017, the Court proceeded to return the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   communications to Defendant, with an accompanying letter explaining that the Court does not accept\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings from represented parties, clarifying that his attorney must submit filings on his behalf, and advising him to contact his counsel. The Court then continued to await defense motions, particularly having now seen Defendant's clear desire that pretrial motions be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the first week of November 2017, the Court learned that defense counsel was out on medical leave and was not anticipated to return to work until the end of December 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the circumstances, the Court did not believe it was necessary to impose upon the Federal Public Defender's Office (the \"FPD\") to memorialize this status on the record, nor to require a formal request to continue the matter. The Court assumed it would likely hear from defense counsel after the first of the year and was comfortable simply awaiting her return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, rather than timely informing the Court of completion of Defendant's discovery review, the defense's intentions regarding pretrial motions, or the status of plea negotiations, on January 23, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on violations of the Speedy Trial Act. (Doc. 24). The Court established a briefing schedule on the motion (Not. Order, Jan. 24, 2018), pursuant to which the Government responded in opposition (Doc. 25) and Defendant replied (Doc. 26). On May 29, 2018, Defendant also filed a motion to dismiss based on speedy trial violations under the Sixth Amendment. (Doc. 27). The Government responded in opposition to this motion as well. (Doc. 28). No reply was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Both motions to dismiss (Docs. 24, 27) are presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Docs. 25, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to the motion to dismiss for violation of the Speedy Trial Act, the Government argues that, much like the Court, it anticipated that Defendant would file pretrial motions and, further, that the Government understood the Court's July 25, 2017 notation order as affording Defendant time to review additional discovery before filing said motions. (Doc. 25). The Government further notes that the parties had recommenced plea negotiations around October 25, 2017, and that negotiations were in fact occurring when Defendant filed the motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6). Finally, the Government argues that while a technical violation may have occurred, the appropriate remedy should be dismissal of the indictment without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant argues in his reply, however, that the Government was negligent in producing discovery and tracking speedy trial time in this case and, therefore, dismissal with prejudice is warranted. (Doc. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As to the motion to dismiss under the Sixth Amendment, the Government argues that the delay in this case has not been excessive, particularly given the portion of the delay attributable to Defendant. (Doc. 28). Moreover, the Government argues that the delay is neither attributable to bad faith on its part, nor has it been an attempt to seek a tactical advantage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the Government argues Defendant has not been prejudiced by the delay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As stated more fully below, the Court finds that a technical violation of the Speedy Trial Act has occurred, but that the violation does not warrant dismissal with prejudice. Moreover, the Court finds that there has been no violation of Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). On November 3, 2017, the Government emailed defense counsel regarding plea negotiations, and also copied Assistant Federal Public Defender Richard Monahan, knowing that Ms. Lockard had just gone out on medical leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In that email, the Government indicates its position on offering Defendant a better deal and further indicates that the prosecutor has spoken to her supervisors regarding the negotiations as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Again acknowledging Ms. Lockard's absence, the prosecutor offers to continue plea negotiations with Ms. Lockard's colleagues and even provides her cell phone number to Mr. Monahan, stating: \"I'd be happy to get you up to speed and talk about the reasoning behind the decision [regarding the plea offer].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On November 6, 2017, Mr. Monahan responded to the Government's email, stating that the preference of their office would be to defer the case until Ms. Lockard's return, but they needed to meet with Defendant first to \"kind of see where he wants to go from here ... [and] see if [he] can wait until [Ms. Lockard] gets back to proceed with [the] case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Monahan tells the prosecutor that, although he is not yet certain who will meet with Defendant, he \"will keep [her] posted after [someone has] had a chance to meet with [Defendant]....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government states that this was the last communication\n   received until Ms. Lockard returned to work in January 2018. (Doc. 28 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on the email communications, the Court concludes that plea negotiations were ongoing from October 25, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when defense counsel requested a meeting to discuss further plea negotiations) until at least November 3, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when the prosecutor emailed defense counsel regarding the Government's terms in order for Defendant to obtain a better deal). Accordingly, time was automatically tolled during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   However, given the circumstances, the speedy trial clock technically restarted on November 4, 2017, which constituted day\n   <strong>\n    twenty-seven\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based on this computation, day\n   <strong>\n    seventy\n   </strong>\n   on the speedy trial clock ran on Sunday, December 17, 2017. Accordingly, even if plea negotiations occurred upon Ms. Lockard's return in January 2018, time had already expired on the speedy trial clock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    2.

(Doc. 3). These offenses are unquestionably serious. Indeed, Defendant does not dispute this conclusion. (Doc. 26 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, the first factor weighs in favor of dismissal without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Facts and Circumstances Leading to Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In assessing the facts and circumstances leading to dismissal, the Court looks to the occurrences leading to the passage of more than seventy non-excludable days, up to the date of the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sherer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266063\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/407/#p411\">\n    770 F.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (6th Cir. 2014) (joining other circuits in finding that \"a motion for dismissal [under the Speedy Trial Act] is effective only for periods of time which antedate [its] filing ... [and therefore the] court need only consider alleged delay which occurs prior to and including the date on which the motion is made\") (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based on the Court's calculation,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the point at which the speedy trial clock began to run unchecked was after November 4, 2017. Notably, this was the point at which defense counsel was recently out on leave. Based on the Government's emails, it is apparent that the prosecutor reached out to Ms. Lockard and Mr. Monahan, in an effort to keep the case moving forward. The email response to the prosecutor clearly indicated, in the absence of any objection from Defendant, the FPD intended to defer the case and await Ms. Lockard's return. The email response also stated that the FPD would be in touch with the Government after meeting with Defendant. No further communications\n   were received until after the speedy trial clock had run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This Court recognizes that Defendant \"has no duty to bring himself to trial and has no duty to bring any delay to the court's attention.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, \"[d]efendants who passively wait for the speedy trial clock to run have [a lesser right] to dismissal with prejudice than do defendants who unsuccessfully demand prompt attention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11193539\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/426/#p431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Moreover, Defendant does bear responsibility to keep the Court and opposing party apprised as to his own intentions and status, particularly where he has promised to do so or where it is clear that such communications are expected. The Sixth Circuit specifically noted in\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   that the case was distinguishable from the Sixth Circuit's prior opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830166\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/146/\">\n    17 F.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1994), \"because the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   court was waiting to receive information from the defendant, while ...

Here, defense counsel states that as of November 3, 2017, the defense had \"copies of all of the discovery that was necessary to evaluate the case.\" (Doc. 26 at 3). Defense counsel also acknowledges that, \"[a]fter receiving the discovery in full, [Defendant] and his counsel decided not to file pretrial motions....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, defense counsel readily admits that, even while physically out of the office during her maternity leave, she maintained constant communication (presumably on other cases) via email and telephone, and that she in fact received the Government's November 3, 2017 email the day it was sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Regardless, defense counsel said nothing to opposing counsel or to the Court regarding Defendant's decision not to file motions, opting instead to \"passively wait for the speedy trial clock to run.\"\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11193539\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/426/#p431\">\n    217 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Regardless, however, this Court recognizes its own role in the delay leading to dismissal. Ironically, the error leading to the speedy trial violation first arose because this Court left pending Defendant's August 21, 2017 motion\n   <em>\n    seeking an open-ended continuance\n   </em>\n   . From the Court's perspective, Defendant's request for additional time was entirely reasonable and warranted. The issue, however, was that the Court viewed Defendant's motion as effectively resolved by the July 25, 2017 Notation Order, in which Defendant was already granted leave to file motions after reviewing discovery. Thus, the Court expected that Defendant would proceed to review discovery and inform the Court if and when he was prepared to file pretrial motions or establish a trial calendar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, based on the facts and circumstances known to the Court, the amount of time that had passed did not raise any alerts. Specifically, the Court knew that Defendant faced a number of very significant charges, exposing him to a substantial term of incarceration if convicted. The Court also knew that Defendant needed time to review additional discovery, which discovery Defendant would receive after the protective order was entered on September 22, 2017. The Court also communicated with defense counsel directly on October 25, 2017, with regard to Defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motions. At no point during this exchange did defense counsel express any uncertainty as to whether she would be permitted to file late motions on Defendant's behalf, nor did she give any indication that she did not intend to file motions (which would have clearly contradicted Defendant's wishes, as expressed in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   correspondence). Shortly thereafter, the\n   Court became aware that defense counsel was out on maternity leave and would not be returning to the office for several weeks. Under the circumstances, the Court did not consider imposing upon defense counsel or her colleagues for a formal status report. The Court expected it would hear from defense counsel upon her return or would be informed if there were any issues in the interim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Admittedly, the sound approach would have been for this Court to formally rule on Defendant's August 21, 2017 motion, once again grant leave to file motions after reviewing discovery, and to memorialize that ruling with a new ends-of-justice finding, just as this Court had done on two prior occasions. However, the Court relied upon its belief that Defendant was working to move his case forward and that any issues would be brought to the Court's attention. The Court was mistaken in this regard, as was the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court agrees that a technical violation of the Speedy Trial Act occurred. This Court also finds that both the Court and the Government would have been wise to utilize a strict, formulaic approach, rather than relying on their assumptions of good faith. However, the reason for the delay, at its core, was that the Court and the Government mistakenly believed they were awaiting either a motion or an update from Defendant. Thus, defense counsel's failure to communicate was a significant contributing factor in the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Impact of Re-Prosecution on the Speedy Trial Act and the Administration of Justice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"The main considerations that the courts have taken into account when examining this factor are whether the defendant suffered actual prejudice as a result of the delay and whether the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct that must be deterred to ensure compliance with the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant concedes only that the delay from June 26, 2017 to October 6, 2017 is attributable to the defense. The remainder of the delay Defendant attributes to the Government and the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, Defendant argues that the Government was negligent in its obligation to track speedy trial time. (Doc. 27 at 3-4). Defendant asserts that while \"the government assumed [Defendant] would file pretrial motions and thereby toll the speedy trial clock ... [he], as per his right, decided not to file pretrial motions ... [and] [t]he government thereafter failed to track the speedy trial clock and did not inform the Court when time was set to expire.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of his prior motion to dismiss, Defendant also argued that the Government was negligent in providing discovery timely. (Doc. 26 at 2-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court finds that the Government was neither negligent nor acting in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As to discovery, the Government made its initial production timely, as Defendant repeatedly acknowledged. That the Government needed to supplement its initial discovery production is by no means uncommon nor unreasonable. And the email communications exchanged between the prosecutor and defense counsel demonstrate that the Government made every effort to respond to Defendant's supplemental discovery requests and to provide those items as promptly as possible. (Doc. 28-1). Admittedly, there were some delays in production. However, most, if not all, of the delays were caused by circumstances outside the Government's control,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , needing to obtain the additional items Defendant requested, addressing technical issues, or having to await the preparation of the production. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, Gov't Email to Defense, Oct. 19, 2017, \"I don't have [lab reports] either. I'll get those to you tomorrow. I will also re-burn the videos that did not work. The person who does the redactions is in training and I've asked my agent to follow up on ... the 4/7 video ... [and] the search warrant photos\"). The Government can hardly be faulted for these types of delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Government was not negligent in providing discovery, nor that the timing of production was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Further, the Court rejects Defendant's argument as to the Government's alleged negligence in tracking the speedy trial clock. Defendant argues that he was not required to file pre-trial motions, which is entirely accurate. However, based on defense counsel's representations, the Government innocently, albeit mistakenly, anticipated that Defendant would either file pre-trial motions or would communicate intent to forego filing. (Doc. 28 at 3). The Government's assumption was entirely reasonable and, indeed, was precisely what this Court assumed as well. The Government also interpreted the July 25, 2017 notation order as the Court giving Defendant sufficient time to review discovery and file late motions if needed. Indeed, this was precisely what the Court intended. Thus, the Government's interpretation was not only reasonable, but accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Conversely, the notion that the Government should somehow intuit Defendant's\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     unspoken\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   intent to forego filing pretrial motions, and should then be held responsible to notify the Court of the resulting speedy trial issue, is unfair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   So too is the notion that any party should be permitted to reap the rewards of having successfully deceived the Court and opposing counsel. While the Government certainly has the obligation to track speedy trial, it is inherent to assume that opposing counsel is acting in good faith. Here, defense counsel's failure to notify anyone of her client's decision not to file pretrial motions, and to then take advantage of her own failure to communicate, was sharp practice and should not serve as a means to pass blame\n   onto the Government. Although the Government acted on ultimately erroneous assumptions, there is nothing to indicate bad faith or negligence on its part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendant also argues that the Court negligently caused delay in his case by failing to act on his first motion to dismiss. (Doc. 27 at 4-6). Specifically, Defendant argues that this Court \"should have ruled on [Defendant's] speedy trial motion by Thursday, March 29, 2018,\" and that \"61 days have passed since the speedy trial motion should have been decided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, Defendant assumes that merely because he did not request a hearing, that his motion is automatically ripe for decision as soon as it is briefed. (Doc. 27 at 3, n.1). Whether a hearing is helpful or necessary is a matter for the Court to decide, not the parties. And, here, this Court fully intended to set Defendant's initial motion to dismiss for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Specifically, the Government's response in opposition to the motion to dismiss referenced a number of email communications, which emails were said to evidence ongoing plea negotiations. (Doc. 25 at 5, n.1). The Government did not elaborate further, concluding that plea negotiations would not have automatically tolled time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). However, as this Court explains,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   plea negotiations do indeed toll time automatically. Accordingly, this Court intended to give the Government an opportunity to present this evidence at a hearing, in order for the Court to determine whether time was actually tolled by virtue of those plea negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Subsequently, however, Defendant filed the second motion to dismiss (Doc. 27), and the Court awaited briefing to determine whether both motions may require a hearing and perhaps whether the motions could be heard together. The Court's decision to wait was not inactivity or negligence, but a considered decision, based on how the Court believed, in its discretion, it could best manage its own substantially overcrowded docket.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/321/#p329\">\n    476 U.S. at 329-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/321/#p329\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the phrase 'or other prompt disposition' in [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(D) ] does not imply that only 'reasonably necessary' delays may be excluded between the time of filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing thereon\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The second motion to dismiss was not fully briefed until July 4, 2018,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the day after the Court reasonably expected to receive Defendant's reply. Once briefing was concluded, the Court found upon review that the Government had attached its previously referenced emails to its response to Defendant's second motion to dismiss and further elaborated on the timing of when plea negotiations began and ended. (Doc. 28-1). Upon further consideration, the Court concluded that a hearing on the original motion to dismiss was no longer required. The Court also determined that it would proceed to rule on the second motion to dismiss without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Thus, the time that elapsed beginning with the filing of the original motion to dismiss through the date 30-days after the second motion to dismiss was ripe for decision (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , at least August 4, 2018) is all reasonably attributable to Defendant's own filings. Accordingly, the Government cannot be \"more to blame,\" if at all, for that period of delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doggett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    505 U.S. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court again acknowledges its role in the delay since the motions became ripe for decision. However, this delay is based\n   entirely on the \"neutral reason\" of the Court's own overcrowded docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts should be weighted less heavily ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In sum, the reasons for the delay throughout the entirety of this case are either neutral as to both parties or are attributable to Defendant. The Government is certainly not \"more to blame\" for the delay than Defendant and defense counsel. Accordingly, the second factor weighs against dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    third\n   </strong>\n   factor is Defendant's assertion of his right. \"Whether and how a defendant asserts his right is closely related to the other factors,\" in that \"[t]he strength of [a defendant's] efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the reason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always readily identifiable, that he experiences.\"\n   <em>\n    Barker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, quite the contrary to asserting his right to a speedy trial, Defendant had sought an extension of time and two subsequent continuances in this case, the last of which was not even time-limited. (Docs. 16, 17, 20). And though Defendant initially sought to maintain his trial setting (Doc. 16), he subsequently acknowledged that his need for additional time necessitated continuing the trial date (Doc. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Accordingly, the third factor weighs against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Finally, the\n   <strong>\n    fourth\n   </strong>\n   factor is any resulting prejudice to Defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Prejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect ...

However, Defendant's motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act (Doc. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and the Indictment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The Court's Calendar Order instructed defense counsel to submit the status report to the Court via email, with copy to opposing counsel. (Doc. 15). It is this Court's practice to accept email submissions of not only status reports, but also certain requests for action (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , requests for a continuance or to schedule a hearing). The Court's adoption of this practice is a courtesy extended to counsel in all cases, in an effort to relieve some burden on practicing attorneys by offering an easier, informal manner for disposing of commonplace case management tasks. Notably, the continued viability of this practice requires practitioners to act in good faith and to remain diligent in abiding by orders and deadlines.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The Court's Notation Order stated that the time elapsing from June 26, 2017 (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the date of Defendant's motion) until July 24, 2017, was excludable due to ongoing plea negotiations. (Not. Order, July 7, 2017). However, Defendant's June 23, 2017 email status report conveyed that the parties were already engaged in active plea negotiations. Thus, the Court's statement as to when the excludable period commenced should have reflected an earlier date of at least June 23, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    n.6\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n    But the Court's statement is not determinative as to the proper exclusionary period, because \"other proceedings\" under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1) are subject to\n    <em>\n     automatic exclusion\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     United States v.
