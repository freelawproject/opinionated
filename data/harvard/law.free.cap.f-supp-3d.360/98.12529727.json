Vanessa L. Bryant, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Nicole Chase brings the instant action alleging claims arising out of her arrest by the Canton Police following a complaint of sexual assault by her then employer, Defendant Calvin Nodine. Ms. Chase brings thirteen claims against Nodine's Smokehouse and Calvin Nodine (the \"Nodine Defendants\"), and ten claims against the Town of Canton, Detective John Colangelo, Officer Adam Gompper, Sergeant Mark J. Penney, and Chief Christopher Arciero (the \"Town Defendants\"), including false arrest, malicious prosecution, denial of equal protection, denial of substantive due process, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 1-1 (Notice of Removal, Att. 1 (Compl.) ) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Town Defendants now move to dismiss all claims against them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the purposes of the motion to dismiss, the court assumes the following facts set forth in the Complaint to be true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Chase started working at Nodine's Smokehouse, Inc. (\"Nodine's Smokehouse\") in or about September 2016. [Dkt. 1-1 \u00b6 7]. She initially worked at the Nodine's Smokehouse factory, and later assisted with Nodine's Restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Nodine's Restaurant opened in or about November 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For most of the time Ms. Chase worked at Nodine's Restaurant, Calvin Nodine, the owner, would come by the restaurant regularly but usually would not stay for very long.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 30. When he was there, Mr. Nodine \"would engage in inappropriate conduct that made [Ms. Chase] feel uncomfortable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. For example, Mr. Nodine, on more than one occasion, purposefully dropped his eye glasses on the floor and directed Ms. Chase to pick them up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When she would do as directed, he would stare down her shirt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Nodine would make suggestive comments and jokes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would also stare at Ms. Chase and follow her around.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Nodine's behavior made Ms. Chase uncomfortable, but she \"put up with it because he was never around in the restaurant very long.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Nodine started spending more time at Nodine's Restaurant in April 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. On May 6, 2017, Mr. Nodine was at the restaurant while Ms. Chase was working.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. That day, Mr. Nodine made multiple offensive sexual comments directed at Ms. Chase, which she ignored.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39-40. Mr. Nodine also made unwanted and uncomfortable physical contact with Ms. Chase multiple times that day, including hugging and kissing her on the cheek and later coming up behind her and squeezing her body and her buttocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b641-44. At the end of the day, Mr. Nodine pulled Ms. Chase into the men's bathroom, locked the door, and forced Ms. Chase to perform oral sex on him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the incident, Ms. Chase texted her former general manager at Nodine's Restaurant and told him of the assault, leaving out the detail that Mr. Nodine had successfully forced her to perform oral sex on him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 101. He told her to report it to the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Chase told her mother about the assault that night as well, again leaving out the oral sex detail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, May 7, 2017, Ms. Chase went with her mother to the Canton Police Department to report the assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 60. Defendant police officer Adam Gompper met with Ms. Chase, who had her relate the details of the assault in the lobby of the Canton Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Ms. Chase told Officer Gompper that she was not sure if she wanted to press charges at that time, and Officer Gompper told her to come back and make a written statement if she decided to pursue charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Ms. Chase returned to the Police Department on Thursday, May 11, 2017, and spoke to Officer Gompper again, who typed up her statement and had her sign it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Ms. Chase did not specify that Mr. Nodine had forced her to perform oral sex during either of the meetings or in the written statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101. Two other Nodine's Restaurant employees provided statements to the police corroborating\n   Ms. Chase's account of Mr. Nodine's other behavior towards her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Ms. Chase's arrest warrant, Officer Gompper and Defendant Detective John Colangelo interviewed Mr. Nodine on May 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. Mr. Nodine had his attorney present and, while he initially denied any sexual contact with Ms. Chase, after conferring with his attorney, he told Officer Gompper and Detective Colangelo that Ms. Chase had performed consensual oral sex on him on one occasion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. The Police Department did not update Ms. Chase following Mr. Nodine's interviews as Officer Gompper had said they would.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. After trying to reach Officer Gompper multiple times to get an update on her case, Ms. Chase was able to speak with him and he informed her that the Department was still investigating the matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 21, 2017, Ms. Chase reported to the Police Department at their request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. She met with Detective Colangelo, whom she was meeting for the first time, in an interview room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. Detective Colangelo asked Ms. Chase about her story and then pressed her for more information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-97. Detective Colangelo told Ms. Chase that Mr. Nodine had told them she had performed consensual oral sex on him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100. He also told her that Mr. Nodine had taken a lie detector test, leaving out that he had failed that test and then refused to take another test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 136. Ms. Chase felt that Detective Colangelo was being aggressive and was intimidated by him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She became emotional and, despite being ashamed and uncomfortable with explaining the specifics, she told Detective Colangelo that Mr. Nodine forced her to perform oral sex and that it was not consensual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-104. Thereafter, Detective Colangelo focused on Ms. Chase's prior omission of these details and questioned whether Mr. Nodine had sexually assaulted her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Chase told Detective Colangelo about the text messages she sent her former manager shortly after the assault, and Detective Colangelo asked that she provide them with copies of the messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-107. Detective Colangelo told Ms. Chase that she had made a false statement and asked if she wanted to revise her previous statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-109. While denying that her statement had been false, Ms. Chase told Detective Colangelo that she would like to revise her statement but would like to speak with a lawyer first.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Several days later, Ms. Chase called Detective Colangelo to try to coordinate a time to come in and amend her statement but she was unable to reach him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. The Court infers Ms. Chase to allege that she left messages asking Detective Colangelo to call her back but he failed to return her calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Ms. Chase's arrest warrant, Detective Colangelo signed the warrant application for the arrest of Ms. Chase for making a false statement on July 7, 2017, 16 days after he interviewed her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111. Around July 13, 2017, Ms. Chase went to the police department to drop off copies of the text messages and again asked to speak with Detective Colangelo about revising her statement, but he was not available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112-113. Ms. Chase thereafter emailed Detective Colangelo multiple times about revising her statement, the second time attaching revisions to be incorporated into her original statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-118. On August 10, 2017, Detective Colangelo responded to Ms. Chase's emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119. In his response, Detective Colangelo indicated that he did not know she had wanted to give a new statement but stated that he had documented the change in her story and had provided the case to the court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He further indicated that the case was still with the State's Attorney's office and that he hoped to have next steps shortly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the Assistant State's Attorney signed the warrant application on August 30, 2017, after Ms. Chase's many attempts to revise her statements and after Detective Colangelo finally acknowledged those requests and represented to Ms. Chase that he had documented the change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. The warrant was signed by the court on September 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122. On September 8, 2017, Detective Colangelo arrested Ms. Chase for making a false statement in violation of Connecticut General Statute \u00a7 53a-57b and she was thereafter arraigned on the charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123, 126. On November 6, 2017, the State's Attorney's Office entered an unconditional nolle prosequi and the case was dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 10, 2018, Ms. Chase filed this lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford. Case No. HHD-CV-17-5049825-S. On April 20, 2018, the Town Defendants-the Town of Canton, Detective Colangelo, Detective Gompper, Sergeant Penney, and Town of Canton Chief of Police Christopher Arciero-removed the case to federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Chase's Complaint alleges violations of the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act for harassment, hostile work environment, retaliation, and aiding and abetting; violations of Title VII for harassment, hostile work environment, and retaliation; negligent infliction of emotional distress; intentional infliction of emotional distress; intentional and/or reckless assault and battery; negligent assault and battery; invasion of privacy; false imprisonment; intimidation based on bigotry or bias; and malicious prosecution against the Nodine Defendants. [Dkt. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 140-219]. It also alleges false arrest; malicious prosecution; denial of equal protection; denial of substantive due process; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the Town Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 220-279. On July 24, 2018, the Town Defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them. [Dkt. 34 (Mot.

Ms. Chase does not allege a sloppy investigation followed by a hasty conclusion resulting in denial of insurance coverage by an insurance company. She alleges much more extreme conduct: that the Town of Canton police chose not to take her claims against Mr. Nodine seriously, treated Ms. Chase as though she was the assailant rather than a victim of sexual assault, willfully or recklessly ignored her attempts to clarify her statement of the events of her sexual assault, knowingly misrepresented the facts surrounding her statement in a sworn affidavit to the State's Attorney and a judge in order to obtain a warrant for her arrest for making a false statement, and then arrested her for initially leaving a salacious detail out of the recounting of her assault. Ms. Chase alleges more than the simple fact of her arrest; she alleges improper conduct leading up to an arrest which caused her significant emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Detective Colangelo as well as Officer Gompper, who Ms. Chase alleges was involved in the development and execution of the case.

This argument fails because the Court has concluded that Ms. Chase has alleged facts sufficient to state \u00a7 1983 false arrest and malicious prosecution claims based on violation of her Fourth Amendment right not to be arrested or prosecuted without probable cause. The Town Defendants make no arguments that the violated rights were not clearly established or that it would have been objectively reasonable for Defendants to believe that their actions were lawful. And the Court believes that such arguments would have failed at this stage given that one's right not to be prosecuted absent probable cause is not, and has not for some time, been in question. As such, the Court finds that the Town Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Town Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Counts 15, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 24 are DISMISSED. Additionally, Counts 14 and 17 are dismissed as to Sergeant Penney. Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 personal capacity and state and common law claims for false and arrest and malicious prosecution (Counts 14, 16, 17, and 19), as well as her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim (Count 23) remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    A court considering a motion to dismiss may consider \"the factual allegations in plaintiffs' amended complaint, which are accepted as true, ... documents attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference, ... matters of which judicial notice may be taken, or ... documents either in plaintiffs' possession or of which plaintiffs had knowledge and relied on in bringing suit.\"\n    <em>\n     Brass v.

The Court agrees with the Town Defendants that the two exhibits attached to Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum, transcripts of the police interviews of Nicole Chase and Calvin Nodine, [Dkt. 43-2 (Opp'n Ex. 1, Tr. of Nodine Interview); Dkt. 43-3 (Opp'n Ex. 2, Tr. of Chase Interview) ], do not fall into any of these categories because they were not attached to or incorporated into the Complaint by reference, they are not matters of which the Court may take judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201 because they are unofficial transcripts of non-public interviews, and Plaintiff did not rely upon them in bringing suit, as evidenced by the fact that they were not quoted or referenced in the Complaint. To consider the transcripts would require the Court to treat the motion as one for summary judgment under Rule 56 and allow Defendants the opportunity to conduct necessary discovery and submit corresponding pertinent materials. The Court therefore does not take the two transcripts into consideration in deciding the Motion to Dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The remaining false arrest and malicious prosecution claims include: Count 14 for \u00a7 1983 false arrest against Detective Colangelo, Officer Gompper, and Sergeant Penney in their personal capacities; Count 16 for state law false arrest against Detective Colangelo, Officer Gompper, Sergeant Penney, Chief Arciero, and the Town of Canton; Count 17 for \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution against Detective Colangelo, Officer Gompper, and Sergeant Penney in their personal capacities; and Count 19 for common law malicious prosecution against Detective Colangelo, Officer Gompper, Sergeant Penney, Chief Arciero, and the Town of Canton.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Defendants seem to question whether the Court will exercise jurisdiction over these claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Dkt. 34-1 at 21].
