INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case is a challenge to Ohio's current United States congressional redistricting plan (\"Map\") and each of its component districts. Plaintiffs allege the Map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that violates the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article I of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, in anticipation of the 2010 Census, the Republican State Leadership Committee (\"RSLC\"), a national organization designed to elect Republicans to state-level offices, formulated a strategy to solidify and increase Republican control of state legislatures in states where the congressional redistricting process would be controlled by those legislative bodies. (Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6 44). To implement this strategy, the RSLC organized and implemented the REDistricting Majority Project (\"REDMAP\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45). REDMAP aimed to control the redistricting process in certain states to have the greatest impact on determining how both state legislative and congressional district boundaries would be drawn, to solidify conservative policymaking at the state level, and to maintain a Republican stronghold in the U.S. House of Representatives for the next decade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Ohio was one of the states targeted by the RSLC under REDMAP and that the RSLC spent nearly $ 1 million on races for the Ohio House of Representatives in advance of the 2010 election. (Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6 46). In 2010, the Republican Party \"captured\" the Ohio House of Representatives, bringing Ohio under single-party control of the Republican Party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the November 2010 elections, Plaintiffs allege, the Republican Party shifted its focus to help state map drawers in their efforts to capture more seats through redistricting. They did this in part by utilizing the single-party control of the Ohio General Assembly to dictate the drawing of Ohio's U.S. congressional map. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ohio's General Assembly has the primary authority for drawing Ohio's U.S. congressional districts. (Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6 42); Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 103.51. However, Plaintiffs allege the Map was actually drawn by Ohio Republican operatives Ray DiRossi and Heather Mann, who were provided with the RNC's redistricting training materials and who worked in coordination with national Republican operatives including Adam Kincaid and Tom Whatman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-55). Mr. Kincaid is the Redistricting Coordinator of the NRCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55). Mr. Whatman was the executive director of \"Team Boehner\"-named after then-Speaker of the House John Boehner-which was created to work in concert with the RNC and NRCC to expand the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Ohio's congressional map was designed to pack Democrats into four districts, and crack Democratic voters across the remaining 12 districts, to ensure Republicans would maintain a 12-4 advantage in Ohio's congressional seats. (Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 59-61). Plaintiffs argue that the Map burdens their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and exceeds the state's power under Article I of the U.S. Constitution because it is a product of partisan gerrymandering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' subpoenas and the Respondents' responses.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs served subpoenas on Mr. Kincaid, the RNC, and the NRCC on June 28, 2018, July 2, 2018, and July 2, 2018 respectively. (Declaration of Theresa Lee (\"Lee Dec.\") at \u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Respondents ran search terms provided by Plaintiffs and retrieved 23,687 documents. (Declaration of Shawn Sheehy (\"Sheehy Dec.\") at \u00b6 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of those documents, 22,915 were non-responsive to Plaintiffs' subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Respondents withheld 236 documents pursuant to various privileges and produced the remaining 75 documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There are three privileges at issue. First, Respondents contend some of the documents at issue are shielded from discovery by the First Amendment privilege. In support of this claim, Respondents submitted the declarations of Chris Winkleman (general counsel of the NRCC), Dalton Oldham (national redistricting counsel for the RNC), and Mr. Kincaid. All three affidavits state the documents they are withholding pursuant to the First Amendment privilege were intended to assist Republican candidates in winning elections, and disclosure of those documents would \"drastically and adversely affect\" how they communicated in the future. (Declaration of Dalton Oldham (\"Oldham Dec.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11; Declaration of Chris Winkleman (\"Winkleman Dec.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 9-14; Declaration of Adam Kincaid (\"Kincaid Dec.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 14-19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, the RNC argues that documents identified on its privilege log are shielded from discovery by the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine. (Doc. 1-3 at PID # 165).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To evaluate Respondents' privilege claims, the Court ordered Respondents to produce the contested documents for in camera review. (Docs. 101, 116). The Court has reviewed all of the documents at issue,\n   with the exception of several documents that can only be viewed on mapdrawing software the Court does not have, and rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties may \"obtain discovery regarding any\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     nonprivileged\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the party's resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The sole question before the Court is whether the documents withheld by Respondents fall outside the scope of Rule 26 because they are protected by the First Amendment privilege, the attorney-client privilege, and/or the work-product doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The First Amendment Privilege.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Respondents argue that some documents in their possession, and responsive to Plaintiffs' subpoenas, are shielded from discovery by the First Amendment privilege because disclosure would result in a chilling effect on Respondents' protected speech. (Memo. in Opp. at PID # 407-34). Plaintiffs argue the First Amendment privilege does not apply, and even if it does, Plaintiffs' interest in the information sought outweighs the potential for a chilling effect. (Motion at PID # 10-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

(Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 52-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Respondents argue they should not have to produce the documents at issue because the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Bandemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204370\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/109/#p127\">\n    478 U.S. at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204370\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/109/#p127\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that \"[a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.\" (Memo. in Opp. at PID # 402).

Documents in the possession of the entities and individuals alleged to have participated in or influenced the Map drawing process are circumstantial evidence of the validity (or invalidity) of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As the Court explained in a prior Order, documents that are not related to\n   <em>\n    Ohio's\n   </em>\n   redistricting (or fundraising for the same) are not relevant or proportional to the needs of this lawsuit. (Doc. 102 at 18). Along those lines, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a need for documents pertaining exclusively to states other than Ohio that is sufficient to justify the potential infringement of Respondents' First Amendment rights. To the extent any of the documents withheld by Respondents pursuant to the First Amendment privilege pertain\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to states other than Ohio, Respondents need not produce them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs cannot obtain these documents elsewhere. Plaintiffs have engaged in an extensive effort to obtain relevant documents from other sources. Plaintiffs have,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) served Rule 34 discovery requests on three Defendants and seven Intervenors; (2) served Rule 45 subpoenas on 37 people and organizations, including Ohio legislators, Ohio staff members, the RSLC, and State Government Leadership Foundation, and other national republicans; and (3) submitted public records requests to the offices of members of the Ohio General Assembly who played an identifiable role in Ohio's 2011 redistricting. (Lee Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Despite these efforts, Plaintiffs have not obtained the documents Respondents are withholding pursuant to privilege. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Fourth, in balancing the parties' respective First Amendment interests, the Court notes that while Respondents have shown the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of interests protected by the First Amendment, they have not shown that those interests are particularly strong. That is, Respondents have not convincingly shown that disclosure of the documents at issue in this case is likely to have a significant chilling effect on protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Initially, while disclosure of internal political documents like those withheld by Respondents\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   have a chilling effect on the exercise of protected activities, that threat is \"far less compelling than the evidence presented in cases involving groups whose members had been subjected to violence, economic reprisals, and police or private harassment[.]\"\n   <em>\n    AFL-CIO v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109328,3701914\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/168/\">\n    333 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Most importantly, however, Respondents have not set forth any argument explaining why disclosure of\n   <em>\n    any one\n   </em>\n   of the numerous documents withheld pursuant to First Amendment privilege would require them to change the way they communicate, nor have they attempted to explain how that change would frustrate their organizations' advocacy goals. Instead, Respondents attempt to shield five bankers' boxes of documents from discovery by stating in boilerplate fashion that disclosure would adversely affect the way they communicate. The Court finds Plaintiffs' interest in obtaining these documents to support a crucial element of their partisan gerrymandering claim simply outweighs Respondents' sweeping and conclusory claims of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Attorney-Client Privilege.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Respondents argue that the documents listed on the RNC's privilege log are shielded from discovery by the attorney-client privilege. (Memo. in Opp. at PID # 434-36). Plaintiffs argue Respondents have not established the applicability of the privilege. (Motion at PID # 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The attorney-client privilege is based on two related principles. First, subjecting lawyers to routine examinations of their clients' confidential communications would offend the loyalty that forms an intrinsic part of the relationship between a lawyer and client.\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Again, there is no evidence that any of these people are attorneys, much less that they were in an attorney client relationship.\n    <em>\n     Respondents do not even offer any argument as to how these particular documents are privileged\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Mr. Oldham submitted a second declaration (\"Second Oldham Dec.\") that attempts to advocate for the applicability of the work-product doctrine (Doc. 96-1), but that declaration does not state that any document listed on the RNC's privilege log was a confidential communication between client and attorney pertaining to legal advice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The breadth of Mr. Oldham's conclusory assertion that all documents marked \"work product\" (i.e., every single document on the RCN privilege log) were prepared in anticipation of litigation is troubling. For example, REV_00023166 is an email between Mr. Wild, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Hofeller. There is no indication that any of these people are attorneys or that they were acting on behalf of an attorney, there is no explanation as to what role these individuals played, if any, in preparing the RNC for litigation, and there is no indication that potential litigation was the driving force behind this communication. That Respondents withheld this document pursuant to the work-product doctrine, but failed to set forth\n    <em>\n     any argument at all\n    </em>\n    as to why the doctrine would apply, gives the Court reason to question the veracity of Mr. Oldham's broad, conclusory claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
