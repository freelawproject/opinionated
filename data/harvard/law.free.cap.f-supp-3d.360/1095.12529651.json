Had Defendant's counsel researched the issue, he would have seen this lack of case law and likely conducted the same statutory analysis that this Court just conducted, requested discovery regarding the statutory analysis, and then advised Defendant that the Government\n   may not have evidence that Defendant committed the crime. Additionally, counsel's failure to research Defendant's case or advise him that he likely did not commit the crime charged against him cannot be seen as a reasonably objective tactical or strategical decision; it was a failure to perform the duties expected of a defense attorney.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535550\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/695/#p702\">\n    898 F.2d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
