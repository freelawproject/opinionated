The Tribe challenges the Federal Defendants' refusal to exercise jurisdiction over a permit submitted pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , relating to Intervenor-Defendant Aquila Resources Inc.'s proposal to construct the Back Forty Mine in Menominee County, Michigan. Instead of the EPA, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) is overseeing the permitting process. In its initial complaint, the Tribe asserted two separate claims: First, the\n   Tribe claimed that the Federal Defendants had a mandatory duty under the CWA to assume jurisdiction over the Section 404 permit process, which the Tribe could enforce pursuant to the CWA's citizen suit provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Tribe claimed that the Federal Defendants' refusal to assert jurisdiction over the permit process is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The court held oral argument on the motions on August 1, 2018, and the parties submitted supplemental briefing on the matter. On September 11, 2018, the Tribe filed a motion to amend the complaint, seeking to add two new claims. In its proposed amended complaint, the Tribe asserts, first, that the EPA's withdrawal of its objections to the permit was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the APA and, second, that the EPA's failure to consult with the Menominee Tribe pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20300101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 300101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , before the permit for the mine was issued was also arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the APA. For the reasons explained below, the motion to amend will be denied, the motions to dismiss will be granted, and the case will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory and regulatory background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972 \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Although the Act generally prohibits the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters without a permit,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps, may issue a Section 404 permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters. \u00a7 1344(a). The EPA retains oversight of the Section 404 permitting program and may veto the Corps' approval of a permit when the dredged or fill material would have \"an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas ..., wildlife, or recreational areas.\" \u00a7 1344(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Act, a state may request permission from the EPA to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters ... other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce ... including wetlands adjacent thereto.\" \u00a7 1344(g)(1). Once the EPA approves a state's Section 404 permit program, that state assumes jurisdiction over the permitting process and the federal program is suspended. \u00a7 1344(h). Even with its program suspended, the federal government acts as an overseer of the state's process by reviewing any action the state takes with respect to Section 404 permits. \u00a7 1344(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 1344(j), the state must provide the EPA with a copy of every permit application it receives as well as a copy of the permit the state intends to issue. The EPA Administrator then provides copies of the application to the Corps and notifies the state within 30 days if it intends to comment on the state's handling of the application. The EPA must submit its comments to the state within 90 days. Once a state is notified that the EPA intends to comment on the application, it may not issue a permit until it has received the EPA's comments or the 90-day commenting period has passed. If the EPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   objects to the application, the state \"shall not issue such proposed permit\" and may either issue a revised permit that resolves the EPA's objections, deny the permit application, or request a public hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Permitting authority only transfers back to the Corps if the state does not take any action in response to the EPA's objection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To date, only Michigan and New Jersey have been federally approved to administer Section 404 permit procedures.

Indeed, Section 404 and the EPA's corresponding regulations do not contain language requiring that the EPA object to or comment on a proposed permit. Although the regulations indicate that permit objections \"shall be based on the Administrator's determination that the proposed permit is (1) the subject of an interstate dispute under \u00a7 233.31(a) and/or (2) outside requirements of the Act, these regulations, or the\n    404(b)(1) Guidelines,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20233.50\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e), the initial decision to object remains within the Administrator's discretion. And once the EPA objects, there is nothing in the CWA or the regulations specifying that the Administrator is stripped of the discretion to decide whether to later withdraw those objections. In short, the EPA's discretionary decision to object and subsequently withdraw those objections is not reviewable under the APA, as the statute is drawn in such broad terms that there is no clear law to apply and there is no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion. The Tribe therefore fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and any amendment to the complaint to add such a claim would be futile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

Indeed, it is the Secretary of the Corps, not the Administrator of the EPA, that may issue permits \"for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.\" \u00a7 1344(a).
