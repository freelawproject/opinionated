(Doc. ## 12, 13). Plaintiffs Wade Steven Gardner, Mary Joyce Stevens, Randy Whittaker (individually and in his official capacity at Southern War Cry), Phil Walters (in his official capacity as 1st Lt. Commander of the Judah P. Benjamin Camp # 2210, Sons of Confederate Veterans), Ken Daniel (in his official capacity as Director of Save Southern Heritage, Inc. Florida), and Veterans Monuments of America, Inc. responded on January 24, 2019. (Doc. ## 38, 39). For the reasons that follow, the Motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are united by their shared concerned for the preservation of history \"from a Southern perspective.\" (Doc. # 1 at 17, 18, 25). Gardner is a taxpayer in the City of Lakeland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Whittaker \"is a citizen taxpayer of Polk County, Florida with Confederate Dead in his family lineage\" and administers the organization Southern War Cry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Stevens is a descendant of \"Confederate Dead\" and is a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (\"UDC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The Judah P. Benjamin Camp # 2210 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, as represented by Walters, is a \"Florida non-profit corporation whose purpose is to 'vindicate the cause' for which the Confederate Veteran fought.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Save Southern Heritage, as represented by Daniel, is a \"South Carolina non-profit corporation whose purpose is to preserve the history of the south for future generations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Veterans Monuments of America \"is a non-profit corporation that is organized under the laws of the State of Florida whose purpose is to protect and preserve Memorials to American veterans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 20, 2018, Plaintiffs brought this action against Mutz, Delgado, Selvage, Troller, and Walker (collectively,\n   the \"City Defendants\") - all of whom are involved in Lakeland's government in various roles, such as City Commissioner, City Manager, or Mayor - as well as against Padilla, who is President of Energy Services &amp; Products Corporation, and Kenneth Detzner, who was the Florida Secretary of State at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Detzner has since been replaced as a party by Michael Ertel, who is the current Florida Secretary of State. (Doc. # 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action concerns a memorial - a \"Cenotaph\" - dedicated to Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War that stands in Lakeland's Munn Park. (Doc. # 1 at 5-7). The memorial was erected by the UDC with the approval of the Lakeland City Commission in 1910. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). The memorial is a \"massive 26' foot 2 1/2 story, approximately 14 ton Cenotaph, with base dimensions of 9' by 9.'\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The memorial is engraved with the words \"Confederate Dead,\" as well as a poem and images of Confederate flags. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over a century later, the City of Lakeland began receiving complaints about the landmarked memorial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). On December 4, 2017, the Lakeland City Commission voted at a City Council meeting to \"start the process\" of removing the memorial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Plaintiffs maintain this vote was \"a violation of the City's own Historic Preservation Ordinance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Then, \"[o]n May 7, 2018 the Lakeland City Commission voted to relocate the Cenotaph from Historic Munn Park to another site out of the historic district, 'provided private donations paid for the full costs.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October of 2018, some Defendants voted to remove the memorial using the City's funds from the red light camera program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). A Lakeland City Commission meeting was scheduled for November 19, 2018, to discuss, among other things, using revenue from the red light camera program to remove the memorial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). The Complaint does not describe the result of the November 19 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert seven counts against the various Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-29). They allege that the City Defendants have violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution by \"deciding to remove the Cenotaph which communicated minority political speech in a public forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). They seek a declaration that Defendants' actions violate their due process rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Furthermore, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants violated (i) the City of Lakeland's Historic Preservation Ordinance, (ii) Section 267.013, Florida Statutes, (iii) violated the public trust, and (iv) breached a bailment agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City Defendants and Padilla have moved to dismiss the Complaint on various grounds, including that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their federal and state claims. (Doc. ## 12, 13). Plaintiffs have responded (Doc. ## 38-39), and the Motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court accepts as true all the allegations in the complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

(Doc. # 12 at 15-17). Even if Plaintiffs had a protected liberty or property interest in the Cenotaph's placement in Munn Park (Defendants also challenge this), Defendants insist that Plaintiffs lack a particularized interest sufficient to establish standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Plaintiffs claim they are interested parties because of their beliefs - either in support of the Confederacy or merely the historical preservation of Confederate memorials as vestiges of \"the history of the South\" - as well as their status as descendants of the \"Confederate Dead.\" (Doc. # 1 at 2-3). Indeed, in their response, Plaintiffs insist that they have sufficiently particularized interests in the Cenotaph, including \"genealogical relationships and membership in associations for particular historical and cultural foci.\" (Doc. # 38 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs - whether bringing their claims as individuals or representatives of an organization - cannot base their standing on their preferences for the preservation of Confederate memorials or the \"Southern perspective.\" As Defendants explained, \"Plaintiffs' value preferences are not sufficiently particularized, but are general, public-interest grievances, and '[v]indicating the public interest ... is the function of [the legislative and executive branches],' not the judicial branch.\" (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   # 12 at 17)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, one Plaintiff - Gardner - also bases his standing on his status as a Lakeland taxpayer. (Doc. # 1 at 2). Defendants argue that Gardner does not have taxpayer standing to challenge removal of the Cenotaph. (Doc. # 12 at 16). \"A municipal taxpayer has standing 'when the taxpayer is a resident who can establish that tax expenditures were used for the offensive practice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gagliardi v.

(Doc. # 1 at 17, 21). The revenue from the red light camera program comes from citations to those who run red lights - not from taxes. So, Defendants persuasively reason, \"[b]ecause Plaintiffs do not complain about the expenditure of tax dollars, Gardner cannot establish taxpayer standing.\" (Doc. # 12 at 16). Notably, Plaintiffs fail to address this argument in their response. The Court finds that Gardner lacks taxpayer standing to challenge the relocation of the Cenotaph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, all Plaintiffs lack standing to assert the declaratory judgment claim regarding an alleged breach of procedural due process. Count IV is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Alternatively, even if Plaintiffs had standing, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish the deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest because the Cenotaph is government speech. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). According to Defendants, \"[t]he City's decision to relocate the Confederate Monument from one park to another is a legislative decision that does not deprive Plaintiffs of any constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Therefore, they argue this claim should alternatively be dismissed on the merits. The Court agrees. Because the Cenotaph is government speech and not Plaintiffs' speech, Plaintiffs lack a liberty interest in the Cenotaph and thus cannot state a procedural due process claim based on the memorial's relocation. Therefore, Count IV is also subject to dismissal on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     State Law Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   All the federal claims have now been dismissed.
