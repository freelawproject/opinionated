For the reasons set forth below, the motion [71] is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Cox Automotive, Inc. (\"Cox Automotive\"), along with its subsidiaries (collectively,\n   \"Plaintiffs\"), bring this action to remedy and enjoin purported ongoing antitrust and state law violations by Defendant CDK Global, LLC (\"CDK\" or \"Defendant\"). [Compl., at \u00b6 1.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs are vendors that provide automotive software solutions, including well-known applications like AutoTrader, Dealer.com, and Kelley Blue Book. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.] The data that dealers generate in operating their businesses-such as sales, inventory, service, and customer information-is the lifeblood of these applications. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.] Dealers store this data on a database that is part of separate enterprise software known as a Dealer Management System (\"DMS\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.] Virtually every franchised new car dealership in the United States now uses a DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.] While dealers generate much of their data outside of the DMS in separate software solutions, as a practical matter, a substantial portion of dealer data is stored on the DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The DMS Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant CDK and third-party The Reynolds and Reynolds Company (\"Reynolds\") provide DMS software and services to automobile dealerships throughout the United States. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.] Defendant and Reynolds together control approximately 75 percent of the DMS market when measured by number of dealers and approximately 90 percent when measured by number of vehicles sold. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.] Defendant alone controls approximately 45 percent of the DMS market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Switching DMS providers presents significant logistical challenges and is highly disruptive to business operations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.] It can take a dealership more than a year of preparation, staff training, and testing before a new DMS can be put into operation, all while the dealership is trying to sell and service cars. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The financial costs in terms of training and implementation are significant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant's own CEO publicly has recognized that dealers are hesitant to switch DMS providers because the process can take time and can be very difficult. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Dealer Data Integration Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The dealer data integration market consists of services that provide access to dealer data on the DMS, including Defendant's and Reynolds's own in-house data integration services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.] Data integrators may also provide value-enhancing services, such as putting data from different DMSs in a uniform format, performing data hygiene, and allowing granular control by dealers over which vendors receive which data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Before a data integrator accesses dealer data on a DMS, they enter into contracts with dealers authorizing them to access the dealers' data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Vendors of software applications like Plaintiffs rely on data integrators to provide them with access to dealer data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-65.] There once was a competitive market for data integration services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79.] Independent data integrators like Authenticom, Inc. (\"Authenticom\") competed with the offerings provided by Defendant and Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant welcomed that competition, stating: \"We don't tell the dealer, if someone wants access to their data, they have to come to [CDK] to gain access to the data. It's ultimately the dealer's data.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In competition with independent integrators, Defendant provides data integration services through its Third-Party Access (\"3PA\") program, and Reynolds does the same through its Reynolds Certified Interface (\"RCI\") program. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80, 87.] Defendant itself owns two independent integrators-DMI and IntegraLink-that provide data integration services across DMS platforms, including at one time for Reynolds dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 86.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's top executives have repeatedly made public statements that dealers may grant data integrators rights to access their DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.] For example, \"Steve Anenen, CDK's longtime CEO, publicly stated that dealers have the right to grant third parties access to, and use of, their data. He told the industry publication Automotive News, 'We're not going to prohibit that or get in the way of that.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] He further stated, \"I don't know how you can ever make the opinion that the data is yours to govern and to preclude others from having access to it, when in fact it's really the data belonging to the dealer. As long as they grant permission, how would you ever go against that wish?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] The complaint identifies similar statements made by other CDK executives. [See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Consistent with those statements, prior to 2015, Defendant publicly touted its \"open\" system as one of the competitive advantages of its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96.] Defendant issued press releases stressing that it \"believes in the fair competitive environment and does not use its leverage through supply of the dealer management system to reduce competition through the restriction of data access.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] By contrast, in 2009, Reynolds began selectively blocking third-party access to its DMS, and increased its blocking efforts in 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Despite its blocking efforts, Defendant continued to hostilely access Reynolds's DMS. Defendant was successful in marketing its \"open\" DMS as a competitive advantage over the Reynolds DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97.] As a result, Defendant very slowly gained market share from Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Reynolds's DMS market share declined from about 40 percent to 30 percent, with most dealers leaving Reynolds for Defendant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2015, Defendant \"closed\" its system, coming as a complete surprise to Plaintiffs and others in the industry. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98.] Before 2015, Plaintiffs used 3PA, DMI, IntegraLink, Superior Integrated Solutions, Inc. (\"SIS\"), and other commercial data integrators to access data for dealers using Defendant's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] But after Defendant elected to close its system, Defendant made every effort to ensure that Plaintiff and other vendors could only integrate with dealer data through Defendant's 3PA program. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs contend that Defendant's change to a \"closed\" DMS was the result of a horizontal agreement with Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In early 2015, Defendant and Reynolds entered into three written agreements that are central to this lawsuit. One of these agreements is a \"Data Exchange Agreement\"-also referred to as a \"wind-down\" agreement-pursuant to which Defendant agreed to wind down its data integration business on the Reynolds DMS, with Reynolds promising not to block Defendant's access to the Reynolds system during the wind-down period. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106.] During that period, Reynolds agreed that Defendant could continue to extract dealer data just as it had before, using login credentials provided by the dealer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As for other independent integrators, Defendant and Reynolds agreed that they would not assist any other party in accessing the\n   other's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant and Reynolds also agreed that they themselves would no longer access data on each other's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107.] Defendant also agreed to coordinate the transition of Defendant's clients that needed access to data on Reynolds's DMS to Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The other two written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds \"granted reciprocal access\" to each other's data integration products-via the 3PA and RCI programs, respectively. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112.] Under the agreements, Defendant's proprietary products and services could integrate with data on Reynolds's DMSs via RCI, and vice versa. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Reynolds received five free years of 3PA integration from Defendant, while Defendant had to pay for the data integration services from Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Moreover, by signing up for 3PA, Reynolds agreed that it would integrate with data on Defendant's DMSs exclusively through 3PA, and not obtain data for its products and services from anywhere else. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant agreed to the same in its integration contract with Reynolds for the RCI program. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the written agreements, senior CDK and Reynolds executives have admitted that they agreed to restrict access to dealer data and destroy data integrators like Authenticom, SIS, and others. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113.] During a May 2015 phone conversation with Authenticom's founder and CEO Steve Cottrell, Reynolds's Vice President of Data Services Robert Schaefer said that Reynolds had \"made agreements with the other major DMS providers\"-there only is CDK-\"to support each other's third-party access agreements and to block independent integrators such as Authenticom.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Mr. Schaefer said that Authenticom should wind down its operations and leave the market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] On April 3, 2016, at an industry convention in Las Vegas, Defendant's former Vice President of Product Management Dan McCray stated that Defendant and Reynolds had agreed to \"[l]ock [Authenticom] and the other third parties out,\" and that they were \"working collaboratively to remove all hostile integrators from our DMS system.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant's public position has been that it closed its DMS as part of a cybersecurity initiative. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150.] Plaintiffs acknowledge Defendant's claimed \"security\" justification but argue that it is pretextual. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 170-78.] According to Plaintiffs, a top-level CDK executive admitted in private conversation with a vendor that the rhetoric around \"security\" has \"little credibility\" and is primarily designed to force vendors to use Defendant for data integration. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 171.] Plaintiffs therefore claim that Defendant \"closed\" its DMS pursuant to its agreements with Reynolds in order to decrease competition in the data integration market, resulting in dramatically increased prices for data integration services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150-56.] For example, Plaintiffs allege that in July of 2015, Defendant proposed massive price increases of up to 900 percent. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152.] Plaintiffs allege that price increases for data integration services have no corresponding increase in functionality or quality of service. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.] Given that Defendant's open system resulted in lower priced and better-quality data integration services, dealers preferred its \"open\" DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 119-21, 144.] Dealers have openly complained about Defendant's decision to switch to a \"closed\" DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 119-21.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Alleged Exclusive Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shortly after entering into the Data Exchange Agreement, Defendant began \"renegotiating\" its contracts with vendors for 3PA access (actually, cancelling existing contracts and forcing vendors like Plaintiffs\n   to sign new contracts). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122.] Consistent with its decision to close its DMS, Defendant imposed exclusive dealing provisions that required vendors to use 3PA alone to integrate with data on Defendant's DMSs for all of their products and services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] CDK also took the new position that its existing contracts with dealers prohibited allowing data integrators to access its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] When Plaintiffs pushed back on these changes, Defendant said there would be \"little flexibility\" because Defendant was going to impose the same changes on every vendor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124.] After Defendant began publicly threatening to terminate Plaintiffs' access to data on CDK's DMS, Plaintiffs finally agreed to Defendant's new 3PA terms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 125, 129.] Plaintiffs allege, however, that they agreed to Defendant's new 3PA terms in reliance (at least in part) on Defendant's representation that no other vendor would pay less than Plaintiffs for integration services in the 3PA program and that Plaintiffs would receive Most Favored Nation status. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126-29.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant also forced many of its dealers to extend their contracts by years by threatening to terminate their DMS service in less than 60 days unless they entered into years-long contracts instead of the month-to-month contracts previously used by many of the dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 59.] Plaintiffs allege that dealers had no choice but to sign the lengthy extensions given the impossibility of switching DMS providers in such a short amount of time. [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In this case, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant conspired with Reynolds to (1) boycott and block independent data integrators such as Authenticom, and (2) divide the market for data integration services between each other. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' horizontal conspiracy claim fails for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are wrong about what the challenged agreements provide. Focusing on the written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds, Defendant argues that the \"agreements effect only a wind-down of [Defendant's] hostile access to Reynold's DMS[.]\" [72, at 13.] Although the 2015 written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds do not require that Defendant and Reynolds block third-party access on their own DMSs, as Judge St. Eve noted, the agreements do \"effectively require that CDK stop hostile access of Reynolds DMSs (for a period, at least) and, more importantly, expressly prohibit [Defendant and Reynolds] from assisting in the hostile access of one another's DMSs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant's executives admitted \"that the companies agreed to block and thereby destroy third-party data integrators.\" [Compl., at \u00b6 17.] \"Defendants conspired to block integrators from accessing necessary data from the dealers-meaning, 'relationships' integrators 'need'-by (among other things) withholding authorization and disabling third-party credentials, so that Defendants, ultimately, could charge more for their integration services.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , 313 F.Supp.3d at 952. Such an agreement to block data integrators from the market plausibly is anticompetitive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' Section 1 horizontal conspiracy claim fails because Plaintiffs merely have alleged parallel conduct. \"Tacit collusion, also known as conscious parallelism, does not violate section 1 of the Sherman Act.

[Compl., at \u00b6\u00b6 119-21.] It therefore is reasonable to infer that Defendant and Reynolds were motivated to conspire with each other so that they could close their systems to data integrators without fear that their customers would turn to another provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Rather, data integrators are non-contracting third parties who bear no accountability to Defendant or Reynolds for undermining their systems' security and performance. Still, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant conspired with Reynolds to block data integrators from accessing necessary data from the dealers by withholding authorization to access their respective DMSs and by disabling third-party credentials, thereby inhibiting the relationship between the data integrators and the dealers.

The Court sees no reason for the inclusion of an agreement to stop unauthorized access of a competitor's computer systems in that category. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not cite to-and the Court is not aware of-any cases treating the servicing and/or use of a competitor's product as a \"territory\" for the purposes of a market-division agreement. The Court therefore grants Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' horizontal conspiracy claim to the extent that it is based on a market-division theory but denies Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' horizontal conspiracy claim in all other respects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiffs allege that \"[a]s a condition of participating in CDK's 3PA data integration service, vendors must generally agree to use 3PA exclusively for all of the vendors' products and services.\" [Compl., at \u00b6 20; see also\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 122-23, 132-34.] Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' exclusive dealing claim fails because 3PA is a \" 'managed interface' that is part of CDK's DMS, not a separate product.\" [160, at 15.] According to Defendant, there is no separate market for data integration services because the \"peculiar characteristics\" of 3PA \"preclude any finding that it is a separate product.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Defendant fails fully to develop this argument. Although Defendant identifies two relevant factors for determining a product market (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"separate demand\" and \"the products peculiar characteristics and uses\"), Defendant does not even address other relevant factors such as \"distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown Shoe Co. v.

Plaintiffs allege that dealers are \"locked in\" Defendant's DMS. [Compl., at \u00b6\u00b6 56-60, 207.] In support of that assertion, Plaintiffs allege that \"switching costs are high\" and \"[s]witching DMS providers presents significant logistical challenges and is highly disruptive to business operations.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.] \"It can take a dealership over a year of preparation, staff training, and testing before a new DMS can be put into operation, all while the dealership is trying to dell and service cars.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Indeed, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's own CEO publicly has recognized that dealers are hesitant to switch DMSs because the process can take time and can be very difficult. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant argues that because of its contractual bars on third-party DMS access, dealers were aware of its aftermarket power and its terms when they purchased contract with Defendant. [72, at 24.] However, Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that Defendant publicly took the position that it permitted access by third-party integrators. [Compl., at \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.] For example, Plaintiffs allege that \"CDK's top executives have repeatedly made public statements that dealers may grant data integrators rights to access their DMS.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.] \"Steve Anenen, CDK's longtime CEO, publicly stated that dealers have the right to grant third parties access to, and use of, their data. He told the industry publication Automotive News, 'We're not going to prohibit that or get in the way of that.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] He further stated, \"I don't know how you\n   can ever make the opinion that the data is yours to govern and to preclude others from having access to it, when in fact it's really the data belonging to the dealer. As long as they grant permission, how would you ever go against that wish?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] The complaint identifies similar statements made by other CDK executives. [See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant nonetheless argues that dealers could not be justified in relying on these representations given contrary language in their contracts with Defendant. [160, at 19.] In making this argument, Defendant cites to cases recognizing that \"[a] party is not justified in relying on representations outside of or contrary to the written terms of a contract he or she signs when the signer is aware of the nature of the contract and had a full opportunity to read it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cromeens, Holloman, Sibert, Inc. v.

However, it is not apparent from the face of the complaint that Defendant's contracts with dealers contradict these representations. Although Defendant's contract with dealers permitted dealers to authorize its agents to access the DMS [Compl., at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 74, 82], it is not clear whether third-party data integrators were acting as the dealers' agents. Defendant argues in a footnote that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the data integrators are the agents of dealers [72, at 10 n.2], but Plaintiffs do not need to anticipate factual defenses that Defendant may raise regarding their claim.\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

Although discovery ultimately may demonstrate that data integrators were contractually prohibited from accessing Defendant's DMS, based on the well-pleaded obligations in the amended complaint it is plausible that dealers believed that they could authorize third-party integrators to access their DMSs, especially in light of public statements by CDK executives indicating that dealers had such authority. Accordingly, CDK plausibly has alleged an\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant further argues that Plaintiffs cannot complain about the alleged foreclosure of competition in the dealer-data-integration aftermarket for Defendant's DMS because any hostile integration of its DMS is unlawful under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"). [72, at 25.] However, as Defendant notes, whether a data integrator violates the CFAA depends in part on whether the data integrator \"accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access[.]\" [72, at 25 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C) ) (internal quotation marks omitted).] And, as discussed above, it is not at all clear from the complaint that data integrators lacked authorization to access Defendant's DMS. Given Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Defendant's repeated and unequivocal statements indicating that it permitted third-party integrator access, the allegations in the complaint support the contrary conclusion. Furthermore, whether data integrators violated the CFAA is a question of fact that cannot be determined based on the pleadings alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.
