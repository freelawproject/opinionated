The Secretary has moved to dismiss all claims, asserting sovereign and qualified immunity and arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons below, the Court will grant the Secretary's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Michele Compton started Plaintiff Michigan Interlock, LLC, (\"MIL\") to distribute, install, and service Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices (\"BAIID\") in Michigan. Compl. \u00b6 1. A BAIID is a \"breath alcohol analyzer\" that \"connects with a motor vehicle's ignition and other control systems\" and \"prevents a vehicle from starting if the would-be-driver's breath alcohol meets or exceeds .025 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. After a habitual drunk driver recovers his license, a BAIID must be installed in his car and driver data from the device must be provided to the Michigan Department of State.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department enforces the portion of the Michigan Vehicle Code that regulates BAIIDs, and oversees their manufacture, certification, installation, removal, and service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27-29. To certify a BAIID, the manufacturer must apply to the Department and submit an affidavit, averring that (1) the BAIID meets national standards, (2) the BAIID will periodically take samples within 15 minutes of the driver starting the car, and (3) the manufacturer will comply with the Department's reporting requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. By law, the Department maintains a list of approved BAIID manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31; M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625k. If a manufacturer is removed from this list, its BAIIDs can no longer be used in Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; M.C.L.A. 257.625q.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 18, 2006, MIL entered into an exclusive distributer agreement with\n   Defendant Alcohol Detection Systems, LLC, (\"ADS\") a Maryland corporation that manufactures BAIIDs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Thereafter, the Department certified ADS's BAIIDs and listed MIL's information on the list of approved manufacturers as ADS's distributer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. Over the years, MIL purchased, leased, distributed, installed, and serviced thousands of BAIIDs manufactured by ADS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32, 36. \"By almost any metric, the exclusive Distributer Agreement and the relationship with MIL was a major success for ADS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Similarly, MIL's annual gross income eventually exceeded $ 2 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 8, 2016, the Michigan Legislature amended the Vehicle Code to require that all BAIIDs be equipped with cameras capable of recording a digital image of the individual providing the sample.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. The amendment also empowered the Department to immediately suspend a manufacturer, and revoke that manufacturer's device from the approved list, if the manufacturer violated any section of M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625q(10). (e.g. repeated failure to submit reports in a timely matter, repeated failure to report violations, providing a person with a bypass code, etc.). A manufacturer must immediately comply with a summary suspension order, but may apply for a hearing within thirty days. M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625q(11). Notably, non-manufacturers (like MIL) do not have a statutory right to a hearing, even if they, in fact, own the de-certified BAIDD. Compl. \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As soon as this amendment took effect, ADS informed MIL that it would not replace or modify previously purchased BAIIDs to include the necessary cameras.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. To remain in business, MIL and Compton borrowed $ 1.6 million to purchase about 1,500 camera-equipped BAIIDs from ADS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. For the next few years, these new units \"failed to function properly within the Department's requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61-66. MIL informed ADS about the problems, but ADS failed to correct them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 16, 2018, Plaintiffs learned that Defendant Directed Electronics, Inc., had purchased ADS. (ADS and Directed are collectively referred to as \"the Corporate Defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege that Directed \"plotted\" to enter the BAIID market so that it could leverage its existing distribution structure in Michigan, in direct violation of MIL's exclusive distributer agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 7, 2018, the Department lodged a Summary Suspension Complaint and Order that immediately decertified BAIIDs manufactured by the Corporate Defendants, including those that MIL had already purchased and installed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. The Department never provided MIL with the opportunity to contest the order or an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. The next day, the Department issued a press release that instructed customers \"to contact [MIL] to have [their BAIID] removed - for free - and have a new device installed by one of the five approved manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86. On March 16, 2018, the Corporate Defendants sent a letter to all of MIL's customers, instructing them to call \"an ADS representative\" and providing MIL's phone number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Corporate Defendants refused to reimburse MIL for any of the de-installation costs it incurred in the aftermath of the Suspension Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From March 15, 2018 to March 30, 2018, the State Defendants and the Corporate Defendants met to discuss the Suspension Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. MIL was not notified of these discussions or given the opportunity to represent its own interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At one of these meetings, the Defendants agreed to a modified order that re-certified the BAIIDs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 30, 2018, the State\n   Defendants lifted the Suspension Order and approved the modified order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The next day, the Corporate Defendants informed Plaintiffs that the State Defendants \"no longer wanted MIL on the Department's list of approved vendors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102. The Department removed MIL's information from the list and designated ADS as both a manufacturer and distributer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At this point, Plaintiffs allege that \"the Corporate Defendants [entered] Plaintiffs' property without permission, [accessed] their computers, phones, files, and systems without permission, and otherwise [conducted] business with Plaintiffs' BAIIDs - without permission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 13, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in this case, naming the Department and Secretary Johnson, in her official and individual capacity.

She argues that she is entitled to sovereign immunity in her official capacity and qualified immunity in her individual capacity. She also argues that Plaintiffs lack standing. In response, Plaintiffs argue that sovereign immunity does not apply because they are seeking prospective injunctive relief and that they have standing to bring these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Count XIV: Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they had \"Constitutionally protected use, property, and liberty interests in the their BAIIDs, the data produced by and housed on the their BAIIDs, their certification and enlistment as an approved BAIID vendor ..., the profits generated for the use of their BAIDD, and the contracts concerning those BAIIDs.\" Compl. at \u00b6 244. The State allegedly denied these rights by lodging a Summary Suspension Order and removing them from the approved manufacturers list, without a pre- or post-deprivation hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 246-247. Plaintiffs allege that \"[u]nless restrained by this Court, the State Defendants will continue to wield their power and deprive persons and BAIID service providers of the rights, privileges or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution ... and continue to cause irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Notably, Plaintiffs do not allege that they face a threat of current or future procedural due process violations. Rather, Plaintiffs state that they were \"\n   <em>\n    deprived\n   </em>\n   of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment ... and thereby suffer and will continue to suffer substantial\n   <em>\n    damages.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 251 (emphasis added). Thus, Plaintiffs allege they are still feeling the effects of a past violation-not that a current violation\n   is harming them or that a future violation will harm them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff's complaint shows that they are not truly seeking prospective injunctive relief for this claim. Plaintiffs allege that \"[f]ederal due process principles required the State Defendants to provide a 'clear and certain remedy' \" for their deprivation of rights, and that this obligation may be satisfied by \"refunding [the money Plaintiffs paid for de-installation costs] and orchestrating the return of their equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 246. To the extent that Plaintiffs are implying that they have a claim for money damages, any such claim is barred by sovereign immunity. Further, an injunction requiring the Secretary to \"orchestrate\" the return of equipment would be retrospective (i.e. addressing a past harm), not prospective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim fails to seek prospective injunctive relief and is barred by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Count XV: Substantive Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"Substantive Due Process requires that government action that deprives individuals of life, liberty, or property be reasonably related to the police power, that is, the health, safety, welfare, or morals of the community, and that executive action not be abusive, or shocking to the conscience.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 254 (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs further allege that the Michigan Legislature created a liberty interest when it constrained the Secretary's discretion in M.C.L. \u00a7 257.625q, and that Plaintiffs had a property interest in their BAIIDS, their data, their spot on the approved list, and their contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 257. Plaintiffs claim that the Secretary deprived Plaintiffs' liberty and property interests, and this deprivation was not reasonably related to any exercise of the police power and shocked the conscience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 264. Because of this, Plaintiffs claim they \"have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs appeared to have alleged one ongoing constitutional violation: that they have a property interest in being on the list of approved BAIID manufacturers and that the Secretary arbitrarily removed them. If this is true, the violation is continuing for as long as they are left off the list. This logic also applies to the liberty interest claim; if Plaintiffs had a liberty interest in being in the BAIID business, the violation is continuing for as long as the Secretary prevents them from operating. Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' substantive due process claims fall within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception because prospective injunctive relief could be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Count XVI: Unlawful Taking\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they have property rights in their BAIIDs, data, certification, spot on the approved list, and contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 267. Plaintiffs allege that the State deprived them of these property interests without just compensation, and is using their property for the public's benefit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 270. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that the State Defendants \"have deprived Plaintiff of any and all economically beneficial use of their property\" without just compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 268-270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have alleged an ongoing Constitutional violation only as to their spot on the approved list. If Plaintiffs have a property interest in being on the approved vendor list, and the Secretary has deprived them of being on the list without just compensation, that constitutional violation would be continuous. To this extent, Plaintiffs have alleged a continuing constitutional violation where prospective injunctive relief could be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Count XVII: Declaratory Judgement that\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    M.C.L. \u00a7 257.625q\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    is Unconstitutionally Vague\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that M.C.L. \u00a7 257.625q contains provisions that are invalid under the vagueness doctrine, and seeks \"declaratory relief\" to that effect. Because this claim is not seeking prospective injunctive relief, it is barred by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition to asserting sovereign immunity, Secretary Johnson also argues that Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring their constitutional claims. Because the Court concludes that Counts XIV and XVII are barred by sovereign immunity, it will not consider whether Plaintiffs have standing for those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"To establish Article III standing, the plaintiff must allege that: (1) he has suffered an injury-in-fact that is both '(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical'; (2) the injury if fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct; and (3) it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Binno v.

Count XV: Substantive Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they have property interests in their BAIIDs, the BAIIDs' data, their certification and status as an approved vendor, and the profits generated by the use of their BAIID.

By removing Plaintiffs from its approved list, Plaintiffs allege that the Secretary deprived them of these interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 258-259.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged a concrete, particularized injury. Although Plaintiffs claim that they have been deprived of property and liberty interests, this is a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ., and the amended complaint does not provide any factual basis for the Court to conclude that either of these interests actually exist. The two statutes that Plaintiffs point to as creating these interests apply only to BAIID \"manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625k (\"the department shall provide a list of all\n   <em>\n    manufacturers\n   </em>\n   of approved certified devices to each person who is approved to be issued a restricted license ...\"); M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625q(10) (\"The administrator may order a summary suspension or revocation of the certification of a\n   <em>\n    manufacturer\n   </em>\n   and its device from the list of approved certified BAIIDs ...\"). Because Plaintiffs do not allege that they are BAIID manufacturers, the Court does not see how these statutes can create liberty or property interests for Plaintiffs that could have been harmed by Secretary Johnson's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (stating that standing requires \"an invasion of a legally protected interest.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the Plaintiffs' allegations do not establish that the harm is fairly traceable to Secretary Johnson's actions or redressable by her. The Secretary represents that she \"cannot dictate who device manufacturers utilize as local installers for the devices. The device manufacturers provide the State Defendants with the contact information to be displayed on the Secretary of State's website. Determining who will install the devices is a contractual matter between the manufacturer and local distributer.\" (ECF No. 13, PageID 446). This representation aligns with the text of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.C.L.A. \u00a7 257.625k (requiring the Department to list approved BAIID manufacturers, not distributers or installers). Thus, the alleged\n   harm appears to have been caused, and can be redressed, by the Corporate Defendants-not the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (for standing purposes, the injury cannot be \"the result of the independent action of some third party ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Count XVI: Unlawful Taking\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they have property interests in their BAIIDs, the BAIIDs' data, their certification and status as an approved vendor, the contracts governing the BAIIDs, the financing documents controlling their BAIIDs, and other monetary assets. Compl. at \u00b6 267. Plaintiffs allege that this property \"was taken from them due to the State Defendants' acts and/or omissions, and placed into the hands of the Corporate Defendant's without Plaintiffs' permissions, authorization, or approval, and/or the State Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of any and all economically beneficial use of their property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 268. Plaintiffs allege that the Secretary took their property \"for public use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As the Court previously noted, the only alleged deprivation that could be remedied by prospective injunctive relief is Plaintiffs' omission from the approved list. But, this argument fails for the same reasons that Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim fails: there are no factual allegations to establish that Plaintiffs actually had this property interest, that the Secretary actually caused the harm, or that the Secretary can redress the harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.i\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Conclusion for Official Capacity Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' procedural due process and declaratory judgment claims against Secretary Johnson, in her official capacity, are barred by sovereign immunity. Further, the Court concludes that, even though Plaintiff's substantive due process and unlawful taking claims are within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception, Plaintiffs lack standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This statute imposed no procedural requirements as to non-manufacturers, such as MIL, but the Secretary is entitled to presume that the law is constitutional. Further, MIL itself was not subject to the order, so it was not clear that MIL's rights could be affected by the Secretary's actions. Thus, at the time of the Order, the Secretary did not know that her implementation of the statute could harm MIL. In other words, Secretary Johnson is entitled to qualified immunity in her personal capacity because, at the time of the Order, it was not clearly established that she might violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS Secretary Johnson's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiffs stipulated to an order that dismissed the claims against the Department.
