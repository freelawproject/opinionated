The Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant's motion (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 32\n   </strong>\n   ) for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiffs, Maria Negron (\"Negron\"),\n   Victor Gonzalez (\"Gonzalez\"), Lizzette Gonzalez, and Miguel Gonzalez (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") purchased a seven day cruise through the Eastern Caribbean aboard the Defendant's ship, Celebrity Summit, leaving on November 4, 2017, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 29 at \u00b6 9, 10.) Four days in, Negron, who is 84 years old, began to feel dizzy and ill while the ship was docked in Barbados. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12.) Onboard medical personnel misdiagnosed Negron with a heart attack, and disembarked all of the Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) Paramedics then transported Negron to a local hospital for testing, including a CT scan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.) At the hospital, the \"Plaintiffs were exposed to unreasonable waiting times to be attended, threatening environment, uncomfortable facilities, exposure to areas contaminated with Ebola, lack of food and drink, limited or imprecise information, and little communication as to Negron's condition and further development.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fortunately, the CT scan results returned normal and Negron \"felt perfectly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20.) So, the Plaintiffs requested to return to the ship to resume their cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) The Defendant, apparently, decided against allowing Negron, an elderly passenger who had demonstrated an inability to withstand the physical rigor of a cruise, to continue for three more days on the high seas. As a result, the Plaintiffs were driven back to the port by taxi, at which point the Defendant's personnel prevented them from re-boarding and, instead, entered their cabins, packed and removed their belongings, and transported them to a hotel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-26.) This, allegedly, caused the Plaintiffs to become confused and anxious, while also leaving them stranded in Barbados until Gonzalez obtained a temporary passport, as he boarded the cruise with an expired passport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-35.) In addition, the Defendant's \"personnel w[ere] not careful when packing the Plaintiffs' luggage,\" causing the Plaintiffs' medication to become \"disorganized and lost throughout their belongings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because of this, the Plaintiffs were deprived of the cruise for which they paid; incurred unanticipated expenses, including the cost of a plane ticket for Gonzalez to Miami (not the port of embarkation); and faced \"annoy[ing]\" questions from U.S. Customs about Gonzalez's temporary passport, among other complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 41, 42.) The Plaintiffs specify their damages as \"severe psychological damages, emotional distress, much personal discomfort, uncertainty, fear and lack of safety,\" and \"undue expenses and costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.) For their troubles, the Plaintiffs request $ 900,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed suit on May 4, 2018, for intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. (ECF No. 1.) The Defendant moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which the Court granted, dismissing that claim with prejudice. (ECF No. 13, 19.) The Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint adding new claims for negligence (\"Count I\") and trespass (\"Count V\"). (ECF No. 29.) Now, the Defendant moves to dismiss those claims. (ECF No. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claims\" that \"will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the ground upon which it rests.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The Supreme Court has held that \"[w]hile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more\n   than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendant raises two arguments in the Motion: (1) that Count I is actually a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, and requires dismissal for failing to plausibly allege that the Plaintiffs were in the \"zone of danger\"; and (2) that the trespass claim should be dismissed because the Plaintiffs had no legal interest or ownership in their cruise cabin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In opposition, the Plaintiffs do not dispute the Defendant's characterization of Count I, and argue: (1) that the Amended Complaint contains sufficient allegations of physical impact to sustain a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress; (2) that, in the alternative, the Plaintiffs plausibly allege that they were placed in immediate risk of physical harm; and (3) that the Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a legally protected interest in their cabin and thus state a claim for trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties agree that this matter is governed by maritime law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaparro v.

The Plaintiffs Cannot Recover for Emotional Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To begin, the Court agrees with the Defendant that the Plaintiffs' negligence claim is, in fact, one for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Plaintiffs do not specify any physical harm for which they seek recovery under this claim. Rather, the Plaintiffs ask for \"severe emotional distress\" and \"mental anguish\" damages allegedly resulting from the negligent conduct of the Defendant. (ECF No. 29 at \u00b6 53.)

Finally, \"occupancy\" under that section means \"such acts done upon the land as manifest a claim of\n   <strong>\n    exclusive control\n   </strong>\n   of the land, and indicate to the public that he who has done them has appropriated it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694560\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/510/1063/#p1074\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Comment (a) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Restatement (2d) of Torts, Division One, Chapter Seven, Topic One, Scope Note (1965) (this chapter \"deal[s] with invasions of the interest in the\n   <strong>\n    exclusive\n   </strong>\n   possession and physical condition of land\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   So, to state a claim for trespass, the Plaintiffs must plausibly allege that they had the\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   control or possession of their cruise ship cabin. They have not, and cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Any possession the Plaintiffs had in the cruise cabin was not exclusive and, indeed, was expressly subordinate to that of the Defendant under the terms of the cruise ticket. To that end, the ticket, which the Plaintiffs attached to the Amended Complaint, provides that the Defendant may:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   search the stateroom, property or baggage of any Passenger, ... disembark or refuse to embark the Passenger, ... or restrain any Passenger at any time, without liability, at the risk and expense of the Passenger, when in the sole opinion of the Carrier or Captain the Passenger's conduct or presence\n   ... is believed to present a possible danger, security risk or be detrimental to himself or the health, welfare, comfort or enjoyment of others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (ECF No. 29-1 at \u00a7 8(e).) There are no factual allegations that the Defendant's cabin entry was done for a purpose other than terminating the Plaintiffs' trip in an effort to avoid a medical emergency on the high seas involving Negron, an elderly passenger who presented to ship doctors as physically unfit for an open ocean voyage. Indeed, no other inference may plausibly be drawn from the Amended Complaint. Thus, the Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, plausibly allege that their \"possession\" of the cabin was exclusive, and the Court\n   <strong>\n    dismisses\n   </strong>\n   Count V with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 30) and\n   <strong>\n    dismisses\n   </strong>\n   Count I and V of the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 29) with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Done and ordered\n   </strong>\n   at Miami, Florida, on December 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court accepts as true the facts pled in the Amended Complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beck v. Deloitte &amp; Touche\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1299624,1306652\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/732/\">\n     144 F.3d 732\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 735 (11th Cir. 1998) (\"In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, a court must accept the well pleaded facts as true and resolve them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
