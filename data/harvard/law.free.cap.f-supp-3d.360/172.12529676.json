(\"MECC\") and Lender Consulting Services, Inc. (\"LCS\"); and three insurance providers, Great Divide Insurance Company (\"Great Divide\"), Beazley USA Services, Inc. a/k/a Syndicate 2623/623 at Lloyd's (\"Beazley\"), and Crum &amp; Forster Specialty Insurance Company (\"Crum\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Environmental Site Assessment and Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 17, 2013, Plaintiff and MECC executed a Master Services Agreement for Environmental Consulting Services (the \"MMSA\") for MECC to \"provide environmental consulting services to BankUnited at certain designated sites to assist BankUnited in the underwriting of mortgage loans.\" (AC \u00b6 17.) The same day, Plaintiff and LCS entered into a Master Services Agreement for Environmental Consulting Services (the \"LMSA\") for LCS to also provide environmental consulting services to assist Plaintiff in underwriting mortgage loans. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2013, Mt. Kisco Associates LLC (the \"Borrower\") requested a loan from Plaintiff to refinance its mortgage on property located at 105 Kisco Avenue, Mount Kisco, New York 10549 (the \"Premises\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) On November 5, 2013, to assess whether it should underwrite the loan, Plaintiff issued MECC a work order pursuant to the MMSA, requesting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (\"ESA\") \"to assess the environmental risk of the Premises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) MECC's obligations to Plaintiff under the MMSA and work order included the duty to perform services \"in a manner consistent with that level of care and skill ordinarily exercised\n   by other professional consultants under similar circumstances at the time the Services are performed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A art. IV.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MECC conducted the ESA on November 18, 2013, and subsequently delivered a Phase I Report completed by MECC's President, Charles G. Merritt, and John Perotti. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 96). At the time the report was prepared, Merritt had nineteen years of industry experience and Perotti had over twenty years of experience performing environmental site assessments for lending institutions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97, 99.) Plaintiff alleges that, on information and belief, neither Merritt nor Perotti hold an engineering degree or are licensed engineers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The report stated that Perotti investigated \"the ground floor, second floor, utilities areas, warehouse, retail space, side paved parking lots, and all accessible exterior areas of the Premises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) The report concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on historical Sanborn fire insurance maps, the subject property has historically been occupied by a lumber mill, a garage, a painting shop, coal and wood sheds, an auto sales/service facility, and a woodworking facility.

Further evaluation is recommended to determine whether documentation regarding these tanks is available or if additional investigation (Phase II) is warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24 (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 4, 2014, pursuant to the LSMA, LCS reviewed the Phase 1 Report that MECC had prepared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) LCS found that MECC's Phase I Report met the applicable professional standards as set forth by the American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials (\"ASTM\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) Julie A. Daly, senior vice president at LCS, conducted the review and at the time had over ten years of relevant full-time experience. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) Plaintiff alleges that, on information and belief, Daly does not hold an engineering degree and is not a licensed engineer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff hired MECC to conduct the ESA and LCS to review the ESA as part of Plaintiff's due diligence to attain \"innocent landowner\" status under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , before obtaining a security interest in the Premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 89, 94.) To obtain innocent landowner status, Plaintiff was required to commission an environmental site assessment from an \"Environmental Professional\" as defined by CERCLA, and Plaintiff states MECC and LCS met that definition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Relying on MECC's Phase I Report and LCS's review, as well as a November 21, 2013 appraisal of the Premises by Cushman\n   &amp; Wakefield of Connecticut, Inc., which determined that the as-is market value of the Premises was $4,300,000, Plaintiff loaned $3,225,000 to the Borrower on March 20, 2014, with the Premises mortgaged as security for repayment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 93.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, however, the Premises had a history of nuclear and radiological contamination that was not included in the ESA or caught by LCS's review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    History of the Premises\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Historical records from 1942 show that the Canadian Radium and Uranium Corporation (\"Canrad\") operated a nuclear refinery that was partially located on the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) During and just prior to the United States's involvement in World War II, the United States delivered \"uranium sludge\" to Canrad, and Canrad extracted from the sludge numerous highly radioactive substances, including radium, radium-D, polonium, and actinium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-33). Canrad's \"hasty\" production process due to the wartime emergency led to radiological contamination throughout the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29,34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After World War II, Canrad ceased producing weaponized uranium, but still produced commercial quality radium and uranium in its refinery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Government inspections of the refinery found \"deplorable conditions\" and continuous overexposure to radiation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) In 1957, New York State brought charges against Canrad for exposing its employees to excess radiation, and Canrad pleaded guilty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) In 1958, Canrad was ordered by the New York State Department of Health to dispose of the radioactive waste at its refinery, and, despite Canrad's efforts to comply, it failed to decontaminate the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1966, the Mt. Kisco Urban Renewal Agency bought the Premises, as well as adjoining land, with the goal of decontaminating it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The attempts to decontaminate, however, resulted in further contamination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) From the 1970s onward, local, state, and federal agencies investigated, discovered, and reported on harmful contaminants existing at the Premises, including in a 1980 Westchester County report, a 1993 State Department of Health survey, a 1994 Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") investigation, and a 1998 State Department of Environmental Conservation report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-53.) Then, in 2013, the EPA again decided to investigate the Premises, conducting on-site reconnaissance and gamma radiation screening, and found radionuclide contamination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 22, 2015, the EPA and New York State agencies met with the Borrower to discuss the contamination of the premises, and the EPA stated its intention to order a cleanup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) In August 2015, the EPA commissioned Weston Solutions, Inc. (\"Weston\") to conduct a radiological survey (\"the 2015 EPA report\"), and Weston found above-background gamma readings, radioactive radium above EPA Site-Specific Action Levels (\"SSALs\"), and radon levels in excess of EPA SSALs inside and premises and in the soil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-59.) In April 2016, the EPA commissioned Weston to conduct a Phase II Removal Assessment Report, and the Report concluded there was gamma radiation more than triple background levels near a warehouse on the Premises and several \"hotspots\" more than double background levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.) Radioactive radium was also detected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Further, Weston took groundwater samples at the Premises and found alpha and beta particles, radium, bismuth, lead, and thallium, all exceeding EPA SSALs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    MECC's and LCS's Failure to Report on the Contamination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff hired MECC to perform the ESA \"for the purpose of uncovering '[the]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances ... on [the] property that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substance ... into structures on the property or into the ground, groundwater, or surface water of the property,' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68, Ex. C at 2) (alterations in original), but MECC failed to discover, disclose, or detect the radioactive contamination at the Premises, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69). MECC also failed to conduct the ESA in accordance with the applicable professional standards set forth in the ASTM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) For example, ATSM E 1527-05 requires, among other things, interviews with multiple individuals, including state and local officials, to determine past uses of the property and whether hazardous substances are within or likely to migrate onto the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) MECC failed to conduct such interviews, which resulted in a defective and misleading Phase I Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75.) As such, Plaintiff was not aware and could not have been aware of the radiological or nuclear contamination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    \u00b6 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) \"MECC's failure to conduct the ESA with the skill ordinarily exercised by professional environmental consultants at the time of the ESA resulted in an error-filled and materially misleading Phase I Report.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Similarly, LCS failed to review MECC's Phase I Report in accordance with ASTM standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) LCS's review did not mention MECC's failure to interview local and state officials or MECC's failure to follow up on the radiological risk posed by Canrad's adjacent site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Events After Plaintiff Learned of the Contamination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On November 16, 2015, the Borrower notified Plaintiff that the EPA was investigating the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) The Borrower also explained that it had filed an action on July 9, 2015, asserting multiple claims against multiple defendants, including MECC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see 105\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mt. Kisco Assocs. LLC v. Carozza\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-5346 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 3, 2016, the\n   <em>\n    Journal News\n   </em>\n   published an article titled, \"Atomic Legacy Fuels Lawsuit over Mount Kisco Property,\" detailing the Borrower's lawsuit. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 160, 162). This was, upon information and belief, the first article published in a periodical and made known to the general public directly linking the Premises to the Canrad refinery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162.) Several other news articles were subsequently published regarding the history of contamination on the Premises and the Borrower's lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163-164.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On or about September 9, 2016, the Borrower hired a consultant who estimated the cost of remediating the nuclear and radiological contamination on the Premises to range from $4 million to $30 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-154.) Additionally, the Borrower's tenant, NY Stone, discontinued its business following the 2015 EPA report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155.) Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that the Borrower's inability to derive income from its tenant due to the contamination on the Premises made it unable to perform under the terms of the loan, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156), and on or about December 10, 2016, the Borrower defaulted by failing to make payment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151). The Borrower is in default in the amount of $3,043,251.70. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because of the high cost of remediating the contamination on the Premises, Plaintiff realized that foreclosure was no longer a viable method of enforcing the note, so Plaintiff entered into a forbearance agreement with the Borrower on May 9, 2017, agreeing to accept payments of interest only while Plaintiff pursued its claims against the Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158.) Pursuant to the forbearance agreement, the Borrower paid Plaintiff $68,288.88 in arrearage at closing, and Plaintiff has forgone\n   approximately $38,700.00 in principal installment payments, as well as its rights to the accelerated sum of $3,043,251.70. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On October 18, 2017, Plaintiff commissioned another appraisal of the Premises by Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Connecticut, Inc., which, on October 24, 2017, stated that the Premises was worth nothing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 165-166.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    The Insurance Contracts and Insurers' Denial of Coverage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The MMSA and the LMSA both contained insurance clauses requiring MECC and LCS to insure and protect Plaintiff against the risk of loss caused by the services that Plaintiff hired MECC and LCS to perform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 137). Under the MMSA, MECC was required to maintain \"Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in a per occurrence basis in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 with an aggregate of $2,000,000 and $50,000 fire damage,\" and \"Professional Errors and Omissions coverage in a claims made basis for an amount of not less than $1,000,000 per claim with an aggregate of $1,000,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-110, Ex. A art. VI.) The MMSA also stated that, \"Except for the Errors and Omissions and workers compensation policies, BankUnited, N.A. shall be listed as an additional insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111, Ex. A art. VI.) The LMSA required LCS to procure the same insurance that the MMSA required MECC to procure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   From April 17, 2013, to April 17, 2014, MECC held a Commercial Lines Policy (\"Policy 7425\") from Defendant Great Divide, which included defense and indemnification coverage for property damage liability, contractors pollution liability, and professional liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) MECC renewed Policy 7425 through April 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Policy 7425 included an additional insured endorsement providing coverage for general liability and contractors pollution liability, and included \"any persons or organizations when [MECC] and such persons or organizations have agreed in a written contract or written agreement that such persons or organizations be added as an additional insured on your policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114, Ex. G at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Beginning April 17, 2016, and through the filing of the AC, MECC held an insurance policy from Defendant Beazley (\"Policy 0201\"), which included defense and indemnification coverage for property damage liability, contractors pollution liability, and professional liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) Policy 0201 had an additional insured endorsement that covered general liability and contractors pollution liability, and included \"the client for whom [MECC] performs or performed contracting services ... provided that a written contract or agreement is in effect between the [MECC] and the client requiring the client to be an additional insured under [MECC]'s general liability and/or contractors pollution liability policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118, Ex.

Further, from April 17, 2017, through the filing of the AC, MECC held an umbrella insurance policy with Beazley (\"Policy 0101\"), which included indemnification coverage for liability in excess of the aggregate limit of Policy 0201 and umbrella liability coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   From July 6, 2013, to July 6, 2014, LCS held an Environmental Package Policy (\"Policy 1563\") from Defendant Crum, which included defense and indemnification coverage for property damage liability, contractors pollution liability, and professional liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.) Policy 1563 included an additional insured endorsement that covered general liability and contractors pollution liability, and included those persons or organizations \"required by contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143, Ex.

Plaintiff's only support for its constructive fraud claim in its motion papers is the single conclusory sentence that \"MECC had a special relationship with BankUnited because MECC and its staff held themselves out as 'Certified Environmental Specialists.' \" (Opp. to MECC at 25.) First, Plaintiff has not cited authority for the proposition that a \"special relationship,\" as opposed to a fiduciary or confidential relationship, is sufficient to plead constructive fraud in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rescuecom Corp. v.

Second, even if a \"special relationship\" sufficed, Plaintiff cites no support for the notion that \"Certified Environmental Specialists\" are in a special relationship with their clients as to impose additional duties on them, and the Court could find no such support for such\n   an assertion. Moreover, Plaintiff did not plead any allegation of actual or constructive fraud against LCS, and did not argue that it did in its opposition to LCS's motion to dismiss. In any event, the only misrepresentations alleged are the failure to uncover the conditions that Plaintiff alleges MECC and LCS would have found had they performed up to professional standards.

The statute of limitations in\n   <em>\n    Kerbein\n   </em>\n   did not begin to run until the settlement agreement was finalized because prior to that, the plaintiff could have walked away from settlement and suffered no damages. Here, however, Plaintiff has alleged no facts to suggest that it could have walked away from the deal between the time that it closed on the mortgage loan and the time when it learned of the contamination. As in\n   <em>\n    Kerbein\n   </em>\n   , at the time of closing Plaintiff could have brought all of the claims against MECC and LCS that it brought in the instant action, because, as alleged by Plaintiff, MECC and LCS had already failed to perform under the contract, committed professional malpractice, and negligently omitted any reference to nuclear or radioactive materials on the premises in the ESA and ESA review. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 91.)

(Opp. to MECC at 17-18; Opp. to LCS at 18-19.) Both MECC and LCS argue that they did procure the requisite insurance and that they should not be held liable simply because the insurance companies refused to cover Plaintiff's claims.

Plaintiff argues that it \"bargained for insurance to cover precisely what occurred here,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , damages flowing from MECC's failure to perform,\" which left Plaintiff \"completely uninsured for the very loss it has sustained, namely the four to thirty million dollar remediation required on the Premises, rendering BankUnited's mortgage interest worthless.\" (Opp. to MECC at 19.)

In their motion papers, the Insurance Defendants and Plaintiff discuss the applicability of various exclusions and clauses, but they do not address whether Plaintiff's claims against the Insurance Defendants could survive if all of the claims against MECC and LCS were dismissed.

In some instances, plaintiffs may be foreclosed from bringing claims against environmental consultants who commit malpractice because the plaintiffs do not learn of the contamination until more than three years later. But this is not one of those instances. Plaintiff admits that it was advised of the contamination on November 16, 2015, (AC \u00b6 61), well within three years of closing on the mortgage (and even of delivery of the ESAs). Plaintiff had more than a year to bring a timely claim but failed to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
