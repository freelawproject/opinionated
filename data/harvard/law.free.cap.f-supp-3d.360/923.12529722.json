LANGE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In a complaint and motion papers filed January 22, 2019, Plaintiffs Yvonne Taylor and the South Dakota Municipal League (the League) claim that Defendant Steven Haugaard, the speaker of the South Dakota House of Representatives, violated their constitutional rights by banning Taylor-a long time lobbyist and executive director of the League-from the floor of the South Dakota House of Representatives (House Floor) because of an article she published in May 2018. Doc. 1. The Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction requiring Speaker Haugaard to allow Taylor on the House Floor during the hours it is open to the public. Doc. 3. Haugaard through the South Dakota Attorney General's office admitted service of the complaint and motion papers. Doc. 6. Because of the time-sensitive nature of the case, this Court coordinated with the parties' counsel to set a hearing on the motion for January 24, 2019. Shortly before the hearing was to occur, counsel advised that the case was getting settled, but nothing more has been filed since. Because Plaintiffs' filings meet the standard for issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), and present a case for entry of a preliminary injunction, this Court enters a TRO at this time to avert immediate and irreparable injury to Plaintiffs while settlement discussions occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Taylor is the executive director of the League, a non-profit organized to represent\n   South Dakota's incorporated municipalities. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 4 at \u00b6 1. She is also a long-time lobbyist, having been registered to lobby on the League's behalf since 1997. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 2. Taylor writes a column for the monthly newsletter the League sends to its members. Doc. 4 at \u00b6 6. In the May 2018 newsletter, she published a column urging readers to register to vote in the June 5, 2018 primary and again in the November election. Doc. 4-1. The column drew a distinction between legislators who were \"the Normal\"-described as \"willing to look at issues one by one, listen to facts, and make rational decisions\"-and \"the Wackies\"-described as \"opposed to government in general and all forms of taxation,\" believing \"state and local governments are ripping them off,\" and thinking \"facts they don't like are lies.\" Doc. 4-1. Taylor wrote about unopposed legislation that had died in the South Dakota House of Representatives because of the \"Wackies\" and how \"[w]e desperately need to get that 'wacky ratio' down [and get] good quality people to serve.\" Doc. 4-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to Taylor's affidavit, Speaker Haugaard on Monday, January 14, 2019, called Taylor into his office, asked her to close the door, and for the first time spoke with her about her May column. Doc. 4 at 2. As Taylor's affidavit tells it, Haugaard said that Taylor's column made the Legislature look like \"a bunch of buffoons\" and that, while Taylor was entitled to privately think those thoughts, she could not publish them. Doc. 4 at 2. Haugaard then asked Taylor not to be on the House Floor when open to the public until further notice. Doc. 4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 16, 2019, Taylor had a letter delivered to Speaker Haugaard on the League's stationary recounting their conversation and the directive that Taylor not be on the House Floor until further notice. Doc. 4-2. Taylor protested the directive, asserting that she found no authority by statute or otherwise to ban her from the House Floor and to disrupt her work as a lobbyist in that manner. Doc. 4-2. Taylor asked for Haugaard to provide in writing his authority for banning her by end of day or she would resume her duties including being on the House Floor when it is open to the public. Doc. 4-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Speaker Haugaard did not respond to Taylor's letter. Doc. 4-2. The next day, on January 17, 2019, Taylor sought to enter the House Floor when it was open to the public, but the assistant sergeant at arms intervened, saying that he had been instructed by the Speaker not to let her on the House Floor and handing her a section of Mason's Rules concerning \"Public Order\" in legislative bodies. Doc. 4 at 2; Doc. 4-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Most South Dakota legislators lack offices, so their desks on the floor of the senate or house is where legislators can be found and conduct meetings. Lobbyists, when the floor is open to the public, meet with legislators on the floor and circulate sign-up sheets to sponsor bills there. The deadline this year for getting bill draft requests with completed sign-up sheets to the Legislative Research Council (LRC) is Monday, January 28, 2019. Doc. 4 at 2. The legislative session in South Dakota is short, under 40 days in length. Doc. 4 at 2. Taylor's banishment from the House Floor impedes her ability to lobby for the League and for her other interest group, the South Dakota Police Chiefs' Association. Doc. 4 at 2; Doc. 4-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Nor was it a decision with prospective implications reaching beyond Taylor. Instead, the ban was an ad hoc decision that applied to and affected only Taylor. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the ban involved the \"integral steps in the legislative process.\" There is no indication that Haugaard was following South Dakota's legislative procedures when he banned Taylor, and the ban was not related to any legislation or legislative function.

As the Supreme Court of the United States long ago recognized, \"the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal amounts of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Elrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p373\">\n    427 U.S. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p373\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The harm suffered by Plaintiffs thus is irreparable and significant. Meanwhile, there appears to be little harm to Speaker Haugaard in allowing Taylor access to the House Floor alongside other lobbyists and the public, as she has done for decades as a lobbyist and executive director for the League. Haugaard appears to have no legitimate interest (if it was his intention to do so, which the Court does not know) to punish journalists or lobbyists for columns he deems to make legislators appear like buffoons. There appears to be little harm to Haugaard's legitimate interests to allow Taylor access like other lobbyists and the public have to the House Floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Probability of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor focuses on the probability that the movant will succeed on the merits. Haugaard's banning Taylor from the House Floor appears not to have been \"government action based on presumptively reasoned democratic processes.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v.

Taylor argues that the ban violates the First Amendment because it is a content-based restriction on free speech and because Haugaard imposed the ban to retaliate for Taylor writing the article. This Court focuses on the retaliation claim for purposes of the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The First Amendment generally bars government officials from retaliating against an individual for exercising her right to free speech.\n   <em>\n    Hartman v.

To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, Taylor must show: (1) that she engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment; (2) that Haugaard took adverse action against her that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing the activity; and (3) that the adverse action was motivated at least in part by Taylor's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Bennie v.

Here, Taylor wrote and published an article encouraging people to vote and criticizing some members of the South Dakota legislature. The First Amendment protects this activity, so it appears that Taylor can satisfy the first element of her retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The second element requires this Court to determine whether Speaker Haugaard banning Taylor from the House Floor would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in political speech. This element is objective: \"the question is not whether the plaintiff [herself] was deterred, though how plaintiff acted might be evidence of what a reasonable person would have done.\"\n   <em>\n    Scheffler v.

When applying the ordinary firmness test, courts should be \"mindful\" that the \"effect on freedom of speech may be small, but since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights it need not be great in order to be actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Taylor contends that access to the House Floor is an important part of her job; it allows her to speak with several legislators at once, circulate bill sponsor signup sheets, and advocate for or against legislation. Doc. 4 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-18. As Taylor tells it, Haugaard banning her from the House Floor prevents her from representing the League in an effective manner. Doc. 4 at \u00b6 11. An ordinary lobbyist would be deterred from engaging in protected conduct if, as a result, a public official significantly limited her ability to perform her job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dickinson Leisure Indus., Inc. v. City of Dickinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215944\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/835/#p847\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (S.D. Tex. 2004) (\"It seems obvious that if a municipality were to use its police power to purposefully undermine a citizen's livelihood, a citizen of ordinary firmness would think twice about exercising his or her right to oppose the municipality on a matter of public debate.\"). Taylor's affidavit and the attachments thereto suggest that Taylor has a fair chance of meeting the second element of the retaliation test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The third element requires Taylor to show a causal connection between the ban and the article. According to Taylor's affidavit, Haugaard called her into his office, told her that she could not publish the thoughts she expressed in the article, and directed her not to be on the House Floor when it was open to the public until further notice. Doc. 4 at \u00b6 8. The assistant sergeant of arms then denied Taylor access to the House Floor a few days later, explaining that Haugaard had instructed him to do so. Doc. 4 at \u00b6 10. There appears to be a fair probability that Taylor can show the requisite causal connection between the ban and her article. Because the record suggests that Taylor has a fair chance of prevailing on the merits of her First Amendment retaliation claim, the third\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factor appears to favor granting the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    d) Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The public interest favors access by the public to legislators, including access\n   to legislators by Taylor as executive director and lobbyist for the League and as lobbyist for the South Dakota Police Chiefs' Association. The public interest disfavors elected officials retaliating against journalists or columnists who write articles encouraging people to vote and criticizing closedminded legislators. This Court hopes that Haugaard was not doing that and had some other thought in mind. This Court of course does not know that Haugaard in fact retaliated against Taylor for the column she wrote, but Taylor's affidavit and attachments to that affidavit presents a prima facie case of this. The public interest appears to strongly favor injunctive relief here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ORDERED that a temporary restraining order enters under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2) enjoining Haugaard from debarring, banishing, or restricting access by Taylor to members of the South Dakota House of Representatives or the House Floor during those times when the House Floor is open to the public and/or lobbyists. It is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ORDERED that this temporary restraining order expires at the earliest of 14 days from its issuance or the issuance by this Court of an order dissolving or modifying the order under Rule 65(b)(4). It is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ORDERED that the parties promptly notify this Court if any settlement or resolution is reached, the terms of that resolution, and, if they so choose, the terms of any preliminary or permanent injunction to enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    This Court takes the facts from the complaint and Taylor's affidavit and is not making any findings of fact at this time. Indeed, this Court had expected to learn what, if any, facts are in dispute during the hearing it had scheduled for January 24 and conduct an evidentiary hearing on any disputed facts at that time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
