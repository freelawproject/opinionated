Mr. Beazer pled guilty to the offense pursuant to a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the Probation Office prior to sentencing found Mr. Beazer had three prior state convictions for either a violent felony or a serious drug offense, and therefore was an armed career criminal subject to a sentencing enhancement. In particular, the PSR listed the following convictions as predicate offenses for the purposes of the ACCA sentencing enhancement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) June 26, 2007 convictions in Norfolk Superior Court for Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon, Simple Assault and Battery, Carjacking, and Armed Robbery.

[PSR \u00b6 34]. The PSR also indicated that it considered another August 20, 2007 conviction for Assault with a Dangerous Weapon and a conviction for Simple Assault, part of the same incident and August 20, 2007 sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [PSR \u00b6 33]; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) A February 11, 2013 conviction in Fall River District court for Possession with Intent to Distribute a Class B and Class E substance. [PSR \u00b6 36].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Beazer did not object to his classification as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, but argued that I should lower his criminal history category as an exercise of my discretion because his prior crimes were the result of his mental health issues, and because the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by ACCA was disproportionate to the severity of his offense. I rejected that argument and, on February 13, 2014, sentenced Mr. Beazer to 188 months incarceration, with credit for time served, and 3 years of supervised release. The sentence was tailored to reflect his status as an armed career criminal, the seriousness of the underlying offense, and his circumstances with respect to mental health and substance abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If Mr. Beazer had not been classified as an armed career criminal, he would have been subject, at most, to ten years incarceration - the statutory maximum penalty for a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the absence of the ACCA sentencing enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Mr. Beazer concedes that this particular basis for relief does not flow from\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   , but instead presents it as an alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, I find both that this argument is barred and that, even if not barred, it fails on the merits. Mr. Beazer's February 11, 2013 conviction for Possession with Intent to Distribute Crack Cocaine was properly classified as a predicate offense under ACCA and his belated effort to assert this claim is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

What is more, while\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a new rule of constitutional law with retroactive effect,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1268\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , its holding did not implicate the definition of a \"serious drug offense\" under ACCA. It certainly did not recognize a right that is applicable to any drug offense claim. Consequently, the one-year limitations period for this claim did not reset on June 26, 2015, when\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   was announced; nor did it reset on April 18, 2016, when\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   was made retroactively applicable on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Beazer has made no contention here that he was somehow impeded from bringing this claim earlier by some action or omission on the part of the Government; nor does he allege any newly discovered facts that would affect his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I conclude Mr. Beazer's claim with respect to his drug conviction is therefore barred by the one-year limitations period established by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Procedural Default\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even if Mr. Beazer could be said to have filed his claim for relief with respect to the drug conviction within the one-year limitations period, I find his claim to be\n   procedurally defaulted. Mr. Beazer did not object, either in his sentencing memorandum, or during his sentencing, to his classification as an armed career criminal. Nor did he object to the classification of his February 11, 2013 drug conviction as a predicate offense under the ACCA. Though he had a right to appeal, he did not seek direct review of his sentence or of his classification as a career offender.

The charging document, for its part, simply alleges that Mr. Beazer \"did, by means of a dangerous weapon to wit: a replica handgun, assault and beat\" the victim.

As with the charging documents for the June 26, 2007 conviction, the charging documents for the August 20, 2007 conviction indicate only that Mr. Beazer was charged with, and ultimately pled guilty to, the general crime of ABDW.

Given the confusion that the developing case law in this area has generated and the ambiguity created by the aggregation of designated armed career criminal predicates in the PSR, I decline to treat the current argument by the government that the August 20, 2007 ADW conviction is a valid predicate as subject to a waiver or forfeiture.
