BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action involves the Aikmans' claims for breach of contract and negligence against their title insurer, Commonwealth, stemming from a civil action in state court in which the Aikmans' neighbors sued them for recognition of, and interference with, a servitude. The pertinent facts concerning the land at issue in that case and here have been recited by the Louisiana court of appeal for the first circuit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   This litigation involves several parcels of contiguous property located in Tangipahoa Parish, more particularly depicted in the appendix hereto.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   Plaintiffs Jerelean Arnold Naramore, Tammie Naramore Steib, and Craig Steib collectively own the 9.46-acre parcel identified on the appendix by Naramore's name.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   The adjacent 9.52-acre parcel to the east is owned by plaintiffs Carol Arnold Martinson and David Henry Martinson. Defendants Baynum and Kayla Aikman own a 1.767 [acre] parcel adjacent to the southwest side of the Naramore parcel. An asphalt road, West Sam Arnold Loop, is adjacent to the west side of the Aikman parcel. A gravel road extends from West Sam Arnold Loop through the southern boundary of the Aikman and Naramore parcels. The gravel road is located within an alleged servitude shown on the Bodin survey as the long rectangular area along the southern boundaries of the Aikman and Naramore parcels, and extending across the Martinson parcel into a tract owned by Ottis S. Arnold. The use of the gravel road, and more specifically the existence of the alleged servitude, is the origin of the dispute between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All of the above property (collectively the \"Arnold property\") was previously owned by Sam and Vivian Arnold, who acquired it in 1956. Although unclear when the gravel road was built, Sam and Vivian, along with their tenants, began using the road as early as 1960 to access the Arnold's home. The road was also used by the Worley family, the owners of property on the south side of the road, to access their property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In the early 1980s, Sam and Vivian began transferring the property to their descendants. They first transferred the Martinson parcel to their daughter, Carol Martinson, on March 25, 1980. The act of sale describes the Martinson parcel, along with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [A] servitude 0.45 chains in width in an East-West direction connecting the existing Public Road with servitude on property of Ottis Samuel Arnold in favor of Grace Louise Arnold Mapes, Ottis Samuel Arnold and Jerelean Avis Arnold Naramore as per plat and survey of Leey Mapes of record in COB ___, page ___, dated [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The referenced Mapes survey is dated March 20, 1979, and shows a servitude that is approximately the same in size and location as shown on the Bodin survey. The act of sale was recorded in the public records shortly after its execution, but the Mapes survey was not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 28, 1982, Sam and Vivian conveyed to Jeffrey and Cynthia Arnold the 1.75 acres ultimately acquired by the Aikmans on August 13, 1993. The 1982 and 1993 conveyances do not mention the disputed servitude. On October 27, 1983, Sam and Vivian transferred the 9.46-acre parcel to Jerelean Naramore. That act of sale does not mention the servitude, but references the Mapes survey. Naramore transferred approximately four acres to her daughter, Tammie Steib, on May 29, 2008. That conveyance contained a survey identifying the gravel road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties used the gravel road without any significant incidents until late 2010 or early 2011, when log trucks and other heavy equipment used the road in connection with timber operations on the Martinson parcel. Baynum objected and blocked further vehicular traffic beyond his driveway by parking a tractor on the road and pulling a large log across it. He later installed and locked a gate at the entrance to the road near West Sam Arnold Loop. Although he gave a key to some members of the Arnold family, confrontations continued. When efforts to amicably resolve the dispute failed, suit was filed on October 20, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   The appendix is an excerpt from a survey prepared by William J. Bodin Jr., dated August 17, 2011, introduced in evidence at trial. The survey presents the properties in a west (left side of page) to east manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   Naramore's name is incorrectly spelled \"Naramone\" on the survey.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Naramore v.

App. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to their neighbors suing them in state court, the Aikmans filed a claim with Commonwealth concerning the alleged servitude.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 19, 2011, Ryan S. Galer (\"Galer\"), Commonwealth's claims counsel, wrote to the Aikmans explaining why Commonwealth denied their claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Galer writes that the facts of the claim are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 13, 1993 Jeffrey Travis Arnold and Cynthia Hutcheson Arnold conveyed ... the [Property] to [the Aikmans]. [The Aikmans] refinanced the Property on December 20, 2004 and purchased owner's policy of title insurance ... underwritten by [Commonwealth]. There is a gravel road (the \"Alleged Right-of-Way\") across the most southern portion of the Property. [The Aikmans'] neighbors, the Martinson[s], use the Alleged Right-of-Way to access their property. Prior to January 11, 2011, [the Aikmans] posted a sign along the Alleged Right-of-Way that states \"do not enter private drive\" and informed a relative of [their] neighbors that the Martinson[s] had no business using the Alleged Right-of-Way.... [The Aikmans] contacted the Law Offices of Gary M. Peltier on January 13, 2011 and asked Mr. Peltier whether [their] neighbor has a valid right-of-way across the Property. Mr. Peltier sent [the Aikmans] a letter dated January 18, 2011 advising [them] that ... he could not find a recorded right-of-way and encouraged [the Aikmans] to submit a claim with [Commonwealth]. [The Aikmans] submitted [their] notice of claim to [Commonwealth] in a letter received by [Commonwealth] on February 3, 2011. [Commonwealth's] claims center opened [the Aikmans'] claim for investigation and administration on February 11, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Commonwealth] contacted [the Aikmans] on March 10, 2011 to discuss [their] claim. In that telephone conversation, [the Aikmans] state that the Martinson[s] are claiming a right-of-way across the Alleged Right-of-Way. [The Aikmans] told [Galer] that the Martinson[s] claim that there is a map dating back to 1950 which shows the right-of-way. [The Aikmans] contacted the Tangipahoa Parish courthouse and the Parish engineering department. Neither the courthouse nor the engineering department were able to find a right-of-way benefitting the Martinson[s'] property. [The Aikmans] also stated that the Martinson[s] are claiming a right-of-way across the Property from a right-of-way obtained in 2006. [Commonwealth] ordered a title examination of the Property dating back to 1945. The title search does not show any easements or rights-of-way across the Property except for an easement benefitting the Consolidated Gravity Drainage District # 1 of Tangipahoa Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Galer then described the coverage afforded by the policy and explained that the Martinsons' claim to use the right-of-way did not invoke any of the policy's covered risks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Galer explained that the claim fell within several of the policy's\n   exclusions and exceptions from coverage, including an exception in paragraph three (3) of Schedule B for \"[e]asements, or claims of easements, not shown by the public records.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Galer explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Commonwealth's] title search does not show any easement of public record benefitting the Martinson[s'] property. Therefore, even if the Martinson[s] do have an unrecorded valid easement or claim of easement across the Property and one of the Covered Risks were invoked, your claim is excepted from coverage pursuant to paragraph three (3) of the Schedule B Exceptions from Coverage because the Martinson[s'] claim of an easement is not shown in the public records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, Galer explained that the Martinsons' claim to the right-of-way allegedly arising from a 2006 document signed by the Tangipahoa Parish Engineer that shows a public gravel road is excluded from coverage because it was created after the policy was issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 20, 2011, the Aikmans' neighbors sued them in the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa, State of Louisiana (the \"servitude litigation\"), seeking a declaratory judgment establishing the location of the servitude, an injunction prohibiting the Aikmans' from interfering with the use of the servitude, and damages, including attorney's fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state-court plaintiffs contend that Sam and Vivian Arnold established the servitude to connect their properties to the public road, and that it has been in continuous use since before Sam and Vivian Arnold began transferring portions of the property to their family members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the state-court plaintiffs allege that the October 27, 1983 act of conveyance from Sam and Vivian Arnold to Jerelean Arnold Naramore \"provided for a servitude of access to [Naramore's] property,\" and that the servitude was \"referred to in a survey plat provided by Leey Mapes dated March 20, 1979,\" and recorded in the Tangipahoa Parish public records in the chain of title related to Naramore's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also allege that Naramore provided for a servitude of access to the tract of land she donated to her daughter Tammie Naramore Steib (\"Steib\"), and that it was recorded in the Tangipahoa Parish public records in the chain of title related to Steib's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the state-court plaintiffs allege that the March 28, 1980 act of conveyance from Sam and Vivian Arnold to Carol Arnold Martinson (\"Martinson\") \"provided for a servitude of access to [Carol Ann Martinson's] property,\" and that the servitude was \"referred to in a survey plat provided by Leey Mapes dated March 20, 1979,\" and recorded in the Tangipahoa Parish public records in the chain of title related to Martinson's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 30, 2012, after holding an evidentiary hearing, the state trial court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Aikmans from interfering with the state-court plaintiffs' use of the alleged servitude.\n   <em>\n    Naramore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12678008\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/252/935/#p937\">\n    252 So.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
