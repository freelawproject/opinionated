(Dkt. No. 49.) Plaintiff filed an opposition on November 16, 2018. (Dkt. No. 52.) Defendant replied on December 7, 2018. (Dkt. No. 53.) Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the Court finds the matter suitable for adjudication without oral argument. Based on the reasoning below, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2018, Plaintiff San Diego County Credit Union (\"SDCCU\") filed a complaint against Defendant Citizens Equity First Credit Union (\"CEFCU\") alleging the following causes of action: 1) declaratory judgment of non-infringement of federally registered trademark for \"CEFCU. NOT A BANK. BETTER.\"; 2) declaratory judgment of non-infringement of common law mark \"NOT A BANK. BETTER.\"; 3) declaratory judgment for invalidity of federally registered trademark for \"CEFCU.

(Dkt. Nos. 29, 39.) On October 2, 2018, the Court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) on the first four causes of action for declaratory judgment, and granted Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) on the fifth and sixth causes of action with leave to amend. (Dkt. Nos. 40, 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, (\"FAC\") alleging the same six causes of action with additional factual allegations. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC.) On October 26, 2018, Defendant filed the instant fully briefed motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the first four causes of action for declaratory relief as well as discretionary dismissal under Rule 57, and failure to state a claim on the fifth and sixth causes of action under the Lanham Act. (Dkt. Nos. 49, 52, 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SDCCU owns over 40 federally registered trademarks in connection with its credit union services, including U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C560%2C596\">\n    Registration No. 4,560,596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"IT'S NOT BIG BANK BANKING. IT'S BETTER\" (the \"SDCCU Mark\") which issued on July 1, 2014. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 25; Dkt. No. 48-2, FAC, Ex. A.) CEFCU owns U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C952%2C993\">\n    Registration No. 3,952,993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"CEFCU. NOT A BANK. BETTER\" (the \"CEFCU Mark\") which issued on May 3, 2011. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 33; Dkt. No. 48-3, FAC, Ex. B.) CEFCU also allegedly uses the common law mark \"NOT A BANK. BETTER\". (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 14.) Prior to filing the trademark application for the CEFCU Mark, CEFCU conducted a trademark search report and, on information and belief, learned that several third-party credit unions already used trademarks similar to the CEFCU Mark such as \"NOT A BANK - BETTER!\", \"BETTER THAN A BANK\", and \"IT'S NOT A BANK\" (\"Third Party Marks\"). (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SDCCU and CEFCU are both large credit unions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) SDCCU's customers are primarily located in Southern California while CEFCU's customers are primarily located in Peoria, Illinois and Northern California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the end of 2008, CEFCU purchased Valley Credit Union in Northern California but did not direct its marketing bearing the CEFCU Mark or CEFCU's Common Law Mark in connection with credit union services outside the Illinois market until June 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) In June 2011, CEFCU started using the CEFCU Mark in connection with marketing campaigns in the Illinois and California markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early 2016, a CEFCU employee saw a billboard in San Diego, CA containing the SDCCU Mark used to market credit union services and notified CEFCU managers in March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) On May 17, 2017, CEFCU filed a petition for cancellation\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the '596 Trademark Registration No. for the SDCCU Mark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (\"USPTO\") Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\"TTAB\") claiming the SDCCU Mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive consumers when viewing CEFCU's Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 40; Dkt. No. 48-5, FAC, Ex. D.) On March 23, 2018, CEFCU filed a motion for leave to amend its cancellation petition to add its alleged common law mark of \"NOT A\n   BANK. BETTER\" (\"CEFCU Common Law Mark\") against SDCCU. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FAC alleges that the CEFCU Mark is, in fact, more similar to each of the Third Party Marks than it is to the SDCCU Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Therefore, if CEFCU believes that the scope of protection for its mark is broad enough to encompass the SDCCU Mark, CEFCU materially misrepresented to the USPTO that the CEFCU Mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the other hand, if CEFCU believes that its mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party Marks, the CEFCU Mark cannot be broad enough to encompass the SDCCU Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In either case, CEFCU's cancellation action and threat of lawsuit are objectively baseless and brought with the subjective intent to harm SDCCU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SDCCU asserts it has a reasonable apprehension that CEFCU will file a lawsuit against it alleging trademark infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the amended complaint, Plaintiff adds an allegation that CEFCU uses its Marks with the \"circle-R\" designation to convey to the public and consumers that the CEFCU Mark and CEFCU Common Law Mark are lawfully registered trademarks with the USPTO, even though the CEFCU Mark was falsely and/or fraudulently registered, and the Common Law Mark is not registered with the USPTO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 67, 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss the first four causes of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction arguing Plaintiff has not asserted a justiciable claim for alleged infringement under the Declaratory Judgment Act (\"DJA\") and discretionary dismissal under Rule 57. (Dkt. No. 40.) Defendant additionally moves to dismiss the fifth and sixth causes of action for failure to state a claim based on the new allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Dismiss DJA Causes of Action for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its motion, Defendant seeks dismissal of the first four causes of action for declaratory relief for lack of an actual controversy because the FAC allegations are \"fundamentally inconsistent with its prayers for declaratory relief.\" (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 17.) Specifically, Defendant claims that SDCCU, in its prior briefing, persuaded the Court that CEFCU had damaged SDCCU's business by \"stifling SDCCU's ability to freely use and/or expand its use of the SDCCU Mark\" but now alleges, in the FAC, that \"in response to CEFCU's use and registration of the CEFCU Mark, SDCCU increased its use of the SDCCU Mark on corresponding marketing materials and relating advertising spend (sic).\" (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 107.) Therefore, the new allegation that SDCCU increased its use of the SDCCU mark is inconsistent with it being in real and reasonable apprehension of suit for infringement. Defendant further argues that the Court should use its discretion under Rule 57\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by considering the\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors and grant dismissal of the DJA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that the allegations concerning declaratory relief claims have not been amended, (Dkt. No. 52 at 8), and the law of the case doctrine precludes CEFCU from re-litigating the declaratory relief claims. Moreover, SDCCU argues that its continued use of the SDCCU Mark provides more support for its real and reasonable apprehension of being sued for infringement and not less, citing\n   <em>\n    Societe de Conditionnement en Aluminium v. Hunter Eng'g Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1262127\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/655/938/#p944\">\n    655 F.2d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 944 (9th Cir. 1981) (showing of apprehension \"need not be substantial\" if an allegedly infringing mark is in use). Next, it claims its arguments are not inconsistent, that is, while SDCCU has developed a real and reasonable apprehension of being sued, it also disagrees with the allegations in the petition for cancellation and further asserts that CEFCU's trademarks are invalid and not-infringed. Third, SDCCU's allegations clarify that CEFCU's fraudulent registration of the CEFCU Mark caused damage to SDCCU by stifling SDCCU's business because it was forced to expend resources to address CEFCU's use of its fraudulently registered mark in the California market instead of using those resources in the regular course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The law-of-the-case doctrine generally provides that 'when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Askins v.

But a court may exercise its discretion and decline to apply the law of the case if \"1) the first decision was clearly erroneous; 2) an intervening change in the law has occurred; 3) the evidence on remand is substantially different; 4) other changed circumstances exist; or 5) a manifest injustice would otherwise result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601425\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/709/#p716\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But when a plaintiff has filed an amended complaint, the law of the case doctrine does not apply because the amended complaint is a new complaint which may include additional facts and claims that are different from the original complaint requiring a new determination by the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1043. If \"the district court determines the amended complaint is substantially the same as the initial complaint, the district court is free to follow the same reasoning ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Askins\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred by dismissing the first amended complaint based on the law of the case doctrine without addressing the merits of the government's motion to dismiss because the amended complaint included facts and claims that were different from the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1043 (\"The amended complaint is a new complaint, entitling the plaintiff to judgment on the complaint's own merits; we do not ask whether the plaintiff is 'precluded' or 'barred' by the prior ruling.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, because Plaintiff filed a FAC, the law of the case doctrine does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiff argues and the Court notes that the DJA allegations in the FAC and the initial Complaint are the same. In its prior order, the Court conducted a careful and detailed analysis on whether it had subject matter jurisdiction following the Ninth Circuit's \"flexible approach\" in determining whether there is an actual case or controversy by assessing whether the plaintiff had reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit,\n   <em>\n    Rhoades v. Avon Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2948648\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/1151/#p1157\">\n    504 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2007), and then whether the court should exercise its jurisdiction by considering the\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors which balance \"concerns of judicial administration, comity, and fairness to the litigants.\" (Dkt. No. 47 at 5-14 quoting\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain v. Allstate Ins., Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801707\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1361/#p1367\">\n    931 F.2d 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367 (9th Cir. 1991) ). The Court concluded that Plaintiff had demonstrated it had a real and reasonable apprehension that it would be subject to an infringement suit and the Court exercised its jurisdiction over the DJA claims after considering the\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors. (Dkt. No. 47 at 13-14.) Because the factual allegations in the FAC are the same as the initial complaint, the Court relies on its reasoning in the prior order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court notes that Defendant raises a single new argument that challenges one new fact alleged in the FAC concerning the \u00a7 1120 cause of action to be inconsistent with the DJA analysis contending that the allegation is \"fundamentally inconsistent with its prayers for declaratory relief.\" (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 17.) Specifically, Defendant claims that SDCCU, in its prior briefing, persuaded the Court that CEFCU had damaged SDCCU's business by \"stifling SDCCU's ability to freely use and/or expand its use of the SDCCU Mark\" but now alleges, in the FAC, that \"in response to CEFCU's use and registration of the CEFCU Mark, SDCCU increased its use of the SDCCU Mark on corresponding marketing materials and relating advertising spend (sic).\" (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 107.) Therefore, the new allegation that SDCCU increased its use of the SDCCU mark is inconsistent with it being in real and reasonable apprehension of suit for infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the alleged \"prayers for declaratory relief\" in paragraph 107 relates to the harm SDCCU incurred based on the cause of action for false or fraudulent trademark registration under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201120\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , not DJA claims. To the extent it relates to the DJA claims, Plaintiff has not demonstrated, by legal authority that the \"prayers for declaratory relief\" are considered in addressing whether SDCCU had a real and reasonable apprehension that it would be subject to a suit for infringement for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, Ninth Circuit law requires that the Court look at whether \"the plaintiff has a real and reasonable apprehension that he will be subject to liability if he continues to manufacture his product.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhoades v. Avon Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2948648\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/1151/#p1157\">\n    504 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (9th Cir. 2007). In its ruling, the Court focused on the allegations in the petition for cancellation, the amended petition for cancellation and the initial disclosures and determined they alleged the elements for a cause of action for trademark infringement. (Dkt. No. 47 at 13.) CEFCU has failed to demonstrate a nexus or relationship between SDCCU's increased use of its Mark and SDCCU's real and reasonable apprehension of suit for infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, Defendant argues that under Rule 57, the\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors are to be considered by the Court to address whether a special statutory proceeding requires dismissal of this DJA case, and based on the pending petition for cancellation proceeding, the Court should dismiss these claims. However, the Court already addressed the\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors in its prior order concluding that this declaratory action is preferable over the TTAB action in addressing all issues between the parties and the Court exercised its jurisdiction over the case. (Dkt. No. 47 at 14.) Defendant has not presented any reasons for the Court to alter its prior ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, because the facts on the first four causes of action for declaratory judgment have not been amended, the Court relies on its prior analysis and ruling and DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the first four causes of action under the DJA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Askins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518027\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1035/#p1042\">\n    899 F.3d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Second, SDCCU lacks standing to assert purported third-party rights against the '993 Registration and does not even allege any invasion of such rights.

Yoder, with the USPTO during the registration of the CEFCU Mark, asserting that the CEFCU Mark was \"used in commerce\" or \"interstate commerce\" as of February 5, 2007 with the intent to deceive the USPTO in order to advance CEFCU's Mark registration. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 37, 100.) But prior to June 2011, CEFCU did not direct its advertising using its Mark outside of the Illinois market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that CEFCU falsely stated that its Mark would not likely cause consumer confusion with respect to pre-existing\n   marks of which it was aware including Third Party Marks such as the \"IT'S NOT A BANK\" mark of Warren Federal Credit Union, \"BETTER THAN A BANK\" mark of ABNB Federal Credit Union and \"NOT A BANK-BETTER!\" mark of United 1st Federal Credit Union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 101.) The false assertion was made with the intent to deceive the USPTO so that its Mark would advance to registration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) CEFCU's Mark would have not advanced to registration if CEFCU had not declared that the CEFCU Mark would not likely cause consumer confusion concerning pre-existing marks for credit union services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On information and belief, the false statements in the declaration filed with the USPTO were willful and meant to deceive and constitute fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) The FAC also added an allegation that CEFCU uses the CEFCU Mark with a \"circle-R\" designation stating to consumers that the CEFCU Mark is a registered trademark even though it was fraudulently and/or falsely registered. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant first argues that Plaintiff's allegation concerning CEFCU's \"use in commerce\" is a \"term of art\" as defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires that the mark is used in association with\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   that are \"rendered in commerce\" and SDCCU fails to allege that CEFCU services identified by the CEFCU Mark were not \"rendered in commerce\" as of February 5, 2007. Moreover, SDCCU's allegation that CEFCU did not direct its advertising using the CEFCU Mark outside the Illinois market prior to June 2011 does not support the conclusion that the CEFCU Mark was not in \"use in commerce\" prior to 2011. Simply put, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to allege facts which support its theory that CEFCU's claimed first \"use in commerce\" date was false. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the facts alleged in the FAC, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a false statement in the '993 Registration Application claiming that CEFCU was using its Mark in commerce as of February 5, 2007, when in fact it was not until June 2011 that CEFCU directed its advertising outside the Illinois market. Whether CEFCU in fact was using its Mark in commerce as of February 5, 2007, based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is a question of fact not proper on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, to the extent Defendant's argument is addressing the merits of Plaintiff's claim, they are improper on a motion to dismiss. On this argument, Defendant seeks judicial notice that CEFCU is a federal regulated credit union and its deposits are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 12.) On a motion to dismiss, the Court only considers the allegations in the FAC and \"accepts as true all facts alleged in the complaint, and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056441\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/949/#p956\">\n    580 F.3d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956 (9th Cir. 2009). The Court denies CEFCU's request for judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, Defendant challenges Plaintiff's allegations that CEFCU falsely stated that its Mark would not likely cause consumer confusion with respect to pre-existing marks of which it was aware when CEFCU applied for the Mark. According to CEFCU, SDCCU cannot rely on the\n   existence of \"third party marks\" to attack the validity of the CEFCU '993 Registration where there are no allegations that any of the third-party users had any grounds for objecting to the '993 Registration in 2010. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 13.) Further, Defendant argues that as a matter of law, a third party's prior use of a trademark is not a defense in an infringement action. Plaintiff counters that it is not asserting the third party's prior marks as a defense to an infringement claim but relying on these facts to support the claim that CEFCU fraudulently obtained its registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At this stage on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201120\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff relies on the existence of Third Party Marks similar to CEFCU's prior to the '993 Registration as factual support for an allegation that Defendant made a false statement on its trademark registration application. Plaintiff is not asserting purported third-party rights against the '993 Registration. Thus, allegations concerning the existence of third party marks do not warrant dismissal of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, Defendant argues that the \"new\" alleged damages are not a \"proximate\" result of the challenged '993 Registration because of the six year gap in time between the '993 Registration which issued on May 3, 2011 and allegations of injury that began around May 17, 2017, when SDCCU became aware of the CEFCU Mark when the petition for cancellation was filed. Moreover, it argues that CEFCU's first use of its Mark antedates the first use date claimed in SDCCU's '596 Registration so that it had a right to seek cancellation of the '596 Registration irrespective of the '993 Registration. Plaintiff argues it seeks damages based on SDCCU's marketing expenses and diverted employee time which are directly related to \"counteracting the effect of CEFCU's fraudulent use and registration of the CEFCU Mark\" and courts have held that a lapse in time between the registration issuance and the alleged injury does not bar damages. (Dkt. No. 52 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The FAC alleges that CEFCU's fraudulent conduct in obtaining a false registration has damaged SDCCU's business. (Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-107.) \"[I]n response to CEFCU's use and registration of the CEFCU Mark, SDCCU has conducted, in whole or in part, many marketing meetings among SDCCU's executives ... as well as other marketing employees, for the purpose of discussing strategies for countering CEFCU's use and registration of the CEFCU Mark. These meetings consumed employee time that otherwise would have been spent on other matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Moreover, SDCCU has increased its use of its Mark on marketing materials and related marketing spending and incurred expenses that it would not have otherwise incurred but for CEFCU's false and/or fraudulent registration of the CEFCU Mark.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, a gap between an alleged fraudulent registration of a mark and claimed injuries are not automatically barred but a plaintiff must demonstrate the harm is proximately caused by the fraudulent registration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MIH Allegro BV v.

In\n   <em>\n    Maker's Mark Distillery, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a case cited by Plaintiff and similar to the facts in this case, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the counterclaim under \u00a7 1120 based on the impossibility that the fraudulent registration that occurred nineteen years ago proximately caused the defendant injuries.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204292392\">\n    2007 WL 4292392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1.

(Dkt. No. 48, FAC \u00b6 120.) However, the Court already ruled and Plaintiff recognizes that attorney's fees and costs are not recoverable as damages under \u00a7 120 and does not oppose Defendant's motion on these damages sought.
