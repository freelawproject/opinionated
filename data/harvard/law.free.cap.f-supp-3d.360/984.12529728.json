To start, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have made a credible assertion of possible harm that could result from a stay. Even if EPA exercises complete diligence in passing the proposed regulation, that diligence does not eliminate the ordinary uncertainty in the rulemaking process, which creates at least a \"fair possibility\" of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p254\">\n    299 U.S. at 254-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p254\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
