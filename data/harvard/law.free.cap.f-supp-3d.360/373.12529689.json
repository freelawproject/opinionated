Defendant JKM Technologies, LLC d/b/a OESH Shoes (\"JKM\") manufacturers and markets a competing ballet flat shoe named the Dream Flat. Rothy's filed suit, alleging patent infringement and Lanham Act violations against defendants JKM and Dr. Casey Kerrigan (collectively, \"Defendants\"), based on perceived similarities between The Flat and the Dream Flat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(B)(6) (the \"Motion\"), ECF No. 19. Defendants ask the court to dismiss Kerrigan\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , and dismiss the Lanham Act claims from Rothy's Complaint (the \"Complaint\" or \"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1.

The Flat is \"designed and seamlessly manufactured from recycled bottles using a proprietary 3D knitting process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. This combination of features constitutes the trade dress of The Flat.

Defendants began reviewing, researching, and copying The Flat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Around June 2018, Defendants began marketing a competing flat called the Dream Flat (\"The Dream Flat\"). The \"shape, design and look [of The\n   Dream Flat] ... is virtually identical to Rothy's The Flat product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

But other courts in this Circuit have found that similar allegations are sufficient at the pleadings stage to deny dismissal.

Rothy's allegations regarding functionality are sufficient survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that \"[t]he functional purpose or practical benefit of a ballet flat is to give the wearer a slim fit shoe for ample flexibility.\" MTD Br. 13. Defendants complain that Rothy's \"description of 'The Flat's' trade dress seemingly ignores that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   ballet shoe shares these\n   <em>\n    exact same\n   </em>\n   qualities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (contending that The Flat is \"a plain, generic ballet flat marketed under the unremarkable name, \"The Flat\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (arguing that alleged trade dress \"articulates nothing as a trade dress other than features of a typical ballet flat shoe\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (claiming that Rothy's \"alleged trade dress is essentially the 'common basic shape or design' of a ballet flat\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (contending that \"there can be no likelihood of confusion between [The Flat and the Dream Flat] from a trade dress perspective because both shoes are common ballet flats, just like hundreds of other ballet flats on the market\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (arguing that The Flat \"happens to be a ballet flat shoe that is and has been so common in the industry as to be practically omnipresent on women's feet\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again appealing to\n   <em>\n    Landscape Forms\n   </em>\n   , Defendants argue that \"granting trade dress protection to an ordinary product design would create a monopoly in the goods themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Landscape Forms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336426\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/113/373/\">\n    113 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   380 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In essence, Defendants ask us to delve into what is a ballet flat shoe on a motion to dismiss. While Defendants may ultimately be successful on this argument on summary judgment, the court is examining the sufficiency of the complaint and the incorporated documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.I. du Pont de Nemours\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196761\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/435/#p448\">\n    637 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, on a 12(b)(6) motion, \"a court evaluates the complaint in its entirety, as well as documents attached or incorporated into the complaint,\" but \"the district court cannot go beyond these documents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court declines to accept Defendant's suggestion and inject extraneous materials into a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Upon review of the complaint and attached documents, the court has no way to discern whether\n   The Flat is \"just like hundreds of other ballet flats on the market,\" MTD Br. 20, or that the Flat \"happens to be a ballet flat shoe that is and has been so common in the industry as to be practically omnipresent on women's feet,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. While it may ultimately be true that Rothy's description of The Flat's trade dress describes most every ballet flat shoe, that purported fact is not apparent from the face of the Complaint or the attached articles. Accordingly, Defendants' second argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that \"the articles cited by [Rothy's] in its Complaint are fatal to the trade dress claim because they demonstrate that 'The Flat' is functional in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. To be sure, one of the articles discusses the functionality of The Flat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Connie Chen,\n   <em>\n    Women in New York City and San Francisco Are Obsessed with These Comfortable Flats Made from Recycled Water Bottles-Here's What They Feel Like\n   </em>\n   , Business Insider (November 1, 2018) (\"Because of how they're made, Rothy's shoes have a distinctive feel and functional advantages that other flats don't.\")\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://amp.businessinsider.com/rothys-comfortable-work-flat-review-2018-6.

In its Opposition, Rothy's suggests that the trade dress of The Flat is the shoe as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Opp. 11 (\"In this case, the correct trade dress inquiry requires an analysis of the overall commercial impression of the design of The Flat as a whole.\"). The Business Insider article does mention a functional advantage of a seamless 3D knitted upper, but the alleged trade dress is more than just the 3D knitted upper. The other aspects of the trade dress are not discussed vis-a-vis functionality. In other words, while these articles provide insight into the functionality calculus, they are not, in and of themselves, determinative of this issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Fourth, Defendants argue that Rothy's own allegations show that the trade dress is functional. Defendants take issue with allegations in the Complaint that The Flat was designed \"as being sustainable, having a comfortable fit, and being lightweight.\" MTD Br. 15 (internal quotations omitted) (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11). To be sure, Paragraphs 9 and 11 of the Complaint do appear to attribute some functionality to The Flat. But it is not clear from the allegations if the functional aspects described in Paragraph 9 and 11 are part and parcel of the shoe itself, or certain elements of the shoe. If it is the former, then the trade dress would likely be functional. But if only certain elements of the shoe are functional, this does not preclude a jury from finding that, taken as a whole, The Flat is nonfunctional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tools USA &amp; Equip.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/654/#p658\">\n    87 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Looking, as we must, at the overall trade dress rather than at individual features, we cannot say that a reasonable jury could only have concluded that the trade dress was functional.\"). Because the court cannot resolve that question on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must reject Defendants' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Nonetheless, Rothy's does\n   plead certain factors described in\n   <em>\n    Perini\n   </em>\n   .

First, they argue that \"[t]he shoe was launched less than three years ago[,] which is far too short an amount of time to acquire any secondary meaning.\" MTD Br. 20.

Rothy's has pled facts sufficient to satisfy some of the elements. Given the factually intensive nature of secondary meaning, it is not appropriate for the court to weigh the factors at this stage.

There are two problems with this argument. First, this argument rehashes one of Defendants' main points: The Flat is a generic ballet flat. For the reasons described above, this argument fails at the pleading stage. Second, the shape of the toe is but one element in Rothy's alleged trade dress. The court is required to examine Rothy's trade dress holistically, rather than piecemeal.
