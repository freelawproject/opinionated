(ECF No. 26 at 2; ECF No. 28 at 4 n.3.) During her time at SRS, Adams was an electrical and instrumentation mechanic (\"E &amp; I mechanic\") for approximately three (3) months, a clerk/typist for approximately ten (10) years, and a financial analyst for approximately sixteen (16) years and five (5) months. (ECF No. 22-4 at 209-10.) During Adams' tenure as a financial analyst, she performed field audits as a precious metals auditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 22-1 at 249; ECF No. 22-4 at 63, 112, 219.) Well before initiating this suit, Adams filed claims for breast cancer and beryllium sensitivity with the OWCP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 22-5 at 41, 159, 351.) On April 4, 2006, DOL denied Adams' claim for breast cancer. (ECF No. 22-5 at 291.) Respectively, on November 20, 2013, and June 30, 2014, Adams' claims for beryllium sensitivity were approved, and she was awarded medical monitoring benefits and sixty thousand dollars ($ 60,000.00) under Part B and Part E of the EEOICPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80, 233.) Along with the aforementioned claims, Adams also pursued a claim for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the claim at issue, on August 28, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also occurring on August 28, 2014, and in support of her claim for COPD, Adams provided DOL with a bronchochallenge report, pulmonary function test (\"PFT\"), and a medical report from Dr. R. Hal Hughes (\"Dr. Hughes\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-68.) Dr. Hughes' report, from May 6, 2014, diagnosed Adams with occupational COPD and specifically opined that Adams' \"[o]ccupational exposures [to beryllium] ... at least likely as not contributed\" to her occupational COPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.) On February 12, 2015, DOL \"was not able to establish that beryllium exposure [had] a known link to COPD\" and requested that Dr. Hughes provide a \"detailed [and scientific] rationalization\" for his conclusion that Adams' COPD was linked to beryllium exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) Dr. Hughes responded to DOL on February 19, 2015, with a handwritten note, stating: \"In my group of [b]eryllium sensitive patients-41% have documented asthma compared to the general population of 6% asthma. My opinion is that the asthma is occupational due to beryllium exposures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once again, on May 11, 2015, Dr. Hughes diagnosed Adams with \"mild COPD\" and concluded \"[o]ccupational exposures ... at least as likely as not contributed to her COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) After receiving more submissions from Adams regarding her occupational history, subjective complaints, and work duties, DOL confirmed her various jobs at SRS, including the length of time she spent on each specific job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-37, 48; ECF No. 22-4 at 209-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Eventually, DOL engaged in several important administrative actions, all of which are relevant to this dispute. First, on March 18, 2015, DOL conducted a search on its Site Exposure Matrices (\"the SEM\") in order to determine the toxic substances present at SRS and the effect of those substances on specific workers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 22-4 at 112.) The SEM \"contains information regarding scientifically established links between toxic substances and illnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOICP Site Exposure Matrices Website-Home Page DOE Facilities and RECA Sites Data\n   </em>\n   , U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR , https://www.sem.dol.gov (last updated May 22, 2018). Quite importantly, while \"DOL continually updates these relationships in [the] SEM as new disease associations are published in Haz-Map[,] [t]he causal links shown in [the] SEM\n   <em>\n    do not represent an exclusive list\n   </em>\n   of the pathways necessary for an affirmative Part E causation determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). DOL's initial search on the SEM found that Adams was potentially exposed to, among many others, the following toxins while working at SRS: ammonia, asbestos, cement,\n   chlorine, coal dust, diesel exhaust, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, welding fumes, and wood dust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 22-5 at 45-46.) At this stage, the SEM's results did not suggest that Adams was exposed to beryllium, and there is no indication that DOL conducted any inquiry into Adams' potential exposure to beryllium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, after conducting the general, initial search on the SEM, DOL forwarded Adams' case to a certified industrial hygienist (\"IH\"). (ECF No. 22-4 at 102.) DOL only asked the IH whether Adams' position as an E &amp; I mechanic would have brought her \"into contact\" with specific toxic substances, \"how much exposure [was] likely for each substance[,]\" and the \"likely exposure scenarios.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 207-08.) In regard to specific toxic substances, DOL did not question the IH about Adams' exposure to beryllium, but requested information relating to asbestos, cement, chlorine, coal dust, nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, and silicon dioxide (crystalline). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n    at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The IH issued his report on September 28, 2015, and determined that \"there [was] no evidence to suggest that [ ] Adams, in her capacity as an E &amp; I mechanic, would have had significant exposures to cement, chlorine, coal dust, nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, or silicon dioxide (crystalline).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103, 105.) According to the IH, exposure to those toxic substances \"would have been incidental in nature ... and not significant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105.) However, the IH did conclude that Adams, as an E &amp; I mechanic for three (3) months, was \"exposed to asbestos at greater than incidental levels[,] [but] [h]er exposures to asbestos would have been infrequent in nature ... and would have ranged from low to moderate levels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IH did not make any conclusions or findings pertaining to Adams' exposure to beryllium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n    at 103-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; ECF No. 22-1 at 252.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Third, after the assessment by the IH, DOL referred Adams' case to a contract medical consultant (\"CMC\"). (ECF No. 22-4 at 130.) DOL asked the CMC whether, given the IH report, Adams' work history \"make[s] it at least as likely as not that exposure to toxic substances during [her]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   course of employment was a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing [her] claimed condition of COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CMC issued his report on October 15, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122-24.) In response to DOL's inquiries, the CMC ultimately opined that Adams' \"work history does not make it at least as likely as not that exposure to toxic substances[,] during the course of employment[,] was a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to[,] or causing the claimed condition of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124.) The CMC reached this conclusion by first reasoning that Adams did not have COPD because her PFTs failed to meet the required airflow limitation for a COPD diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CMC also cast doubt on the relationship between asbestos and COPD and found Adams' three (3) month exposure to asbestos to be \"a trivial loss of lung function.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CMC did not make any findings in regard to whether Adams' exposure to beryllium would have aggravated, contributed to, or caused her occupational COPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 9, 2015, DOL's OWCP District Office (\"District Office\") in Jacksonville, Florida, issued a Recommended Decision. (ECF No. 22-4 at 111-14.) The District Office reasoned that Dr. Hughes' response \"lacked credible scientific documentation\" and noted that the SEM database identified the potential toxic substances, those to which Adams was exposed, with a link to COPD. (ECF No. 22-4 at 113.) The District Office further opined that the findings of the IH and CMC, expanding upon the SEM's output, revealed that \"Adams' workplace exposures to toxic substances were not a significant factor in causing, contributing to[,] or aggravating [her] COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is no indication that the District Office possessed any scientific literature from Adams when rendering its Recommended Decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The District Office informed Adams of her right to object to the Recommended Decision within sixty (60) days, which would require the FAB to issue a Final Decision regarding her claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 3, 2016, within the sixty (60) day time limit, Adams, through her counsel, filed objections to the Recommended Decision, urged the FAB to grant her claim for COPD, and requested a live hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61, 65.) Adams primarily objected to the IH and CMC because they allegedly \"failed to consider the full extent of her occupational exposure to toxic substances while working at SRS\" and \"all of [her] potential exposures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.) Importantly, and a central issue before the court, Adams forcefully maintained that the IH did not identify beryllium as \"a potential toxic [substance]\" even though it \"is associated with an increased risk of developing COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the same vein, Adams submitted that the CMC \"did not consider the effect of beryllium exposure upon her development of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The essence of Adams' objection, which remains pertinent, concerns the failure of the District Office \"to adequately develop [her] claim for COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.)

Before the hearing, Adams submitted additional evidence from her medical records. (ECF No. 22-1 at 252, 288.) Within those records, Dr. Hughes opined, in a medical report from February 18, 2016, that \"approximately 40% of the beryllium sensitive patients and 50% of the chronic beryllium patients have asthma [and] COPD[,] which is the basis for my concluding that Ms. Adams has occupational COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288.)

(ECF No. 22-1 at 246-56.) The FAB's Final Decision denied Adams' claim for COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249.) The Final Decision began by recounting the lower administrative proceedings, summarizing Adams' scientific articles and objections, and detailing the video hearing that took place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249-53.) In regard to Adams' objection concerning the relationship between beryllium and COPD, the FAB's Final Decision noted that \"[b]eryllium is not usually associated as a causative factor for development of COPD; therefore, the IH and CMC were not asked to evaluate your exposure potentials to beryllium in relationship [sic] to your COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 252.) Perplexingly, the Final Decision then stated that \"[a]lthough the DOE recognizes that [ ] beryllium was present at [SRS], the levels of exposure that an employee would need to develop beryllium sensitivity is much different than [that] to contribute to the development of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 253.) The FAB, contradicting its acceptance of Adams' beryllium sensitivity claim, further argued that \"there [was] insufficient evidence in [her] case file to indicate that [she] work[ed] with beryllium during [her] DOE employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Besides briefly summarizing the two scientific articles explaining the relationship between beryllium and COPD,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the FAB's Final Decision only stated the following in response to\n   Adams' submitted articles: \"Although your authorized representative provided studies linking COPD to exposures to beryllium, the studies involved employee's [sic] working at beryllium plants that would have had major exposures to beryllium, which does not apply in your case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When deciding conclusions of law, the FAB maintained that Adams' claim \"essentially boil[ed] down to which doctor's reports [were] of greater weight and credibility rejection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 255.) The FAB found the CMC's report as \"better reasoned\" and \"well rationalized\" in comparison to Dr. Hughes' medical opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.320\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) According to the FAB, because Adams did not present sufficient evidence to meet her burden of proof \"to establish [her] entitlement to benefits,\" her claim was denied under Part E of the EEOICPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 255-56.) DOL informed Adams that she was permitted to request reconsideration of its Final Decision within thirty (30) days of its issuance.

In her Request for Reconsideration, Adams argued that she met her burden under Part E of the EEOICPA because she submitted medical literature supporting Dr. Hughes' opinion, showing that \"beryllium exposure is associated with ... the development of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) Adams also maintained that the District Office and the FAB \"relied on an incomplete evaluation of her toxic exposures at [ ] SRS\" and challenged DOL for concluding, in tension with her successful claim for beryllium sensitivity, that there was \"insufficient evidence\" of her beryllium exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to arguing the foregoing, Adams submitted important, new evidence in support of her claim for COPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-151.) First, Adams provided a medical opinion from Dr. Peter Frank (\"Dr. Frank\"), and he observed that Adams' occupational exposure to toxic substances, particularly beryllium, while at SRS was \"the most significant risk factor[ ] for her development of COPD and other related pulmonary conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.) In contrast to the findings of the IH and CMC, Dr. Frank suggested that beryllium exposure contributes to the development of COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.)

Encouraging the FAB to either grant her claim for COPD or remand it to the District Office, Adams maintained that her \"new argument and evidence\" would have \"altered the outcome of the [Final] [D]ecision and the scope of development of [her] claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 19, 2016, the FAB denied Adams' Request for Reconsideration. (ECF No. 22-1 at 2-10.) The Order Denying Reconsideration first recounted the reasons for denying Adams' claim for COPD and examined her newly submitted evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The Order then challenged Dr. Hughes' February 2016 conclusions by referring to his opinions as \"anecdotal evidence, not subject to peer review,\" and suggesting that he did not thoroughly investigate his pool of patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Regarding the scientific articles submitted by Adams, the FAB only stated that \"two previously submitted articles suggest but do not e[s]tablish that COPD can be linked to beryllium exposure[,]\" while \"[t]he remaining articles list potential links between toxic substances and COPD and other lung disorders, such as cigarette smoke, cotton fibers, coal dust, and grain dust.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FAB also rejected three arguments put forth by Adams, including that the IH only considered her exposures as an E &amp; I mechanic, she frequently visited construction sites with toxins linked to COPD, and her position as a precious metals auditor exposed her to toxic substances with links to COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) When accessing her arguments, the FAB concluded that Adams was not \"on record\" with the description, frequency, and nature of her construction visits and precious metals auditing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) The FAB described Dr. Frank's medical opinions, quite harshly, as \"not well rationalized\" and \"based on assertions that have no factual basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) When the FAB handed down its Order Denying Reconsideration on August 19, 2016, its Final Decision became \"final\" on this same day for purposes of the EEOICPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.319\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 30.319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7385s-6(a), Adams filed her Complaint against DOL on October 17, 2016. (ECF No. 1.) Adams submitted her Initial Brief on April 3, 2017, arguing that she was denied \"[d]ue [p]rocess ... because [ ] DOL disregarded substantial, probative evidence in support of her claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26 at 11.) Additionally, Adams contends that DOL failed to \"properly develop\" her claim as required by law, which made the FAB's Final Decision arbitrary and capricious. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) She specifically suggests that the IH and CMC's conclusions regarding her COPD are flawed because they ignore\n   her exposure to beryllium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Likewise, Adams also forcefully maintains that DOL's Order Denying Reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious because it was \"clearly erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence,\" and, unlike the CMC, Dr. Frank discussed her exposure to beryllium and its link to COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Pointing to her scientific articles, Adams relentlessly concludes that \"she met her burden of showing that [it] was at least as likely as not that her occupational exposures at [ ] SRS were ... a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing her COPD.\" (ECF No. 30 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Unsurprisingly, in its Responsive Brief filed on May 3, 2017, DOL starkly disagreed with Adams on multiple fronts. (ECF No. 28.) Maintaining that its Final Decision was not arbitrary and capricious, DOL claims that it adequately reviewed the \"medical evidence and factual statements made by Adams,\" addressed each of her objections, and assisted her with the development of her claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.) DOL further submits that \"[t]here was no basis for requesting an assessment of Adams' exposure to beryllium when the [D]istrict [O]ffice had no evidence of a causal link between beryllium and COPD, either from its search of the data in [the] SEM or as established by a well-rationalized medical opinion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) DOL also argues that its Order Denying Reconsideration was not arbitrary and capricious because Dr. Frank's report was not supported by factual evidence, two scientific articles were previously submitted, four scientific articles were inconsequential, and Adams \"did not sufficiently prove that her exposure to beryllium\" was a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing her COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Lastly, DOL contends that Adams' [d]ue [p]rocess argument is without merit because she does not have any property interest in benefits under the EEOICPA, and she was afforded \"her notice and opportunity to respond.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon receiving DOL's Responsive Brief, Adams attacked DOL's exclusive use of the SEM because it \"was never intended to be utilized ... as an exclusive measure of an employee's toxic exposures.\" (ECF No. 3 at 6) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.231\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 30.231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"OWCP site exposure matrices may be used to provide probative factual evidence that a particular substance was present at ... a DOE facility....\").) According to Adams, DOL acted arbitrarily by ignoring her previous exposure to beryllium when the SEM failed to identify it as related to COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Adams adamantly refuted DOL's assertion that she failed to carry her burden under Part E of the EEOICPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.) Adams charges that her scientific articles, including from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, show that beryllium is associated with COPD and at least as likely as not a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing her COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) In response, DOL continues to insist that it had no obligation to investigate Adams' beryllium exposure, let alone ask the IH or CMC for their opinions regarding beryllium, when Adams failed to provide sufficient evidence \"to establish a causal link between her COPD and any potential beryllium exposure at [ ] SRS.\" (ECF No. 32 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 25, 2017, this matter was completely and fully briefed by the parties.

(ECF No. 22-4 at 63-73.) One of her principal objections concerned DOL's lack of attention to her \"increased risk of developing COPD\" as a result from her exposure to beryllium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.) She submitted several scientific articles in support of her claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-73.) One of those articles, which is from a government agency, concluded the following about workers exposed to \"hazardous levels\" of beryllium: \"As exposure to beryllium increased, so did the risk of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68 (citing NAT'L INST. FOR OCCUPATIONAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   SAFETY &amp; HEALTH , HEALTH CONCERNS FOR WORKERS WHO WORKED AROUND BERYLLIUM (2011), https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/Beryllium_Notification-508.pdf (last visited Nov. 26, 2018) ).) The findings of the second article \"suggest[ed] that COPD ... [is] related to beryllium exposure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72 (citing Mary K. Schubauer-Berigan et al.,\n   <em>\n    Cohort Mortality Study of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Workers\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at Seven Beryllium Processing Plants: Update and Associations with Cumulative and Maximum Exposure\n   </em>\n   , 68 OCCUPATIONAL &amp; ENVTL. MED. 345 (2011) ).) DOL's Final Decision recognized that the former article \"indicated that as exposure to beryllium increases, so does the risk of COPD,\" while the latter article \"linked occupational beryllium exposure to the increased risk of development of COPD.\" (ECF No. 22-1 at 251.) Despite making its own conclusions in regard to these studies, DOL attempted to distinguish them by reasoning that the employees within those studies \"would have had major exposures to beryllium,\" which is inapplicable to Adams' case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 253.) DOL's conclusion, though more akin to an unsupported presumption, regarding Adams' beryllium exposure is unfounded and devoid of any factual merit. DOL granted Adams' claims for beryllium sensitivity, respectively, on November 20, 2013, and June 30, 2014. (ECF No. 22-5 at 80, 223.) Even though it granted prior beryllium claims, DOL did not, and has not, conducted any medical assessment of Adams' exposure to beryllium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-1 at 252-53; ECF No. 22-5 at 234.) Based upon the administrative record, it is simply impossible for DOL to \"conclude\" that Adams did not have a major exposure to beryllium that contributed to her COPD when it failed to determine her exposure levels to that particular substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 22-1, 22-2, 22-3, 22-4, 22-5.) Moreover, DOL's dismissive attitude of Adams' exposure to beryllium is plainly at odds with its prior grant of her beryllium sensitivity claim, which is an affirmative acknowledgement that she was exposed to some amount of beryllium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-5 at 233-35.)

At multiple points, DOL's Final Decision stated that \"[t]he SEM ... identified that an E &amp; I mechanic had the potential for exposure to the toxic substances of asbestos, cement, chlorine, coal dust, nitrogen dioxide, phosgene and/or crystalline silicon dioxide which are related to the health effect of COPD.\" (ECF No. 22-1 at 254.) Additionally, DOL contends that \"there was no basis for requesting an assessment of Adams' exposure to beryllium when the [D]istrict [O]ffice had no evidence of a causal link between beryllium and COPD, either from its search of the data in [the] SEM or as established by a well-rationalized medical opinion.\" (ECF No. 28 at 17.) As pointed out by Adams, the SEM is not a dispositive means by which a claimant can establish a relationship between a toxic substance and illness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2030.232\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 30.232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"The employee ... may also submit to OWCP\n   <em>\n    other evidence\n   </em>\n   not described in paragraph (a) of this section showing that the employee has or had an illness\n   <em>\n    that resulted from an exposure to a toxic substance\n   </em>\n   during the course of employment at either a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate.\" (emphasis added) ). Supposedly, at the time of Adams' claim, DOL did not use the SEM as a dispositive tool and specifically stated the following: \"The SEM is not used to establish or deny causation by itself, but is used as a tool to assist in the evaluation of causation in light of the evidence as a whole....

DOL's silence flew in the face of one article that concluded the following: \"Careful review of the literature demonstrated that approximately 15% of COPD is work related and\n   <em>\n    that new agents causing COPD\n   </em>\n   , as well as news cases with persistent airflow limitation associated with work\n   <em>\n    , are still being reported.\n   </em>\n   \" (ECF 22-1 at 130 (quoting Piera Boschetto et al.,\n   <em>\n    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    (COPD) and Occupational Exposures\n   </em>\n   , 1:11 J.

Once again, by not addressing the underlying issue, whether beryllium may be a new agent causing, contributing to, or aggravating COPD, DOL disregarded another new aspect of the problem before it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p294\">\n    899 F.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the National Park Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it did not explain \"likely inconsistences\" that it uncovered and ignored \"important aspects\" of the problem).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Adams also provided a medical opinion from Dr. Frank in her Request for Reconsideration. (ECF No. 22-1 at 80-83.) Dr. Frank put forth the idea of a \"risk factor\" and stated that it is \"any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81.) He specifically stated that \"[risk factors] do not operate in isolation,\" but coexist and interact with one another to produce [a] disease or illness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He arrived at the conclusion that Adams' exposure to toxic substances, including beryllium, were \"significant risk factors for her development of COPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.) In an ill-fated attempt, DOL stated that Dr. Frank's medical opinion was not \"well rationalized,\" \"lacked a factual basis,\" and \"unsupported by the evidence of record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) DOL is concerned that Dr. Frank's opinion is flawed because \"[t]he record does not include any details about [Adams'] work as a precious metals auditor....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The perplexing irony of DOL's concern is that Adams indicated that she performed precious metals auditing, but DOL did not develop any additional details when its regulations suggest that it do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. 30.2(a) (\"OWCP also provides assistance to claimants and potential claimants by providing information regarding eligibility\n   and other program requirements, including information on completing claim forms and the types and availability of medical testing and diagnostic services related to occupational illnesses under Part B of the Act and covered illnesses under Part E of the Act.\"). While DOL is certainly at liberty to scrutinize the basis of Dr. Frank's opinion, it failed to acknowledge the question put forth by Dr. Frank: namely, whether beryllium was a \"risk factor\" that increased \"the likelihood\" of Adams' development of COPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 81.) Not only has DOL jettisoned its own regulatory obligation, it has ignored another critical aspect of the problem when given a second chance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p294\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, given DOL's noticeable silence and lack of explanation regarding \"risk factors,\" the court is unable to ascertain the role it played, if any, in DOL's Order Denying Reconsideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518071\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/260/#p294\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This is precisely the type of conduct that fails to survive review under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ergon-W.

For example, in DOL's Final Decision, it explicitly stated that one of Adams' submitted articles \"indicated that as exposure to beryllium increases, so does the risk of COPD,\" while the other \"linked occupational beryllium exposure to the increased risk of development of COPD.\" (ECF No. 22-1 at 251.) However, changing its tune, DOL took a different view of the articles in its Order Denying Reconsideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Concerning these two articles, DOL, blatantly contradicting itself, concluded that the same articles \"suggest but do not establish that COPD can be linked to beryllium exposure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Provided with another chance to correct course, DOL continued to ignore the relevant factors before it and decided, at its own peril, to undermine the development of its own administrative record. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-1 at 2-6,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-1 at 249-56.)
