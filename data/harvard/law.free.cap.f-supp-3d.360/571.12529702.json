After careful consideration, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against Defendant pursuant to the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which requires employers to pay employees at least one and one-half times the regular rate for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 U.S.C. 207(a)(1) ; (Doc. 1). According to Plaintiffs, Defendant violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by requiring that Plaintiffs work an excess of forty hours per week during one or more weeks of employment and not compensating them at the statutory rate of one and one-half times the regular rate for those hours worked in excess of forty hours per work week. (Doc. 1 at 7). Instead, Defendant classified Plaintiffs as independent contractors and paid them at a straight time hourly rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs further maintain that Defendant's actions were willful and/or showed a reckless disregard for the provisions of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant counters that Plaintiffs are not \"employees\" of Defendant as that term is defined and interpreted under the FLSA. (Doc. 9 at 10). Thus, Defendant was under no obligation to pay Plaintiffs at the statutory rate of one and one-half times the regular rate for those hours worked in excess of forty hours per work week.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that shows Defendant acted willfully in violation of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree that Defendant is subject to the FLSA and to the applicable damages, should Defendant be found liable.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds the following by a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. During the relevant time period, Defendant provided pipe welding and fabrication services primarily to its customer Pioneer. Defendant also provided other types of services, such as roustabout work, treatment of produced oil at the customer's facilities, dirt work, ditching, pipe installation, environmental cleanup, and NORM cleanup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. During the relevant time period, all of the Plaintiffs worked exclusively for Defendant as welders. Plaintiffs could be called at any time during the day to complete emergency jobs for Defendant. Plaintiffs provided their services to Pioneer only by virtue of their relationship with Defendant and under Defendant's Master Services Agreement with Pioneer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. Defendant hired Plaintiffs to complete all welding work for Defendant and moved Plaintiffs to subsequent projects once Plaintiffs completed an assigned project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. Plaintiffs became certified welders and took various tests at the direction of Defendant to stay up to date with Pioneer's certification requirements. Defendant paid for Plaintiffs' welding certifications--those required by Pioneer--and for hours Plaintiffs spent completing the tests to become certified pipe welders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5. Defendant trained Plaintiffs to drive a forklift and paid Plaintiffs for hours they spent training on how to operate a forklift.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6. While working for Defendant, Plaintiffs completed pipe-welding, structural welding, maintenance jobs, and occasionally drove forklifts. However,\n   Plaintiffs worked primarily as pipe welders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   7. Pioneer, not Defendant, dictated the specific welding procedures, provided diagram schemes for Plaintiffs to use while completing their respective projects, and owned the pipe the Plaintiffs welded on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   8. A third-party company employed by Pioneer inspected Plaintiffs' welding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   9. Defendant assigned Plaintiffs welding work with Pioneer and maintained daily time records for each Plaintiff that it would then bill to Pioneer. On some occasions, such as on hard bid jobs, Defendant tracked Plaintiffs hours but did not bill Pioneer on an hourly basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   10. Plaintiffs took the same break and lunch times as Defendant's employees and were required to work between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. At times, Plaintiffs were required to stay after 5:00 p.m. Plaintiffs did not think they could refuse a job or leave early out of fear of being replaced or terminated. If Plaintiffs were late, they were sent home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   11. Plaintiffs were disciplined by Defendant for not complying with Pioneer's requirements. For example, Plaintiffs were sent home if they failed to wear safety gear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   12. Plaintiffs supplied their own trucks, welding machines, and several specialized welding tools, such as beveling machines, grinders, torches, torch hoses, leads, jack stands, hand tools, levels, and squares. Plaintiffs were also accountable for their meals and housing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   13. Defendant paid for and supplied consumables, such as oxygen, acetylene for coating, welding rods, buffing wheels, grinding disks, face shields, and sanding pads. The type of consumables required was dictated by Pioneer. Additionally, Defendant provided the forklift needed to move pipes and other items at the project site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   14. Defendant also hired welder helpers to assist Plaintiffs, some of which were suggested by Plaintiffs, and, once hired, assigned the welder helpers to projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   15. Defendant paid Plaintiffs a fixed hourly rate of $80 or $70, depending on the year, plus a $100 per diem as reimbursement for fuel and to compensate Plaintiffs for using their welding equipment and trucks. The $100 per diem was agreed to by the parties based on the industry standard. Plaintiffs were not required to turn over expenses to justify the per diem payment. Plaintiffs were also paid an hour to drive to a location and an additional hour to drive from a location regardless of the length of the actual drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   16. Although Defendant did not expressly prohibit Plaintiffs from taking other jobs while working for Defendant, realistically the work schedule established by Pioneer via Defendant precluded Plaintiffs from working on other jobs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   17. Plaintiffs were required by Defendant to attend safety meetings, together with Defendant's employees, and complete job safety analysis tickets. Plaintiffs were also required to submit to random drug testing. Plaintiffs were paid for the time spent at safety meetings and completing drug tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   18. During the relevant time period, Plaintiffs classified themselves as self-employed on their income tax returns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   19. Sam Hardcastle (Hardcastle), also a welder, with the consent of Defendant--and at its initial direction--assigned tasks to Plaintiffs based on Pioneer's (and other customers) needs and based on Defendant's obligations under its contract with Pioneer, disciplined Plaintiffs when they arrived late, and provided more simplified diagrams instructing Plaintiffs how to complete welds required under the Master Service Agreement. Hardcastle's role was institutionalized over time and with T.R. Bridges' initial direction regarding how to manage the welders and Defendant's obligations to its customers and after Hardcastle gained the expertise necessary to oversee Defendant's duties under its contracts. T.R. Bridges was aware of Hardcastle's role among the welders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   20. Defendant initially hired welders as employees but reclassified them as independent contractors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   21. All findings of fact that are more properly considered to be conclusions of law are also adopted by the Court as conclusions of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
