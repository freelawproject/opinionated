(\"Wells Fargo\") a defendant in the TelexFree multi-district securities litigation, move to dismiss all counts against them in the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (\"SCAC\") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). TelexFree, Inc. (\"TelexFree\") was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012 to April 2014, and involved approximately two million participants worldwide, nearly a million of whom suffered a net financial loss. Several plaintiffs filed actions in federal district courts across the United States seeking to recover their losses against dozens of defendants, ranging from financial service providers, including banks (such as Wells Fargo), payment processing companies, and the principals of the fraudulent scheme employed by or otherwise involved with TelexFree. As the actions involved common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation joined the actions into a multidistrict litigation, ordered transfer of all actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Wells Fargo is identified in the SCAC as a bank that maintained accounts for TelexFree\n   and \"provided banking services, maintained accounts, and received and executed transfers of funds from or for the benefit of TelexFree\" (SCAC \u00b6 84). The only other specific reference to Wells Fargo in the SCAC is \u00b6 713 which alleges \"Wells Fargo also maintained accounts on behalf of TelexFree and processed transactions amounting to tens of millions of dollars for TelexFree.\" The Plaintiff seeks recovery against Wells Fargo for aiding and abetting in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93 \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 69 and ch. 93A \u00a7\u00a7 2(a) and 11 (Count III), unjust enrichment (Count IV), and tortious aiding and abetting (Count X).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The SCAC also makes general allegations against all bank defendants. As general averments, Plaintiffs allege that the defendant banks received significant funds from TelexFree and other defendants to provide banking services, maintain accounts, and receive and execute transfers for the benefit of TelexFree. (\u00b6 711). They further allege that the defendant banks profited from these relationships and that despite a federal regulatory duty to be watchful for the existence of \"red flags\" surrounding TelexFree, they allowed the pyramid scheme to utilize their services including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Processing and opening depository accounts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Receiving payments made by promoters of TelexFree to become members of the program;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Maintaining depository accounts containing funds paid by promoters to TelexFree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Making payments to certain promoters as part of TelexFree's investment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Transferring funds paid by promoters of TelexFree among TelexFree entities, defendant founders' personal accounts, foreign companies, and shell companies; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Allowing TelexFree to use the banks' name in their promotional materials thereby lending TelexFree the use of their reputation and credibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege a claim that plausibly entitles the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Accordingly, I find that there is no separate Cause of Action under the facts of this case for aiding and abetting M.G.L.C. 93 \u00a7 12 and 69, and C. 93A \u00a7 2 and 11 and grant Defendant's Motion as to the Third Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth Claim for Relief: Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Count IV of the SCAC alleges that \"Plaintiffs and the putative class conferred\n   a benefit upon the defendants by furnishing funds, directly or indirectly to defendants, who accepted them without protest and retained and benefited from them.\" (SCAC at \u00b6 1038). The Plaintiffs go on to allege that the Defendant, with specific regard to the financial service providers, was unjustly enriched.

Knowing and Actual Assistance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The primary tort elements of the aiding and abetting allegation is not disputed by the Defendant. The parties agree that TelexFree established an illegal Ponzi scheme and thus committed a relevant underlying tort. Any analysis of the claims contained in the SCAC begins by examining the allegation that the Defendants either actively participated in and/or substantially assisted in TelexFree's tortious and fraudulent scheme. Participation that is not active, (i.e. passive) does not constitute aiding and abetting\"). Similarly, mere assistance, less than substantial, also fails to meet the relevant threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Our Court in\n   <em>\n    In re State Street Cases\n   </em>\n   outlined why passive assistance and inaction does not rise to the level of substantial\n   assistance. Specifically, in State Street, a fraudster used bank accounts in the execution of a fraudulent scheme. The Court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The mere settling of a transaction or providing of a platform, without more, cannot sustain a charge of substantial assistance. Although conventional banking services made it easier to effectuate [a] fraudulent scheme, there was no showing of substantial assistance ... [although] ... participants in the ... scheme used [bank] accounts ... to perpetrate it ... These allegations are precisely the sort of passive assistance and inaction that, without more, does not rise to the level of substantial assistance.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    In re State Street Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205508151\">\n    2013 WL 5508151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Absent any showing of active participation in, or substantial assistance in furthering the underlying tort, the mere provision of banking services, as in\n   <em>\n    State Street\n   </em>\n   cannot actively or substantially assist a fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    2. Actual knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As evidence of actual knowledge, Plaintiffs plead that financial service providers, which presumably includes Wells Fargo, had access to TelexFree's promotional literature and TelexFree's contact with their members (including the victims of the scheme). (SCAC 187-88, 337-38). The Court gives deference to the factual assertions of the non-moving party. However, the Plaintiffs argue that financial service providers, including Wells Fargo should have concluded from review of those documents that TelexFree's scheme was facially tortious. An argument that a bank should have recognized a fraud is insufficient to meet the actual knowledge requirement. \"The fact that a bank\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   recognized fraud does not mean that it had\n   <em>\n    actual knowledge\n   </em>\n   of fraud.\" An aiding and abetting claim demands a showing of 'actual knowledge' of the underlying wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    Cahaly v.

(SCAC at 698). Setting aside the xenophobic implications, TelexFree claimed to be in the business of Voice over Internet Telephony, a technology that allows international calls be made cheaply, and which was heavily marketed in Brazil and American Brazilian communities. If such a company was legitimate the majority of their customers would be drawn from immigrant communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Lacking any plausibly articulated pleading that Wells Fargo had actual knowledge of the underlying tort during the period in which they served as TelexFree's bankers the aiding and abetting counts must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Defendant Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss (documents 171) are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
