Bickler does not dispute this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rather, Bickler offers two arguments to support his motion. First, he contends that his use of the name is artistic expression protected by the First Amendment. Second, Bickler asserts that he is entitled to make \"fair use\" of the name \"Survivor\" to state the historical fact that he was previously a member of the band.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Bickler's First Amendment argument rests on his interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

In any event, resolution of Bickler's First Amendment argument depends largely upon factual questions that are not properly resolved at the pleading phase. In short, the dispute boils down to whether Bickler's use of \"Survivor\" is artistic as opposed to commercial in nature. Here, the complaint plausibly alleges that Bickler uses the name \"Survivor\" to promote his appearances for commercial gain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 11, Exs. B-D.

Here, Plaintiffs have set forth facts regarding some, but not all, of these factors. For example, Bickler allegedly uses the exact trademark in dispute-\"Survivor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eastland Music Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537122\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/869/#p871\">\n    707 F.3d at 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that if the defendant's work bore the same name as the plaintiff's, \"allegations of confusion...could be omitted from the complaint\"). Plaintiffs also allege that Bickler uses the name widely, including on his websites and in performances in Georgia and Illinois. Finally, Plaintiffs claim that \"Bickler's continued unauthorized use of the mark SURVIVOR in connection with his musical performances creates the misleading impression that Bickler remains a member of or is otherwise affiliated with\" the band. Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Whether these allegations are enough is a close issue, but the Court, drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor (as it must do), concludes that the complaint adequately pleads a likelihood of consumer confusion to survive a motion to dismiss. Although some of the examples include the disclaimer that Bickler is a \"former\" member of Survivor, this is not always the case. For example, the \"About Dave\" page of his personal website merely describes the success of Survivor's \"biggest hit, 'Eye of the Tiger,' \" and does not explicitly state that Bickler is no longer affiliated with the band.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. B. Similarly, Bickler's Instagram page describes him as the \"original lead singer for the rock band Survivor,\" a phrase that does not ineluctably lead to the conclusion that Bickler is no longer a member of the band.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537122\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/869/#p871\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C. And Bickler's use of the Instagram account with the handle \"thesurvivordave\" could confuse readers into believing that he remains affiliated with the band in some fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Of course, it is quite possible that discovery will prove Bickler right and Plaintiffs wrong, but the complaint adequately states the required elements of a trademark infringement claim for pleading purposes. Factual questions regarding the likelihood of consumer confusion (if any), the descriptive nature of Bickler's use, and the precise manner of his use must be left for another day. Accordingly, the Court denies Bickler's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Contract &amp; Unfair Competition Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to the remaining two claims, Bickler argues only that, if the trademark infringement claim is dismissed, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the\n   breach of contract and unfair competition claims. Because the Court declines to dismiss the trademark infringement claim, the Court denies Bickler's motion to dismiss the remaining claims on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Bickler's motion to dismiss [16] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court assumes the alleged facts in the complaint are true and draws all possible inferences in favor of Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tamayo v.
