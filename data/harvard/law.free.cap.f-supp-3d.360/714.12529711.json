No. 36), in addition to Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (\"Metro\") and Freddie O'Connell's (collectively \"Defendants\") combined Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deja Vu of Nashville (\"Deja Vu\") and The Parking Guys (\"TPG\") (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") have filed responses to the instant motions (Doc. Nos. 26, 28, 39), to which Defendants have replied (Doc. Nos. 27, 32). For the following reasons, Defendants' and Schipani's Motions to Dismiss (Doc. Nos. 17, 25) will be granted and Schipani's Motion to Strike (Doc. No. 36) will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Deja Vu is a Nashville business engaged \"in the presentation of female performance dance entertainment to the consenting adult public.\" (Doc. No. 1 at 2.) In early 2016, Deja Vu sold its original location at 1214 Demonbreun Street, Nashville, Tennessee to third-party developers and began relocation efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) In the summer of 2016, Deja Vu entered into a purchase agreement for a location at 1418 Church Street, Nashville, Tennessee, which was zoned for \"adult use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) After Deja Vu purchased the property, Metro Council Members Freddie O'Connell and Bob Mendes introduced Ordinance No. BL2016-350 (the \"Ordinance\"), which sought to eliminate \"adult entertainment\" as a permissible land use for the zone where Deja Vu sought to operate its new establishment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-6.) O'Connell hoped that the Ordinance would trigger a larger conversation about adult entertainment in Nashville and would refocus these adult entertainment businesses away from downtown Nashville. (Doc. No. 1-7.) Ultimately, in October 2016, O'Connell\n   publicly withdrew the Ordinance, and, in May 2017, Metro's Sexually Oriented Business License Board approved a license for the operation of Deja Vu's new club at 1418 Church Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2017, a local newspaper, The Tennessean, published an article entitled \"New Deja Vu strip club on Church Street quickly draws complaints.\" (Doc. No. 1-10.) In the article, Lee Molette, a local developer who supported the Ordinance, commented that Deja Vu patrons were using drugs, dropping liquor bottles and other litter, and parking illegally on his and other nearby properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) In the same article, O'Connell also stated that he had seen video footage of a drug deal conducted near Deja Vu's new establishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Mike Durham, general manager and vice president of Deja Vu, disputed the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, a spokesperson from Nashville Metro Police Department stated that additional patrols would be added to respond to the complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In conjunction with operating their new location, Deja Vu entered a written agreement with TPG to provide valet services for the club. (Doc. No. 1 at 8.) Deja Vu chose TPG in part because it was an established valet service business with no history of sanctions from the Metro Traffic and Parking Commission (the \"Commission\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deja Vu alleges that a properly run valet service contributes to the orderly flow of traffic and is necessary to attract high-end patrons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, in May 2017, TPG filed its initial application to Metro's Public Works Department for permission to operate a valet service on 15th Avenue North to service Deja Vu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Metro Public Works denied TPG's request, stating that parking was not allowed on Church Street or 14th Avenue. (Doc. No. 1-11.) Plaintiffs allege that a representative from Metro Public Works also orally informed them of the decision, and, when Plaintiffs asked for a reason supporting the decision, none was provided. (Doc. No. 1 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 8, 2017, TPG timely appealed the Commission's valet application denial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Metro Public Works then decided to hold a hearing on TPG's appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that, prior to and at the meeting, Schipani, who owns a building across from Deja Vu's new club, and Molette engaged in a plan to disseminate false information to obtain the permanent denial of TPG's valet application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 9, 2017, Schipani sent an email to Diane Marshall, an employee of Metro Public Works, with Molette as a copied recipient, attaching a letter and stating \"[a]nything that you can do to support the denial of this valet parking permit will be appreciated.\" (Doc. No. 1-14 at 1.) The attached letter was on behalf of the Midtown Church Street Business &amp; Residential Association and was addressed to Diane Marshall and Chip Knauf, a representative for the Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The letter stated that, since Deja Vu opened and TPG operated its valet service (without a permit), its members had witnessed near miss accidents and traffic congestion, which necessitated a permanent denial of TPG's pending valet application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the letter stated that member businesses had been blocked out of their gated parking areas due to TPG's valet service and employees were having difficult maneuvering the street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiffs allege that these statements were knowingly false when made and were communicated to obtain permanent denial of TPG's pending valet permit. (Doc. No. 1 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 14, 2017, TPG began applying for, and receiving, a series of \"Lane Closure Permits\" for the operation of a valet service on 15th Street North while their valet permit appeal was pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 7, 2017, Schipani emailed Marshall\n   and Molette a series of photographs, allegedly showing \"consistent problems with valet parking on both sides of the street which impedes the flow of traffic, blocking private parking and presenting safety issues for drivers plus pedestrians.\" (Doc. No. 1-16 at 2.) Schipani, on behalf of the Midtown Church Street Business and Residential Association, \"fervently ask[ed] [Marshall] to deny [TPG's] application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) TPG's valet application appeal was then placed on the Commission's agenda for its July 10, 2017 meeting. (Doc. No. 1 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the Commission's July 10 meeting, Molette first testified against TPG's valet permit appeal, stating that: (1) the street was too narrow for TPG's valet service; (2) TPG's current operation of the valet service was causing congestion; (3) TPG's current operation of the valet service was causing traffic to back up on 15th Street to Church Street; (4) the congestion caused by TPG's valet service was consistent day-to-day; and (5) a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle due to TPG's valet service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Schipani also testified against TPG's valet appeal, noting that: (1) TPG was parking vehicles on her property; (2) TPG was causing traffic \"up and down\" the street; and (3) TPG was \"constantly\" parking in a manner that impeded vehicular ingress and egress to her business's parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Diane Marshall testified that TPG's requested valet permit met the technical requirements of the Metro Code, explaining that a \"No Parking to Corner\" sign could be properly moved from 90 feet to 30 feet from the corner, thereby opening 60 feet for three 20-foot valet lanes and allowing TPG to legally operate the valet service for Deja Vu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Finally, Chip Knauf, Traffic Engineer for Metro Public Works, reiterated that the requested valet permit met the technical code requirements for approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Commission subsequently deferred the matter to their next meeting to gather additional evidence, including alleged video evidence showing the traffic congestion related to TPG's ongoing valet operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the Commission's July 10, 2017 hearing, Metro retained Collier Engineering Company, Inc. (\"Collier\") to perform a study of TPG's ongoing valet operation and its effects on traffic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ultimately, Collier's report concluded that, during Deja Vu's busiest period (Friday night/Saturday morning) five vehicles experienced delay due to congestion at the valet stand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) On August 11, 2017, Schipani again emailed Knauf, Molette, and O'Connell, reiterating her position that TPG's valet appeal should be denied and stating that: (1) the neighborhood surrounding TPG's valet operation continued to witness public safety hazards attributable to TPG's valet service; (2) TPG's valet operation was associated with two pedestrians hit by cars in the past two months; and (3) the corner of Church Street and 15th Street was \"gridlocked' most nights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) On August 14, 2017, O'Connell emailed Knauf requesting that TPG's valet appeal be denied and noting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Area property owners have demonstrated ... an extraordinary amount of inappropriate vehicular activity at the intersection in question ... and I believe a valet here would present unfortunate public safety concerns, traffic and parking issues that could affect performance of emergency vehicles, and general negative traffic and parking issues for area users of the public right of way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Doc. No. 1-22. at 1.) Plaintiffs allege that O'Connell's email to Knauf was intended to be conveyed to the Commission and to influence the Commission to deny TPG's requested valet permit, and O'Connell \"issued the email with the intent to use the color of his office as a Metro Council Member\n   to influence the Commission to deny the appeal.\" (Doc. No. 1 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 14, 2017, the Commission again took up TPG's appeal for a valet permit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Collier presented their findings, Marshall reiterated that Collier found no direct problems with TPG's valet operation, and Knauf also noted that there were no outstanding problems with operating the valet in that area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Ultimately, Commissioner Nora Kern stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Well, I think the report and the pictures seem to be a little bit at odds from-just based on-but I do think the letter from Councilman O'Connell should stand for a lot since he hopefully has a good feeling of what's going on his street. So I would move to deny the valet stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) The Commission then denied TPG's valet application appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that, in voting to deny the appeal, the Commission substituted the judgment of O'Connell, Schipani, and Molette for their own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in Davidson County Chancery Court, seeking a review of the Commission's decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-26.) The Davidson County Chancery Court ultimately denied Plaintiffs' petition, subject to Plaintiffs' currently pending appeal. (Doc. No. 26-2 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"the acts of Metro, O'Connell, Schipani, and Molette were part of a single plan to orchestrate the improper denial of the valet permit requested by TPG to service Deja Vu\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. No. 1 at 20.) Further, Plaintiffs allege that Metro and its officials violated Deja Vu and TPG's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by (1) denying TPG's requested valet permit without substantive and procedural due process of law; and (2) denying TPG's requested valet permit due to disagreement with or disdain for Deja Vu's First Amendment protected speech and expression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs request monetary damages, attorney's fees and costs, and all equitable and general relief to which they are entitled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Schipani's Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Schipani has filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 17), pursuant Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(5) and 12(b)(6), to dismiss Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985 claim against her. First, Schipani argues that the Court should decline to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    424 U.S. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) and\n   <em>\n    Burford v. Sun Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    319 U.S. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    87 L.Ed. 1424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943). (Doc. No. 18 at 7-14.) Schipani also argues that Deja Vu's \u00a7 1985 claim must be dismissed for lack of standing because Deja Vu has not suffered a cognizable injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding the merits, Schipani first contends that she is absolutely immune from Plaintiffs' lawsuit because her statements were made while she was a witness in quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Further, she argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1985 because they have not alleged any class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) She also contends that she did not produce, and could not have produced, the alleged injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-24.) Finally, she argues that Plaintiffs' action should be dismissed for improper service of process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Abstention and Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Schipani contends that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , the instant federal suit and Plaintiffs' still-pending Davidson County Chancery Court action are parallel because both lawsuits are presently pending, the claims in each action are predicated upon the same allegations and same\n   material facts, the alleged injuries arise out of the same administrative decision, and all the parties to the Davidson County Chancery Court action are parties to the instant case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Further, she argues that all eight of the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   factors favor abstention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-13.) Alternatively, she asserts that abstention is appropriate under\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   because review of the Commission's proceeding is available under state law (and is currently ongoing in Davidson County Chancery Court) and the exercise of federal review would interfere with state-level efforts to establish coherent policies on a matter of public concern, namely traffic flow on public streets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) Finally, Schipani maintains that, to the extent Deja Vu asserts a \u00a7 1985 claim against her, it must be dismissed for lack of standing because Deja Vu itself has not suffered any cognizable injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Schipani concludes that (1) TPG was the only entity whose permit application was considered and ultimately rejected by the Commission; and (2) TPG's inability to obtain a valet permit has no bearing on Deja Vu's right or ability to operate, and it is also free to have valet services provided by another entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that it would not be appropriate for the Court to abstain. Plaintiffs contend that the instant federal suit is of a completely different character than the state action, with different requested relief, such that the suits are not parallel under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. No. 26 at 16.) Plaintiffs also argue that the instant case does not involve the type of complex administrative issues\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention is designed to address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Finally, D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu counters that it has standing because it has been denied a government entitlement due to its protected First Amendment activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) The Court will consider Schipani's abstention arguments first and then turn to her standing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , \"a federal court may, in certain limited circumstances, decline to adjudicate a claim that is already the subject of a pending state-court case.\"\n   <em>\n    RSM Richter, Inc. v. Behr Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656938,3700772\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/553/\">\n    729 F.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556 (6th Cir. 2013). A court called upon to consider\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention must engage in a two-step process: first, the Court must determine if the State and federal proceedings are \"actually parallel\" to one another; and then, only if the threshold requirement of parallelism is met, the Court will engage in a multi-factor balancing analysis to decide whether to abstain.\n   <em>\n    Romine v. Compuserve Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669459\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/337/#p339\">\n    160 F.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339-41 (6th Cir. 1998). Underlying this analysis is the fundamental principle that \"federal courts have a strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746454\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/706/#p716\">\n    517 U.S. 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746454\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/706/#p716\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746454\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/706/#p716\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (citing\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    424 U.S. at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

First, the claims (and associated issues) in each action are distinct. TPG's petition for writ of certiorari seeks to determine whether the Commission's decision was supported by material and competent evidence, while the instant federal suit seeks to determine whether Defendants acted conspiratorially, in violation of \u00a7 1985, to damage Plaintiffs' respective businesses. Moreover, the requested relief also distinguishes the actions, with TPG's petition for writ of certiorari seeking to reverse the Commission's denial and the instant federal suit seeking monetary damages stemming from that denial. Put simply, the instant federal action and the Davidson Chancery Court action are not sufficiently parallel to require abstention under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   . Given the significant differences in the state and federal actions, there is no \"clear justification\" warranting abstention, and, therefore, the Court will exercise its jurisdiction over this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11422254\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/711/#p715\">\n    300 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the \"clearest of justifications\" to warrant abstention).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention,\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention \"is concerned with protecting complex state administrative processes from undue federal interference,\" but \"it does not require abstention whenever there exists such a process, or even in all cases where there is a 'potential for conflict' with state regulatory law or policy.\"\n   <em>\n    New Orleans Pub.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5.) Further, to the extent that Plaintiffs assert a First Amendment retaliation claim, Metro argues that such a claim must fail because there has been no adverse action taken against Deja Vu, and, alternatively, there are no facts alleged that would show that the permit denial was motivated by animus against Deja Vu's offering of adult-entertainment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Third, Metro contends that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985 claim against it should be dismissed because (as stated by Schipani above) there are no allegations that the alleged discrimination was based on race or membership in some other protected class defined by inherent personal characteristics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Finally, O'Connell contends that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985 claim against him should be dismissed based on his legislative immunity.

In response, Plaintiffs argue that: (1) they had a legitimate expectation in the issuance of a valet permit based on the language of the Metro Code; (2) the state court remedy is inadequate because it does not provide for money damages; and (3) the reason for the denial was due to improper animus towards Deja Vu's First Amendment activity.

Additionally, the Court's \"Judicial Preferences\" clearly states \"[c]ounsel should\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    incorporate legal authority or factual argument from another document, including a prior brief or the brief of another party in the case.\" Judicial Preferences, Chief Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., Middle District of Tennessee, https://www.tnmd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-district-judge-crenshaw (last visited Feb. 4, 2019) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Molette is required to file a separate Motion to Dismiss with an accompanying Memorandum of Law. To the extent that Molette's \"Joinder\" is a motion, it is\n    <strong>\n     DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Additionally, Schipani's conclusory assertion that Deja Vu can merely contract with another valet service is belied by the factual record. Schipani's (and Molette's) multiple and fervent complaints to the Commission about TPG's valet service were premised on the congestion the service created and the logistical impossibility of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    valet service, not just TPG, servicing Deja Vu. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. Nos. 1 at 16, 1-16 at 2.) Schipani gives no indication that these same complaints could not, or would not, be raised against other potential valet service vendors. Indeed, the suggestion that the individual defendants would not object to another valet service strains credulity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Because the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985 claim on this basis and does not reach the witness immunity issue, Schipani is not entitled to attorneys' fees under Tennessee Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-1003(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
