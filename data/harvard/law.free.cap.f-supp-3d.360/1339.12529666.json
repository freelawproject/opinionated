Before me now is Carnival's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Motion\") (ECF No. 41). For the reasons below, Carnival's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff and Decedent (\"the Webbs\") were passengers onboard the Carnival\n   <em>\n    Dream\n   </em>\n   on January 17, 2015, departing from New Orleans, Louisiana to Cozumel, Mexico. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 1, ECF No. 41 (\"Def.'s Facts\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their cabin included a balcony with a railing that was over 45 inches high, complying with relevant federal law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7 - 9. The Webbs traveled with another couple, Robert and Amanda Howe (\"the Howes\"), that stayed in an adjoining cabin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the day in question, the Webbs were served 22 alcoholic beverages in a 12-hour span, from before noon to near midnight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12 - 13, 24; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 17, 66, ECF No. 79 (\"Pl.'s Facts\"). Most of these drinks were Long Island Iced Teas, each of which contains 2.5 ounces of alcohol. Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 69. Plaintiff ordered and signed for drinks throughout the day for both herself and Decedent, save for when the Webbs both ordered drinks at the casino bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 14 - 17, 22, 24 - 26. The two attended dinner at 9:30 p.m., where Decedent, who was inebriated, did not slur his words or stumble. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 20; Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 20. But less than an hour later at the casino bar, Decedent fell off his barstool after a round of drinks. Def.'s Facts\n   \u00b6 23; Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 75. Parties dispute the reason for Decedent's fall, and whether the bartender acted appropriately after the fall or was warned to cease serving Decedent drinks. At 11:43 p.m., roughly an hour after the fall, Plaintiff signed off on what would be a final round of drinks for herself and Decedent. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After midnight, Plaintiff and the Howes went to the ship's nightclub as Decedent stayed behind to finish his cigarette.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Decedent never arrived at the nightclub, however.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30 - 36. Instead, he entered his cabin alone at 12:28 a.m., and ultimately stepped out onto the cabin balcony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 - 38. Around 1:00 a.m., Decedent fell off the balcony onto the lower deck, resulting in his death. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 41; Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 64. Parties dispute Decedent's blood alcohol content at the time of his death, and Plaintiff's and the Howes' level of concern for Decedent's well-being before his fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carnival's alcohol servers and bartenders are required to undergo alcohol service training. Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 42. The training dictates that their employees (1) never serve an obviously intoxicated guest, (2) offer water to guests who have had multiple drinks, (3) contact their manager when an employee is unsure of what to do, and (4) use a so-called \"Traffic Light System\" to gauge a guest's potential intoxication level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 53. To that end, employees are trained to observe guests' behaviors and actions in order to assess their intoxication levels.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45 - 51. Bartenders and servers must stop serving guests alcohol if they sway, stagger, or slur their speech.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. In those types of situations, an employee is trained to inform the guest that the employee will not serve the guest alcohol, provide the guest a glass of water, inform the employee's manager and security of the matter, and keep the guest in place before security may arrive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. In cases of extreme intoxication, the Chief Security Officer may lead the guest to their cabin, and possibly surveil the guest for at least an hour thereafter as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The passenger has the burden to prove that \"(1) the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular injury; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach actually and proximately caused the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaparro v.

For over service of alcohol cases, the facts must show \"that a reasonable defendant would have been on notice of the impending danger to the plaintiff.... Accordingly, the intoxicated passenger's behavior is relevant to the determination that Defendant ... was on notice of the danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205512347\">\n    2012 WL 5512347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Mere notice that a passenger is intoxicated, however, may not always be sufficient to put a defendant on notice that the passenger is in serious danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Fla. Nov. 14, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, the parties clamor over whether Carnival had sufficient notice of Decedent's intoxication. For Plaintiff's part, she and the Howes attest to Decedent's visible signs of intoxication in portions of their depositions. In addition, Carnival's training for servers and bartenders requires them to observe behavioral signs of intoxication, which, Plaintiff argues, should have alerted employees to Decedent's condition. In particular, Decedent's fall from his barstool could have alerted the bartender to execute Carnival's protocol for heavily intoxicated guests. On the other hand, as Carnival contends, Plaintiff may have been better situated to appreciate Decedent's condition, given that they spent the entire trip together and Plaintiff was aware of Decedent's drinking habits. Her buying another round of drinks after\n   Decedent fell from his barstool, or leaving Decedent alone at the end of the night, may illustrate how little Plaintiff perceived Decedent's drinking as a danger. What is more, Plaintiff ordered and signed off on most rounds of drinks throughout the day for both herself and Decedent, possibly impeding Carnival employees from observing Decedent more closely before his death. Taken together, the notice issue is a fact-intensive inquiry that a jury should resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Carnival alternatively argues that its duty of reasonable care was discharged once Decedent returned to his cabin, and that imputing liability for his death based on any alleged over service of alcohol is unreasonable. To support its position, Carnival cites to cases and laws that limit liability for alcohol purveyors in non-maritime settings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 41 at 12 - 13 (citing two state law cases where alcohol purveyors were not liable for decedents' deaths), 79 at 6 - 7 (citing to dram shop liability laws). These cases and laws are of little utility in a general maritime law case like this one. For one, general principles of negligence in maritime cases preempt state laws governing alcohol purveyors, such as dram shop liability laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205512347\">\n    2012 WL 5512347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Further, even accepting Carnival could have discharged its duty in this situation, it is unclear whether it did so. In fact, it is possible Carnival violated its policies for handling highly intoxicated individuals when it did not monitor Decedent after his last drink and when he exited to his cabin alone. Without more undisputed evidence over Carnival's actions in response to Decedent's intoxication, issues over dischargeability and foreseeability are best reserved for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
