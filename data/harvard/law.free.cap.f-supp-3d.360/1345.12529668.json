A.\n    <em>\n     The Accident Aboard the Carnival\n     <em>\n      Liberty\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, Elizabeth Amy, brings this one-count\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   negligence action on behalf of her minor daughter, W.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   W.A. was three years old at the time of the subject accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 13, 2016, several members of the Amy family boarded the Carnival\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   , a cruise ship operated by Defendant Carnival Corporation (\"Carnival\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The family members on the\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   included W.A., her father Wade Amy, her mother Elizabeth Amy, her grandmother Earlene, and her five siblings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The family, including W.A., went to the\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   's Deck 14 for the bon voyage send-off party as the ship left the port to begin the cruise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elizabeth Amy watched the female children, including\n   W.A., while Wade Amy watched their male children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The female Amys posed for some photos, and then walked over to join their male counterparts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ten to fifteen seconds later, W.A. fell-either over the top of the railing, or through the lower courses\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the railing-to the deck below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   W.A. sustained,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a skull fracture, impact to her brain, and bleeding inside her skull.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the fall, Wade Amy had been showing the children (including W.A.) the nearby Coast Guard vessels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He saw his daughter fall out of the corner of his eye, to the left of him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Amy would have immediately prevented W.A. from climbing the railing if he had been watching her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Amy did not see W.A. climb on the railing, nor go through or over the railing, nor fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Subject Railings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The railing's horizontal courses were 200 millimeters,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 7.87 inches, apart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The railing's overall height was 43.3 inches tall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carnival had knowledge of these dimensions prior to the incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The general purpose for the location of the railing on the ship was to prevent someone from falling on the deck below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   (including its railings) was built by the Fincantieri company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carnival, as the owner and purchaser of the ship, had at least some degree of control over the fit and finish of the ship, including what the guard rails would look like.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presumably, if Carnival had told Fincantieri that it wanted its guard rail to have some climb protection built into it or had demanded that the space between the courses be four inches instead of seven or eight inches, Fincantieri would have complied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Carnival's general purpose for its guard rails includes \"being efficient to contain humans\"-including small children-\"on one side from getting to the other side.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally speaking, Carnival concedes that \"to have a guard rail that for whatever reason would not be efficient to contain foreseeable human beings on one side, and not allow them to get to the other side...would be dangerous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, generally,\n   Carnival knows that if a guard rail \"has sufficient space between the lower intermediate railings,\" and if a small human being \"were permitted to climb or crawl,\" that small human being \"in theory...could get through there, if he or she wants to.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carnival has always wanted to have \"enough\" lower rails on its guard rails to contain children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Carnival itself had never, prior to the incident, researched how narrow the spaces between the balusters needed to be to prevent a child passing through.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Carnival's understanding was that \"any guard rail\" (including one with plexiglass) \"is climbable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Carnival's corporate representative, Suzanne Vazquez, testified that Carnival was unaware of a single allegation of a child going through the courses on a railing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that in her 14 years with the company, 55 million passengers had sailed with Carnival, and W.A. was the first person ever alleged to have fallen through the courses of a railing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, she also testified that \"clearly it's easy to assume that a child has tried to climb on the guard rails on any cruise ship,\" including Carnival ships.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Vazquez testified that, if somehow a child were to go through or over the subject guard rail, it was obvious that the child could be injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   But prior to the suit, she had never received any actual allegations that the subject courses were in fact wide enough to allow a toddler or small child to get through.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, Ms. Vazquez testified that its fleet-wide databases do not contain any record of complaints of children falling (or almost falling) through or over railings for the three years before W.A.'s fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the databases do not (indeed, could not) capture unreported attempts by children to either climb or get through open courses on Carnival ships,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"near misses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Carnival does not know how many kids have actually attempted to climb or crawl through or over its railings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Industry Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The requirements for the railing's dimensions are governed at least in part by the Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the International Convention on Load Lines (\"ICLL\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ICLL was promulgated by the International Maritime Organization, which also created the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea's requirements are binding on cruise vessels like the\n   <em>\n    Liberty.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both of these authorities address specifications for railings. The Cruise Vessel\n   Safety and Security Act provides that cruise ships \"shall be equipped with railings that are located not less than 42 inches above the cabin deck.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regulation 25 to the ICLL states that railings must be one meter high,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 39.37 inches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rail must have a minimum of three courses, with the lowest course opening not more than 230 millimeters,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 9.05 inches, and the remaining courses not more than 380 millimeters,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 149.96 inches apart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the Code of Federal Regulations provides that all passenger vessels shall have guard rails at least 39 \u00bd inches from the deck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rail must have a minimum of three courses, with the lowest course opening not more than nine inches, and the remaining courses not more than 15 inches apart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lloyd's Register, a classification society, confirmed that the\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   's railings, including its height and courses, complied with the \"applicable requirements of ICLL 1966 and 2005 consolidated edition Reg. 25\" as well as the \"additional minimum requirements\" as set forth in \u00a7 1 of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2072.40\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 72.40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The classification society issued Carnival a certification of same regarding the\n   <em>\n    Liberty\n   </em>\n   's railings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff accepts that the foregoing authorities say what Carnival says they say. But Plaintiff disputes that these \"requirements\" \"include or preclude\" (1) openings in guardrail courses that are 4 inches or less, (2) utilizing solid, clear panels in lieu of guardrails with open courses, or (3) slanting barriers back toward potential climbers to deter climbing by small children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   To that end, Plaintiff points to two additional industry standards: (1) the International Building Code (\"IBC\") and (2) NFPA-301, promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 16-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The IBC is a building code, consisting of regulations and standards for land based buildings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, the IBC \u00a7 1003.2.12.2 provides that open guards \"shall have balusters or ornamental patterns such that a four-inch diameter sphere cannot pass through any opening,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 17, though this portion of the IBC document is not part of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   NFPA-301 is the \"Code for Safety to Life from Fire on Merchant Vessels.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides in pertinent part that open guards \"shall have intermediate rails or an ornamental pattern such that a sphere 10 cm (3.9 in.) in diameter cannot pass through any opening.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the NFPA disclaims any legally binding effect of NFPA-301: NFPA documents \"are developed through a consensus standards development process\"; the NFPA \"has no power, nor does it undertake, to police or enforce compliance with the contents of NFPA Documents. Nor does the NFPA list, certify, test, or inspect products, designs, or installations for compliance with this document.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NFPA urges readers of NFPA-301 to \"consult applicable\n   federal, state, and local laws and regulations. NFPA does not, by the publication of its codes, standards, recommended practices, and guides, intend to urge action that is not in compliance with applicable laws.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Disney\n     <em>\n      Wonder\n     </em>\n     , Built by the Same Shipbuilder as the\n     <em>\n      Liberty\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff also deposed Corynne E.
