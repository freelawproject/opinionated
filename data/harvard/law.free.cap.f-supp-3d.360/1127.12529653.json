Mr. Bastide-Hernandez requests the Court dismiss the Indictment filed on August 14, 2018, charging him with illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1326. ECF No. 1. The Court held a hearing on December 14, 2018. Paul Shelton appeared on behalf of Defendant, who was present in the courtroom, and Richard Burson appeared on behalf of the Government.

Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ; a statute (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and regulations passed pursuant to congressionally delegated authority (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Bastide-Hernandez seeks to dismiss the Indictment alleging one count of illegal reentry into the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   due to the Government's failure to support an element of that crime-a previous denial of admission, or an exclusion, deportation, or removal order. While Mr. Bastide-Hernandez was removed on December 17, 2010, he now alleges that the removal order is void for lack of jurisdiction, and incapable of serving as an element of the instant offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Many of the underlying facts are disputed. The various agencies involved in Mr. Bastide-Hernandez' removal proceedings repeatedly ignored or contravened the statutory or regulatory procedures for those procedures, making the record difficult to unravel. However, the agreed-upon facts establish that Mr. Bastide-Hernandez is entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Bastide-Hernandez is alleged to be a Mexican citizen, who first entered the United States in 1996. He was granted a voluntary departure to Mexico in 1999, and two more in 2004. On April 26, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") elected to pursue removal proceedings, and personally served Mr. Bastide-Hernandez with a document titled \"Notice to Appear.\" A second document, also titled \"Notice to Appear,\" was allegedly served upon Mr. Bastide-Hernandez on the same day, updating his address as the immigration detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, ECF No. 26-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both documents included a Certificate of Service, which includes the averment that Mr. Bastide-Hernandez \"was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his or her hearing.\" In both instances, that averment was not true. For while both documents ordered Mr. Bastide-Hernandez to appear before an immigration judge in Seattle, Washington, the time of that hearing was listed as \"a date to be set at a time to be set.\" The second putative Notice to Appear was sent to the Executive Office for Immigration Review on May 2, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The immigration court, and not DSHS, sent a second document, titled a \"Notice of Hearing,\" to Mr. Bastide-Hernandez. ECF No. 26-4. That document appears to have been to the custodial officers at the ICE detention center via fax, because that method of delivery was handwritten at the bottom of the document instead of either of the listed forms of service: personal service or service by mail. Mr. Bastide-Hernandez does not concede receipt of this document. The notice of hearing stated that a master hearing in the removal proceeding had been set for June 14, 2006, at 1:00 P.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A removal order issued from that hearing, and as with the notice of hearing, a handwritten notation at the bottom of the order indicates that it was served via fax to the custodial officers for Mr. Bastide-Hernandez. Based upon that form of service, Mr. Bastide-Hernandez appears not to have been physically present at the removal proceeding. The Government infers that he may have been present through video-teleconferencing, although Mr. Bastide-Hernandez does not concede that he was present at that hearing, through video-teleconferencing or otherwise. Nor does Mr. Bastide-Hernandez concede receipt of that removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The 2006 removal order was reinstated and used as the basis for three subsequent removals, however, it remains the only removal order capable of serving as a predicate element for the instant offense. On May 25, 2018, Mr. Bastide-Hernandez again came into contact with immigration officials and was charged with illegal reentry three months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Bastide-Hernandez argues that the Government cannot show that a prior removal order was issued because based on the regulations governing immigration hearings, the 2006 immigration court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to render its order. Thus, Mr. Bastide-Hernandez moves this court to dismiss the indictment. The Government contends that the immigration court did have jurisdiction to issue the 2006 removal order, and even if it didn't,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) bars Mr. Bastide-Hernandez from collaterally challenging the validity of the 2006 removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The 2006 Immigration Court Lacked Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An initial explanation of the relevant statutory, regulatory, and decisional authority may provide clarity regarding this Court's decision. The Attorney General has the authority to define, by regulation, the jurisdiction of immigration courts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). The Parties agree that the relevant regulation governing the jurisdiction of immigration courts for removal proceedings is 8 C.F.R. 1003.14. That regulation requires a \"charging document\" to be \"filed with the Immigration Court\" by the \"Service\" (the Immigration and Naturalization Service, now Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE.) 8 C.F.R. 1003.14(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A \"charging document\" is defined by regulation to mean a \"Notice to Appear, a Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, [or] a Notice of Intention to Rescind and Request for Hearing by Alien.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   held that based on the clear language of that statute, \"when the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere in the statutory section, including as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \u00a7 1229(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the non-citizen sought an adjustment of status based upon the accrual of ten years of continuous presence in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 2110. Because\n   the petitioner had been served with a putative notice to appear, the Government argued that his term of continuous presence ended, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)'s \"stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In an 8-1 opinion, the Supreme Court held that \"[a] notice that does not inform a noncitizen when and where to appear for removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a),' \" and thus, the stop-time rule was not triggered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Bastide-Hernandez argues that under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , no \"charging document\" was filed because the Notice to Appear filed with the immigration court did not include date-and-time information. Thus, he argues, the immigration court was never vested with jurisdiction. The Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    (A) Pereira's Interpretation Applies Outside of the Stop-Time Rule Context\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding should be limited to the stop-time rule context, alleging first that the Supreme Court expressly narrowed its holding to the stop-time context, and second that the remedy granted impliedly shows that the Supreme Court could not have intended to create the rule that a defective notice to appear deprives an immigration court of jurisdiction. This Court disagrees, and holds it is bound by\n   <em>\n    Pereira.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   took care to describe the contours of its holding. It noted that the question presented by the petitioner swept in all the requirements listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), but that the notice to appear included all of the information required except for the time requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i).\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Supreme Court expressly reserved for another day the determination of whether a putative notice to appear that omits other information listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) may nonetheless satisfy the statutory requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , n.5. Having thus narrowed the scope of the question presented to only the time and place requirement, the Court held that a \"document that fails to include such information is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a) ', and thus does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 2118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding is narrow in that it only addresses date and time information, it operates as a firm and clear syllogism. The first clause (\" 'A putative ... 1229(a)' \") interprets \u00a7 1229(a), and the second clause (\"and thus ... stop-time rule\") constructs \u00a7 1229(b)(d)(1). While the construction of the stop-time rule does not apply to this case, the interpretation of the definition of a notice to appear does, and is binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MK Hillside Partners v.

The Government argues that the Supreme Court would not have remanded the matter to the immigration court unless it impliedly held that the immigration court had jurisdiction. The Supreme Court did not reach the issue of jurisdiction because neither party raised it.

It lacks the parenthetical phrase \"(in this section referred to as a 'notice to appear')\" which the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   court held was \"quintessential definitional language.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, by its own terms, it is an additional list of \"administrative\n   information\" required to be given to the immigration court. This includes some items, such as the noncitizen's registration number, alleged nationality and citizenship, and the language that the noncitizen understands, which are not required by the statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Thus, this regulation does not define a second class of Notice to Appear, but instead provides a list of additional pieces of information that the Service is required to provide the immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In practice, this is made clear. The Notice to Appear that is served upon noncitizens is Form I-862, the same form that is filed with the immigration court.
