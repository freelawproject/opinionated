The magistrate judge recommends that the summary judgment motion be granted and the two pending evidentiary motions be denied as moot. Plaintiff Golden Spread Cooperative, Inc. (\"Golden Spread\") filed objections to the findings, conclusions, and recommendation on December 3, 2018, which intervenor Westport Insurance Company (\"Westport\") joined the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After making an independent review of the pleadings, files, and records in this case, the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the objections of Golden Spread and Westport, and Emerson's December 17, 2018 response to the objections, the court concludes that the conclusions and recommendation are correct. It is therefore ordered that the objections are overruled, the conclusions and recommendation of the magistrate judge are adopted, and Emerson's April 16, 2018 motion for summary judgment against Golden Spread and Westport is granted. The motion in\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   and motion to exclude expert testimony are denied without prejudice as moot.

GORDON BRYANT, JR., UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to a Standing Order of Reference, this case has been referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for pretrial management, including decisions as to non-dispositive matters and making findings and recommendations as to dispositive matters. ECF No. 74. This case, removed from state court on diversity jurisdiction, arises out of a contract in which Defendant Emerson Process Management Power &amp; Water Solutions, Inc. (Emerson) agreed to replace the distributed control system (DCS) for a steam turbine at Plaintiff Golden Spread Electric Cooperative, Inc.'s (GSEC) power station. Emerson now moves for summary judgment on GSEC's contract (breach of contract and express warranty) and tort (negligence and strict liability) claims for damages allegedly sustained by the steam turbine as a result of defects in the DCS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Emerson Process Management Power &amp; Water Solutions, Inc.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 71) [hereinafter Def.'s Mot. Summ. J.]. For the reasons that follow, the undersigned recommends that the District Judge\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Emerson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GSEC operates Mustang Station Power Plant (Mustang Station), a consumer-owned power plant located near Denver City, Texas. Mustang Station became operational in 2000, and has multiple generators capable of producing a combined 958 megawatts of power. App. to Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., at 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 78) [hereinafter Pl. App.]. This litigation centers on one of those generators-an Alstom steam-turbine generator known as Unit 3-and a control system designed by Emerson. GSEC purchased Unit 3 from Alstom and installed it in the Mustang Station during 1999-2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2013, GSEC solicited proposals to replace Unit 3's DCS, and Emerson submitted the winning bid. Def. Emerson's Br. in Supp. of its Mot. Summ. J., at 8 (ECF No. 72) [hereinafter Def.'s Br.]; Pl.'s Br. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., at 6-7 (ECF No. 77) [hereinafter Pl.'s Resp.]. GSEC and Emerson subsequently negotiated and executed a contract that required Emerson to design, develop, program, and install the new DCS for Unit 3. Pl. App., at 2. The DCS is \"the necessary means for operation and control of the steam turbine's integrated subsystems\" and includes \"computer hardware, software and associated equipment.\" App. to Def. Mot. Summ. J., at 2 (Decl. of Glen Wagner) (ECF No. 73) [hereinafter Def. App.]. Specifically, the executed contract requires, in part, that Emerson provide \"control solutions that will target and analyze specific processes in Golden Spread's Mustang Station, determining optimal operating conditions and offering tremendous cost savings to Golden Spread's Mustang Station facility.\" Pl.'s First Am. Compl., at 3 (ECF No. 36). The contract encompassing the parties' agreement consists of four parts, numbered in their \"order of precedence\" for interpretation: (1) Cover Letter; (2) Proposal; (3) License Agreement; and (4) Terms and Conditions. Def. App., at 290.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During Emerson's testing and commissioning of the new DCS, Mustang Station lost power and Unit 3 tripped offline. Pl. App., at 2; Def.'s Br., at 9; Pl.'s Br., at 7. As Unit 3 coasted to a stop, the lube-oil system failed to remain engaged, causing the turbine to overheat and suffer extensive friction damage. Def.'s Br., at 9; Pl.'s Br., at 7. Investigation after the incident revealed that the new DCS created and installed by Emerson for Unit 3 contained a logic error in the software that caused the lube-oil system to prematurely shut off during the turbine roll-down. Def.'s Br., at 9; Pl.'s Br., at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the incident, and pursuant to the parties' agreement, GSEC submitted a warranty claim to Emerson. Def.'s Br., at 9-10. Emerson completed modifications to the DCS software, which GSEC subsequently approved, and GSEC returned Unit 3 to service. Def. App., at 2-3 \u00b6 11 (Decl. of Glen Wagner). Emerson performed this warranty work at no charge to GSEC. Joint Stipulation of Facts, at 1 (ECF No. 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   GSEC and Westport Insurance Company\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this suit in an attempt to recover for the damages sustained by Unit 3 due to Emerson's alleged improper design, development, programming, and installation of the replacement DCS. Pl.'s First Am. Compl., at 4-12. They seek $ 8,352,996.94 in damages for steam turbine repair costs caused by the lack of lubrication following the power failure. GSEC's Amended Complaint alleges claims for breach of contract, breach of express warranty, negligence, and strict product liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Emerson moves for summary judgment as to all claims. Def.'s Br., at 10-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Emerson contends that GSEC's breach of contract and warranty claims fail as a matter of law because the parties' negotiated contract unambiguously provides that GSEC's sole and exclusive remedy is for Emerson to either correct any nonconformity or defect or, if impracticable, to refund the purchase price. Def.'s Br., at 11-13; Def. Emerson's Reply Br. in Supp. M. Summ. J., at 5-10 (ECF No. 83) [hereinafter Def.'s Reply]. Emerson further asserts that Texas's economic loss doctrine bars GSEC's tort claims as a matter of law. Def.'s Br., at 13-19; Def.'s Reply, at 10-15. Emerson also proffers alternative theories for granting partial or full summary judgment, arguing the parties contracted for a disclaimer of consequential or incidental damages arising from either contract or tort claims, and a total damage cap equal to the greater of the defective item's purchase price or $ 2.5 million. Def.'s Br., at 19-22; Def.'s Reply, at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response, GSEC argues that Emerson misinterprets the terms of the contract, and that the Limited Warranty provisions cited by Emerson are not the sole and exclusive contractual remedies available. Pl.'s Br., at 10-13. In addition, GSEC contends the economic loss doctrine does not preclude recovery in this case because it bargained for the new DCS separately from the original turbine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-22. GSEC further asserts that the damage to Unit 3 was not consequential, but instead direct and foreseeable damage not limited by the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24. Lastly, GSEC claims that the damages cap in the contract does not cover or apply to their claim for attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Summary judgment is required when 'the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Trent v.

Tex. Local Civil Rule 56.3(a) (emphasis added). The rule further provides that the party may satisfy this requirement \"by stating in its motion that each of the required matters will be set forth in the party's brief.\" Local Rule 56.3(b). Emerson followed the latter course, referring the court to its brief for a summary of the grounds upon which it seeks summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., at 1;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Def.'s Br., at 11-21. While not a model of clarity, and certainly not \"stat[ing] concisely the\n   <em>\n    elements of each claim or defense\n   </em>\n   as to which summary judgment is sought,\" the court gleans the following from Emerson's motion and brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because neither the motion nor brief identifies, much less examines, any summary judgment proof concerning the essential elements of GSEC's claim for breach of express warranty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court presumes Emerson does not seek judgment by either affirmatively showing the nonmovant's inability to establish such material facts or \"merely demonstrat[ing] an absence of evidentiary support in the record\" as to the warranty claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843958\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/211/#p213\">\n    660 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It does appear, however, that Emerson seeks summary judgment as to GSEC's contract, express warranty, negligence, and strict product liability claims as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. GSEC's breach of contract claim, as a general proposition, is subsumed within its express warranty claim by operation of Texas law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. Warranty and remedy limitations negotiated by the parties in the written contract bar GSEC's breach of express warranty claim;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. The economic loss rule bars tort claims for damage to the steam turbine because the DCS is an \"integrated component\" and the turbine therefore does not constitute \"other property\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. Even if the turbine qualifies as \"other property\" under the economic loss rule, its repair costs would be unrecoverable \"consequential damages\" or, if recoverable, subject to the contract's damage cap.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br., at 6-8, 12 n.3. The court examines each claim as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Summary Judgment Record Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although GSEC asserts four separate causes of action, i.e., breach of contract, breach of express warranty, negligence, and product liability, its claims boil down to two common issues: did the DCS provided by Emerson contain a defect that caused damage to the Unit 3 turbine and, if so, what remedies, if any, does the parties' contract provide for such defect and the resulting damages? Before the court can properly evaluate Emerson's motion, it must first identify the summary judgment evidence in the record concerning these two questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As to the parties' negotiated agreement, both parties have submitted verified copies of the final version of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 289-382; Pl.'s First Am. Compl., Ex. A, at 1-94 (ECF No. 37-1). While the parties clearly have differing interpretations of the contract, there appears to be no dispute over what documents\n   actually make up the contract or the relevant language contained therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Regarding the incident itself, from the court's review of the parties' summary judgment filings (including the motion and supporting brief, response, and reply, all exhibits and appendices attached thereto, and the parties' joint stipulation), the parties agree factually as to what occurred-they simply disagree as to the resulting legal consequence. Apparently due to this lack of factual dispute, however, neither GSEC nor Emerson offers much in the way of traditional Rule 56 summary judgment proof-affidavits, deposition testimony, etc.-specifically identifying the cause of the injury alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Identifying the defect causing the damages sought by GSEC is significant because the contract contains different language for defects related to Goods and Services and those associated with Software and, as argued by GSEC, potentially provides differing remedies for each. Because few, if any, of either party's factual recitations in the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) briefing concerning the specific cause of the DCS's failure and the resulting damage are submitted as sworn testimony, the court must consider the legal impact, if any, of the parties' unsworn factual statements contained in their MSJ briefs, as well as GSEC's factual allegations set forth in its First Amended Complaint (FAC), in determining whether to grant or deny Emerson's motion for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the court believes it can consider the following as admissible summary judgment evidence for the purpose of evaluating Emerson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, a court may rely on judicial admissions contained in an opponent's response to a motion for summary judgment in deciding whether disputed fact issues exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City Nat'l Bank v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538648\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/536/#p544\">\n    907 F.2d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (5th Cir. 1990) (refusing to treat as a \"binding judicial admission\" a misstatement in appellate brief addressing whether substantial evidence supports a jury verdict, noting that such a circumstance \"is unlike admissions of fact in a summary judgment brief used to determine whether or not there is a genuine issue of material fact\"); 10A Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2723 (4th ed. supp. 2018) (\"[A]dmissions in the brief of the party opposing the motion may be used in determining that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, since they are functionally equivalent to 'admissions,' which are expressly mentioned in Rule 56(c)(1)(A)....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) (\"A party asserting that a fact cannot be ... genuinely disputed must support the assertion by ... citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including ... admissions ....\"). Second, following the same rationale, the Fifth Circuit has also stated that it \"see[s] no reason why, for purposes of resolution of [a] motion for summary judgment,\" courts \"cannot treat the factual allegations of the complaint as admissions or\n   stipulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Isquith ex rel.

The court need look no further than GSEC's response to Emerson's motion to confirm this.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Br., at 7 (\"Investigation ... revealed the newly-purchased and installed DCS contained a logic error\"), 11 (\"[T]he instant dispute resulted from a defect in the DCS software.\"), 23 (\"This list has no connection to direct property damage to the turbine occurring\n   <em>\n    as a result of Emerson's faulty DCS logic\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). Emerson, at least for purposes of its motion, concurs in GSEC's assessment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Br., at 9 (\"[T]he lube oil system failed to remain engaged because of a flaw in the programming of the steam turbine DCS\"); Def.'s Reply, at 9 (\"Golden Spread even acknowledges that its claims are for a defect in the control logic software....\"). Further examination of GSEC's live complaint removes any doubt as to what GSEC contends caused the damages it seeks to recover herein.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Am. Compl., at 8 \u00b6 20 (\"The DCS logic implemented by Emerson and controlling the lube oil system was defective in that it caused the lube oil system to fail to engage, resulting in overheating and friction damage to the steam turbine.\"), 9 \u00b6 25 (\"The DCS control logic programmed by Emerson was defective. A detailed review of the logic that Emerson installed in the DCS at the time of the event reveals an incorrect logic loop.\"), 11 \u00b6 29 (\"The DCS logic implemented by Emerson and controlling the lube oil system was defective in that it caused the lube oil system to fail to engage, resulting in overheating and friction damage to the steam turbine.\"). GSEC also provides testimony that meets the requirements of Rule 56(c)(4) through an affidavit from an engineering expert, attached to its FAC as Exhibit A, wherein he opines that \"a detail review of the logic that Emerson had installed, in their DCS, at the time of the event shows incorrect control logic existed,\" which \"directly contributed to the Mustang Station Steam Turbine damage.\" Pl.'s Am. Compl., Ex. A, at 2-3 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12. In sum, the court finds that the summary judgment record firmly establishes that a \"logic error\" in the software of the DCS caused the alleged damages in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Considering the foregoing, the summary judgment evidence also clearly proves GSEC accepted the DCS unit upon delivery, incorporating it into the Unit 3 turbine and then seeking repair or modification to the DCS unit when defects in the software surfaced (as opposed to returning it or revoking the acceptance). The undisputed evidence also demonstrates, as a general proposition, that once notified of\n   the software issue, Emerson remedied the defect to GSEC's apparent satisfaction and at no cost to GSEC. Specifically, GSEC submitted a written \"warranty demand for the failure of the control system installed by Emerson at Mustang Station pursuant to the Software License Agreement and Paragraph 5(e) of the Terms and Conditions of Sale ....\" Def. App., at 5-6 (email from GSEC Chief Operating Officer (COO) J. Jolly Hayden, dated Apr. 14, 2015); Joint Stipulation of Facts, at 1. In response, Emerson worked with GSEC to remedy the defect by modifying the software, with no charge to GSEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 2-3 \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Am. Compl., Ex.

Many changes were made including the removal of the faulty Auto Stopping Logic for the EM DC Pump.\"); Joint Stipulation of Facts, at 1. GSEC approved the modifications, then put Unit 3 back into service. Def. App., at 3. The court finds no evidence in the record showing GSEC disputes that Emerson remedied the DCS's defective software in accordance with the contract; instead, it contends that the contract, rather than providing an exclusive repair remedy, also authorizes recovery by GSEC for damage caused to the turbine as a result of the software defect. Pl.'s Resp., at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court will examine the parties' contractual bargain within the foregoing factual framework and determine the legal effect of the agreement as to GSEC's various claims against Emerson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Rather than rejecting the DCS or revoking its acceptance, GSEC submitted a warranty claim to Emerson, and Emerson repaired the defect in the DCS. The undisputed summary judgment evidence before the court establishes that the basis of GSECs contract claim is the allegedly defective DCS it accepted and had installed on Unit 3. Because GSEC accepted the DCS, it cannot maintain a breach of contract action and is limited to only a warranty claim. As a result, the undersigned recommends that the district judge grant summary judgment in favor of Emerson for GSEC's breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orthoflex, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204045206\">\n    2013 WL 4045206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (granting summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs breach of contract action where it had accepted the products).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Def.'s Br., at 12. GSEC argues in response that while Emerson did repair or reprogram the DCS software, other language in the contract reflects the parties' intent to not limit GSEC to that sole remedy for a breach of the express warranty. Pl.'s Resp., at 10-13. The court agrees that Emerson fulfilled its obligation under the specific provision cited for remedying defects in the DCS unit's software. As previously outlined, the undisputed summary judgment evidence establishes that GSEC submitted a written \"warranty demand for the failure of the control system installed by Emerson at Mustang Station pursuant to the Software License Agreement and Paragraph 5(e) of the Terms and Conditions of Sale....\" Def. App., at 5-6 (email from GSEC COO J. Jolly Hayden, dated April 14, 2015); Joint Stipulation of Parties, at 1. In response, Emerson worked with GSEC to remedy the defect by modifying the software at Emerson's expense; GSEC approved the modifications and put Unit 3 back into service. Def.

Interpretation of the parties' intent as expressed in the Limitation of Remedies' exclusivity clause therefore stands or falls solely on the language contained therein, as construed in conjunction with the entirety of the contract. As a result, the court will next examine GSEC's arguments in regard to language of the contract itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   GSEC contends initially that (1) the Limited Warranty section (Section 5) of the Terms and Conditions (goods and services), specifically 5(h),\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   operates only as a disclaimer of additional warranties for\n   goods and services, not as a proscription against all claims for property damage and, apparently in the alternative,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Section 5's limited warranty language has no bearing on GSEC's claim because it specifically excludes claims based on defective software. Pl.'s Resp., at 11. GSEC also makes a related argument concerning language in the License Agreement, asserting that its terms pertaining to software only waive additional warranties of fitness and merchantability and do not constitute a disclaimer of any other claim or cause of action GSEC may have related to defective software.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. In support of this construction, GSEC refers to the License Agreement's language specifying that \"the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6 of the Terms and Conditions,\" and that Section 6's damages cap (limiting each party's liability to the greater of the price to buyer of the good or service provided or $ 2.5 million) would be superfluous if it did not apply to other property damage claims arising out of defective software.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Finally, GSEC claims that language in the Cover Letter, which holds the highest priority in the documents forming the contract, contains another express warranty from Emerson concerning the DCS, and that this warranty \"contains no limitations and was breached by [Emerson's] conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   GSEC's foregoing arguments focus primarily on two sections of the contract, both of which are contained in the Terms and Conditions. Essentially, GSEC seems to allege first that Section 5's language providing that the warranties and remedies contained therein \"are exclusive remedies for all claims based on defective goods (other than software ... which is covered by the Software Licensee [sic] Agreement) ... and there are no other representations or warranties of any kind,\" in no way bars its express warranty claim for damage to the turbine because the language: (1) only operates as a disclaimer of additional warranties for goods and services, not for claims of property damage; or (2) by its express terms specifically excludes from its coverage claims based on defective software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Regardless of whether the court has accurately articulated GSEC's argument in regard to Section 5's language, the court nonetheless finds that the cited provision in no way alters the outcome in this case. The contract undisputedly provides identical warranty waivers and remedy limitations for goods and services or software in the Terms and Conditions and the License Agreement, and such remedies are exclusive.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 293 (Terms and Conditions \u00b6 5(e) ) (\"If Buyer discovers any warranty defects with respect to the Goods manufactured by Seller (other than the firmware, which shall be subject to warranty claims under the Software License Agreement) or Services and notifies Seller thereof in writing during the applicable warranty period ... Seller shall (i) correct any defects ... and (ii) at Seller's option, either repair or replace that portion of the defective Good(s). If ... a defective Good manufactured by seller cannot be repaired or replaced ... Seller will refund to Buyer the purchase price ....\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 293 (Terms and Conditions \u00b6 6(A) ) ( (\"The remedies of Buyer set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement are exclusive remedies for all claims based on defective Goods (other than software, including firmware, which is covered by the Software License Agreement) or Services.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 297 (Software License Agreement) (\"[I]f Emerson is notified in writing of such nonconformity during the applicable warranty period, Emerson shall be promptly remedied [sic] such non-conformity (at its expense), by correction .... If such remedies are impracticable, Emerson shall promptly refund to [GSEC] the purchase price ....\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Def. App., at 297 (\"The warranties set forth above are the exclusive remedies with respect to any warranty claim relating to the Software and shall be in lieu of all other warranties with respect thereto ....\"). The court finds the summary judgment evidence establishes that defective software caused damage to the turbine, and such damages are necessarily covered by the License Agreement; however, even assuming coverage by the Terms and Conditions (as a good or service), the applicable language and remedy are the same: repair or refund of purchase price. Both contract sections expressly state that such remedies are exclusive for all claims based on alleged defects, and GSEC is bound by the express terms of the agreement it negotiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In an attempt to avoid this construction, GSEC points to the language contained in Section 6 of the Terms and Conditions, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   In no event, regardless of the form of the claim or cause of action (whether based in contract, infringement, negligence, strict liability, other tort or otherwise), shall either party's liability to the other party and/or its customers\n   <em>\n    with respect to any claim arising in connection with this Agreement\n   </em>\n   exceed the greater of (i) price to buyer of the specific goods manufactured or services provided by Seller giving rise to the claim or cause of action, or (ii) $ 2.5 Million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Def App., at 293 \u00b6 6(B) (Terms and Conditions) (emphasis added). GSEC submits that this provision reflects the parties' intent that the language contained in both the License Agreement (software) and the Terms and Conditions (goods and services), disclaiming any additional warranties and limiting remedies to simply repair or refund,\n   <em>\n    is not\n   </em>\n   exclusive and that the parties contemplated other causes of action or methods of recovery. Pl.'s Resp., at 12. In essence, GSEC argues this interpretation is required so as to \"harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.M. Davidson, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9258255\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/128/223/#p229\">\n    128 S.W.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stated alternatively, GSEC contends that if the contract's exclusivity provisions truly limit it to only repair or refund for defects in the DCS, such a construction renders the cap language superfluous and therefore does not give meaning to all provisions of the contract. GSEC correctly states the legal principle, but the court disagrees with its application and conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As previously noted, the court must give effect to the parties' intent as expressed in the plain language of the contract taken as a whole. Here, the court has found that the summary judgment proof establishes a defect in the DCS software, and that the terms of the License Agreement provide an exclusive remedy of repair or refund of the purchase money, which Emerson has fulfilled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The License Agreement's language stating that \"the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6 of the Terms and Conditions\" (which obviously\n   include the language of 6(B) ) requires no different result. GSEC's argument presumes the only conceivable legal dispute that could arise in connection with the parties' contract is one involving defective DCS software; if true, such a scenario would admittedly render the damage cap language superfluous. This interpretation, however, assumes too much. If claims or disputes could arise \"in connection with [the] Agreement\"\n   <em>\n    separate and apart from alleged defects in the DCS software\n   </em>\n   , the damage or cap limit of Section 6(B) can still be given legal effect in harmony with the contract's exclusive remedy provisions related to the software. Emerson cites three examples in its Reply where Section 6(B)'s limits would otherwise come into play: (1) breach of contract in the event Emerson failed to deliver the control system; (2) damage caused by Emerson personnel while on GSEC's property during installation of the control system; and (3) Emerson's breach of the contract's confidentiality clause. Def.'s Reply, at 6. The court does not believe this list to be exhaustive, but it is sufficient to make the point-the contract's general damage cap or limit can still have legal effect and import while being construed in harmony with the parties' expressed intent to exclusively limit available remedies for defects in the DCS software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This conclusion also aligns with the \"fundamental axiom of contract interpretation that specific provisions control general provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Baton Rouge Oil &amp; Chem.

Pro Team, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. Civ.A. 304CV1985M,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201131093\">\n    2005 WL 1131093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Tex. May 9, 2005) (applying foregoing principle, court found that forum selection clause in contract, which specifically addressed the cause of action asserted by plaintiff, controlled over another contractual forum clause that governed \"an array of other conflicts\");\n   <em>\n    C.A.U.S.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386602\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/268/#p275\">\n    531 S.W.3d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that in dispute over whether homeowners association could force home owners to use particular waste and recycling provider, specific provision in agreement requiring homeowners to collect or dispose of garbage at their expense controlled over general clause authorizing homeowners association to \"operate, maintain, and manage the common areas of the subdivision\" (including streets), thus entitling homeowners to judgment as a matter of law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, GSEC's argument in regard to the significance of the Cover Letter similarly fails to alter the court's conclusion. GSEC asserts that in the Cover Letter, which holds the highest precedence in the documents forming the contract, Emerson expressly warrants that through\n   the DCS replacement project it will be \"determining optimal operating controls and offering tremendous cost savings,\" and providing \"industry-specific applications, unmatched experience, and a highly skilled team of engineers.\" Pl.'s Resp., at 13 (quoting Def App., at 289 (Krecek Decl. Ex. C) ). GSEC posits that this alleged warranty \"contains no limitations and was breached by [Emerson's] conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386602\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/268/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Emerson counters by asserting that to the extent the Cover Letter creates an express warranty, it is still subject to the exclusive remedies provided in the License Agreement. Def.'s Reply, at 8-9. The court does not find GSEC's argument persuasive. Even if the Cover Letter did create an express warranty independent of the warranties in the License Agreement, the License Agreement's \"Limitations and Remedies\" section nevertheless unambiguously states that the warranties or remedies set forth therein \"are the exclusive remedies with respect\n   <em>\n    to any warranty claim relating to the Software\n   </em>\n   and shall be in lieu of all other warranties ... whether statutory, express or implied ....\" Def. App., at 297. Thus, regardless of where the warranty arises in the document, GSEC's only remedies for breach of warranty would be either to have the defect repaired or to have the purchase money refunded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In summary, Emerson is entitled to summary judgment as to GSEC's breach of contract claim because GSEC accepted the DCS rather than revoking its acceptance or returning the DCS. The parties' contract also requires entry of summary judgment as to GSEC's breach of warranty claim because the undisputed evidence shows Emerson fulfilled its warranty and remedial obligations under the express terms of the contract: it corrected, at Emerson's expense and to GSEC's satisfaction, the software defect in the DCS.

The court reasoned that such damages \"were more appropriately recovered through the UCC's thorough commercial-warranty framework\" because it protects manufacturers from \"unlimited and unforeseeable liability\" for economic losses and provides consumers the means by which they may seek redress for economic losses caused by a product defect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926939\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/557/77/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nobility Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926939\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/557/77/#p82\">\n    557 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   81-82 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Quoting at length from the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm\n   </em>\n   , the Texas Supreme Court recently reaffirmed these \"principal rationales\" for the ELR, acknowledging that while \"[e]conomic injuries may be no less important than injuries of other kinds,\" courts nevertheless \"impose tort liability for economic loss more selectively than liability for other types of harms.\"\n   <em>\n    LAN/STV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n    435 S.W.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1 cmt. c (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 1, 2012) ). Reasons for this apportionment include the potential indeterminate and disproportionate liability inherent in economic losses and the fact that risks associated with economic loss \"tend to be especially well suited to allocation by contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1 cmt. c). Further quoting the Restatement's \"well-summarized\" justification for applying the ELR, the court noted that imposition of liability \"out of proportion\" to a defendant's culpability can \"create an exaggerated pressure to avoid an activity altogether,\" and a buyer relying on a seller's words when entering a transaction \"has a full chance to consider how to manage the risks involved, whether by inspecting the item or investment, obtaining insurance against the risk of disappointment, or making a contract that assigns the risk of loss to someone else.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1 cmt. c) (recognizing that \"money is a complete remedy for an economic injury,\" whether in the form of insurance, indemnity, or some other form of replacement payment). The foregoing considerations also \"make it hard for a court to know what allocation of responsibility for economic loss\" would best serve the interests of the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   A contract that settles responsibility for such a risk will therefore be preferable in most cases to a judicial assignment of liability after harm is done. The contract will better reflect the preferences of the parties and help prevent the need for speculation and litigation later. Contracts also are governed by a body of commercial law that has been developed to address economic loss, and thus will often be better suited for that task than the law of torts. In short, contracts to manage the risk of economic loss are more often possible, and more often desirable, than contracts to manage risks of other types of injury. As a result, courts generally do not recognize tort liability for economic losses caused by the breach of a contract between the parties, and often restrict the role of tort law in other circumstances in which protection by contract is available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n    at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1 cmt. c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, the Texas Supreme Court's reasoning and analysis demonstrate a strong preference for remedying economic loss through contract rather than tort law. The cited criteria and rationale, in this court's view, encourage a finding that Texas law requires an expansive, rather than restrictive,\n   application of the ELR. An examination of other Texas cases confirms such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

As demonstrated by the court's earlier examination of relevant case law, while determining the subject of the parties' contract is a crucial question in answering whether the ELR bars a tort claim, these courts' decisions frequently turn on additional factors such as (1) integration of component parts, (2) foreseeability of the harm, and (3) UCC policy considerations undergirding the ELR. A close reading of\n   <em>\n    Grizzly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   shows that those courts recognize the foregoing criteria, thereby counseling strongly against a strict or limited reading of the \"bargained for separately\" language. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   the court acknowledged the general premise that Texas courts apply the ELR where defective component parts damage a product in the hands of (1) the final consumer or (2) a manufacturer assembling the components into a final product for resale.\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8392745\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/84/#p92\">\n    243 S.W.3d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More importantly, while noting the lack of contractual privity between the plaintiffs (home owners) and defendant (subcontractor), the court observed that plaintiffs' economic losses, i.e., damage caused to their home by defective siding, had been recovered through a judgment against the general contractor who built the home (and with whom plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have a contract), thereby fulfilling the ELR's underlying policy consideration of not disrupting risk allocations made by commercial parties in their contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8392745\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/84/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 94 &amp; n.2 (citations omitted). Similarly, the court in\n   <em>\n    Grizzly\n   </em>\n   found\n   <em>\n    Equistar\n   </em>\n   \"instructive on the issue\" of component parts and that incorporation of such parts into a larger product did not render the completed product \"other property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Grizzly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205676069\">\n    2013 WL 5676069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. In concluding the ELR barred the plaintiff's tort claims for damages caused to its helicopter by a defective engine, the court stated that \"[w]hen analyzing application of the economic loss rule, the proper inquiry is to determine whether a loss is more appropriately compensated through tort law or under the [UCC].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205676069\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   These same considerations formed the basis for other courts to apply the ELR even where the injured party bargained separately for the defective item that caused the injury. As already exhaustively detailed herein, multiple decisions applying Texas law have refused to find that an integrated product or unit, damaged by a defective component part, would qualify as \"other property\" for purposes of the ELR. The courts have applied this standard where: (1) the defective component part was already integrated into the completed product at purchase; (2) the original manufacturer or supplier provided the defective component as a replacement part after the original sale; or (3) a manufacturer contracted for and incorporated the defective component part into an integrated product or unit and subsequently sold it to customers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid Continent\n   </em>\n   , 572 S.W.2d at 312-13 (rejecting under the ELR plaintiff's strict liability claim for damage caused by airplane's defective engine, where engine was a component part of the whole product when purchased);\n   <em>\n    Equistar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9062739\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/123/584/#p587\">\n    123 S.W.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that compressor damage caused by replacement component parts (impellers) provided by the original seller did not constitute damage to other property);\n   <em>\n    TEU Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203338217\">\n    2018 WL 3338217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (holding that plaintiff's integrated exterior light fixtures sold to consumers, which were damaged by defective LED drivers supplied by defendant and installed into fixtures by plaintiff, did not amount to \"other property\" under the Texas ELR because the \"proper unit of analysis is the integrated product, not the individual components\");\n   <em>\n    Sanitarios Lamosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202405923\">\n    2005 WL 2405923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (applying Texas law, court found that toilets sold by plaintiff were the completed product, and damage to the toilet tank or toilet itself caused by defendant's defective component part did not constitute damage to \"other property\" under the ELR);\n   <em>\n    Alcan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118621\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/482/#p503\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that under Texas law, plaintiff's completed product, sold to consumers and damaged by defective component part supplied by defendant, is not \"other property\" for purposes of the ELR);\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p524\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that ELR barred plaintiff manufacturer's tort claims where defective component part damaged final integrated product sold to consumers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Similarly, these courts have also applied the ELR, even where the parties bargained separately for the defective item, where the harm ultimately sustained by the finished, integrated product was foreseeable by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alcan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118621\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/482/#p503\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that damage to panels was foreseeable and, as sophisticated entities, parties could have protected themselves through contractual provisions);\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p524\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 522-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding plastic bags constituted a component part because plaintiff \"used the plastic bags as a component in a final product\" and the parties could reasonably foresee damage to the masa).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Finally, and in this court's view most significantly, these decisions reaffirm the underlying rationale proffered by the Texas Supreme Court in adopting the ELR: losses arising from defective products that cause no personal injury or damage to other property \"tend to be especially well suited to allocation by contract\" and decisions made by the contracting parties as to how best manage the risk.\n   <em>\n    LAN/STV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927870\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/234/#p243\">\n    435 S.W.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that the Texas Supreme Court would hold that the object of the parties' bargain was a fully integrated and operating Unit 3 turbine, with the control unit (the DCS) constituting just one component of the whole functioning product. Thus, any damage to the turbine does not constitute damage to \"other property\" for which GSEC can recover in tort (negligence or strict liability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The parties bargained for a fully-functioning Unit 3 turbine.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   From the court's review of the contract, including the \"offer sheet\" or proposal from Emerson, which GSEC accepted, the DCS consists of a complex configuration of hardware (e.g., computers, servers, and LCD monitors) and various software programs integrated together that act as a \"control interface for all engagement and control functions\" of Unit 3. Def. App., at 2 \u00b6 5 (Decl. of Glen Wagner). As a result, the DCS allows GSEC to control system devices, interface with field instrumentation, initiate startup and shutdown sequencing, adjust system settings and inputs/outputs that the turbine converts into energy, and operate and control Unit 3's integrated subsystems.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203338217\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.

This complex system is integral to the function of Unit 3; without the DCS, the steam turbine cannot operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   At the time of the contract, the parties knew that the DCS was a component of Unit 3.

The court sees no reason to conclude otherwise simply because GSEC is not reselling the turbine but is instead using the completed product for its own use. Although GSEC may have purchased the Emerson DCS separately from the steam turbine, the object of its bargain was a fully-functioning Unit 3-not merely the purchase of an updated control system. Standing alone, the DCS had no use or purpose to GSEC.

Indeed, the facts of this case fit squarely within the holdings of Texas and federal courts that \"have rejected the argument that damage to a finished product caused by a defective component part constitutes damage to 'other property,' so as to permit tort recovery for damage to the finished product.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p524\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8392745\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/84/#p92\">\n    243 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   92 );\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helen of Troy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696909\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/511/703/#p722\">\n    511 F.Supp.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiff could not recover in tort for damages to finished product caused by component part);\n   <em>\n    Sanitarios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202405923\">\n    2005 WL 2405923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (same);\n   <em>\n    Equistar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9062739\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/123/584/#p587\">\n    123 S.W.3d at 589-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Alcan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11118621\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/133/482/#p503\">\n    133 F.Supp.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).
