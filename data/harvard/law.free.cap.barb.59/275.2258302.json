That while the defendant claimed to be, and was, so possessed or interested, as aforesaid, and before the commencement of this action, the plaintiff demanded of the defendant her dower in said premises as widow of said Edward A. Hieoll, deceased, and the defendant neglected and refused, and still neglects and refuses, to assign said dower to her.

The defense demurred to, amounts in effect to this: certain taxes on the property remained unpaid, the property was sold to pay such taxes, and the defendant claims under such sale, and such sale cuts off the plaintiff. To constitute such a defense, the answer must state every fact necessary to be proved on the trial, to show a valid levy and sale and lease. <em>(Blackwell on Tax </em>Titles, 501, <em>2d ed.

On the trial, every preliminary step to constitute a title must he shown. <em>(Tallman </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 <em>Comst. </em>70. <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>9 <em>Barb. </em>411. <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Follett, </em>15 <em>id. </em>343.) Among the preliminaries requisite at the times of the sales in question, were,</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">1. That assessors completed an assessment roll before August 1st, and left it with one assessor for examination by citizens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-9\">2. That a notice of completing roll was put up at three public places.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-10\">3. Meeting of assessors to review objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-11\">4; That a majority of assessors subscribed the roll, and put a certificate thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-12\">5. That assessors delivered roll to clerk of New York, who delivered it to supervisors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-13\">6. That supervisors examined and corrected the roll.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-14\">7.

That proof of service of said notices was duly filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">12. Notice of sale, and sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">13. Notice to redeem, to be published six months before expiration of two years after sale. (1 <em>R. S. </em>393. <em>Laws of </em>1823, <em>oc. </em>262. <em>Laws of </em>1843, <em>ch. </em>230.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-8\">IN. The lease is not evidence' that these acts were complied with. <em>(Beekman </em>v. <em>Bigham, </em>1 <em>Selden, </em>366. <em>Dike </em>v. Lewis, 2 <em>Barb. </em>344. <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>1 <em>Comst. </em>79; 3 <em>Denio, </em>594.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-9\">TV. After delivery of the lease, notice is to be served on occupant and person last assessed; the notice has to contain certain particulars, to be served in a specified manner, and the comptroller or clerk of arrears has to be satisfied that the notices were properly served, and give a certificate to that effect, before the lease becomes absolute. <em>(Laws of </em>1843, <em>ch. </em>230, <em>art. </em>111, <em>p. </em>327, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21, 24. <em>Laws of </em>1853, <em>chap. </em>579, <em>p. </em>1065, \u00a7 3. <em>Laws of </em>1843, <em>chap. </em>235, <em>p. </em>333, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-10\">Y. The answer is not helped by either section 161 or section 162 of the Code. <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Koezley, </em>14 <em>Abb. </em>147.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-11\">YI. An answer of new matter, to be sufficient, must contain a statement of new matter constituting a defense. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 149.) 1. The words \u201cmust contain\u201d are imperative. <em>(McKyring </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>16 <em>N. Y. </em>297.) 2. A defendant cannot give evidence of any new matter not contained in his answer. <em>(Deifendorf </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>7 <em>Barb. </em>18.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-12\">YII. The answer of new matter should state every fact which the defendant must prove on the trial, to make out a defense. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>7 <em>N. Y. </em>478. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>10 <em>id. </em>363.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-13\">YEN. If, on the trial, all the facts stated in this answer were conceded, they would not show a valid lease; and this seems conclusive against the sufficiency of the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-14\">IX. The answer does not state directly, nor indirectly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that intermediate the sale and giving the lease, any notice to redeem was given. This is a vital point; without such notice, and in due form, the lease was void.' <em>(Doughty </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>594; 1 <em>Comst. </em>79. <em>Lawrence on Tax Laws, p. </em>126.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">X. The plaintiff admits there was a sale, and admits there was no redemption, and that &amp; lease was executed; but denies there was any notice to redeem. The defendant does not say there was any such notice, but without such notice there was no power to give a lease. The law will not assume in favor of a party, anything he has not averred. <em>(Cruger </em>v. <em>Hud. River R. R., </em>12 <em>N. Y. </em>201.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">XI. The allegation in the answer, that a lease \u201c was duly executed and delivered, under their corporate seal, by the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of Xew York, according to law,\u201d applies only to the mode of executing the lease, which it is admitted was duly executed and delivered under the corporate seal, according to law; it cannot be construed as an allegation that every previous act had been performed,'necessary to authorize the mayor &amp;c. to give such a lease.'</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-8\"><em>J. H. V. Arnold, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">This is an action for dower in lands, brought under the provisions of the Revised Statutes. Such action must be brought against the actual occupant of the lands, if there be one; if the lands are not actually occupied, then it must be brought against some person exercising acts of ownership on the premises claimed, or claiming title thereto, or some interest therein, at the commencement of the suit. (2 <em>R. S. </em>312, <em>Edm. ed. Child </em>v. <em>Chappell, </em>9 <em>N. Y. </em>251. <em>Ellicott </em>v. <em>Mossier, </em>7 <em>id. </em>201. <em>Redfield </em>v. <em>Utica and Syr. R. R.

Pr. </em>31. <em>Shaver </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>558. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>53 <em>Barb. </em>155.) Even a declaration on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>defendant, that he owns the lands, if untrue, will not support the action of ejectment against him. <em>(Banyer </em>v. <em>Smpie, </em>5 <em>Hill, 48.) </em>It is not pretended by the complaint that the defendant was in actual occupation of the premises therein described. The allegation is, <em>\u201c </em>that the defendant is in possession of and claims to own the aforesaid premises or some interest therein.\u201d The defendant, by the second paragraph of her answer, puts in issue the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the defendant\u2019s possession, by the general denial. Under a general denial the defendant may show title out of the plaintiff. It is proper, however, that she should show the character and nature of the adverse possession \u25a0 claimed; or the facts relied on to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The defenses demurred to support the general denial of the defendant that she has any possession, or claims any interest individually in, or ownership of, the premises, and shows that the only interest in, or possession of, the premises she holds or claims is as administratrix of Andrew Fash, deceased, and that the suit is brought improperly against her individually, and should have been brought against her as such administratrix jointly with her co-administrator, as pleaded by the sixteenth paragraph of the answer (which is not demurred to.) The defendant cannot be brought into court and subjected to a claim for costs and damages where she has no individual interest or possession. Her interest is a joint one with her co-administrator, and is indivisible. \"Where there are two or more administrators or executors who have qualified, all must be made parties. <em>(Code </em>\u00a7 119. <em>Scrantom </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 &amp;c. Bk., </em>33 <em>Barb. </em>531. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>2 <em>Hilton, </em>522.) It is the right of a party who is' sued to require that any other person jointly liable with him shall be made defendant. <em>(Van Name </em>v. <em>Van Name, </em>23 <em>How. Pr. </em>252. <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>28 <em>Barb. </em>602.) There .is a defect of parties defendant, and such defect not appearing upon the face of the complaint, must be pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>by the defendant in the answer, in order to avail himself of the same at the trial; and he must point out in the answer all those whom he claims should be made parties defendant with him. (Code, \u00a7 144. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>2 <em>Abb. </em>351. <em>Wigand </em>v. <em>Sichel, </em>3 <em>Keyes, </em>120.) If he omits to set the plaintiff right when he has an opportunity to do so, he cannot afterwards take advantage of it. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Ins. and L. Co., </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>467.) The paragraphs of the answer demurred to, show the character of the defendant\u2019s interest and claim in the premises. They are really all, in connection with the sixteenth paragraph of the answer, which is not demurred to, one entire defense, i. e., that the suit is improperly brought against the defendant, and the facts supporting such defense. A demurrer will not lie to part of an entire defense in an answer. <em>(Cobb </em>v. <em>Frazee, </em>4 <em>How. Pr. </em>413. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>14 <em>id. </em>97.) At the worst, the matter demurred to might be redundant or irrelevant. In such case the plaintiff\u2019s remedy would be by motion to strike out, and not by demurrer. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 160. <em>Watson v.Husson, </em>1 <em>Duer, </em>242. <em>Spies </em>v. <em>Transit Co., </em>5 <em>id. </em>662. <em>Roeder </em>v. <em>Ormsby, </em>13 <em>Abb. </em>334. <em>Seeley </em>v. <em>Engel, </em>13 <em>N. Y. </em>542. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Greenin, </em>2 <em>Sand. </em>702. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>5 <em>Abb. NB. S. </em>145.) But it is submitted that there is nothing in the matter demurred to which is not proper and pertinent in support of- the allegations of non-joinder, and denial of possession, as well as tending to show title out of the plaintiff. The answer, in setting up the outstanding title under tax sales, shows a .title paramount to any claim which the plaintiff can have, at least during the pendency of the term for which the conveyance of the premises was given to Fash, which is- all that is claimed in the answer. The answer states particularly when, by whom, for what cause, and under what statutes, the taxes under which the sale was had, were <em>imposed; </em>the amount of the tax; that it remained unpaid <em>; </em>and all the facts essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tial to create the authority to <em>sell; </em>and is not open to any of the objections which were urged in the ease of <em>Carter </em>v. Koezley, (14 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>149.) It must also be borne in mind that in that ease the defendant admitted his possession of the premises, but set up title under the tax sale in himself. The allegations with reference to services of notices, fully refer to the sections of the statutes under which they were given. Such notices were not necessary to be given in all cases, only in those in which mortgagees and others had filed memorandums of their claims, or where the last owner to whom the premises were assessed was a resident of the city and county of New York. <em>(See Laws of N. Y. of </em>1843, <em>ch. </em>235, <em>p. </em>335 ; <em>Id. </em>1841, <em>ch. </em>230, <em>p. </em>141; <em>Id. ch. </em>170, <em>p. </em>210.) It may appear upon the trial that the giving of such notices was unnecessary in this matter. If the premises were last assessed to Edward A. Nicoll, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, this would be so, as he is stated in the complaint to have died several years before the leases were given. The leases are conclusive evidence that the sales in pursuance of which they were given were regular, according to the provisions of the statute, and being given they stand absolute. <em>(Laws of </em>1850, <em>ch. </em>183. <em>Id. </em>1855, <em>ch. </em>427, \u00a7 65. <em>Id. </em>1843, <em>ch. </em>230, <em>p. </em>223.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-5\"><em>By the </em>Court, Cardozo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVb\">It was not disputed on the argument, and cannot be, but that the answer does not aver several matters which it will be necessary for the defendant to prove, to establish the validity of the lease. If the truth of the plea, therefore, were conceded, the defendant would not be entitled to judgment, because other facts must be proven, to establish her case; and not having pleaded those facts, she cannot claim to give evidence to support them. It is plain, from this statement, that that part of the answer demurred to is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel now insists that that part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the answer is irrelevant, or rather that it is introductory to the sixteenth clause, and that a demurrer will not lie to a part of a defense. But the difficulty is that it is not pleaded as part of one defense. The defendant has stated them separately and numbered them, thus clearly showing, by his compliance with the 25th rule of the court, that he meant to plead them as separate and distinct defenses. He cannot now be heard to assert that they are not so.</p>\n<court id=\"b289-8\">[First Department, General Term, at New York,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"A1S\">April 4, 1871.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The statute of 1855, <em>(Laws of </em>1855, <em>ch. </em>427,) does not aid the defendant.
