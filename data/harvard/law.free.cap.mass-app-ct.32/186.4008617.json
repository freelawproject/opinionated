L. c. 7IB,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>while fleeing from an altercation with another student. This incident occurred in the presence of Richard\u2019s teacher in the cafeteria of a junior high school operated by the defendant. Richard was thirteen years old at the time of his injury and had attended the Malden public schools since the first grade pursuant to a yearly individualized education plan (IEP). As of the time of the incident, the teacher and school officials had long been aware that Richard was sometimes impulsive, erratic, and combative.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, filed pursuant to the Massachusetts. Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, alleged (1) negligent educational programming for Richard and (2) negligent supervision of students generally and of Richard specifically. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that \u201c[t]he decision as to [Richard\u2019s] placement ... is the paradigm of discretion embraced by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(6).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201cThe adoption of a plan to integrate handicapped pupils fully into the public schools falls precisely into the area of retained immunity.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 224 (1977). While <em>Whitney </em>was decided before the 1978 enactment of G. L. c. 258, the immunity recognized by it is not altered by that statute. The statutory and regulatory scheme of G. L. c. 7IB requiring that the special education child \u201cmust be placed in the least restrictive program which meets the child\u2019s special education needs,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>382 Mass. 665, 668 (1981), relies upon the expertise of local educators to establish academic standards and provide special educational services. <em>Stock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Sch., </em>392 Mass. 205, 213 (1984). The application of such expertise in evaluating each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>child\u2019s needs and developing individualized educational programming is indistinguishable in nature from the \u201chigh degree of discretion and judgment involved in weighing alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy and planning . . . .\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 218. See also <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 467-469 (1986). School officials, making individualized placement decisions, of necessity act without strictly \u201cfixed or readily ascertainable standards.\u201d See <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 215 (1983). We conclude that the adoption of an IEP and the placement of a child pursuant to that plan are therefore acts exempt from tort liability under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(b)..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The claim of negligent supervision is controlled by our decision in <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Methuen, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 279 (1988), in which we stated, \u201cManagement of student imbroglios, student discipline, and school decorum fall readily within the discretionary function exception to the Tort Claims Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 280, quoting from <em>Cady, supra </em>at 217. The plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that the defendant is liable because its acts in implementing the IEP were not discretionary functions. They rely on the statement in <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 218, that, \u201cwhen the particular conduct claimed to be tortious involves . . . the carrying out of previously established policies or plans, such acts should be governed by the established standards of tort liability applicable to private individuals or entities . . . .\u201d However, nothing in the record indicates that the defendant was charged with or had assumed any specific duties respecting Richard\u2019s deportment or that any individualized policies or plans for supervising Richard\u2019s behavior had been established.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the defendant\u2019s management of Richard\u2019s behavior falls within the wide discretion granted to school officials in maintaining discipline and decorum. See <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Methuen, supra </em>at 280. The plaintiffs\u2019 vague argument that the addressing of Richard\u2019s known disruptive propensities involved the carrying out of \u201cpreviously established policies and plans\u201d ignores this court\u2019s observation that the standards for dealing with disruptive student behavior are not readily ascertainable and \u201cmust be as variable as the personalities of the students and the settings in which disruption occurs.\u201d <em>Cady, supra </em>at 216. Moreover, <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester </em>can be read to indicate that decisions to afford or forgo increased supervision for special needs students are under the discre-. tionary function umbrella and are not subject to review by the courts in an action for damages. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 222, 224. See <em>A.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 234, 245 (1988)(\u201cwe continue to look to the principles enunciated in <em>Whitney </em>to guide our determinations of the intended scope of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10[6]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiffs also argue, principally by analogy to <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745 (1984), and <em>A.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 234 (1988), that we should find the defendant owed Richard a special duty because of his status as a special needs child. They claim that this special duty is such as to remove the defendant\u2019s acts from the discretionary function exception. Although argued for the first time on appeal, we consider this issue, see <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977), but only to note that the discretionary function exemption, when applicable, is a complete bar to liability. The cited decisions engage the issue of special duty only in the context of the activity in question being outside of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-17\">The statute creates a comprehensive program of evaluation and placement of school age children with special needs. Local school officials are responsible for providing appropriate, publicly supported education for such children pursuant to an individualized education program including, to the extent possible, placing them in the least restrictive regular public school program which meets the child\u2019s special needs. See G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. The statutory and regulatory schemes are more fully described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>382 Mass. 665, 668 (1981), and <em>Isgur </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Newton, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 295-297 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 10(6), as inserted by St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, exempts from liability \u201cany claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a public employer or public employee, acting within the scope of his office or employment, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Title 603 Code Mass.
