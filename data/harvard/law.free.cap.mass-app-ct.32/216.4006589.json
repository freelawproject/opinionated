L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; one indictment for kidnapping in violation of G. L.\u2018 c. 265, \u00a7 26, and one indictment for threatening to commit a crime in violation of G. L. c. 275, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following two trials the defendant was found guilty on each count of each indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was sentenced to four concurrent terms of nine to fifteen years at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, on all counts of the statutory rape indictments, and a sentence of nine to ten years on the kidnapping charge to run concurrently with the rape sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On appeal, the defendant makes the following claims: (1) the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conviction of kidnapping; (2) the judge erroneously instructed the jury on the crime of kidnapping; (3) the judge erred in admitting \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony; (4) the judge incorrectly instructed the jury on its consideration of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony; (5) the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to support a conviction of rape of a child; and (6) the admission of the defendant\u2019s \u201cbad acts\u201d was improper and highly prejudicial. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The jury could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant married the victim\u2019s mother when the victim, whom we shall call Ann, was eight years old. Ann, her mother, and the defendant lived together in the same house on King Street in Groveland until Ann moved out after she turned eighteen in the summer of 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On November 5, 1988, several months after she had moved out of the King Street house, Ann was in her car with a friend when she noticed that she was being followed closely by the defendant in his automobile. Ann got out of her car and approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle. He yelled at her and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>told her to return to the King Street house. Ann, frightened and uncertain about what was going to happen, returned to the house and instructed her friend to walk up and down King street and to keep an eye out for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Immediately upon her arrival at the house, Ann recognized that the situation was \u201cintense and that something was wrong.\u201d At the defendant\u2019s urging, Ann\u2019s mother asked her if she had undergone an abortion. Ann admitted to the abortion and asked the defendant to leave the room so she could have a private conversation with her mother. Ann informed her mother, out of the defendant\u2019s presence, that the defendant had been sexually \u201cmolesting\u201d her for years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the defendant returned to the room, the victim\u2019s mother confronted the defendant with Ann\u2019s accusation. The defendant admitted to sexual activity with Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The conversation then moved to a downstairs living room where the defendant threatened Ann that \u201c[you] don\u2019t have to worry about anything any more after tonight.\u201d A short while later, the defendant told Ann \u201call right, let\u2019s go.\u201d As the defendant and Ann left the house, Ann said to her mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Her mother did not reply, and Ann and the defendant walked to Ann\u2019s car, the defendant following closely behind Ann. As they reached the car the defendant asked her for the keys. Ann told him that they were inside the house. The defendant followed 'her to and from the house as she went to retrieve the car keys. Ann was \u201chorrified\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d of the defendant; she contemplated running from the defendant, but believed it would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The defendant instructed Ann to enter the passenger side of the car. She did so and the defendant sat on the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>side and drove away from the house. As the car pulled out of the driveway, the defendant asked Ann if she \u201cwanted to know how he was going to kill [her].\u201d According to Ann the defendant then said he \u201cwas going to stop the car, smash my head into the windshield, and hopefully I would die with that action; because he was going to crash the car, and it would be more painful when he did that.\u201d The defendant drove the car to Georgetown Square, pulled the car into a Citgo gas station, and told Ann that he was going to kill her in another car. As she stepped out of the car, she seized the opportunity to escape, ran inside the gas station office, and asked the attendant to phone the police because someone was trying to kill her. At this moment, the defendant entered the office and told the attendant that it was a \u201cfamily matter\u201d and not to call the police. The defendant grabbed Ann\u2019s arm and pulling it behind her back forced her out the door. When they were outside the office Ann managed to pry herself loose and ran to safety inside a nearby market.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Milton Randall, the store manager, brought Ann to a back room and called the police. Officer Daniel Beaton of the Georgetown police was the first to arrive on the scene and testified that Ann \u201cwas shaking and crying very, very loudly.\u201d Ann told Beaton that her father had threatened to kill her and that she was \u201cafraid her father was going to take her.\u201d Ann accompanied Beaton to the police station where she told him that the defendant had been having sex with her for the past five or six years. Two days after the above events transpired Ann met with Officer William Sargent of the Grove-land police department and told him in considerable detail that the defendant had sexually abused her since the age of nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I. <em>The Kidnapping Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"At2\">1. <em>Sufficiency of evidence on the charge of kidnapping. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of kidnapping. The familiar test is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>monwealth, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The indictment (possibly combining clauses [1] and [3] of G. L. c. 26<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, \u00a7 266) contained language which required the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant forcibly confined or imprisoned Ann \u201cwith intent ... to cause her to be secretly confined or imprisoned . . . against her will.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s contention is that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant intended to cause the victim to be secretly confined or imprisoned against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Even if we regard the \u201cintent\u201d language of the indictment as not surplusage, but see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>375 Mass. 118, 120 (1978) (intimating that the \u201cintent\u201d language in an indictment based on the third clause might be regarded as superfluous where the remaining language of the indictment is sufficient to embrace the first clause), there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant forcibly confined or imprisoned Ann with the intent to cause her to be secretly confined or imprisoned against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The jury could have considered the following; the victim testified that she was \u201cscared\u201d of the defendant and that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>escape would be \u201cfutile\u201d; that Ann, because of her fear of the defendant, obeyed his instructions to leave the house and to sit on the passenger side of her car while the defendant was in control of the vehicle; that the defendant drove the vehicle away from the house against the will of the victim; that she was held inside the vehicle against her will and was unable to escape from the vehicle; that after the defendant had admitted to years of sexual contact with Ann the defendant threatened to kill her and told her that he was going to \u201csmash [her] head against the windshield\u201d; that after that night she would not have to worry about anything; that Ann finally managed to escape only by fleeing from the defendant\u2019s grasp when the vehicle stopped in Georgetown, and that thereafter she was shaking and sobbing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These facts provide sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant intended forcibly to confine the victim against her will. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>370 Mass. 192, 203 (1976) (evidence need not require the jury to draw an inference, it is sufficient that the evidence permits the inference to be drawn); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frankoff, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 446 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">2. <em>Jury charge. </em>The defendant contends that the judge failed properly to instruct the jury on kidnapping by incorrectly defining the word \u201cforce\u201d in response to a jury question. Assuming the point was properly preserved by the defendant, there was no error. The judge correctly noted that there need not be physical force applied against the victim; if the victim is subdued by the \u201cdisplay of potential force, [that] is sufficient. . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavacciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 652 (1991) (\u201cforce\u201d may be either actual or constructive).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The judge\u2019s reference to the word \u201cinveigle\u201d did not mislead the jury. The judge read the kidnapping statute in its entirety and it includes the word \u201cinveigle.\u201d The judge also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>told the jury that the confinement must be against the person\u2019s will \u2014 the \u201c[ejssence [of kidnapping] is restraint, restraint of locomotion.\u201d \u201cThe test of the charge is the impression created by it as a whole. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 707 (1972). Thus considered, the defendant\u2019s claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">II. <em>The Rape Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">1. <em>Admissibility of the \u201cfresh\u201d complaints. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in allowing the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony of Officers Beaton and Sargent concerning the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements made to them detailing' the defendant\u2019s acts of rape and abuse. The defendant calculates that the statements were made some twenty-seven months after the date of the last putative event, July 14, 1986, rather than the two months that expired measured from the date that Ann left the King Street house. There was no abuse of discretion on the part of the judge in admitting the corroborative testimony of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Whether a complaint is reasonably \u201cfresh\u201d \u201crests in the first instance in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 491 (1991). Significant delays have been excused when the victim is a child. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 229 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 414 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, supra, </em>at 491. \u201cThe test is whether the victim\u2019s actions were reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 228. In considering the issue, the courts have looked to the following criteria: when did the victim leave the control of the defendant, was the perpetrator of the offense related to the-victim (parent or stepparent of the victim), and did the defendant obtain the victim\u2019s silence through the use of threats, implied or expressed? <em>Id. </em>at 229. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, supra </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The trial judge properly concluded that Ann\u2019s complaints, made approximately two months after she left the defendant\u2019s house, were sufficiently \u201cfresh.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 672 n.9 (1987), the court found that \u201c[i]n cases where a young victim has been under the control of, and in reasonable fear of, a defendant who is a close relative, the promptness of a complaint is usually measured from the date when the victim leaves the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d Here, the victim ceased being under the defendant\u2019s control only two months prior to her statements, the defendant was Ann\u2019s stepfather, and when Ann was very young he had threatened her with going to a \u201cbad place.\u201d The almost daily sexual assaults, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>kept Ann within the defendant\u2019s grasp until she left the house. The judge was well within his discretion in allowing the officers to give corroborative testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, supra </em>at 490-492 (complaint given some two years after rape properly admitted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, supra </em>at 414 (noting the difference between cases involving a single putative event, and those where, as here, the claim is that there were repeated acts of abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">2. <em>The judge\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning fresh complaint testimony. </em>The defendant claims for the first time on appeal that the judge failed to submit to the jury the question whether the complaint was \u201cfresh.\u201d The defendant failed to object either to the judge\u2019s jury instructions or to his limiting instructions on the issue of fresh complaint. If there was error, our review would be confined to a determination whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">During the course of the trial, as well as during his final charge, the judge instructed the jury concerning the proper use of fresh complaint testimony. The judge instructed the jury that the statements were admissible only as corroborative evidence and that they could not be used to prove that the victim was in fact sexually assaulted. The judge also told the jury that the statements were \u201cadmitted solely to give you, if they do give you, assistance \u2014 if they are in fact an assistance.\u201d He also told the jury that they could \u201cweigh the absence of a fresh complaint. Perhaps it ought to be called a stale complaint doctrine. But this issue of staleness, that also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>can be weighed. . . .\u201d By referring to the doctrine as the \u201cstale complaint\u201d doctrine the judge implicitly instructed the jury that it was within their province to decide whether the complaints had been made within a reasonable time period. Taken as a whole the judge\u2019s instructions on the issue of fresh complaint were adequate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 626-27 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Densten, 23 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 981, 982 (1987) (\u201cAlthough ... the judge\u2019s instructions could have been more explicit, we think, when read as a whole, they adequately conveyed to the jury that it was for them to determine whether the victim\u2019s complaint to his mother was made within a reasonable time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">3. <em>Other points. </em>The defendant raises two additional points. First, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to support a conviction of rape of a child under sixteen years of age. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. The defendant argues that the victim provided no testimony that any acts of penetration occurred within the time frame of the indictments, and that her repeated reference- to having \u201csex\u201d with the defendant was insufficient to warrant a finding of penetration. The defendant\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The rape indictments allege that the defendant began having natural or unnatural intercourse with the victim sometime on or after July 15, 1983. This date corresponds to Ann\u2019s thirteenth birthday. During trial, the victim testified that sometime after she got her first menstrual period, which occurred when she was thirteen, the defendant\u2019s \u201ctouchings\u201d changed. She testified that at that time \u201che put his penis into my vagina.\u201d -Following this testimony, she stated that the defendant would have \u201csex\u201d with her on a daily basis. \u201c[T]he evidence in this case, together with the reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom, was adequate to warrant a finding by the jury of penetration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nylander, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 787 (1989) (citations omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 947, 948 (1983) (jury could reasonably infer that victim\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the term \u201csexual relations\u201d was synonymous with sexual intercourse).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The defendant also claims that during his trial on the rape indictments (the defendant had been convicted of kidnapping in the first trial, see note 2, supra) the judge improperly admitted evidence pertaining to the kidnapping. The events which unfolded on the evening of November 5, 1988, were irrelevant, so the argument continues, and highly prejudicial to the issue whether the defendant raped his stepdaughter. The judge admitted the testimony as evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">While evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad conduct \u2014 here, the kidnapping \u2014 is ordinarily not admissible to show his criminal propensity, \u201c[e]vidence that tends to show consciousness of guilt on the part of a defendant is always relevant at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 125 (1979). Evidence otherwise relevant is not rendered inadmissible merely because it may indicate that the defendant had committed another offense. <em>Ibid. </em>After Ann revealed the defendant\u2019s actions to her mother, the defendant forcibly led her to her car, drove her away and told her that he was going to kill her. Following Ann\u2019s escape, the defendant fled to a friend\u2019s house where he spent the night. According to the friend, the defendant said, \u201cWell, he says, you know \u2014 \u2018The police may be looking for me.\u2019 He said . . . [Ann], his daughter there, accused him of having sex with her, in front of her mother, and he took her out, took her for a ride to try and straighten things out, I guess.\u201d The events relating to the charge of rape were interwoven with the events relating to the kidnapping charge. The judge properly admitted the testimony of the friend in order to show the defendant\u2019s guilty state of mind, and the testimony of other witnesses about events of that evening was admitted to show the \u201cattendant circumstances.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 489 (1988). \u201cWe believe that the desperate nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct here lent credibility to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the evidence of flight supported an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>inference of guilt of the crimes charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>367 Mass. 474, 496 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The defendant\u2019s conviction for threatening to commit a crime was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent and is therefore not before this court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. 437, 438 n.3 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> At the first trial the defendant was found guilty of kidnapping and threatening to commit a crime. The jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the indictments charging the defendant with rape of a child. The rape charges were retried and the defendant was found guilty on each count of the retried indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The evidence relating to the kidnapping charge is drawn from the first trial while the evidence regarding the rape charges is drawn from the second trial. The evidence at the second trial was substantially the same as the evidence at the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">At trial, the victim testified in detail that the assaults began at the age of nine when the defendant began touching her on the breasts and vagina. The series of assaults increased in invasiveness as the victim grew older. The victim testified that beginning at the age of thirteen the defendant\u2019s sexual \u201ctouchings\u201d changed and he began to \u201cput his penis into [her] vagina.\u201d The defendant\u2019s almost daily acts of oral and vaginal rape of his stepdaughter continued up until the victim turned eighteen and moved out of the family residence. When she was quite young, the defendant told the victim not to reveal his abuse or else she \u201cwould go to a bad place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The first sentence of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 900, reads in part as follows: \u201c[1] Whoever, without lawful authority, forcibly or secretly confines or imprisons another person within this commonwealth against his will, or [2] forcibly carries or sends such person out of this commonwealth, or [3] forcibly seizes and confines or inveigles or kidnaps another person, with intent ... to cause him to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this commonwealth against his will. . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>375 Mass. 118, 119-120 n.1 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">indictment in its entirety reads as follows: \u201cFletcher W. Titus . . . at Groveland . . . without lawful authority, did forcibly confine or imprison one [Ann], within this Commonwealth against her will, with intent either to cause her to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this Commonwealth against her will, or to cause her to be in any way held to service against her will.\u201d The phrase \u201cheld to service against her will\u201d first appeared in Rev. Sts. (1836) c. 125, \u00a7 20, and was connected to the process of slavery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saylor, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 120 n.2 (1989). The phrase may now be regarded as surplusage in any indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The defendant claims that, because the indictment avers that the kidnapping occurred in Groveland, the jury should not have been allowed to consider the events which took place in Georgetown. There is no merit to the argument. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
