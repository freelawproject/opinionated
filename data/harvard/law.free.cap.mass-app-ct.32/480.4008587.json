L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IBB, concluded that the board had exceeded its authority. A judgment was entered annulling the board\u2019s decision and remanding the case to the board for further action \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d the judge\u2019s decision. Because the judge\u2019s decision left no basis for the board to withhold its approval of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the plan, the judgment undoubtedly should be taken to mean that the board, upon remand, would be required to issue its approval of the plaintiffs plan. In these circumstances, the judgment, notwithstanding the remand order, is sufficiently final to warrant our review. See <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 605 (1980) (lower court retained jurisdiction, but there was a final judgment because \u201cnothing remains to be done but to place a \u00a7 81P endorsement on the plan in accordance with the judgment\u201d). Compare <em>Roberts-Haverhill Assocs. </em>v. <em>City Council of Haverhill, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 715, 719 (1974) (final decree annulled decision of the council and ordered further hearings). The board filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We draw the material facts from the judge\u2019s findings and from exhibits not in dispute. The plaintiff is a residential real estate development company which holds an option to purchase 138.76 acres of undeveloped farm land in a residentially zoned district of Taunton. The proposed subdivision would yield 154 single family house lots, each containing at least 25,000 square feet of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The board approved, with modifications, two preliminary subdivision plans submitted by the plaintiff, see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81S, one on December 17, 1987, and the other on May 19, 1988. As stated in art. II, \u00a7 205, of the board\u2019s rules and regulations, the purpose of the submission of preliminary plans is to \u201cprovide for the detailed review of the layout and features of the proposed subdivision by the board, and other city agencies and boards.\u201d This is consistent with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, as amended by St. 1969, c. 884, \u00a7 2, which provides, in part, that the \u201cpowers of a planning board . . . shall be exercised with due regard for . . . securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility services, fire, police, and other similar municipal equipment . . . necessary in a subdivision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Fifteen copies of the plaintiff\u2019s preliminary plans were filed with the board in order to permit distribution to, and review and comments by, various city departments, including the board of health, the sewer department, the city engineer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fire department, and the street department. Among the review comments received by the board in response to the plaintiffs preliminary plans was a letter dated March 29, 1988, from the superintendent of the sewer division of the city\u2019s department of public works. The letter refers to the fact that the preliminary plans reveal the plaintiffs intention to tie into a sewage line that had been constructed in South Walker Street, and that the plaintiff had been informed that that line could not be utilized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter concludes that the \u201csanitary sewer problem is still an issue that has not been resolved.'</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A second letter to the board was from the Taunton board of health, dated April 14, 1988. After referring to the same problem of the absence of Dighton\u2019s permission to tie into the South Walker Street sewage line, the board of health concluded that it \u201ccannot approve this subdivision until such time as the question of waste water disposal for this project has been decided and finalized.\u201d The plaintiff received a copy of both letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The plaintiff submitted its proposed definitive subdivision plan for approval on September 21, 1988. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U. The judge found that there was no significant change from the second preliminary plan. On November 8, 1988, the board was informed that the board of health \u201capproves the subdivision conditioned upon adequate . . . sewage services [being] available to the site,\u201d and on November 14, 1988, the acting city engineer wrote the board that \u2014 aside from the outstanding issue of approvals from Dighton \u2014 there was adequate capacity in the system to process the additional discharge flow from the plaintiff\u2019s subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>On December 5, 1988, after the required public hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s definitive plan, see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81T, the board voted to disapprove the plan on the ground that \u201c[t]his is not a viable subdivision \u2014 there is no evidence that sewer is available.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff submitted a revised definitive subdivision plan, again showing the same tie-in to the South Walker Street line, and, after another public hearing on February 16, 1989, the board again voted to disapprove the plans because \u201c[t]here is no sewer tie-in.\u201d (See note 2, <em>supra.) </em>The board made no reference to a letter it had received from the board of health dated February 9, 1989, stating that the \u201cBoard of Health approved the definitive subdivisions conditioned upon municipal . . . sewage [sic] to the site . . . and upon all of the issues relative to cellars and watertables and storm water runoff and roadway drainage being discharged to bordering vegetative wetlands or directly to the Three Mile River being specifically addressed by the Taunton Conservation Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The board\u2019s principal argument is that the judge was wrong because the plaintiff\u2019s definitive plans were not in compliance with the board\u2019s regulations. We agree. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81Q, as inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, provides that the board\u2019s rules and regulations \u201cshall set forth the requirements of the board with respect to . . . the installation of municipal services [in the subdivision] ... to carry out the purposes of the subdivision control law as set forth in section eighty-one M.\u201d Section 81M, as amended by St. 1969, c. 884, \u00a7 2, provides that the subdivision control law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 8IK to 81GG, was enacted to protect the safety, convenience, and welfare of the inhabitants of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>city or town accepting its provision, and that the powers of the board shall be exercised with due regard \u201cfor securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage . . . and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision . . . .\u201d The effect of these provisions is to require a planning board to adopt reasonable regulations designed to carry out the purposes of the subdivision control law, including provisions relating to any necessary sewer arrangements. See <em>Castle Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Park &amp; Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>344 Mass. 329, 332 (1962). Moreover, the required regulations may impose the reasonable obligation that an applicant show that it \u201chas <em>perfected arrangements </em>which will make possible service of the subdivision by the usual utilities . . .,\u201d including sewer. <em>Rounds </em>v. <em>Water &amp; Sewer Commrs. of Wilmington, </em>347 Mass. 40, 46 (1964) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Article II, \u00a7 201, of the Taunton board\u2019s rules and regulations provides that \u201c[n]o subdivision plan shall be approved unless it. . . meets the requirements of public safety, including . . . sewerage disposal and drainage facilities.\u201d Section 211(2)(C) of art. II provides that, if the applicant proposes to interconnect with the Taunton municipal sewerage system, the definitive plan must be accompanied by (i) a statement by the supervisor of the sewer department \u201cof the conditions on which the city will sewer the subdivision,\u201d and (ii) a statement of the supervisor approving the engineering features of the proposed sanitary sewers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the same effect is art. Ill, \u00a7 315(1), which provides that sanitary sewers shall be designed \u201cto provide connection to municipal sewerage system, as approved by the sewer supervisor.\u201d These regulations are reasonable requirements designed to assure an adequate and proper sewerage system for the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s definitive subdivision plans did not include any statement from the sewer department specifying the conditions on which the city would provide sewerage for the subdivision.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the plaintiff acknowledges that the right to tie into the South Walker Street line depends on the outcome of the pending litigation it commenced against the town of Dighton and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The plaintiff argues that the judge noted the failure of the plaintiff to provide the statements required by the regulation but that the judge was nevertheless correct in concluding that the adequacy of the plaintiff\u2019s proposed sewer tie-in is \u201cbest reserved for the board of health and building inspector at the time building permits are applied for, [and therefore] the board acted both unreasonably and prematurely . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The argument has no merit. On the facts of this case, the issue is not whether the board may require the issuance of a sewer permit before giving its approval to subdivision plans but whether the board may reasonably require that the plaintiff demonstrate that \u201cperfected arrangements\u201d have been made for the interconnection to the municipal sewer system shown on the subdivision plans. <em>Rounds </em>v. <em>Water &amp; Sewer Commrs. of Wilmington, supra </em>at 46, held that the board may properly require such a demonstration. Because the plaintiff failed to provide the required statements from the sewer supervisor, and thereby demonstrate that all necessary arrangements were in place, the plans did not comply with the board\u2019s regulations; that material deficiency is sufficient to justify the decision of the board. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, as amended by St. 1957, c. 265, which provides in part, \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>is the intent of the subdivision control law that any subdivision plan filed with the planning board shall receive the approval of such board if said plan conforms to the recommendation of the board of health and to the reasonable rules and regulations of the planning board . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The board\u2019s decision was correct for a second reason. As described above, the city\u2019s board of health did not give its unconditional approval to the plaintiff\u2019s definitive subdivision plans. To the contrary, the board of health, by letters to the planning board dated November 8, 1988, and February 9, 1989, conditioned its approval upon the availability of the sewer tie-in and, in the February 9 letter, to \u201call of the issues relative to cellars and watertables and storm water runoff and roadway drainage . . . being specifically addressed by the Taunton Conservation Commission.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Subdivision plans must comply with reasonable recommendations of the board of health. <em>United Reis Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Natick, </em>359 Mass. 621, 623 (1971). <em>Independence Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 135 (1987). In the absence of the approval of the subdivision plans by the board of health, the planning board had no choice but to disapprove the plans because it could not resort to the alternative of modifying the plans to bring them into conformity with the recommendations of the board of health.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Loring Hills Developers Trust </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. 343, 348 (1978). Because there was no such approval, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the board did not exceed its authority in disapproving the plaintiff\u2019s plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The judgment of the Land Court is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered that the decision of the city of Taunton planning board did not exceed its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The city of Taunton and the town of Dighton were parties to an agree-, ment dated January 3, 1979, under which Dighton was to construct a sanitary sewage system within the town and to dispose of its sewage through the sewage collection and treatment works of Taunton. The resulting system included a line that ran along South Walker Street, but the agreement was silent as to whether a land owner, such as the plaintiff, could tie into that line without the approval of the town of Dighton. As indicated in the text, <em>infra, </em>that issue is the subject of a pending action brought by the plaintiff in the Massachusetts courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The board cited additional reasons, but the only reason which remains a live issue in this case is that relating to the sewage tie-in.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Despite this letter, the judge found that the board of health had \u201cissued its approval of Hovnanian\u2019s Revised Definitive Subdivision Plan on February 9, 1989.\u201d The record appendix does not include any action or decision by the board of health on February 9, 1989, other than the letter of that date described in the text of this opinion. It is clear that the approval by the board of health was expressly conditioned upon a variety of material matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">It is undisputed that the engineering features of the subdivision plans relating to the sewerage system were satisfactory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The plaintiff provided a letter from the sewer department dated October 17, 1988, in which the superintendent acknowledged the city\u2019s obligation to maintain the South Walker Street line. This letter did not satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s obligations under the regulations with regard to the necessary sewer tie-in. By letter dated January 20, 1989, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel notified the board that suit had been brought to determine whether the South Walker Street line is \u201cpublic\u201d and to determine whether Dighton must grant the plaintiff permission to tie into the South Walker Street line. This, too, did not satisfy the requirement of the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The judge relied on <em>Fairbairn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Barnstable, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 185 (1977), but that case, insofar as it might tend to support the judge\u2019s decision, involved the action of the town\u2019s board of health implicating the State Sanitary Code, not the subdivision control law. See <em>id. </em>at 183-185.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">There is also statutory authority for the planning board to issue its approval upon the condition that no building be erected without the consent of the board of health, but that authority is limited to those instances where the report of the board of health \u201crequire[s]\u201d that arrangement. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
