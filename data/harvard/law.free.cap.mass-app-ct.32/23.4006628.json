Abington Savings Bank (bank) held a mortgage of $1,410,000, the bank brought this action under its own insurance policy to recover for loss to its \u201cmortgage interest\u201d in the amount by which its loan exceeded the bank\u2019s recovery under the mortgagor\u2019s policy. The bank had received only $730,000 from the mortgagor\u2019s insurance company, a figure determined by appraisers (after the parties could not agree) to be the actual cash value of the loss to the building. On cross-motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court entered judgment for the defendant insurer, ruling that the bank \u201chas recovered from the policy of the borrower all that it is entitled to and has no rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>look to the defendant\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s policy for further recovery.\u201d We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The provisions of the bank\u2019s policy on which it relies, as well as the definition of \u201cmortgage interest,\u201d are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arguing that the policy does not limit recovery to the actual cash value of the property, the bank claims it is entitled to recover the difference between the replacement cost of the property and the amount received from the mortgagor\u2019s insurer. The bank\u2019s insurance policy nowhere refers to replacement cost<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we do not see any basis for reading such a term into the words \u201cthe loss.\u201d See \u00a7 A, par. ii, set forth in note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The definition of \u201cmortgage interest\u201d in the policy is the <em>interest of the bank in the real property </em>which it has as a security for its loan. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Such a policy, as contrasted with a mortgage insurance policy, see, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 1709 (1988), does not permit either the owner or a mortga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>gee to collect by way of insurance more than the loss to that property. A lienholder\u2019s insurable interest is not greater than the security to which it attaches. As recited in 3 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 24.72 (2d rev. ed. 1984), \u201cThe mortgagee\u2019s insurable interest is prima facie the value mortgaged and extends only to the amount of the debt, <em>not exceeding the value of the mortgaged </em>property\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Grain Shippers\u2019 Mut. Fire Ins. Assn., 176 </em>Iowa 316, 322-324 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">To overcome this rule, the bank cites <em>Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank, </em>133 F. 2d 789 (5th Cir. 1943), arguing that it had an interest in the property greater than its market value \u201cbecause the building (under construction) and the land secured a mortgage construction loan which until sufficient appreciation in the real estate market occurred, was greater than the market value of the property.\u201d The argument is specious. The fact that the loan was greater than market value does not help the bank nor can the bank obtain recovery for hoped-for appreciation in the property. Had the bank foreclosed and sold the property immediately prior to the loss, it would have realized no more than its then fair market value. It is not entitled to a greater recovery because the property was damaged by fire. <em>Tabbat </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>185 Mass. 419, 421 (1904). In <em>Century Ins. Ltd. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank, </em>133 F. 2d at 791, the security holder\u2019s interest in the pledged property (cotton) was greater than the market value of the destroyed cotton because the security holder was protected by an agreement with a Federal agency whereby that agency was obliged to purchase the cotton at a higher price. There is nothing comparable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The bank\u2019s additional claim that it is not bound by the determination of value under the mortgagor\u2019s policy is also without merit. The bank participated in the appraisal process in Maine and it did not appeal from the determination. The bank\u2019s policy permits recovery where there is inadequate or no insurance or where the bank is \u201cunable to collect <em>the loss </em>wholly or partially under (the mortgagor\u2019s insurance).\u201d See note 2, <em>supra. </em>In context, the provision does not look to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>redetermination of \u201cthe loss\u201d where the same peril has been insured against and full recovery has been allowed for that loss under the mortgagor\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we interpret \u00a7 A, par. ii, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>it provides coverage only where the mortgagor\u2019s policy does not cover the full amount of \u201cthe loss\u201d as determined by that (the mortgagor\u2019s) policy. That the defendant insurer suggested an appraiser (whom the bank designated to be one of the appraisers to determine the loss under the mortgagor\u2019s policy) who gave an original appraisal which\" was higher than was ultimately awarded does not, in our view, change the result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\n<em>\u201c SECTION (A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u201cPHYSICAL LOSS OR DAMAGE FROM \u2018REQUIRED PERILS\u2019 \u201cUnderwriters hereon will insure the Assured for <em>loss to the Assured's Mortgage Interest </em>and unpaid charges accruing after loss up to date of settlement, including . . .

The provision, however, only permits recovery of replacement costs if the property is in fact repaired. It was not repaired or replaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We do not consider any question of estoppel. Cf. <em>Home Owners Fed.
