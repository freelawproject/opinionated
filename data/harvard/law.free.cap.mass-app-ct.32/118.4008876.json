A Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Probate Court judge determined that the Ohio orders were in conflict with an earlier outstanding New York order placing custody of the child with the mother, Taciana Giambrone (Taciana), and denied Mark\u2019s complaint for enforcement. Concluding that the Ohio custody determinations were not made in substantial conformity with G. L. c. 209B, the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, and that they are not consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (1988), the Federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), we affirm the order denying the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">1. <em>The New York and Ohio proceedings. </em>We recite the facts as they appear in the parties\u2019 stipulation and the various documents and decisions filed in the proceedings in New York, Ohio, and Massachusetts. After their marriage in Brazil in 1983, Mark and Taciana resided in Ohio. Each of the parties had relatives living in that State. They moved to New York in January, 1985, and their son, Cristian, was born there on September 14, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In January, 1987, Mark and Taciana separated. The parties have not stipulated but Taciana has alleged in Massachusetts pleadings that Cristian remained with her. In any event, the time interval appears to have been brief. Soon after the separation, Cristian was delivered to relatives in Ohio. Taciana went to Brazil to visit with her family, and Mark made preparations to relocate to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Taciana returned to the United States on February 18, 1987. We have nothing to advise us of the place of her arrival. Two days later, Mark initiated divorce proceedings in New York and obtained an ex parte order granting him temporary custody of Cristian. A hearing was scheduled for March 3, 1987, pending service upon Taciana.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Prior to the scheduled hearing, Mark left New York, permanently, and went to Ohio. Through his attorney, he filed in New York a notice of discontinuance of his divorce action. It is the law of New York, N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. \u00a7 3217 (McKinney 1992), that a party asserting a claim may discontinue it without judicial approval prior to service of a response to the claim or within twenty days after service of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>claim, whichever is earlier. On March 3, 1987, however, the New York judge refused to recognize the notice of discontinuance. She found that there was confusion on the point whether Mark\u2019s attorney, who served the notice upon Taciana on March 2, 1987, had earlier been shown by Taciana, who was acting pro se, a copy of her response. The judge scheduled an immediate hearing and, on March 4, she vacated her custody award of February 20, 1987, and ordered the parties to appear for a custody hearing on March 12, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As these events were occurring in New York, Mark, in Ohio, on March 3, 1987, filed a complaint for alimony only (referred to in Massachusetts as a complaint for separate support) and obtained a temporary order granting him custody of Cristian. Through counsel in New York, he also filed an appeal from the judge\u2019s refusal to recognize his notice of discontinuance and a request for a stay of the judge\u2019s orders pending that appeal. The Appellate Division denied the request for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On March 12, the New York judge proceeded with the scheduled custody hearing, made findings of fact (which are not in the materials before us), awarded temporary custody of Cristian to Taciana, scheduled another hearing for March 30, and ordered that \u201call parties and the child are to be present.\u201d Mark did not attend the March 12 hearing. On March 18, 1987, the clerk of the New York court forwarded a copy of the judge\u2019s decision and order to the clerk of the Ohio court with a letter requesting that the Ohio court, pursuant to the decision of the New York judge and the \u201cprovisions of the TJCCJA\u2019 \u201d (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act), enter an appropriate order for the appearance of Mark and Cristian in New York on March 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On April 1, 1987, the Ohio judge \u201crelinquished\u201d jurisdiction to New York, dismissed Mark\u2019s complaint for alimony only, and directed him to appear in New York on March 30, 1987. (Mark had not gone to New York for the hearing). Taciana then went to Ohio and, on April 15, filed a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>seeking enforcement of the New York order of March 12. Mark filed a second complaint in Ohio for alimony only.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Taciana\u2019s petition was heard on May 5. Three days later, the judge entered the following orders. First, he accepted the New York order for filing, granted temporary custody of Cristian to Taciana, and ordered Mark to turn the child over to her. Next, and on his own motion, the judge stayed his orders, pending Mark\u2019s appeal from them, on the condition that Taciana be allowed visitation with Cristian. Finally, he ordered that Taciana not remove the child from Ohio. Taciana left Ohio on May 17, taking Cristian with her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On July 29, 1987, Taciana filed a counterclaim for divorce on Mark\u2019s complaint in New York, where his appeal from the judge\u2019s refusal to recognize his discontinuance was pending. Two days later, in Ohio, the judge heard Mark\u2019s second complaint for alimony only. Judgment on that complaint was entered on August 13, 1987, and it also provided that Mark was to have custody of Cristian. On November 16, 1987, Taciana was granted a divorce and custody of Cristian in New York, provided that she \u201csettle a judgment,\u201d which was not done.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the order also provided that \u201c[ujntil such judgment is settled [\u00bfnd] signed, this [paper] shall constitute the decision and order of the Court awarding permanent custody of Cristian to Taciana Giambrone. The Ohio and Massachusetts Courts . . . will be notified accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">2. <em>The Massachusetts proceedings. </em>Massachusetts became involved when, on November 12, 1987, Taciana filed a complaint under G. L. c. 209B, seeking enforcement of the March 12 custody order of New York. It is alleged, but not stipulated, that Taciana came to Massachusetts, bringing Cristian, to attend school. Her complaint was prompted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the fact that Mark had found her and had tried to take Cristian. She resisted, the police were called, and she was arrested on the outstanding warrant. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>In her complaint under c. 209B, Taciana asked that temporary custody of Cristian be awarded to the Department of Social Services. On November 13, Mark filed a counterclaim, seeking enforcement of the Ohio orders awarding him custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Also on November 12, in Ohio, the Court of Appeals of Greene County rendered its decision on Mark\u2019s app\u00e9al from the judge\u2019s determination (of May 8) that he should \u201crelinquish\u201d jurisdiction to New York. That determination was affirmed because, as stated in that decision, there was \u201cno logical reason why the [New York] order should not be enforced in this state.\u201d On November 20, the Massachusetts probate judge entered a judgment enforcing the New York custody order and returned custody of Cristian to Taciana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That judgment did not end the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Shortly after the criminal matters were resolved, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York decided Mark\u2019s appeal. The court concluded that, under N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. \u00a7 3217(a)(1) (McKinney 1992), Mark had an absolute right to discontinue his divorce action. Assuming, without deciding, that, under \u00a7 3217(b), a court could exercise its equitable power to estop the discontinuance, the Appellate Division found that Mark\u2019s conduct did not warrant the exercise of that power. The court reversed the judge\u2019s order and discontinued Mark\u2019s action for divorce. See <em>Giambrone </em>v. <em>Giambrone, </em>140 A.D.2d 206 (N.Y. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">This decision prompted Mark to request a rehearing in Massachusetts. The probate judge denied Mark\u2019s request on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the basis that Ohio lacked the jurisdiction to enter the orders which Mark wanted enforced. In July, 1988, Mark resorted to self-help. With the assistance of his father, brother, and an unidentified person, Mark forcibly removed Cristian from Massachusetts. He was apprehended in Connecticut, and Cristian was returned to Taciana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">After Mark failed in that attempted abduction, he brought a new complaint in Massachusetts. On October 4, 1988, he filed a complaint seeking enforcement of all the Ohio orders, including an order of habeas corpus, dated (as best we can make out) September 9, 1988. While that complaint was pending, Mark also filed a motion requesting that custody of Cristian be relinquished. The probate judge denied that motion, again explaining that it was based upon orders entered at a time when Ohio lacked jurisdiction to make any determination concerning the custody of Cristian.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">There the matter stood until June 27, 1989, when Taciana filed a counterclaim, asking that Massachusetts take jurisdiction over the issue of Cristian\u2019s custody and enter a judgment in her favor, and Mark moved for final judgment. On August 2, 1990, the probate judge reaffirmed his order of February 9, 1989, and a judgment was entered denying Mark \u201call relief.\u201d Mark filed his notice of appeal. There is no Massachusetts order awarding custody of Cristian to either Mark or Taciana. The only question before us is whether the probate judge was correct in refusing to enforce the Ohio custody orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">3. <em>Jurisdiction of the custody issue. </em>Under the circumstances in which this case was presented to the probate judge, a complaint for the enforcement of the Ohio orders (see G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 12), it fell upon him to determine whether the Ohio orders were valid under its law and entitled to recognition. Resolution of that question brought into play, by necessity, consideration of the New York custody orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>On February 20, 1987, the date of the first custody order, New York was Cristian\u2019s home State even though he was then in Ohio. It was Mark who sought the New York order, and New York was the State where Taciana continued to live upon her return from her visit to Brazil. See N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 75-d, par. 1(a) (McKinney 1988), in which New York sets out a \u201chome state\u201d basis for jurisdiction to make a custody determination. When, on March 3, 1987, Ohio entered a custody order in Mark\u2019s favor, it lacked the jurisdiction to do so under its own law. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3109.31(A) (Baldwin 1988).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As of that date, New York had jurisdiction under the prerequisites of Ohio law, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>and the New York judge had written to and spoken with the Ohio judge concerning retention of jurisdiction by New York. See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(A) and (g). Moreover, according to the Ohio judgment of April 1, 1987, dismissing Mark\u2019s complaint, the Ohio judge specifically stated that \u201cthis Court finds that there is no jurisdiction to entertain issues presented to the State of New York.\u201d Thereafter, on May 5, 1987, the judge accepted the New York order granting Taciana custody of Cristian. However, he gave no reasons for staying enforcement of the New York order, filed in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3109.32 (Baldwin 1988),* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pending Mark\u2019s appeal from his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>It is unnecessary for us to consider whether under Ohio law the judge was correct in staying enforcement of the New York order and not returning Cristian to Taciana. That question was decided by the Court of Appeals of Greene County, Ohio, on November 12, 1987. The court concluded that Mark\u2019s appeal was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d there would, be \u201cno abuse of discretion in enforcing the foreign order,\u201d and there was \u201cno logical reason\u201d why that order should not be enforced in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Notwithstanding that decision, the Ohio judge issued an order of habeas corpus on September 9, 1988. It is that order which Mark wants Massachusetts to enforce. This order does not appear to be grounded upon any events that transpired subsequent to Mark\u2019s unsuccessful appeal in Ohio. Rather, the order is based upon the judge\u2019s previous orders (May 17, May 18, May 21, and July 31, 1987) granting custody of Cristian to Mark and Mark\u2019s successful appeal in New York from that judge\u2019s refusal to allow him to discontinue his divorce action. When the Massachusetts probate judge ruled upon Mark\u2019s motion to relinquish custody, filed during the pendency of his complaint for enforcement of the order of habeas corpus, he had before him an affidavit, dated December 9, 1988, from the Ohio judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We learn the factual basis for the order of habeas corpus from the face of the order and the judge\u2019s affidavit. To these facts we apply the law of Ohio and New York, as well as G. L. c. 209B, and the PKPA. In his affidavit, the Ohio judge states that he obtained jurisdiction over Cristian\u2019s custody pursuant to Mark\u2019s complaint for alimony filed on April 17, 1987. He recited that Cristian had been residing in Ohio for a \u201csubstantial amount of time,\u201d the \u201cparties were residing in Ohio and had submitted to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction and requested affirmative relief as to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction as to custody of this child,\u201d there were \u201csignificant contacts with the State of Ohio,\u201d \u201cas a result of hearing tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>timony from both parties represented by counsel, as to the parties\u2019 verbal and alleged physical confrontations,\u201d as well as to Taciana\u2019s plans to remove Cristian from Ohio and the United States, Cristian was \u201cin danger of mistreatment and physical harm,\u201d and, because Mark\u2019s action in New York had been dismissed, no other State had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">There is nothing in the various court papers before us or in the parties\u2019 stipulated facts to suggest that Taciana was in Ohio and put the issue of Cristian\u2019s custody to that forum for any reason other than to seek enforcement of the New York order. New York\u2019s jurisdiction was recognized by Ohio on April 1, Taciana went to Ohio on April 15, and Ohio accepted the New York order on May 5, 1987. Ohio could not thereafter exercise jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3109.22(A)(2) (Baldwin 1988),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because New York, and not Ohio, was Cristian\u2019s home State in May, 1987, New York was exercising its jurisdiction in substantial conformity with Ohio law, and the New York judge had expressly (in writing and orally) retained jurisdiction. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3109.24(A) and (B), providing that in such circumstances, a \u201ccourt of this state shall not exercise its jurisdiction.\u201d See also <em>State ex rel. Ay cock </em>v. <em>Mowrey, </em>45 Ohio St. 3d 347 (1989); <em>Minton </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>9 Ohio App. 3d 165 (1983); <em>Squires </em>v. <em>Squires, 12 </em>Ohio App. 3d 139 (1983). Further, Ohio could not exercise jurisdiction under \u00a7 3109.22(A)(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the reason that Cristian was not pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ent in Ohio when the custody orders were made. The fact that Taciana had removed him in violation of the court\u2019s order was not an event authorizing an exercise of jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3109.22 and \u00a7 3109.31. Rather, Mark could and should have proceeded in New York as ordered by the Ohio court on April 1, 1987, or on his own initiative under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 75-p (McKinney 1988). See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Additionally, it makes no difference whether the judge relied upon \u00a7 3109.22(A)(4), that \u201cno other state would have jurisdiction,\u201d in conjunction with (A)(2) or as an independent basis for exercising jurisdiction. Mark\u2019s appeal in New York, from the judge\u2019s refusal to recognize his discontinuance, was not decided until May 12, 1988. That forum retained jurisdiction until at least that date, if not longer (as will be discussed, <em>infra), </em>and Mark was bound by its orders pending his appeal. See <em>Kolin </em>v. <em>Kolin, </em>134 Misc. 2d 70 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1986). See also N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 240, pars. (1) and (3) (McKinney Supp. 1992). Moreover, under basic jurisdictional principles, the 1988 discontinuance of Mark\u2019s action in New York did not relate back and serve to validate the orders entered in Ohio at a time (1987) when that forum was precluded, by its law and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(g), from exercising jurisdiction in a custody proceeding. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>484 U.S. 174, 182-183 (1988), discussing the enactment of the PKPA \u201cto extend the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to custody determinations.\u201d See also <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>407 Mass. 559, 567 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Had the probate judge enforced the orders of Ohio, he effectively would have been modifying the New York custody orders of March 12 and November 16, 1987. Those orders, as has been discussed, were made in substantial conformity with the law of Ohio and Massachusetts, and there was nothing before the probate judge to indicate that New York was declining jurisdiction. He was, therefore, correct in denying Mark\u2019s complaint for enforcement. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 <em>2(e). </em>See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>4. <em>The present appropriate forum. </em>In his memorandum of decision of February 8, 1989, the probate judge noted that he had advised the parties that New York was Cristian\u2019s home State, that he was deferring to the jurisdiction of New York, and that the parties should pursue their action in that State. As earlier noted, neither Mark nor Taciana followed this advice. Instead, on June 27, 1989, Taciana filed a counterclaim on Mark\u2019s complaint for enforcement, asking that Massachusetts take jurisdiction over the custody dispute and award custody of Cristian to her. It appears from the docket entries and the judgment that no action has been taken on Taciana\u2019s counterclaim. We think it obvious, however, in light of the probate judge\u2019s referral of the parties to New York, that the judge implicitly denied Taciana\u2019s counterclaim. Although Taciana did not file a notice of appeal, both she and Mark have argued before us whether Massachusetts can or should make a custody determination under G. L. c. 209B.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Our decision affirming the order of the probate judge puts the choice of the forum to determine Cristian\u2019s custody between New York and Massachusetts. The last word spoken by New York on that question was on November 16, 1987, when the judge granted Taciana a divorce and custody of Cristian. The divorce, however, was granted on Taciana\u2019s counterclaim for divorce on Mark\u2019s complaint which was discontinued on May 12, 1988.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In granting Taciana a divorce and custody of Cristian on November 16, 1987, however, the New York judge stated that the custody order was to remain in effect until the judgment was settled, an event which has not taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">It is unclear to us whether by that order (November 16, 1987) the New York judge was entering an order of protection under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 240, pars. (1) and (3), and continuing to exercise home State jurisdiction over Cristian. See <em>Umina </em>v. <em>Malbica, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 358 (1989), where we stated that \u201cMassachusetts, unlike States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>more faithful to the UCCJA, does not explicitly reserve jurisdiction under a continuing jurisdiction or a \u2018best interest\u2019 provision,\u201d and cited to <em>Enslein </em>v. <em>Enslein, </em>112 A.D.2d 973 (N.Y. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In view of the history of this dispute, we think that, rather than expect Mark or Taciana to return to New York to ascertain whether that forum views itself to be Cristian\u2019s home State and, if so, whether it will defer to Massachusetts, it would better serve Cristian to have that determination made by the probate judge under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 7. Should the probate judge determine that New York no longer has jurisdiction or that it declines to exercise it, then Massachusetts will have jurisdiction to make a determination as to Cristian\u2019s custody pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(2) or (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Probate Court denying the complaint for enforcement is affirmed, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">On May 18, 1987, the Ohio judge adjudicated Taciana to be in contempt of court. The judge entered an order authorizing \u201cany law enforcement officer or agency of any state or jurisdiction\u201d to find the child, take him from Taciana, and return him to Mark. Taciana was indicted, in Ohio, for the offense of child stealing, and a Federal warrant was issued for her arrest for flight to avoid prosecution in Ohio on that indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Mark had filed a complaint for divorce in Ohio on October 6, 1987, which was granted on December 15, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">When, on November 17, Taciana was arraigned on the fugitive from justice charge, she applied for a criminal complaint against Mark for assault and battery and a restraining order under G.

The Federal and Ohio charges against Taciana were ultimately dropped, leading to the dismissal of the Massachusetts complaint against her on February 16, 1988. On April 4, 1988, Mark admitted to sufficient facts on the criminal case against him, and the matter was continued without a finding for six months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Criminal charges were brought against Mark who, on February 3, 1989, admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty of conspiracy to commit assault and battery.
