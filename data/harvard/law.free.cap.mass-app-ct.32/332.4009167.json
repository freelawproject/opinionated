The defendant was the holder of a power of attorney from Manuelle Van Den Boga\u00e9rde, executed in England, reciting that it was \u201cintended to constitute a General Power of Attorney pursuant to Article 5, Title 15 of the New York General Obligations Law.\u201d At all material times Bogaerde resided in Great Britain or Portugal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">Since the question of personal jurisdiction is \u201csensitive to the facts of each case,\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 2 (1979), we turn to the facts alleged in the complaint and the matters set forth in the defendant\u2019s two affidavits. We also examine the power of attorney. That instrument authorized the defendant \u201cto act in my name, place and stead in any way which I myself could do, if I were personally present, with respect to the following matters [as defined in the New York statute, <em>supra] </em>to the extent that I am permitted by law to act through an agent:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">(A) real estate transaction;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">(B) chattel and goods transactions;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">(C) [crossed out];</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">(D) banking transactions;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">(E) [crossed out];</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">(F) insurance transactions;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">in connection with sale of real property situated at Barnes Road, in Oak Bluffs, Dukes County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts . . . , including without limitation, negotiation of terms and provisions of sale transaction, execution of Contracts, Deeds, Assignments and other Agreements, and effecting of Contracts, Deeds, Assignments and other Agreements, and effecting a closing and distribution of proceeds; in addition to the foregoing, the same shall apply to the disposition and sale of any and all personal property located at said premises.\u201d The power of attorney also included a clause indemnifying any third person against any claims by reason of having relied on the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The complaint alleged that the plaintiff \u201chad cemented\u201d the terms of a real estate transaction to purchase Bogaerde\u2019s real estate, that he had deposited $2,000 as well as an additional $18,000 with the defendant, and that the defendant had deceptively frustrated that transaction in violation of G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiff also alleged that, in reliance on the agreement, he had caused a survey of the land to be made, had a title abstract prepared, and had obtained clearance from the issuer of title insurance for title insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The defendant acknowledged that he had negotiated by telephone from New York with the plaintiff, that he had forwarded to him in Massachusetts a purchase and sale agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ment, and that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer had sent to the defendant (from Massachusetts) another draft of the agreement. He claimed that the negotiations had terminated without an agreement and that he had returned to the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer the plaintiff\u2019s checks. If an oral agreement had been reached with a real estate agent, he insisted the agent was without authority. All negotiations were by telephone or mail and the defendant never traveled to Massachusetts while they were pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is permissible presents generally \u201ca twofold inquiry: (1) is the assertion of jurisdiction authorized by statute, and (2) if authorized, is the exercise of jurisdiction under State law consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the United States Constitution?\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. at 5-6. <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Wilhelm Loh Wetzlar Optical Mach. GmbH &amp; Co. KG, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 16 (1988). The two questions may converge since G. L. c. 223A \u201cfunctions as \u2018an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., supra </em>at 6, quoting from <em>\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Seneca Foods Corp., </em>361 Mass. 441, 443 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We first undertake the statutory inquiry. General Laws c. 223A, \u00a7 3(a) and <em>(e) </em>(1988 ed.), the subsections relied on by the plaintiff, provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u201cA court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">(a) transacting any business in this commonwealth;</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>0) having an interest in, using or possessing real property in this commonwealth . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The term \u201ctransacting business\u201d is broadly construed, see <em>Bond Leather Co. </em>v. <em>Q.T. Shoe Mfg. Co., </em>764 F.2d 928, 931 (1st Cir. 1985), and \u201capplies to any purposeful acts by an individual, whether personal, private, or commercial.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>371 Mass. 439, 441 (1976). The Supreme Judicial Court has suggested that even in two cases where the contacts with the Commonwealth were held to be constitutionally insufficient <em>(\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Seneca Foods Corp., </em>361 Mass. 441 [1972], and <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149 [1978]), \u201cthe defendants might be viewed literally as having \u2018transacted business\u2019 \u201d within the Commonwealth. <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>378 Mass. at 8 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In the case at bar, the defendant negotiated with the plaintiff for the sale of land located in Massachusetts. He spoke on the telephone with the plaintiff (who was in the Commonwealth) as well as with his Massachusetts attorney, and wrote to that attorney in Massachusetts. The cause of action arose out of those negotiations and negotiations with a Massachusetts real estate broker hired by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That the defendant acted only as agent, <em>Kleinerman </em>v. <em>Morse, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 819, 824-825 (1989); <em>Berkeley PG Corp. </em>v. <em>Southbank Inv. Group, </em>291 S.C. 315, 318, 320 (1987), and that he claims no binding contract was consummated is not dispositive. See <em>Berkeley PG Corp. </em>v. <em>Southbank Inv. Group, </em>291 S.C. at 317, 319. Nor is it determinative that the defendant was not physically present in Massachusetts. Widespread use of the telephone and the mail has commonly replaced physical presence in negotiations. <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>378 Mass at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>What is significant \u201cis that the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum were deliberate and not fortuitous, such that \u2018the possible need to invoke the benefits and protections of the forum\u2019s laws was reasonably foreseeable, if not foreseen, rather than a surprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Product Promotions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cousteau, </em>495 F.2d 483, 496 (5th Cir. 1974). This is particularly so where, as here, the negotiations had substantial connection with Massachusetts, namely a contract for the sale of real estate in Massachusetts. See <em>Columbia Briar gate Co. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank, </em>713 F.2d 1052, 1058 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Columbia Briargate Co., </em>465 U.S. 1007 (1984); <em>Berkeley PG Corp. </em>v. <em>Southbank Inv. Group, </em>291 S.C. at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The subject matter of the transaction is also of importance in determining the second branch of our inquiry, that is, whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction meets due process considerations. See <em>Wolfman </em>v. <em>Modern Life Ins. Co., </em>352 Mass. 356 (1967) (contract of insurance); <em>Quasha </em>v. <em>Shale Dev. Corp., </em>667 F.2d 483, 486-487 (5th Cir. 1982) (real property). We conclude that \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would be neither so unfair nor so unreasonable as to result in a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>378 Mass. at 12. See generally <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Wilhelm Loh Wetzlar Optical Mach. GmbH &amp; Co. KG, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 22-27. Massachusetts has a legitimate interest in providing a forum for this action. The land is located here, the defendant conducted negotiations in Massachusetts by telephone and mail, and the broker hired by the defendant, through whom the plaintiff learned of the availability of the land and with whom he may have negotiated, was also located here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal on the basis of Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), is reversed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The defendant claimed the instrument which he termed a \u201climited Power of Attorney . . . excluded any aspect of litigation concerning the property.\u201d New York Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 5-1502A(10) (McKinney 1989), however, provides that a statutory short form power of attorney with respect to real estate transactions (such as the present instrument) \u201cmust be construed\u201d to include certain broad powers, one of which is the power \u201cto prosecute, to defend, to submit to arbitration, to settle . . . any claim . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">New York Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 5-1502A(ll) (McKinney 1989) provides that the short power of attorney \u201cmust be construed to mean that the principal authorizes the agent: To hire . . . any attorney ... or other assistant or assistants when the agent shall think such action to be desirable for the proper execution by him of any of the powers described in this section &gt;\u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">There is also pending in Massachusetts an action against Bogaerde arising out of the same negotiations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The parties have not argued, and we do not reach, the question whether the action could be dismissed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).
