L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, within fourteen days of the constructive grant to the trust of a special permit deprived it of the benefits of that grant. The essential facts are uncontroverted. On January 6, 1988, the defendant board of appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (board) conducted a public hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application for a special permit to construct 110 dwelling units on property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>owned by the trust in the city of Somerville. The board has never rendered or filed a decision with respect to that application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6On June 14, 1989, the plaintiff filed notice with the defendant city clerk to the effect that the application for special permit had been constructively granted by the board and that \u201cparties in interest\u201d designated in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, had been so notified. The defendant city clerk later refused demands that he issue a certificate of final approval of the application for special permit pursuant to G, L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9. The plaintiff thereafter filed suit in the Superior Court seeking a declaration that the application for a special permit had been constructively granted and an order requiring the defendant city clerk to issue a certificate to that effect. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment, and the plaintiff now appeals from the grant of summary judgment which dismissed the action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1987, c. 498, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe decision of the special permit granting authority shall be made within ninety days following the date of . . . public hearing. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cFailure by the special permit granting authority to take final action within said ninety days . . . shall be deemed to be a grant of the special permit. The petitioner who seeks such approval by reason of the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>of the special permit granting authority to act within such time prescribed, shall notify the city or town clerk, in writing within fourteen days from the expiration of said ninety days ... of such approval and that notice has been sent by the petitioner to parties in interest. . . . After the expiration of twenty days without notice of appeal ... or, if appeal has been taken, after receipt of certified records . . . indicating that such approval has become final, the city or town clerk shall issue a certificate stating the date of approval, the fact that the special permit granting authority failed to take final action and that the approval resulting from such failure has become final, and such certificate shall be forwarded to the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiff argues that the command of the statute that the petitioner \u201cshall notify the city or town clerk, in writing within fourteen days from the expiration of said ninety days\u201d is directory rather than mandatory and that the failure to comply strictly with the statute did not undermine the constructive grant. This argument runs counter to the general rule that the statutory use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is to be given a mandatory meaning. <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983). While we recognize that contextual analysis can impart considerable elasticity to the rule, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Quincy Mkt. Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., </em>312 Mass. 638, 646-647 (1942); <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 243, S.C., 384 Mass. 676 (1981), we perceive no indication from the context of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, that the statutory provision in issue is directory. To the contrary, the frequent appearance of both \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in various verb phrases within that section<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> indicates that the latter should be given its usual imperative connotation. \u201cWhere both mandatory and directory verbs are used in the same statute ... it is a fair inference that the legislature realized the difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>meaning, and intended that the verbs used should carry with them their ordinary meanings.\u201d 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 57.11 (4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">It is significant also that the fourteen-day requirement here involved is directed at a private party \u2014 the applicant for a special permit. \u201cThere is an essential difference between statutory directions to public officers and to private persons. . . . Where a [private party\u2019s] rights depend upon his compliance with the provisions of a statute, those provisions are generally mandatory, and compliance therewith a condition precedent to the perfection of such rights.\u201d 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 57.15. Both this essential difference and the contextually based elasticity of the word \u201cshall\u201d have well been demonstrated in decisions antedating the 1987 amendments to G. L. c. 40A in which the provision in \u00a7 15 that the decision of a <em>board of appeals </em>\u201cshall be filed within fourteen days\u201d has been construed as directory. <em>Zuckermart </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, </em>394 Mass. 663, 665-667 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 163 (1985). See also <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of N. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 679 (1968)(statutory command that the decision of a <em>board of appeals </em>\u201cshall be made within ninety days after the date of the filing of an appeal\u201d construed as directory).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We are also guided by the function served by the 1987 amendments. Prior to their enactment, chapter 40A con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tained few procedural guidelines for implementing or appealing from the constructive grant of a special permit or variance. This void engendered considerable uncertainty and litigation. See <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Yarmouth, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 147 (1986), and cases cited therein; 1986 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 8.8 at 258-260 (1986). Addressing itself to the \u201cnotoriously confused text\u201d of the constructive grant provisions of G. L. c. 40A, <em>O\u2019Kane, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 162, the Legislature in 1987, by its enactment of the second and third sentences of the eleventh paragraph of \u00a7 9 (and the fifth and sixth sentences of the fifth paragraph of \u00a715), established precise guidelines for all who might be involved or directly interested in the consequences of a constructively granted variance or special permit. The beneficiary of a constructive grant now has specific instruction for starting the post-grant machinery by giving notice of approval by inaction to the city or town clerk and \u201cparties in interest.\u201d The city or town clerk, in turn, has guidance for signalling the finality of the grant by the issuance of a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">If the statutory directions to a party claiming the benefits of a constructive grant are construed as directory, a challenger to the grant, see <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Easton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 338 (1982), will be uncertain as to whether or when to initiate an appeal. Moreover, the beneficiary of the grant would be able to determine the appeal period by the timing of his notice. Such results would dis-serve the salutary objectives of minimizing \u201cconfusion to attorneys and others concerned with the law relating to land use,\u201d <em>Building Inspector of Attleboro </em>v. <em>Attleboro Landfill, Inc., </em>384 Mass. 109, 113 (1981), and \u201climit[ing] the period during which an appeal may be taken.\u201d <em>Elder Care Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Hingham, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 481-482 (1984), and cases cited. To give the plainly remedial and mechanical provision in question a mandatory connotation is merely to recognize \u201cthat the Legislature intended no \u2018gaps and uncertainties in the specification of a procedure designed to provide definitive rights to accrue . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>within stated times.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noe </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 111 (1982) (Dreben, J., dissenting), quoting from <em>Selectmen of Pembroke </em>v. <em>R. &amp; P. Realty Corp., </em>348 Mass. 120, 127 (1964). See <em>Racette </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gardner, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 619 &amp; n.3 (1989). Given our decision, which in effect nullifies any grant, we need not reach the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the board waived its right to challenge the claim of constructive approval by not filing an appeal after the plaintiff\u2019s notice of June 14, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-18\">A municipal board of appeals may act as a special permit granting authority. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 1A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">The record indicates the trust later submitted and withdrew a second application for eighty units, then obtained a special permit for sixty-seven units, based on a third application. Issues of whether the board\u2019s consideration of the first application was waived or the time for decision extended were considered below. In view of the decision we reach, we need not decide those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Although St. 1987, c. 498, was approved on November 17, 1987, and became effective ninety days later, or after the date of the public hearing on the plaintiffs application, the parties\u2019 arguments below and on appeal are grounded in the 1987 version of the statute, and we accordingly base our decision on the statute as amended through St. 1987, c. 498. Subsequent amendments to \u00a7 9, see St. 1987, c. 584, \u00a7 10; St. 1989, c. 239; St. 1989, c. 341, \u00a7 22; and St. 1990, c. 177, \u00a7 109, have not altered the procedures and times specified in St. 1987, c. 498, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The word \u201cmay\u201d appears several times within G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, although not in the provisions quoted in the text. In some instances \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d appear within the same paragraph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The plaintiff relies on <em>Zuckermart </em>to argue that, since G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, contains no express remedy in the event of failure to comply with the fourteen-day notice provision, the time requirement should be construed as directory. The argument fails to appreciate that the statutory duty in issue is imposed upon a private person. The opinion in <em>Zuckermart </em>impliedly recognized that essential difference when it incorporated the following language from <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 211 (1909): \u201cAs to a statute imperative in phrase, it has often been held that where it relates only to the time of performance of a duty by a public officer and does not go to the essence of the thing to be done, it is only a regulation for the orderly and convenient conduct of public business and not a condition precedent to the validity of the act done.\u201d <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, supra </em>at 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
