King, to recover the sum of $1,556.04, due, as alleged, by reason of a certain written guarantee executed by them to indemnify plaintiffs for goods and merchandise sold the King Overall Company. The case was tried by the court and judgment rendered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Plaintiffs axe New York merchants and King Overall Company is a Virginia corporation engaged in the manufacture of overalls in the city of Suffolk. For a period of years plaintiffs had been furnishing raw material to the overall company. The credit of the company became unsatisfactory and plaintiffs demanded security before making further shipments. At the time of this demand the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>was heavily indebted to the plaintiffs. On January 10, 1929, the defendants, officers and stockholders of the King Overall Company entered into this agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">\n<em>\u201cJanuary 10, 1929.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\u201cMessrs.

A number of payments were made after the guarantee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>executed, as evidenced by letters of the company to the plaintiffs from which we quote the language bearing on the question involved:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\n<em>\u201cMarch 9, 1929.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\u201cWellington, Sears &amp; Company,</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">\n<em>\u201c65 Worth Street,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">\n<em>\u201cNew York City.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">\u201cGentlemen :</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">\u201cAgreeable with our promise, we are enclosing a check for $400.00 to apply <em>on our account, </em>and regret that we cannot at this writing send you a larger check.

This sum was applied by plaintiffs to the unsecured portions of the account due by the King Overall Company. It is the contention of defendants that pursuant to the directions contained in the letters, and in accordance with their express intention, those payments should have been applied to that portion of the indebtedness secured by the guarantee. On the hearing, the court, over the objection of plaintiff, permitted J. G. King to testify that he directed W. C. King to apply the payments on the guaranteed account. Likewise, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, this appears in the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cWilliam C. King, being duly sworn, states that he is secretary and treasurer of the company and conducted all the correspondence between his company and the plaintiff in this ease with reference to the payments made after January 10, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">\u201c(By Judge McLemore):</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\u201cQ. Tell us what you said about those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">\u201cA. I made payments on account as stated in the letters. When they were made on account, and on notes, I stated they were made, on notes, and on specific invoices I mentioned that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\u201cQ. There were four payments of $200.00 each, the last four mentioned on this account of credits in which you apparently said nothing about how the payments were to be applied, sent them without any notations. What do you say with reference to those payments?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\u201cA. They were applied against the guaranteed account. He had written me for payments of $200.00 each, and since he asked for those I did not see any reason to write a letter every time, but just put a check in an envelope and sent it and they were to be applied against the guaranteed account.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">\u201cQ. Did you, in your correspondence in dealing with the matter, treat the entire indebtedness as one account?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\u201cA. No, sir; there were notes and there was a guaranteed account and there were probably one or two invoices prior to the date this guaranty was made that were not included in the note. Those invoices were handled separately, and when payment was made on note it was said specifically on note, and when on guaranteed account it was said on account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>21 Gratt. (62 Va.) 205, the well settled rule upon the subject of the application of payments is thus stated: \u201cThe debtor, when he makes a payment which does not discharge the whole debt, has a right to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>whether it shall be applied to the principal or to the interest of the debt due; and where there are several bonds or notes evidencing the debt, he may say to which the payment is to be applied. When the debtor fails to exercise this right, then the creditor may make the application of the payment as to him shall seem best. * * * and where there are several debts to which the payment may be applied, in the absence of an application by the parties, the law will apply the payment , to the first debt due in order of time. 3 Phillips\u2019 Evi. 337, and note with authorities there cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">If it be conceded that the language employed in the letters <em>supra, </em>\u201cto our account\u201d or \u201cour credit,\u201d is ambiguous, then the action of the court in admitting parol evidence to explain it is without error. However, we do not think the language is ambiguous. In addition to the signature of the King Overall Company appended to each of the letters, there appears the individual signature of Wm. C. King. That fact, together with the language used, we think was sufficient direction to the plaintiffs to apply the payments to that portion of the indebtedness for which the defendants were bound by reason of their guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In <em>Atlantic Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Union Trust Corp., </em>110 Va. 286, 67 S. E. 182, 184, 135 Am. Rep. 937, this court said: \u201cIt is well settled that a person proposing to become surety for the conduct or contracts of another has a right to be treated with perfect good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">No notice whatever was given by plaintiffs that they were applying the payments to the unsecured indebtedness. There is no doubt in our mind that if such notice had been given, defendants would have exercised the right reserved in the contract to cancel the same. It would indeed be going far afield to say that the defendants intended to underwrite the prior indebtedness of the company in view of the express stipulation that the guarantee was the basis of future credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>We concur in the view of the learned trial court that the payments subsequent to January 10, 1929, should be applied to the indebtedness accruing since that date. When we apply those payments as a credit on the amount concededly due on account of purchases subsequent to January 10, 1929, to-wit, $1,556.04, there is still due the plaintiffs the sum of $406.04. They were entitled to a judgment for that amount and the trial court should have so held. For this error, the judgment of the lower court will be reversed apd this court will enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $406.04, with interest thereon from the 22nd day of April, 1929, together witlj the costs of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
