K. Steinhilber, one of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The first assignment of error is that the Commission erred in adjudging that the accident which resulted in the death of E. K. Steinhilber <em>arose out of </em>his employment. It is admitted that it occurred <em>in the course of </em>his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">E. K. Steinhilber was employed by Wright Motor Company, Inc., as its service manager. Among his other duties it was his duty to meet persons as they came into the company\u2019s place of business, to talk to them, find out what they wanted, and to see that their needs relating to the repairing and servicing of automobiles were taken care of. His method of meeting persons was to laugh and talk with them while waiting upon them, and this had the approval of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">J. B. Midgett was a motorcycle policeman of the Norfolk police force. He was accustomed to drop in at the Wright Motor Company\u2019s place of business from time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>time on merely social calls, sometimes as often as twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">On February 20, 1931, the day here in question, however, Midgett came into Wright Motor Company\u2019s place of business to see Steinhilber about getting an automobile repaired which he had bought there some time before, which automobile had been wrecked.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Midgett had not gone on duty when he came to the garage of Wright Motor Company, and when he came into the garage he had his pistol in his right-hand side pocket and his holster in his hand. He walked in and Steinhilber \u201cgot to kidding\u201d him; and reached over and hit him on the pocket in which the pistol- was, patted it and shoved it further down in the pocket. Midgett said: \u201cThat is all right, you need not worry it won\u2019t shoot.\u201d While Midgett was standing in the garage talking to Steinhilber about the wrecked car, he buttoned up his coat, reached over and got his holster, which he had laid on the fender of a car, and put on his belt and holster. He then took the pistol out of his pocket and shoved it down, as if to put it in the holster. He missed the holster, brought it back up, and a second time shoved it down towards the holster. But he again missed the holster, and the pistol slipped out of his hand, fell to the floor between Midgett\u2019s legs and was discharged by the impact. The bullet struck and killed Steinhilber.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">H. E. Gilliam and L. C. Heuitt, employees of Wright Motor Company, and C. M. Hamilton, who was not an employee of this company, were present in the garage when the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Of the four justices participating in this decision Justice Holt and myself think that on this state of facts that the death of the employee was not due to an injury by accident <em>arising out of </em>the employment. Justice Hudgins and Justice Browning are of opinion that it did. Therefore, the ruling of the Industrial Commission on this point is here sustained by a divided court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The second assignment of error is that the Commission erred in finding that the father and mother of the decedent were dependent upon the deceased employee within the meaning of section 40 of the workmen\u2019s compensation act of Virginia (Code Va. 1930, section 1887 [40]).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The only testimony on this point is the testimony of Mr. W. C. Steinhilber, a brother of the deceased employee, the material parts of whose testimony is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u201cQ.

Did you live in the house?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. We all lived together.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">\u201cQ. Were you paying this $18.00 as board or support for family?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">\u201cA.
