The intercourse was had on the seat of a Dodge coupe. There were no marks of violence upon her body and her clothing was not disheveled.- According to her own testimony she was wearing bloomers with rubber bands around the openings at the waist and the legs, and no other opening in them, which the accused pulled down around her knees and with them there accomplished his purpose. These bloomers had no injury to them, except at the rear of the waistband there was a place where the stitching was torn and there was a slight stain on them. The rubber band at the waist was not, however, entirely broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">It is; perhaps, possible that her story that the accused had intercourse with her by force against her will may be true; but her testimony is so highly improbable in so many particulars, that without corroboration, we think, it \u2022 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>insufficient to warrant belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutrix did not, in response to the persuasion and solicitation of the accused and her own passion, consent to the accused haying sexual intercourse with her on this occasion. <em>Boxley </em>v. Com., 24 Gratt. (65 Va.) 649; <em>Harvey </em>v. Com., 103 Va. 850, 49 S. E. 481; <em>Vance </em>v. Com., 155 Va. 1028, 154 S. E. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">As morally reprehensible as the conduct of the accused is shown by the evidence to have been, he may not be convicted of rape unless the evidence be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had intercourse with the prosecutrix by force and violence against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The judgment of the court will be reversed; and as the case of the Commonwealth seems to have been fully developed in the record here before us, it will be remanded with direction to the trial court to dismiss the accused from further prosecution under this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
