BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-24\">Con-Real Support Group, Inc. (\u201cCon-Real\u201d) contracted with the United States, acting through the Small Business Administration, to renovate two buildings at the Veterans\u2019 Administration Medical Center in Waco, Texas. As required by 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a(a), Con-Real secured a payment bond from St. Paul Mercury Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Company (\u201cSt. Paul\u201d). Con-Real subcontracted certain mechanical work (\u201cSubcontract\u201d) to Lochridge-Priest, Inc. (\u201cL-P\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">L-P substantially completed the work required by the Subcontract on January 15, 1990, seven months after the June 25, 1989 date set by the government. L-P sued Con-Real and St. Paul on the Miller Act payment bond and also brought state law contract and quantum meruit claims. Con-Real and St. Paul counterclaimed for breach of contract and delay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The district court entered judgment against Con-Real and St. Paul based on its findings that Con-Real failed to pay L-P $117,976.01 for amounts billed by L-P under the Subcontract and $1,682.00 for plumbing fixtures replaced by L-P because Con-Real caused the premature installation of the initial fixtures. The district court also held that L-P owed Con-Real $8,950.28 in damages for breach of contract for failing to perform certain work under the Subcontract. The parties do not challenge these portions of the court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The district court also entered judgment against Con-Real and St. Paul based on its findings that Con-Real required L-P to perform work in addition to that specified in the Subcontract: specifically, Con-Real demanded the submission of excessive data and the digging of an underground oxygen line.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Con-Real delayed L-P with its changes to the plumbing design, obstructed L-P\u2019s testing of heating and air conditioning equipment, and failed to provide L-P with proper sink vanity tops. Reasoning that L-P\u2019s delay claims were \u201cfor damages incurred due to disruptions and interference with its work,\u201d the district court held that L-P could recover these \u201cdelay expenses\u201d from Con-Real, but not from Miller Act surety St. Paul. The court also awarded L-P prejudgment and postjudgment interest on the joint judgment against Con-Real and St. Paul on the Subcontract and additional work claims, and on the judgment against Con-Real on the delay claim. The court subsequently granted L-P\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees on its state law contract claim against Con-Real.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Con-Real and St. Paul present four key issues on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment as to L-P's delay claim and prejudgment interest, affirm the judgment in all other respects, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">A. Extra Work Provided by L-P.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Con-Real challenges several of the district court's findings of fact regarding extra work provided by L-P. Con-Real argues that the record does not support the district court\u2019s findings that Con-Real required L-P to provide excessive submittal data on VAV boxes and sound attenuators and that Con-Real required L-P to perform additional work in hand-digging an under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ground oxygen line. (Am.F.Fact 14-16) We have reviewed the record in its entirety, and although we agree with Appellant that the evidence supports more than one inference, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">B. Delay by Con-Real.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Con-Real disputes the district court\u2019s findings of fact that Con-Real delayed L-P with plumbing design changes, obstructed L-P\u2019s testing of heating and air conditioning equipment, and failed to provide L-P with proper sink vanity tops. (Am.F.Fact 13, 17, 19) Con-Real asserts that L-P at least partially caused these delays, and thus cannot recover against Con-Real. As with the findings regarding extra work provided by L-P, the record supports the district court\u2019s findings of fact on these issues concerning Con-Real\u2019s delays.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We shift our attention to the district court\u2019s conclusion of law that \u201cclaims for delay expenses are not recoverable against a Miller Act surety.\u201d After the district court entered its amended findings of fact and conclusions of law and the parties in this case filed their briefs, we decided <em>United States ex rel. T.M.S. Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. The Craftsmen, Inc., </em>942 F.2d 946 (5th Cir.1991). Joining the District of Columbia and Eleventh Circuits, in <em>Millers Mutual </em>we held that a subcontractor can recover \u201c \u2018out-of-pocket costs of delay\u2019 \u201d from a Miller Act surety. <em>Id. </em>at 952 (citing <em>United States ex rel. Pertun Constr. Co. v. Harvesters Group, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 915, 918 (11th Cir.1990)). In awarding delay expenses against a Miller Act surety, however, the district court must first determine that the subcontractor did not cause the delay,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> then carefully limit the recovery to \u201ccosts <em>actually expended </em>in furnishing the labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). It has definitely been decided that delay expenses can be recovered against a Miller Act surety under the conditions set forth in <em>Millers Mutual. </em>We thus reverse the judgment as to liability for L-P\u2019s delay expenses and remand to allow the district court to apply <em>Millers Mutual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">C. Calculation of Prejudgment Interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The district court awarded prejudgment interest on L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim against the surety, St. Paul, and on L-P\u2019s state law claims against the contractor, Con-Real. After the district court reconsiders the issue of liability for L-P\u2019s delay expenditures, it will necessarily recalculate the prejudgment interest on the two judgments. We consider separately the liability of the Miller Act surety for prejudgment interest on the Miller Act claim and the liability of the contractor for prejudgment interest on the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">1. <em>Judgment based on the Miller Act Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">Although federal law governs the scope of the remedy available to a Miller Act claimant, including the amount of prejudgment interest, state law injects itself into the analysis because the Miller Act does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>not provide \u201cstandards for the allowance of prejudgment interest.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Ga. Elec. Supply Co. v. United States Fidelity and Guar. Co., </em>656 F.2d 993, 997 (5th Cir.Unit B 1981); <em>see United States ex rel. Canion v. Randall &amp; Blake, </em>817 F.2d 1188, 1193 (5th Cir.1987) (citing <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 128, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2164, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974)). Courts thus \u201clook to state law \u2018as a matter of convenience and practicality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia Electric, </em>656 F.2d at 997 (citation omitted). In this case, we must refer to Texas law to ascertain the standard for assessing prejudgment interest against a Miller Act surety. When the parties have not agreed on an interest rate, as in this case, Texas law allows \u201csix percent interest per annum ... on all accounts and contracts ascertaining the sum payable, commencing on the thirtieth (30th) day from and after the time when the sum is due and payable.\u201d Tex. Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5069-1.03 (Vernon 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The issue is when prejudgment interest awarded on a Miller Act claim based on a breach of contract theory begins to accrue \u2014 at what point in time did the sums comprising the judgment amount against the surety become \u201cdue and payable\u201d to LP? The district court consulted Texas law, reasoned that \u201c[t]he Miller Act provides that the subcontractor shall be paid in full \u2018ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by the [the subcontractor] or material was furnished or supplied by [the subcontractor],\u2019 \u201d and determined that each bill became \u201cdue and payable\u201d one hundred and twenty days after its billing date. <em>See </em>40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270b(a) (West 1986). The court thus awarded L-P six percent interest per annum on the judgment against Con-Real and St. Paul on L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim <em>and </em>the judgment against Con-Real on L-P\u2019s state law claims, beginning one hundred and twenty-one days \u201cafter the billing for each specific item\u201d and running until the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Con-Real and St. Paul argue that the Subcontract entitled L-P to final payment by Con-Real only after Con-Real received final payment from the government, and point out that the record does not reveal whether Con-Real ever received final payment from the government. Appellants assert that the district court erred in calculating interest without reference to when the payments became due under the terms of the Subcontract. L-P assumes that Con-Real and St. Paul\u2019s argument challenges only the calculation of prejudgment interest on L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim, and not the computation of interest on L-P\u2019s state law claims. L-P contends that the monthly amounts L-P billed to Con-Real for new work cannot be grouped into one sum and labeled a \u201cfinal payment\u201d subject to the restriction of final payment by the government to Con-Real under the Subcontract. L-P argues that payment must be made by Con-Real to L-P within a reasonable time, whether or not it receives payment by the government, and that the district court properly calculated prejudgment interest based on the \u201cdue dates\u201d provided to the court by L-P.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">When a subcontractor sues on a Miller Act payment bond, the subcontractor can recover all amounts unpaid for \u201clabor or material furnished in prosecution of the work provided for in such contract\u201d between the government and the contractor from the Miller Act surety. 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270b(a) (West 1986). The expiration of the ninety-day period that follows the subcontractor\u2019s final performance of labor or supply of materials merely creates a right to sue the surety on the payment bond for amounts recoverable under the Miller Act. It does not automatically transform all amounts recoverable under the Miller Act into sums \u201cdue and payable\u201d under Texas law. It plays no part in computing the amount of prejudgment interest allowable on the Miller Act claim, which is determined by reference to state law. And, contrary to Appellants\u2019 contention, the subcontractor can recover from the Miller Act surety for labor and material furnished in prosecution of the contract \u201cdespite nonpayment by the government to the contractor.\u201d <em>Millers Mutual, </em>942 F.2d at 949 n. 6 (citation omitted). Otherwise, the Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Act fails its essential purpose\u2014to provide security for suppliers of labor and material on government construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The issue of prejudgment interest is based on an entirely different analysis. Since the Miller Act turns us to Texas law, the question as to the assessment of prejudgment interest against a Miller Act surety is when the principal amount became \u201cdue and payable\u201d under the terms of the Subcontract, not whether that amount is recoverable against the surety under the Miller Act. This means that the subcontractor can recover prejudgment interest from the surety only on amounts \u201cdue and payable\u201d under the Subcontract, beginning thirty days after the sums became \u201cdue and payable.\u201d Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat.Ann. art. 5069-1.03 (Vernon 1987); <em>see United States ex rel. Seminole Sheet Metal Co. v. SCI, Inc., </em>828 F.2d 671, 678 (11th Cir.1987) (analyzing award of prejudgment interest under the Miller Act by reference to Florida law). If the government in this case has not made final payment to Con-Real, for example, then L-P is not entitled to prejudgment interest on its \u201cfinal payment\u201d because that final payment would not yet be \u201cdue\u201d under the Subcontract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand, the district court must determine when each amount incorporated in the judgment against Miller Act surety St. Paul became \u201cdue and payable\u201d under the Subcontract, and calculate the prejudgment interest commencing thirty days after that point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">L-P\u2019s quantum meruit theory apparently formed the basis for at least part of the district court\u2019s judgment on L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim. Prejudgment interest on amounts recoverable against a Miller Act surety based in quantum meruit and not on a breach of contract theory plainly cannot be assessed by reference to the Subcontract. The analytical framework for calculating prejudgment interest on the portion of the Miller Act claim based in quantum meruit, however, closely resembles that for assessing prejudgment interest on the portion of the Miller Act claim based on breach of contract theory because, again, we are guided by state law. The award of prejudgment interest against a Miller Act surety based in quantum meruit involves reference to Texas law because the Miller Act does not provide the methodology to compute the amount of allowable prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The district court must determine when the prejudgment interest awarded on a Miller Act claim based in quantum meruit begins to accrue under Texas law. Texas law allows a court to award prejudgment interest on a recovery in quantum meruit if the measure of the recovery was \u201cestablished as of a definite time\u201d and the amount of the recovery \u201cdefinitely determinable\u201d by a court under the rules of evidence and by reference to known standards of value. <em>Black Lake Pipe Line Co. v. Union Constr. Co., </em>538 S.W.2d 80, 95-96 (Tex.1976), <em>overruled on other grounds, Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>767 S.W.2d 686 (Tex.1989); <em>see Davidson v. Clearman, </em>391 S.W.2d 48, 52 (Tex.1965); <em>Williams v. Roberts, </em>621 S.W.2d 427, 429 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014San Antonio 1981, no writ); <em>McDaniel v. Tucker, </em>520 S.W.2d 543, 549 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1975, no writ). The interest commences from the date of the loss. <em>Black Lake Pipe, </em>538 S.W.2d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">2. <em>Judgment based on the State Law Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The aegis of the determination of prejudgment interest entails one analysis with respect to L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim and another with respect to L-P\u2019s state law claims. In this case, the analyses converge because the Miller Act incorporates the same state law standard used to properly assess prejudgment interest on L-P\u2019s state law claims. The district court must recompute the prejudgment interest on the judgment against Con-Real on L-P\u2019s state law claims in conformity with the standards explained above as to the portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>judgment based on breach of contract theory and that based in quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment as to prejudgment interest on L-P\u2019s Miller Act claim and L-P\u2019s state law claims and remand to enable the district court to recalculate prejudgment interest in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">D. Attorney\u2019s Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In its order granting L-P\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees on its state law contract claim against Con-Real, the district court noted \u201cthat Defendants have failed to respond to this motion.\u201d Con-Real now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. In <em>Pope v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., </em>937 F.2d 258, 267 &amp; n. 46 (5th Cir.1991), this Court held that a failure to contest a request for attorney\u2019s fees within the time allowed by the local rules meant that the nonprevailing party could \u201cnot raise the issue for the first time on appeal.\u201d Con-Real received a copy of L-P\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees two days before L-P filed the application, but did not respond within the ten days allowed by United States District Court for the Western District of Texas Local Rule CV-7(j)(2) for objections to such motions. The district court granted L-P\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees well after the ten-day period. Although Con-Real objected to L-P\u2019s application after the district court granted the motion, its objection was untimely under the local rule. Con-Real cannot raise its objections to L-P\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court as to L-P\u2019s delay claim and pre-judgment interest, AFFIRM the judgment in all other respects, and REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">. L-P does argue in its cross-appeal that the district court should have entered judgment against Con-Real for the net amount of its liability by offsetting the amount awarded in favor of L-P by the smaller amount awarded against L-P. The record indicates that L-P did not move to alter or amend the judgment on this ground, and we decline to entertain an issue more properly directed to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. We briefly pause to address an additional argument raised by Con-Real and St. Paul. Con-Real argues that the district court erroneously found that L-P did not cause certain expenses and delays. Absent clear error, we will not reverse findings of fact. <em>Brister v. A.W.I., Inc., </em>946 F.2d 350, 354 (5th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). The record supports the district court's findings on these factual issues: 1) L-P was not responsible for damage to a swimming pool steam line (Am.F.Fact 22; R.Vol. 3 at 97-98); 2) L-P was not responsible for installing heat trace tape (Am.F.Fact 24; R.Vol. 3 at 101-06; R.Vol. 5 at 391-92; Plaintiffs Exh. 38 at 2 art. 2, 39 at 66 If 1.1); 3) L-P was not responsible for delay of the completion of the Subcontract or the contract between Con-Real and the government (Am.F.Fact 26; R.Vol. 3 at 112-13, 117-20; R.Vol. 4 at 257, 263, 272-75; R.Vol. 5 at 283-84, 295-98, 319-21, 337-38, 340-44, 359-60, 373; R.Vol. 6 at 557-58, 563; Plaintiffs Exh. 66, 68, 92 at 43-55); 4) L-P was not responsible for certain expenses associated with the redesign of the air-conditioning duct work, specifically, the installation of two VAV boxes (Am.F.Fact 20; R.Vol. 5 at 330-33, 353-54; R.Vol. 6 at 406-07, 424-25).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\">. Each finding is supported by sufficient evidence: 1) Excessive submittal data on the VAV boxes (R.Vol. 3 at 53-56, Plaintiffs Exh. 40, 85 at 4, 27, 56-58); 2) Excessive submittal data on the sound attentuators (R.Vol. 3 at 57-62; R.Vol. 4 at 154-57, 161; Plaintiffs Exh. 39 at 20 \u00b6 B.3, 40, 87 at 5, 7, 20, 76; Plaintiffs Exh. 91 at 18); 3) Installation of underground oxygen line (R.Vol. 3 at 64-65; Plaintiffs Exh. 40, 76).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. The record shows that Con-Real delayed L-P with plumbing design changes (R.Vol. 3 at 43-44, 48-51; R.Vol. 4 at 145, 147-51; Plaintiffs Exh. 40, 43, 77 at 2-7, 91), Con-Real obstructed L-Fs testing of heating and air conditioning equipment (R.Vol. 3 at 35-37, 85-91; R. Vol. 4 at 174, 224-29; R. Vol. 5 at 319-20, 394; Plaintiffs Exh. 40, 50, 51, 54-56, 58 \u00b6 3, 59, 61, 68, 78 at 3, 7-9), and Con-Real delayed L-P by failing to provide L-P with proper sink vanity tops (R.Vol. 3 at 79-81; R.Vol. 4 at 170-71; Plaintiffs Exhibit 40, 50, 53, 57 \u00b6 8, 84 at 5). Furthermore, the record adequately demonstrates that L-P did not delay performance of the Subcontract or the contract between Con-Real and the government. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b369-15\">.As noted above, the district court found that L-P did not cause <em>any </em>delay in the completion of the Subcontract or the contract between Con-Real and the government. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">.
