EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">These appeals raise issues concerning the classification of methamphetamine as a Schedule II controlled substance, the double jeopardy implications of sentencing simultaneously under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d) and \u00a7 843(b), and a district court\u2019s sentencing discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">Appellants were charged jointly with illegal manufacture or possession of methamphetamine. Domingo Valdez Martinez (Martinez), Guadalupe Castro Jr. (Castro), and Raul Ybarra (Ybarra) each pled guilty to possession of phenylacetic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d). Each defendant conditioned his plea, however, on his ability to challenge the classification of methamphetamine as a Schedule II controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812. The district court sentenced all three defendants to ten years imprisonment and three years supervised release for their \u00a7 841(d) convictions. Martinez also pled guilty to an additional charge of using a telephone to facilitate the commission of a Title 21 felony, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). For this the district court sentenced Martinez to an additional four years imprisonment, to run consecutively with the ten-year sentence above. All three defendants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">All three appellants maintain that their indictment fails to state an offense because methamphetamine has been removed from Schedule II as a controlled substance. Appellants ground their challenge in the availability for over-the-counter sale of the products known by the trade names Rynal and Vicks Inhaler. Each of those products contains an isomer form of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(g)(1), the Attorney General \u201cshall by regulation exclude any non-narcotic substance from a schedule if such substance may, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, be lawfully sold over the counter without a prescription.\u201d The Attorney General delegated his authority under this statute to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1973. 38 Fed.Reg. 18380 (1973); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100(b). In 1976 the DEA removed Ry-nal and Vicks Inhaler from the list of nonnarcotic substances, even though they contain, respectively, dl-methamphetamine hydrochloride and 1-deoxyephedrine, diluted isomers of methamphetamine. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.22 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the descheduling of these forms of methamphetamine extends to all forms of methamphetamine because \u00a7 811(g) provides only for the exclusion of a \u201csubstance,\u201d and methamphetamine is the \u201csubstance\u201d at issue, not just Rynal or Vicks Inhaler.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-21\">The Eighth and Ninth Circuits have addressed this precise issue and held that the DEA\u2019s descheduling of Rynal and Vicks Inhaler did not amount to a descheduling of methamphetamine in general. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>States v. Durham, </em>941 F.2d 886, 889-90 (9th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Caperell, </em>938 F.2d 975, 978-79 (9th Cir.1991). <em>United States v. Roark, </em>924 F.2d 1426, 1428 (8th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Branch, </em>943 F.2d 1313 (5th Cir.1991) (unpublished) (relying on <em>Roark).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We agree with our sister circuits on this issue. The court in <em>Caperell, </em>in answering the same argument appellants advance here stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Rynal contains methamphetamine with a potency of .11 grams per 50 milliliters. We do not construe section 811 or its legislative history as evincing an intent of Congress that the Attorney General exclude all forms of methamphetamine from the criminal schedules of controlled substances simply because certain inert or nonabusive substances containing methamphetamine have been approved by the FDA for sale over the counter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU1\">Because methamphetamine is still properly classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, appellants\u2019 challenge to their \u00a7 841(d) convictions fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Appellant Martinez contends that his consecutive sentences under \u00a7\u00a7 841(d) and 843(b) constitute multiple punishments for the same offense and thus violate the rule against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). \u201cThe test to determine if two statutes prohibit the same offense is a matter of statutory construction; the court must determine whether each statute requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, [304,] 52 S.Ct. 180, [182,] 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>796 F.2d 60, 63 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1038, 107 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed.2d 846 (1987). Martinez contends that his conviction for use of a telephone to facilitate possession of the precursor chemical in this case and his conviction for possession of the precursor chemical did not require proof of separate facts. Martinez misapprehends the <em>Blockburger </em>test. \u201c[T]he <em>Blockburger </em>test is to be applied to the elements of proof required by the <em>statute </em>and not to the actual evidence or proof adduced at trial in a given case.\u201d <em>Davis v. Herring, </em>800 F.2d 513, 517 (5th Cir.1986) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Martinez\u2019s two offenses of conviction require different elements of proof. Conviction under \u00a7 843(b) requires proof that a defendant knowingly and intentionally used a communications facility to facilitate the commission of a narcotics offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1032 (5th Cir. Unit B Dec.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982). A conviction under \u00a7 841(d), however, requires proof that a defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed a precursor chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus not every violation of \u00a7 843(b) constitutes a violation of \u00a7 841(d), and vice versa. Martinez could be convicted under \u00a7 843(b) had he used the telephone to facilitate ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ther Castro\u2019s or Ybarra\u2019s possession of phenylacetic acid, without ever possessing the chemical himself. <em>United States v. Rey, </em>641 F.2d 222 n. 6 (5th Cir. Unit A March 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 861, 102 S.Ct. 318, 70 L.Ed.2d 160 (1981). Likewise, Martinez obviously could have possessed the precursor chemical without ever using the telephone. Thus Martinez\u2019s two convictions do not constitute one offense under the <em>Blockburger </em>test and his double jeopardy claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Martinez relies on <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), in arguing for a different result. In <em>Whalen, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a District of Columbia law that listed rape as one of six enumerated felonies that could form the predicate to a felony murder conviction. The Court held that Congress did not intend that consecutive sentences be imposed for both rape and felony murder for a killing committed in the course of the rape. Martinez argues that when we look at his specific indictment as the Court looked at the indictment in <em>Whalen, </em>Martinez\u2019s actions would constitute only one offense. The government does not deny that the identical proof was used to convict Martinez for both the \u00a7 841(d) charge (possession of phenylacetic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine) and the \u00a7 843(b) conviction (use of the telephone to facilitate the \u00a7 841(d) offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Martinez reads too much into <em>Whalen. </em>The majority, in footnote 8, expressly rejects Martinez\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Contrary to the view of the dissenting opinion we do not in this case apply the <em>Blockburger </em>rule to the facts alleged in a particular indictment.... We have simply concluded that for purposes of imposing cumulative sentences ... Congress intended rape to be considered a lesser offense included within the offense of a killing in the course of a rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ72\">Because neither of the offenses for which Martinez was sentenced is a lesser included offense of the other, <em>Whalen </em>does not control today\u2019s case. <em>See also United States v. McDonald, </em>692 F.2d 376, 379 n. 10 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1073, 103 S.Ct. 1531, 75 L.Ed.2d 952 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Finally, Martinez contends that his sentence must be vacated because the district court was unaware that it had the discretion to sentence Martinez to concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">The guideline range for Martinez\u2019s convictions exceeded the statutory maximum. The district court determined Martinez\u2019s offense level to be 36 and his criminal history category to be IV, yielding a sentencing range of 262-327 months imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines. The maximum punishment under the appropriate statutes, however, is only 168 months (120 months under \u00a7 841(d) and 48 months under \u00a7 843(b)). Thus the total maximum statutory sentence is below the minimum guideline sentence. The Sentencing Commission anticipated such an occurrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment. In all other respects sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.2(d) (Nov.1990). The district court followed this directive and sentenced Martinez to consecutive sentences of 120 months and 48 months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Martinez argues that the district court was unaware of its discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 to impose concurrent sentences in his case. Section 3584 provides that multiple sentences imposed on a defendant at the same time may run concurrently or consecutively and that the district court has the discretion to make this decision, taking into account various factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have previously addressed the apparent conflict between the seemingly mandatory language of \u00a7 5G1.2(d) and the discretion permitted by \u00a7 3584. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>903 F.2d 341 (5th Cir.1990).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>the court held that sentencing courts retain at least some discretion under \u00a7 3584 to impose a concurrent sentence, but that discretion is limited to the district court\u2019s power to depart from the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">As in <em>Miller, </em>\u201cwe can assume that the court\u2019s understanding to be that, under the guidelines, consecutive sentences were mandatory.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 345. The district court obviously was familiar with its authority to depart from the Guidelines, having just discussed (and rejected) that possibility when sentencing Ybarra a few minutes before. Also, Martinez made no objection to what he now contends are statements from the court reflecting a belief that it had no discretion to impose a concurrent sentence. We therefore hold, as in <em>Miller, </em>that the district \u201ccourt still recognized its power to impose concurrent sentences by departing from the guidelines\u201d and that its imposition of consecutive sentences was proper. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Accordingly, the convictions and sentences of all three appellants are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-15\">. Rynal has since been deleted from the list of substances descheduled under \u00a7 811(g). <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.22 (1991), which lists only Vicks Inhaler.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\">.

At sentencing, Martinez\u2019s counsel requested concurrent sentences on the two counts. The district court then sought the government's response to that request, and the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">MR.
