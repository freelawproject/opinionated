The cause therefore is ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b737-22\">BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">Petitioner-appellant appeals from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition, in which he claims that his perjury conviction is constitutionally invalid due to ineffective assistance of counsel caused by an actual and simultaneous conflict of interest. We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-24\">In connection with a large amphetamine manufacturing operation, petitioner was charged with a drug conspiracy and a conspiracy to carry or use firearms in connection with a drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Pursuant to a plea agreement, petitioner pled guilty to interstate transportation in aid of a racketeering enterprise. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. At the plea hearing, petitioner implicated Larry Lee Callihan, a codefendant, as the source of his compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner does not challenge this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">The government subsequently charged petitioner with perjury on the theory that petitioner had failed to acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>involvement of codefendant Darrel Glen Russell in the conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner pled guilty to the perjury charge on the promise that the government would not seek to invalidate the first plea agreement on the interstate transportation in aid of racketeering charge. Petitioner was sentenced to sixty months on the interstate transportation in aid of racketeering conviction, and an additional sixty months on the perjury conviction, to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On both convictions, petitioner was represented by attorney D.G.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> D.G. was retained by Greg Cox for petitioner and Cox paid D.G. a $5,000 fee. According to petitioner, D.G. could not represent him with undivided loyalty because Cox was implicated in the drug conspiracy (and was later indicted), and that fact was known by D.G. Petitioner now alleges that D.G. told him to keep Cox\u2019s name out of the proceedings and to implicate codefendant Callihan, who would testify for the government pursuant to a plea agreement. Petitioner informed the government of this prior to the plea agreement on the perjury charge, but did not so inform the district court at the second (perjury) plea hearing. However, petitioner has attached affidavits from his father and wife in which the affiants claim to have heard D.G. telling petitioner to implicate Callihan before the first plea hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I R. doc. 1, exs. A &amp; B. Petitioner further claims that he is factually innocent of the perjury charge, and that D.G. did not pursue proper defenses on the perjury charge because of two conflicts of interest. These conflicts of interest include D.G.\u2019s alleged personal involvement in suborning perjury at the first plea hearing and D.G.\u2019s alleged representation of Cox\u2019s interests from the outset. D.G. has disputed similar allegations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The magistrate recommended that the petition be denied without a hearing based upon a review of the pleadings in this case and in the underlying drug conspiracy and perjury cases. I R. doc. 7 at 2. <em>See also </em>R. 8(a) &amp; (b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. The magistrate relied on the plea hearings in which petitioner twice expressed satisfaction with his counsel and indicated an understanding of the consequences of perjury. Relying upon <em>Hedman v. United States, </em>527 F.2d 20, 22 (10th Cir.1975), the magistrate regarded petitioner\u2019s statements at the plea proceedings \u201cas conclusive in the absence of a believable, valid reason justifying a departure from the apparent truth of the statements.\u201d I R. doc. 7 at 2. The magistrate concluded that \u201c[pjetitioner\u2019s allegation that he was not represented by competent counsel is not supported by the plea transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The magistrate did not consider the performance, prejudice or waiver implications of petitioner\u2019s allegation of attorney conflict. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">The magistrate\u2019s recommendation indicated that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) and E.D.Okla.R. 32(d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthe parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>given ten (10) days from the above filing date [March 28, 1991] to file with the Clerk of Court any objections, with supporting brief.\u201d I R. doc. 7 at 4. <em>See also </em>R. 8(b)(2) &amp; (3), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. The memorandum containing the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendation failed to apprise petitioner of the consequences of failing to file objections, namely waiver of appellate review. On April 19, 1991, the district court noted that no objections had been filed and adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Although we plainly have jurisdiction over this appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253, 2255, we have adopted a firm waiver rule when a party fails to object to the findings and recommendations of the magistrate. <em>Niehaus v. Kansas Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>793 F.2d 1159, 1164-65 (10th Cir.1986); <em>Boyd Motors, Inc. v. Employers Ins., </em>880 F.2d 270, 271 (10th Cir.1989). <em>See also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 146, 106 S.Ct. 466, 470, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Our waiver rule provides that the failure to make timely objection to the magistrate\u2019s findings or recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The waiver rule as a procedural bar need not be applied when the interests of justice so dictate. <em>Thomas, </em>474 U.S. at 155,106 S.Ct. at 474. In this case, however, we need not decide whether the interests of justice exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We join those circuits that have declined to apply the waiver rule to a pro se litigant\u2019s failure to object when the magistrate\u2019s order does not apprise the pro se litigant of the consequences of a failure to object to findings and recommendations. <em>Small v. Secretary, HHS, </em>892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Valencia-Copete, </em>792 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1986); <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 846-47 (4th Cir.1985). <em>See also </em>7 James W. Moore, Jo D. Lucas &amp; Kent Sinclair, Jr., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 72.04[9.\u20146] (1991) &amp; <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1111 (10th Cir.1991) (district courts should provide notice to pro se litigants of certain complex procedural issues). In proceedings in which a party appears without benefit of counsel, we shall exercise our supervisory power and require magistrates within the circuit to inform a pro se litigant not only of the time period for filing objections, but also of the consequences of a failure to object, i.e. waiver of the right to appeal from a judgment of the district court based upon the findings and recommendations of the magistrate. <em>See Arn, </em>474 U.S. at 144, 155, 106 S.Ct. at 469, 474. <em>Cf. United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947, 950 (6th Cir.1981). This notice should be included in the text of the document containing the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations. <em>Valencia-Copete, </em>792 F.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, \u00a7 2255 provides for an evidentiary hearing \u201c[u]nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d In reviewing petitioner\u2019s claims, we must first decide whether \u201cpetitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Barboa, 777 </em>F.2d 1420, 1423 (10th Cir.1985). If so, the district court\u2019s summary denial of an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Notwithstanding the strong presumption of truth accorded petitioner\u2019s in-court statements at the perjury plea hearing, <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1629, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977), the analysis relied upon by the district court is incomplete. The court below framed the ineffective assistance issue solely as one of attorney competence, and did not address the attorney conflict issues not only inherent in these facts, but also squarely presented by petitioner. <em>See, e.g., Wood v. Georgia, </em>450 U.S. 261, 268-69, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1102, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981) (\u201cCourts and commentators have recognized the inherent dangers that arise when a criminal defendant is represented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party, particularly when the third party is the operator of the alleged criminal enterprise.\u201d); <em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 489-90, 98 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) (\u201cJoint representation of conflicting interests is suspect because of what it tends to prevent the attorney from doing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">A defendant making an ineffectiveness claim on a counseled guilty plea must identify particular acts and omissions of counsel tending to prove that counsel\u2019s advice was not within the wide range of professional competence. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56-57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369-70, 88 L.Ed.2d 203; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The defendant must also show prejudice, \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. at 370. The performance inquiry is made with deference to counsel\u2019s assistance, but in recognition that the validity of a guilty plea depends upon a defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary choice among alternatives. <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 369; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Notwithstanding the highly deferential review of counsel\u2019s performance required in an ineffectiveness claim, a defendant\u2019s right to counsel may be compromised by conflict. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (\u201cCounsel\u2019s function is to assist defendant, and hence counsel owes the client a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Tatum, </em>943 F.2d 370, 376-79 (4th Cir.1991) (compromise in pretrial proceedings); <em>Church v. Sullivan, </em>942 F.2d 1501, 1510 (10th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Bowie, </em>892 F.2d 1494, 1500 (10th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Winkle, </em>722 F.2d 605, 608-09 (10th Cir.1983). The right to conflict-free representation extends to plea proceedings, including investigation and negotiation. <em>See Bridges v. United States, </em>794 F.2d 1189, 1192 (7th Cir.1986); <em>Osborn v. Shillinger, </em>861 F.2d 612, 626 (10th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>790 F.2d 803, 811 (10th Cir.1986). A defendant is entitled to a presumption of prejudice if he can prove that his lawyer \u201c \u2018actively represented conflicting interests\u2019 and that \u2018an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067 (quoting <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 348, 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1718, 1719). <em>See also Church, </em>942 F.2d at 1510; <em>Bowie, </em>892 F.2d at 1500; <em>Winkle, </em>722 F.2d at 609. Alternatively, a defendant may prove prejudice by proving \u201cthat his attorney was so inadequate that he was effectively denied the benefit of a full adversarial testing of his guilt.\u201d <em>Osborn, </em>861 F.2d at 626. If a defendant would have elected a trial, but an improper motivation precluded counsel from evaluating this alternative and advising defendant, a defendant has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">An ineffectiveness-due-to-conflict claim is waived if defendant \u201cconsciously chose to proceed with trial counsel, despite a known conflict to which the defendant could have objected but chose to disregard.\u201d <em>Winkle, </em>722 F.2d at 612 n. 12. <em>See also Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 483 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. at 1178 n. 5; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>Church, </em>942 F.2d at 1512; <em>Bridges, </em>794 F.2d at 1193. Though waiver is surely an issue, at this stage we conclude that petitioner would prevail on his ineffectiveness claim if he could prove the conflicts alleged and disprove the government\u2019s waiver contentions. Petitioner is alleging that D.G.\u2019s representation on the perjury charge was compromised by two conflicts and that one or both conflicts, rather than professionally competent considerations, motivated D.G. to urge petitioner to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims frequently are raised by collateral attack as the implications of trial counsel\u2019s performance are realized. <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 378, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2584, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986); <em>Osborn v. Shillinger, </em>861 F.2d 612, 622-23 (10th Cir.1988). Some ineffectiveness claims cannot be resolved with sole reference to the record including regular plea proceedings. <em>Beaulieu v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 805, 807-08 (10th Cir.1991). Here, factual disputes and inconsistencies beyond the record exist; thus, a hearing is needed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>D.G., who apparently has a very different view of the representation, <em>see supra </em>n. 5, has not been heard in this forum. Some, but not all, of the facts alleged support waiver.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Bridges v. United States, </em>794 F.2d 1189, 1194 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">On remand, the district court should hold an evidentiary hearing given the allegations of actual conflict and a breakdown in the adversary process. <em>See Wood, </em>450 U.S. at 273-74, 101 S.Ct. at 1104-05; <em>Bowie, </em>892 F.2d at 1502; <em>Winkle, </em>722 F.2d at 605. A hearing is necessary because of the need to consider extra-record facts concerning counsel\u2019s representation of petitioner. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 494-95, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513-14, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 20, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1079, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); <em>United States v. Estrada, </em>849 F.2d 1304, 1306 (10th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>839 F.2d 648, 652 (10th Cir.1988). The district court should proceed in accordance with \u00a7 2255 and R. 8, Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings, and consider (1) whether actual conflicts existed, (2) which adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance, and if so, (3) whether petitioner made a valid waiver. <em>See Wood, </em>450 U.S. at 273-74, 101 S.Ct. at 1104-05; <em>Bowie, </em>892 F.2d at 1502; <em>Winkle, </em>722 F.2d at 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-26\">. Petitioner subsequently admitted to the prosecutor that he had lied at his plea proceeding by implicating Callihan as the source of his compensation when in fact, it was Greg Cox.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\">. Russell was acquitted, and the government attributes its lack of success to petitioner's perjury. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. We refer to counsel as \"D.G.\" given the unproven nature of the allegations. <em>See Bridges v.

These affidavits contain other conclusory information which does not appear to be based on personal knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">. Petitioner filed a professional misconduct complaint against D.G. with the General Counsel of the State Bar of Texas. Petitioner has attached D.G.\u2019s letter response to the complaint to his petition. I R. doc. 1, ex. C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-14\">.E.D.Okla.R. 32(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\"><em>Civil Cases</em>\u2014Dispositive <em>Matters. </em>Pursuant to 28 USC Section 636(b)(1)(B) a District Judge may designate a Magistrate to conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearings, and to submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition of any of the motions excepted from Rule 32(c), and the Magistrate shall file his proposed findings and recommendations with the Court, mailing copies thereof to all parties who shall have ten (10) days after service thereof to serve and file specific written objections thereto. If no such objections Eire filed, the Magistrate\u2019s findings may be accepted by the District Judge and appropriate orders entered without further notice.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. The failure to object does not waive issues concerning the magistrate's jurisdiction, however. <em>Clark v.

Petitioner admits that he was aware of one conflict from the outset \u2014 that D.G. was retained by Cox, who allegedly was involved in the offense. When questioned by the prosecutor after the first plea agreement, petitioner confessed that he had lied and attributed the lie to D.G. He reported that Cox had paid D.G.
