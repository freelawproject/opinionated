Both motions seek dismissal of all claims set out in the Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint filed by Plaintiff Wild Fish Conservancy (\"WFC\" or \"the Conservancy\"), Dkt No. 57. Having reviewed the briefs, declarations, and exhibits filed in support of and opposition to these motions, and having heard oral argument by the parties, the Court finds and rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

At issue is whether the Federal Defendants in this case have met their consultation obligations under Section 7 of the ESA in their review of Washington's sediment-related water quality standards adopted under the CWA. In particular, Plaintiff's complaint focuses on the potential effects of those standards, and the commercial salmon farms Plaintiff alleges they enable, on threatened salmonid species in Puget Sound. Plaintiff's claims can be grouped into two independent theories of recovery: (1) that the Federal Defendants' consultation in 2011 regarding the effects of Washington's revisions to its water quality standards did not meet the requirements of the ESA and must be performed again; and (2) that regardless of the adequacy of the 2011 consultation, events since 2011 have occurred that trigger the Federal Defendants' duty to reinitiate a consultation regarding those same standards. Plaintiff's objective in this lawsuit is to obtain a court order directing the Federal Defendants to consult, using the best science currently available, on the potential effects of Washington's revisions to its sediment quality standards on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. The Defendants deny that the 2011 consultation was inadequate, and claim they lack authority to reinitiate consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the CWA, states are directed to develop, adopt, implement, and periodically, to revise, a variety of standards governing the waters within their boundaries; EPA in turn is directed to review those standards and revisions, approve or disapprove them, or in some circumstances promulgate its own.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20131.20\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the first, the\n    Conservancy claims that EPA's consultation with NMFS in 2011 regarding revisions to Washington's water quality standards was inadequate, and that NMFS's concurrence in EPA's approval was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Sec. Am. Suppl. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. Plaintiff's second and third causes of action claim that EPA and NMFS, respectively, violated the ESA by failing to reinitiate consultation regarding the likely effects of the approval of the 1996 revisions, in light of recent events related to the salmon farms.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n     \u00b6\u00b6 84-88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Intervenor-Defendant Cooke also argues the Conservancy's first and fourth causes of action are barred by\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , based on a 2010 decision of this Court involving the same parties and similar claims at issue here. All Defendants argue that the federal agencies have no duty to reinitiate consultation because EPA lacks the \"discretionary involvement and control\" over the approval action necessary to trigger such duty, and NMFS lacks the authority to reinitiate consultation under any circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Legal Framework\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     1.

In 2010, in a ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, Judge Coughenour held that EPA and NMFS had violated the ESA by failing to use the \"best available scientific and commercial data\" in their informal consultation process. Judge Coughenour ruled on narrow grounds, finding that the agencies' failure to consider two NMFS studies, the Salmon Recovery Plan and Orca Recovery Plan, was sufficient grounds for setting aside EPA's 2008 consultation and approval. He ordered the federal agencies to reconsider their concurrence that a formal consultation was not required, \"this time taking into account the best available science.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *8. Because the narrow finding was sufficient basis for setting aside the approval and requiring EPA to conduct the process anew, Judge Coughenour declined to rule on the parties' remaining arguments.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In 2011, this time incorporating the two additional studies (and several other documents not considered in 2008), EPA again approved the 1996 revisions. EPA did so having again found, in informal consultation with and concurrence from NMFS, that the revisions were \"not likely to adversely affect listed species.\" Sec. Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 60-63. Again, EPA concluded it was not necessary to conduct a formal consultation as to whether its approval of Washington's 1996 sediment management revisions would affect threatened Puget Sound salmonids. It is this informal consultation, and EPA's approval resulting from it, that Plaintiff challenges in this lawsuit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    As a distinct, independent theory of recovery, Plaintiff also challenges the Federal Defendants' failure to reinitiate consultation under the ESA, as discussed above, in response to events that have occurred since the 2011 approval. The events include, in 2012, an outbreak of an infectious virus (\"IHNv\") at several of the salmon farms which, Plaintiff alleges, served to amplify transmission to and among wild salmon populations. Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-48. A second event that Plaintiff alleges should have triggered the Federal Defendants' duty to reinitiate consultation was the collapse of one of Defendant-Intervenor's net pens in August 2017, resulting in the release of between 160,000 and 305,000 Atlantic salmon into Puget Sound.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 73-77.

Additionally, in 2016 NMFS designated a critical habitat for listed Puget Sound Steelhead; Plaintiff claims this action too should have triggered reinitiation of consultation.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 70.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

Those two causes of action challenge, respectively, NMFS's \"informal consultation with EPA that concluded with NMFS's April 8, 2011, concurrence letter\" and EPA's alleged failure to ensure no jeopardy to listed species based, in part, on its 2011 approval of the Washington water quality standards.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Sec.

The claims in that amended complaint related to EPA's 2008 approval of revisions to the standards, and challenged the approval on multiple grounds. Ultimately, Judge Coughenour found it necessary to rule on only one, finding that \"the Fisheries Service and EPA ignored a salmon recovery plan and an orca recovery plan\" constituting the best available science at the time, and holding that in doing so, \"the agencies thereby ran afoul of the Endangered Species Act.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. Based on this finding, Judge Coughenour set aside EPA's 2008 approval, and ordered the defendants \"to re-consider whether formal consultation is required\"-in other words, to conduct an informal consultation again to determine whether EPA's approval would be likely to adversely affect listed species-\"this time taking into account the best available science.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *8.

While Cooke attempts to elide the two events-\"As it does here, [in\n    <em>\n     WFC I\n    </em>\n    ] Plaintiff challenged EPA's 2008 approval of the net pen sediment management standards\"-it\n    simply cannot be said that the claims here \"arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.\" Plaintiff is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    challenging the EPA's 2008 approval in the case now before this Court.

The 2011 consultation was not a mere\n    <em>\n     pro forma\n    </em>\n    repeat of the 2008 consultation, with the added consideration of two discrete studies as ordered by Judge Coughenour. According to Cooke, the second consultation was in fact a materially different process. Distinct from the 2008 consultation, the 2011 consultation included a review of the two recovery plans, plus \"the science concerning the risk of sea lice infestations in Puget Sound\" and \"217 publications related to marine finfish rearing collected by Plaintiff that it submitted\n    <em>\n     after NMFS had rendered its concurrence in 2008\n    </em>\n    ....

Other than the narrow question of whether the agencies used the best available science in the 2008 consultation by failing to rely on the salmon and orca recovery plans, none of the Conservancy's other claims in\n    <em>\n     WFC I\n    </em>\n    can be said to have been litigated to final judgment. Cooke asserts that \"[f]ollowing production of a 2,677-page record, Judge Coughenour ruled ... that EPA's consultation with NMFS under the ESA was inadequate for a single reason,\" and \"[a]fter a full review of the extensive record ...

On the contrary, Judge Coughenour took pains to clarify that he was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    holding that aside from the omission of the two recovery plans, the agencies' consultation was based on the best available science and therefore legally adequate.

The Agency's position that it had no duty to consult appears to be based on two distinct premises: (1) there was no \"agency action\" for ESA purposes because the approval did not \"authorize, fund, or carry out the permitting or licensing of net pens, [or] establish specific requirements for net pens,\" Fed.

The Agency, however, has failed to articulate why the Court should disregard EPA's two prior consultations, the aforementioned admissions, and Judge Coughenour's previous holding in\n    <em>\n     WFC I\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, the fundamental flaw in EPA's \"baseline\" and \"but-for cause\" arguments is that under the CWA, EPA must review and approve\n    <em>\n     or disapprove\n    </em>\n    the revisions. While an approval may not have changed the standards governing Washington waters, a disapproval certainly would have. The Agency's position-which would have the question of whether or not an agency has a duty to consult turn on the outcome of a consultation-borders on the frivolous. The Court therefore reaffirms that EPA's review and approval process of the 1996 revisions was an \"agency action\" under the ESA, triggering EPA's duty to consult with NMFS pursuant to Section 7(a) of the ESA, and that such consultation necessarily includes the effects of net pens, including potential disease and escapement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     EPA Retained Sufficient \"Discretionary Involvement or Control\" Over the Action to Implement Measures to Benefit Listed Species\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In addition to the duty to consult on any discretionary action that may affect a listed species, the ESA also imposes a duty to reinitiate consultation of prior actions under certain circumstances, including, of relevance to this case, when \"new information reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered,\" or \"a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the identified action.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.16\">\n     50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) &amp; (d).

Moreover, as both\n    <em>\n     EPIC\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Cottonwood\n    </em>\n    make clear, the \"agency action\" cannot be defined, as EPA urges, as the discrete moment of approval.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cottonwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/\">\n     789 F.3d at 1086\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]here is nothing in the ESA or its implementing regulations that limits reinitiation to situations where there is 'ongoing agency action.' \");\n    <em>\n     EPIC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090591\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1073/\">\n     255 F.3d at 1080\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (looking to \"various permit documents\" to determine whether agency retained authority \"to make\n    <em>\n     new requirements\n    </em>\n    to protect species that subsequently might be listed as endangered or threatened\") (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Thus, the question here is whether EPA retains discretionary involvement or control over its approval of the sediment management standards such that in the event a jeopardy to a listed species arises, EPA has authority to take action that will inure to the benefit of that species.

The MOA demonstrates that in the event a consultation with NMFS were to reveal a potential jeopardy, EPA has the authority to confer with a state on standards EPA has approved; to unilaterally revise that state's standards in the event the state refused to do so; and even, EPA claims, to revise criteria enumerated in the regulations for deciding whether to approve or disapprove proposed standards in the first place.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C202\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C202\">\n     at 11,205\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . (EPA could \"revise\n    the criteria if it determines that more stringent criteria were in fact needed to protect endangered and threatened species.\"). While it is true that the CWA grants individual states a great deal of discretion in implementing water standards, it is undeniable that the statute also reserves substantial \"discretionary involvement and control\" for EPA. The Court is unable to discern a reasonable, material distinction between the involvement and control outlined in EPA's own documents, and the ability to \"revisit\" an approval that EPA now disclaims in this litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Other EPA documents confirm EPA's understanding of its own authority under the CWA to continue to influence state water quality standards to the benefit of listed species, even after the approval process is complete. The \"Policy Memo on Water Quality Standards Approvals and Endangered Species Act (ESA) Consultations\" was intended as a guide for circumstances in which EPA has approved a standard but explicitly reserved the right to revise the approval pending the results of an ESA consultation-a situation that is not presented here. The memo indicates, however, that \"[a]s a general matter,\" EPA has the authority to make use of the \"full range of options available under Section 303(c) of the CWA for ensuring water quality standards are protective of threatened and endangered species,\" including \"work[ing] with the State or authorized Tribe to obtain revisions to the standards in the next triennial review ... [or] facilitat[ing] a more narrow set of revisions to the standards in the short term.\" Third Knutsen Decl., Ex. 3 at 3. The memo emphasizes that EPA should \"make [ ] clear\" that \"EPA approval of water quality standards is not irreversible or irretrievable because the Agency retains substantial discretion to revise its decision based on the results of the consultation,\" and \"[i]f clear and compelling information from the consultation indicates more immediate action is necessary to prevent a loss of threatened or endangered species, EPA can make a determination under CWA Section 303(c)(4)(B) that a revised or new standard is necessary\" or change an approval to a disapproval.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C202\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The memo does not reflect a position that this discretion exists only under limited circumstances, as Defendants argue; it directs its water division directors to \"make clear\" that the authority over a prior approval exists \"as a general matter.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Taken together, the MOA and Policy Memo clearly demonstrate EPA's ongoing \"discretionary involvement\" in state water quality standards under the CWA-including standards it has already approved-and EPA's explicit reservation of the right to influence those standards for the benefit of listed species. These documents confirm that EPA is not limited to sitting helplessly by if a consultation were to reveal that in fact EPA's approval of Washington's revisions may adversely affect listed species. The Agency-in its own estimation-has a host of options at its disposal, ranging from \"working with\" Washington to develop new standards, to promulgating new regulations governing the CWA approval process.

The regulation outlining the duty to reinitiate consultation, as referenced above, provides \"[r]einitiation of formal consultation is required and shall be requested by the Federal agency or by the Service, where discretionary Federal involvement or control over the action has been retained or is authorized by law\" and one of four triggering events occurs.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.16\">\n     50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Because by its plain language the provision that obligates EPA to reinitiate consultation applies equally to NMFS, and because this question appears to be amply settled in this Circuit, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action on this basis as well.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hoopa Valley Tribe v.

Section 402.16 ], the Ninth Circuit has stated that the duty to reinitiate consultation lies with both the action agency and the consulting agency.... The federal defendants' effort to distinguish this clear precedent is wholly unpersuasive. Formal consultation is a collaborative process that requires the participation of both the Bureau and NMFS. The purpose of reinitiating formal consultation is not simply to check off a procedural box, but to complete a formal consultation process that ensures to the extent possible that there are no substantive violations of the ESA. Both the NMFS and Bureau have a clear obligation to participate in and complete this reinitiation process. As the Ninth Circuit has already held, '[t]he duty to reinitiate consultation lies with both the action agency and the consulting agency.' The defendants' claim that a reinitiation claim is not cognizable against NMFS fails.\"),\n    <em>\n     citing\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Salmon Spawning\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857848\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/1220/#p1229\">\n     545 F.3d at 1229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Whether or not these statements are\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    , as Defendants claim, the overwhelming weight of authority is that the consulting agency's duty to reinitiate consultation is coterminous with that of the action agency, and Defendants have not cited a single case holding to the contrary.

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Federal Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.

Defendants have not answered Plaintiff's most recent Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint, which was filed on December 17, 2017, based on this Court's direction that they need do so only if, and within 14 days after, this Court denies the Defendants' motions to dismiss. Given this unusual order of proceedings, Federal Defendants make their 12(c) motion, in the alternative, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Court need not decide the appropriate governing rule, however, as the standard is the same.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     The Court notes that Plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action is also based in part on EPA's alleged failure to reinitiate consultation in light of 2012, 2016, and 2017 events, which Cooke does not (and could not) argue was resolved in 2010; a ruling in Cooke's favor on the\n     <em>\n      res judicata\n     </em>\n     issue at this stage would not, therefore, result in dismissal of this claim.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Sec.

In its surreply, the Conservancy claims \"Cooke argues for the first time in its Reply that a 1998 order from the Washington's [\n     <em>\n      sic\n     </em>\n     ] Pollution Control Hearings Board, [ (\"PCHB\"),] precludes 'issues' in this case.\" Pl. Surreply at 2. In its Reply, Cooke does refer to a \"1997 PCHB Decision,\" which the Court understands to be a reference to the PCHB \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order\" entered in 1998, filed as Exhibit 2 to the Spencer Declaration at Dkt. No. 73.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Cooke Reply at 9. Cooke claims that the \"PCHB heard multiple expert witnesses over eighteen days of hearings, and ruled against Plaintiff on all issues.\" The Conservancy objects to Cooke raising this argument for the first time on reply, which is appropriate grounds for this Court to strike it.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Bach v.

Wash. 2007) (\"It is well established in this circuit that courts will not consider new arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\"). The Court finds Cooke's intention in referencing the PCHB decision, however, unclear. Cooke does not cite specific language in the 45-page document, or propose any legal framework by which it may be asking the Court to assess the import of the decision, and the Court declines to wade through the decision to discern one.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-77\">\n     EPA's reliance on\n     <em>\n      National Association of Home Builders v.
