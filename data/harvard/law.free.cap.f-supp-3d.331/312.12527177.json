Conroy, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 31, 2017, Plaintiff Soojung Jang, Ph.D., a citizen and resident of Seoul, Republic of Korea, commenced this libel and defamation action against the Trustees of St. Johnsbury Academy (the Academy) and Kingdom Development Company, Inc. (KDC). (Doc. 1.) The Academy and KDC were part of a successful effort to establish the St. Johnsbury Academy-Jeju on Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea, which opened in late October 2017. (Doc. 8 at 7.) On July 16, 2016, prior to the opening of the school, an attorney for the Academy and KDC sent a letter to the Governor of the Jeju Provincial Office of Education detailing Dr. Jang's purported efforts in the Republic of Korea and the United States to undermine the establishment of the school. In Dr. Jang's Complaint, she claims that the letter's contents are libelous and defamatory and that she suffered actual, special, and punitive damages as a result of the letter's publication. (Doc. 1 at 4-5, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is the Academy and KDC's Joint Motion to Strike the Complaint pursuant to Vermont's anti-SLAPP statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. Tit. 12, \u00a7 1041 (2006), (Doc. 8), and their Joint Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Failure to State a Claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Doc. 11.) Dr. Jang responded in opposition to both motions, (Docs. 12, 15), and the Academy and KDC filed two replies. (Docs. 20, 21.) A hearing on the motions was held on February 20, 2018, and the parties subsequently filed supplemental memoranda. (Docs. 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Concluding that the evidence submitted by the Academy and KDC does not demonstrate that the letter involved a public issue under the Vermont Supreme Court's narrow interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%201041\">\n    Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court DENIES the Academy and KDC's joint Motion to Strike the Complaint. (Doc. 8.) Further, because Dr. Jang's Complaint does not plausibly allege claims for defamation or interference with a professional relationship, the Court GRANTS the Academy and KDC's Joint Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim. (Doc. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has previously treated a motion to strike as analogous to a summary judgment motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bible &amp; Gospel Trust v.

Vt. July 18, 2008). As a result, in analyzing the Motion to Strike, the Court relies on the documents provided by the Academy and KDC in support of their Motion to Strike. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docs. 8, 8-1-8-24). In deciding the Academy and KDC's Motion to Dismiss, the Court accepts as true the factual assertions stated in Dr. Jang's Complaint and the letter attached to the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desiano v.

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 1-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case involves the establishment of a school on Jeju Island, a province in the Republic of Korea (South Korea). Government-sponsored development on Jeju Island is controlled by the Jeju Free International City Development Center (the City Development Center), a corporation owned by the South Korean Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs. (Doc. 8-2 at 5, \u00a7 a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 2, \u00b6 8.) One of the City Development Center's projects is the Jeju Global Education City, a plan to create a \"vibrant global education city\" by establishing several international schools in a specific area on Jeju Island. (Doc. 8-2 at 1, \u00a7 b.) To own and operate the international schools in the Global Education City, the City Development Center established Haewul, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the City Development Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, \u00a7 d;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 2, \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Jang is a resident of Seoul, South Korea, where she is a professor of general education. She is a member of the Establishment and Operation of International Schools Subcommittee (the Establishment Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the Jeju Provincial Office of Education. (Doc. 1 at 3, \u00b6 23.) Dr. Jang is also a member of Jeju Solidarity for Participatory Self Government and Environmental Preservation (Jeju Solidarity), a community organization focused on ensuring that the educational goals of the Global Education City are met. (Doc. 1 at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Academy operates a non-profit private school located in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, and owns a majority of stock in KDC, a Vermont for-profit corporation. (Doc. 1 at 1, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 7; Doc. 8 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Project and Dr. Jang's Initial Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Proposal and Cooperative Venture Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the spring of 2012, the City Development Center requested proposals for the establishment of a new international school in the Global Education City. (Doc. 8 at 2.) The Academy and KDC responded to this request, and the City Development Center ultimately proposed a joint venture with the Academy and KDC to establish and operate a new school known as St. Johnsbury Academy-Jeju (SJA-Jeju). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a\n   result, on November 29, 2012, the City Development Center, Haewul, the Academy, and KDC entered into a confidential cooperative venture agreement setting forth the terms of their joint project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By the agreement's terms, the City Development Center would appoint a developer to construct the school in the Global Education City and, upon construction of the school, sell or lease the building to Haewul. (Doc. 8-2 at 6, \u00a7\u00a7 e, g.) The Academy would grant Haewul a license to use the Academy's intellectual property rights in connection with the promotion and operation of SJA-Jeju and, in consideration, Haewul would pay royalties to the Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00a7 h,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, \u00a7 9.3.) Further, KDC would perform certain administrative and management functions for SJA-Jeju, such as ensuring that SJA-Jeju met the standards of the St. Johnsbury Academy in Vermont. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00a7 i,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, \u00a7 5.) In turn, Haewul would pay a management fee to KDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, \u00a7 9.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Further Review and Approval of SJA-Jeju\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the City Development Center, Haewul, the Academy, and KDC had entered into the cooperative venture agreement, the project could not move forward without being approved by the Jeju Provincial Office of Education, the body charged with reviewing and approving schools in the Global Education City. (Doc. 8 at 4.) To this end, the Provincial Office of Education formed the Establishment Subcommittee, which was charged with reviewing and approving the SJA-Jeju project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As noted above, at the relevant times, Dr. Jang was a member of this subcommittee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 1 at 3, \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. China Daily and Korea Times Articles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 6, 2013, China Daily published an article describing the development on Jeju Island. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-11.) The article generally described the City Development Center's mission to create a free international city like Hong Kong or Singapore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Among the numerous projects described in the article, the article briefly noted that the City Development Center had formed partnerships with three international schools: North London Collegiate School; Branksome Hall; and St. Johnsbury Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The article stated in passing that SJA-Jeju was expected to open in September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, an article in the Korea Times published on July 24, 2013, described the City Development Center's plan to establish seven international schools on Jeju Island by 2021. (Doc. 8-12 at 2.) The article succinctly stated that three schools had already opened on a trial basis and that SJA-Jeju was expected to open in September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Neither article mentioned a public controversy surrounding the establishment of the schools, nor did the articles mention Dr. Jang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Dr. Jang's Presentation to the Establishment Subcommittee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SJA-Jeju was not yet open on January 15, 2016, when Dr. Jang submitted a \"Summary of Preliminary Investigation\" to the Provincial Office of Education and presented the information to the Establishment Subcommittee. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-1 at 3, \u00b6 7.) Dr. Jang generally alleged in the summary that the relationship between KDC and the Academy was established to protect the Academy's non-profit tax status, that the Academy and KDC did not bear any risk if SJA-Jeju failed, and that the Academy and KDC lacked experience establishing and operating international schools. (Doc. 8-3 at 3-5.) She recommended further investigation by the Jeju Provincial Office of\n   Education; in particular, she stated that the Office of Education should seek additional records relating to the business characteristics and tax status of KDC and the Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Dr. Jang's Investigation in the United States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 1, 2016, Dr. Jang sought information regarding the governance of private schools from the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) in the United States. (Doc. 8-4 at 9-10.) In particular, Dr. Jang sought information regarding an independent school's procedures for approving \"a franchised school in foreign country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Attorney Debra Wilson, the Chief Counsel of NAIS, responded to Dr. Jang's request and explained that the procedures depended on the school board and the school's structure and bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) After further email correspondence with Dr. Jang regarding the specific business structure of the Academy and KDC and their relationship with SJA-Jeju, Attorney Wilson offered to reach out to the Academy and KDC on behalf of Dr. Jang. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) As a result, Attorney Wilson investigated Dr. Jang's claims; according to the Academy and KDC, Attorney Wilson concluded in a February 10, 2016 letter that Dr. Jang's claims had no merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 a; Doc. 8-1 at 4, \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Other Activities in Vermont Involving the Academy and KDC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At approximately the same time, in late January and early February 2016, the Academy and KDC claim that an unknown South Korean party contacted both the Vermont Department of Education and a private Vermont attorney. (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 b; Doc. 8-1 at 3, \u00b6 8; Doc. 8-17 at 1, \u00b6 2.) Allegedly, the unknown party requested help seeking documents relating to the cooperative venture agreement and the tax exempt status of the Academy. (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 b; Doc. 8-1 at 3, \u00b6 8; Doc. 8-17 at 1, \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Establishment Subcommittee Hearing\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At a February 18, 2016 hearing, the Establishment Subcommittee considered Attorney Wilson's letter, which allegedly stated that Attorney Wilson \"had performed an independent review of the documentary material\" and that \"the process of entry into the [cooperative venture agreement was] legal and customary for member independent schools of NAIS.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 c.) At the meeting, according to the Academy and KDC, Dr. Jang attempted to refute Attorney Wilson's letter, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 d); however, the subcommittee voted to reconfirm the cooperative venture agreement, which was to be signed by the Academy at a private trustee meeting on May 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 e.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Boston Korea Actions and Article\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 7, 2016, during the Academy's private trustee meeting, two Boston Korea newspaper reporters disrupted the proceedings to pass out questions for the Academy trustees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00a7 f.) Subsequently, on May 12, 2016, Boston Korea\n   published an online editorial entitled \"Open Letter to St. Johnsbury Academy\" and an online article called \"Public Questions Thrown at St. Johnsbury Academy.\" (Doc. 8-6 at 3-4, 6-7.) As interpreted by Google Translate, (Doc. 8-1 at 4, \u00b6 11), the articles questioned the business relationship between the Academy and KDC, the business structure of KDC, and the academic qualifications of both St. Johnsbury Academy and SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-6 at 6-7.) Neither article named Dr. Jang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Caledonian-Record Article and Ethan Allen Institute Post\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 6, 2016, an article appeared in the Caledonian-Record, a newspaper located in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, describing the establishment of SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-13 at 1.) According to the article, contractors had begun work on the project on April 29, 2016, with an anticipated enrollment date in Fall 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the article generally described the anticipated academic programs, extracurricular activities, and the student-body makeup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Finally, the article concluded with a general description of Jeju Island. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Subsequently, in a post on the Ethan Allen Institute website on May 18, 2016, the writer described the contents of the Caledonian-Record article and commended South Koreans and the leadership of the Academy for establishing SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-14.) The articles neither mentioned Dr. Jang nor described an ongoing controversy involving the establishment of SJA-Jeju.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Legal Proceedings Against Dr. Jang in South Korea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At some time in May 2016, according to the Academy and KDC, Haewul initiated criminal and civil legal proceedings against Dr. Jang in South Korea, purportedly as a result of the events described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 8 at 6.) Specifically, Haewul sought an injunction against Dr. Jang's unauthorized investigations and challenged her \"misrepresentations and libelous statements concerning SJA Jeju, Haewul, Inc., and the project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As discussed below, this investigation concluded over a year later, on June 23, 2017, when Dr. Jang signed a \"Written Agreement,\" promising to cease interfering with the establishment of SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-7 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Allegedly Defamatory Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 12, 2016, Attorney Bruce Palmer, representing the Academy and KDC, sent a letter (the Letter) to Lee Seok-moon, the Governor of Education for Jeju Island, and copied the Establishment Subcommittee on which Dr. Jang sat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1.) In the Letter, on behalf of the Academy and KDC, Attorney Palmer expressed a \"deep concern[ ] about unauthorized and disruptive actions and false statements by Dr. Soonjung Jang, a member of the subcommittee of the Jeju Provincial Office of Education ... charged with reviewing and approving [SJA-Jeju].\" (Doc. 1-1 at 1.) As a result, the Governor was asked to remove Dr. Jang from the subcommittee or, at the least, censure and disqualify Dr. Jang from \"any further participation in or consideration of the approval of [SJA-Jeju].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As a basis for this recusal request, Attorney Palmer alleged that Dr. Jang, at every turn, \"challenged the legality and legitimacy of [the Academy's] and KDC's efforts to participate in this project\"; that Dr. Jang \"attacked the validity of the Cooperative Venture Agreement\"; that Dr. Jang \"knowingly defamed [the Academy] and KDC in the process, alleging without any factual basis that each seeks through the [cooperative venture agreement] and other contracts to avoid paying taxes\"; that Dr. Jang accused the Academy's headmaster and KDC's CEO of \"illegally entering into the agreements without actual authority\"; and that Dr. Jang repeatedly questioned the quality of the Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Letter, these actions and statements by Dr. Jang amounted to \"an unjustified, concerted campaign of mistruth about [the Academy] and KDC ... in a transparent effort to scuttle [SJA-Jeju].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, counsel pointed out many of the events described above, including Dr. Jang's contact with Attorney Wilson and Attorney Wilson's subsequent independent review and approval of the cooperating venture agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, \u00a7\u00a7 a, c); Dr. Jang's attempts to refute Attorney Wilson's analysis, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 d); and, the Establishment Subcommittee's subsequent vote reapproving the cooperative venture agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 e.) Attorney Palmer also intimated that Dr. Jang was responsible for the unknown South Korean's efforts to access the Academy's and KDC's records and that Dr. Jang was accountable for the investigation undertaken by Boston Korea and the subsequent articles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 3, \u00a7\u00a7 b, g.) In sum, counsel concluded that \"[t]he campaign by Dr. Jang to impugn SJA and the integrity of its officials demonstrates her deep bias and disregard for traditional customs and laws\" and \"merit disqualification to serve on the [Establishment Subcommittee] responsible to review and approve the project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Subsequent Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Email Communication by Dr. Jang\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After the July 12, 2016 Letter was sent to the Governor, Dr. Jang continued to pursue her investigation of the SJA-Jeju project. On July 23, 2016, Dr. Jang emailed Attorney Wilson again, stating that the Academy and KDC were using Attorney Wilson's statements to rationalize their business activities. (Doc. 8-4 at 24.) Attorney Wilson referred her to Attorney Palmer, as counsel for the Academy and KDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Palmer responded to Dr. Jang's emails by referring her to Haewul's counsel and by prohibiting Dr. Jang from directly contacting the Academy and KDC. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legal Action by Jeju Solidarity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 22, 2016, an attorney representing Jeju Solidarity contacted the Academy and KDC seeking information relating to the Academy's relationship with KDC and the potential liability assumed by the Academy and KDC. (Doc. 8-19 at 2-3.) As noted above, Dr. Jang is a member of Jeju Solidarity, but she was not named in this correspondence. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-19; Doc. 1 at 2, \u00b6 9.) Counsel for the Academy and KDC referred the Jeju Solidarity attorney to Haewul. (Doc. 8-19 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On October 5, 2016, Attorney Jacob O. Durell, acting on behalf of Jeju Solidarity, sought information regarding the business relationship between the Academy and KDC as well as the liability purportedly assumed by the Academy and KDC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-20 at 4.) Specifically, Durell asked to review a number of the Academy's and KDC's documents relating to the establishment of SJA-Jeju. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As authority for this request, the attorney cited Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 11A, \u00a7 16.02, which authorizes a shareholder of a corporation to inspect the records of the corporation, and argued that the Academy and KDC's actions could lead to tort and consumer fraud claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On October 25, 2016, Jeju Solidarity filed suit in this Court, seeking declaratory relief and production of certain documents as well as alleging that the Academy and KDC committed consumer fraud. (Doc. 8-8 at 2, \u00b6 7.) This lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Jeju Solidarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeju Solidarity for Participatory Self-gov't &amp; Envtl.

Following this dismissal, on November 15, 2016, Jeju Solidarity again requested documents from the Academy and KDC. (Doc. 8-22.) On December 5, 2016, Jeju Solidarity sought injunctive relief against the Academy and KDC in Vermont state court, claiming that the Vermont's Public Records Act, as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%201%2C%20%C2%A7%20317\">\n    Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, \u00a7 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , required the Academy and KDC to produce the requested records. (Doc. 8-9 at 6.) On March 3, 2017, the Vermont superior court granted the Academy and KDC's motion to dismiss, concluding that they were not public agencies subject to Vermont's Public Records Act. (Doc. 8-10 at 3.) Dr. Jang was not named as a party to either of these lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Dr. Jang's Written Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On June 23, 2017, as noted above, following the investigation instigated by Haewul, Dr. Jang signed a \"Written Agreement\" directed to the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office in which Dr. Jang stated, \"[I]t is not appropriate to express my opinion on the internet instead of committee meeting and such behavior may cause economic and/or administrative damage to [the Academy].\" (Doc. 8-7 at 2.) She further agreed that she would \"not do any negative activity against [Haewul] or SJA[-]Jeju through the internet including sending emails to parents individually or posting articles\" and \"not do any activity I have done so far such as submitting civil complaints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Opening of SJA-Jeju\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   SJA-Jeju opened in mid-October 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 8 at 7; Doc. 8-16.) A news article in the Caledonian-Record described SJA-Jeju as \"an independent, international boarding school established by the government of the Republic of South Korea using the SJA curriculum.\" (Doc. 8-16 at 2.) In addition, the article generally described the structure of the school, the campus, and the academic requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The article did not mention Dr. Jang or any controversy regarding the establishment of SJA-Jeju.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Jang's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On August 31, 2017, prior to SJA-Jeju's opening, Dr. Jang filed the Complaint in this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   attaching the Letter to her Complaint and alleging that the Letter is \"libelous and defamatory in that it maliciously claimed that the statements of [Dr. Jang] were unauthorized, disruptive, and false.\" (Doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 30.) She further claims that \"[the Academy and KDC's] request that [Dr. Jang] be removed from the subcommittee was done willfully, wantonly, and recklessly to interfere with [Dr. Jang's] professional relationship with the subcommittee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As support for this claim, Dr. Jang asserts in her Complaint that Haewul made public representations that the Academy \"would effectively be running [SJA-Jeju],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, \u00b6 16), contrary to the Academy's purported representation that it would only be licensing its intellectual property without exercising control over SJA-Jeju. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Based on this alleged contradiction, Dr. Jang states that she asked the Academy and KDC to provide documents clarifying their relationship, their control of SJA-Jeju, and their prospective liabilities for any potential failure of SJA-Jeju. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) She further alleges that the Academy and KDC refused her reasonable requests for records and instead, as a result of her \"investigations and inquiries,\" caused their attorney to send the Letter to the Governor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, \u00b6 29.) Finally, she claims that the Letter's contents caused her significant injury, including \"strong stigma\" on her professional standing resulting in $500,000 of future losses, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33), special damages of $115,000 in lost research funds, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 34, \u00a7\u00a7 c, d), professional condemnation from the other members of the Establishment Subcommittee, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, \u00a7 b), and extreme emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, \u00a7 e.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Academy and KDC's Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Academy and KDC have filed two motions opposing Dr. Jang's claims. (Docs. 8, 11.) In their Joint Special Motion to Strike the Complaint pursuant to Vermont's anti-SLAPP statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%201041\">\n    Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (Doc. 8), the Academy and KDC argue that the Letter to the Governor involved a public issue and that, in sending the Letter, they were exercising their constitutional right to free speech and to petition the government. (Doc. 8 at 16.) They further argue that Dr. Jang cannot show that the Letter was devoid of reasonable factual support and arguable basis in law or that the Letter caused her actual injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, they contend that this Court should grant their Joint Motion to Strike. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In their Joint Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim under Federal Rule 12(b)(6), the Academy and KDC argue that the Complaint fails to set forth facts plausibly alleging the elements of defamation. (Doc. 11 at 7-8.) Specifically, they argue that the Letter's contents are pure opinion and, thus, not actionable, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8), that Dr. Jang does not allege that any of the statements in the Letter are false and defamatory, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11), that the Complaint fails to plead lack of privilege in the communication, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12), and that, because Dr. Jang is a public official or public figure, the Complaint fails to allege actual malice, as required by the First Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) The Academy and KDC further allege that Dr. Jang's failure to allege actual malice precludes\n   any recovery for infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Dr. Jang opposes both motions. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docs. 12, 15.) In her opposition to the Motion to Strike, Dr. Jang argues that the Academy and KDC were addressing their grievances in South Korea, rather than under the United States or Vermont Constitutions, and asserts that the Academy and KDC had no factual basis for claiming in the Letter that Dr. Jang's actions were unauthorized and disruptive. (Doc. 12 at 1.) Dr. Jang also argues in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss that she did not fail to plead that the Academy and KDC acted with malice and that the Letter's contents were false, pointing to her allegations in the Complaint that the Letter \"maliciously claimed that the statements of [Dr. Jang] were unauthorized, disruptive and false when they were not\" and that the request for removal was done \"willfully, wantonly and recklessly to interfere with [Dr. Jang's] professional relationship with the subcommittee.\" (Doc. 15 at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Finally, Dr. Jang again claims that \"most of [her] inquiries and investigations were what her committee had authorized her to do as a committee member.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In reply, the Academy and KDC argue that Dr. Jang's responses in opposition merely repeat her conclusory and insufficient allegations, (Doc. 20 at 1), and that their constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government extend beyond the United States' borders. (Doc. 21 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On February 20, 2018, this Court held a hearing on the motions. (Doc. 26.) Immediately prior to the hearing, Dr. Jang filed a Motion for Leave to File Affidavits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 25.) At the hearing, the parties generally reiterated the positions set forth in their motions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Hearing Argument,\n   <em>\n    Jang v. Trustees of St. Johnsbury Acad. et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:17-cv-162 (Feb. 20, 2018) (Conroy, Mag. J.). For the first time, however, Dr. Jang's attorney suggested that South Korean law could apply to the dispute, although Dr. Jang's attorney did not provide any evidentiary proof of this law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%201041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%201041\">\n    at 2:03-2:06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By contrast, Dr. Jang claims that the Academy and KDC have failed to offer sufficient evidence to support the Motion to Strike, (Doc. 28 at 1), and that her Complaint plausibly makes out a claim for defamation. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 27.) Dr. Jang does not offer additional argument regarding her claim for interference with professional relationship.

For tort claims, such as defamation, Vermont follows the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws to determine the applicable substantive law.\n   <em>\n    Amiot v.

If so, that section applies; if not, the Restatement's general principles control, and the court applies the law of the state that \"has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties.\" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145(1) (1971). In that case, a multi-factor test is employed to determine the state with the most significant relationship to the occurrence and parties, rather than a specific section of the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1220372\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/170/415/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defamation is governed by a specific section of the Restatement (Second), which provides: \"In an action for defamation,\n   <em>\n    the local law of the state where the publication occurs determines the rights and liabilities of the parties\n   </em>\n   , ... unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1220372\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/170/415/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 149 (emphasis added).

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1; Docs. 8-1-8-24.) Specifically, the Academy and KDC were concerned that Dr. Jang's actions exhibited bias that would negatively influence the review and approval of SJA-Jeju and asked the Governor to remove Dr. Jang from the committee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1.) Nothing in the Letter suggests that the Academy and KDC were voicing their opinions as part of a public dispute or that the Letter's description of Dr. Jang's personal actions concerned broad issues of public interest.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    2015 VT 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    200 Vt. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    133 A.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ernst II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201610608\">\n    2016 WL 1610608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Indeed, no competent evidence shows that the committee's deliberations were open to the public or that the Academy and KDC distributed the Letter outside of the Establishment Subcommittee.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201610608\">\n    2016 WL 1610608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"[The] [d]efendants plainly have the burden of proving that the specific statements they made were public in nature.\") Similarly, the record does not contain evidence of general public interest in the establishment of SJA-Jeju or Dr. Jang's involvement on the committee. Although the Academy and KDC submitted several news articles that generally describe the Global Education City and, in passing, mention SJA-Jeju, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 8-11-8-14), only one article names Dr. Jang and describes a potential controversy with the establishment of SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-15.) That article was published in response to the case presently before this Court, not as a result of general public interest in the founding of SJA-Jeju or in the Letter's contents. In sum, after\n   <em>\n    Felis\n   </em>\n   , this evidence is not specific enough to show \"that the statements alleged to be defamatory addressed issues of public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Ernst II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201610608\">\n    2016 WL 1610608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The lack of evidence in this case contrasts starkly with\n   <em>\n    Dongguk University v.

Instead, they claim that Dr. Jang is in the public eye because she is both a limited-purpose public figure and a public official. As support, they point to Dr. Jang's involvement in the Establishment Subcommittee charged with reviewing and approving SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8 at 11.) They further argue that, \"[Dr. Jang] very publicly inserted herself into the debate over the appropriateness of SJA Jeju's approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But neither claim is supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   First, the news articles submitted by the Academy and KDC do not suggest that the public in South Korea or Vermont knew of Dr. Jang's attempts to influence the alleged controversy surrounding the approval of SJA-Jeju. Indeed, as noted above, the only news article to mention Dr. Jang by name was published after the initiation of this lawsuit and after the Letter's publication in South Korea. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-15.);\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052500\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/50/553/#p558\">\n    50 F.Supp.3d at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here is no evidence that those disputes were a matter of public interest or controversy at the time the statements were made.\").

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 8-11-8-14.) Similarly, the other documents in the record do not suggest that her actions placed her in the public eye in either Vermont or South Korea; instead, they show that Dr. Jang conducted essentially private inquiries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8-3 at 3; Doc. 8-1 at 3, \u00b6 7; Doc. 8-4 at 21.) In short, although it is clear that Dr. Jang did not approve of SJA-Jeju, neither the news articles nor the other documents submitted suggest that Dr. Jang \"successfully invited public attention to [her] views,\" that she \"assumed a\n   position of prominence in the public controversy,\" or that she \"maintained regular and continuing access to the media.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882472\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/963/255/#p270\">\n    963 F.Supp.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The only evidence possibly suggesting that Dr. Jang's actions thrust her into the public eye is the \"Written Agreement\" in which Dr. Jang promised to forgo \"negative activity against ... SJA Jeju\" on the internet and to stop \"providing information to Media,\" presumably regarding SJA-Jeju. (Doc. 8-7.) But Dr. Jang executed the agreement on June 23, 2017, well after the Academy and KDC sent the Letter to the Governor. (Doc. 8-1 at 4, \u00b6 12.) In other words, the Written Agreement does not show that Dr. Jang's actions were in the public eye at the time the Letter was published.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052500\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/50/553/#p558\">\n    50 F.Supp.3d at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But again, the record does not support this argument in relation to SJA-Jeju. For example, the information in the Letter was of little intrinsic value to Vermonters; plainly, the establishment of SJA-Jeju had little influence on the educated citizenry of Vermont. Further, nothing in the Letter suggests that Dr. Jang's conduct affected broad educational concerns in South Korea. Instead, the Letter describes Dr. Jang's personal efforts to investigate SJA-Jeju and requests her removal. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1.) Absent specific evidence that Dr. Jang's actions generally implicated the whole of South Korea's educational system, the Academy and KDC's reliance on the amorphous concept of an \"educated citizenry\" is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivero, AFL-CIO,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301013\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/105/913/#p925\">\n    105 Cal.

Similarly, Dr. Jang fails to state a claim for tortious interference with profession because the Complaint does not contain sufficient factual allegations for this Court to reasonably infer that the Letter contained a false statement.

False and Defamatory Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   As an initial matter, Dr. Jang's Complaint does not identify the specific false and defamatory language at issue in the Letter. Dr. Jang alleges that the Letter is \"libelous and defamatory in that it maliciously claimed that the statements of [Dr. Jang] were unauthorized, disruptive and false when they were not.\" (Doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 30.)

Accordingly, the Court examines the allegedly defamatory statements in light of the relevant factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   As noted above, Dr. Jang's Complaint does not identify the specific false and defamatory language at issue in the Letter. After a general review of the Letter, however, the Court concludes that the statement most closely corresponding with Dr. Jang's pleading is an opinion.\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galley Schuler v. Rainforest All., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330184\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/298/#p312\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (D. Vt. 2016) (reviewing attached document for false statements despite arguable failure in deficient pleading). That statement is, \"[The Academy] and KDC have deep concerns about unauthorized and disruptive actions and false statements by Dr. Soojung Jang.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 1;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 30.) But this statement's use of the phrase \"deep concerns\" implicates the personal beliefs of the attorney representing the Academy and KDC rather than objective facts. In the context of the Letter, this language reflects the author's strongly held opinion that Dr. Jang specifically acted to thwart the SJA-Jeju project. For example, the Letter also opines that \"Dr. Jang has waged an unjustified, concerted campaign of mistruth about SJA and KDC ... in a transparent effort to scuttle this project,\" (Doc. 1-1 at 2), and argues that \"[t]he campaign by Dr. Jang to impugn SJA and the integrity of its officials demonstrates her deep bias and disregard for traditional customs and laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Like the first statement, these statements characterize Dr. Jang's purpose and intent based on the opinions of the counsel for the Academy and KDC.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285755\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/697/#p720\">\n    898 F.Supp.2d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, Dr. Jang argues in her Complaint that she conducted her investigations and inquiries to benefit Jeju Solidarity and the Jeju community at large. (Doc. 1 at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13.) In short, these statements regarding Dr. Jang's motivations and purpose cannot be proven true or false: a community organizer in one light is a burden on development in another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On the other hand, the characterization of Dr. Jang's conduct is based on a number of objectively verifiable events disclosed in the Letter, (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1 at 2-3, \u00a7\u00a7 a-g); thus, the Letter's contents constitute \" 'mixed opinions' that are not per se excluded as the basis for a defamation claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285755\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/697/#p720\">\n    898 F.Supp.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The objectively provable incidents include Dr. Jang's allegedly unauthorized correspondence via email with Attorney Wilson, (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 a); Dr. Jang's presentation of the \"Summary of Preliminary Investigation\" to the committee, a presentation that the Letter claimed\n   contained falsehoods, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 c); and Dr. Jang's assertion to the committee that Attorney Wilson was not a lawyer, which the Letter claimed was demonstrably false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 d.) Thus, to the extent that the Letter's opinions rely on demonstrable facts, the Court next considers whether the facts are false or whether the facts are substantially accurate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 581A cmt. c(2) (stating that a defendant is not liable for basing derogatory opinion on his own statement of facts that are true and not defamatory).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

But in her Complaint, Dr. Jang acknowledges that she conducted various \"investigations and inquiries\" into the Academy and KDC's activities; thus, her Complaint effectively admits to the substantial truthfulness of the factual incidents described in the Letter. (Doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 29.) As she states, her investigations included seeking \"clarification of [D]efendants' relationship, their control of [SJA-Jeju], and liability for any losses on behalf of [Jeju Solidarity],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 24), requesting \"records concerning the viability of the CVA, as member of POE,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b625), and pursuing \"records and information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, \u00b6 27.) Dr. Jang also reiterates \"that SJA or KDC have acted unfairly by failing to disclose all relevant agreement to [Jeju Solidarity] and by disseminating conflicting information about the role of SJA[,]\" suggesting that she continues to believe that the Academy and KDC should provide certain records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b628.) Given Dr. Jang's acknowledged statements and actions, her Complaint does not plausibly demonstrate the falsity of the events described in the Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Dr. Jang argues that the Letter's contents were false because she had the authority to conduct her inquiries and investigations, her claim is contradicted by the Complaint and attached Letter. In Dr. Jang's Opposition to the Joint Motion to Dismiss, she states that her \"inquiries and investigations were what her committee had authorized her to do as a committee member.\" (Doc. 15 at 2.) But the Letter indicates that the committee \"did not request or authorize this contact by Dr. Jang or the sharing of documents.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 2, \u00a7 a.) Dr. Jang does not offer facts plausibly suggesting that this statement is false. Moreover, even if parts of her investigation were authorized, it appears from the face of the Complaint that the gist of the Letter is true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weisburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5776052\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/147/70/#p73\">\n    147 Vt. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5776052\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/147/70/#p73\">\n    511 A.2d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
