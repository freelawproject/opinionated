Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs allege multiple instances in which their civil rights were violated by Defendants City of Duluth (the City) and Officers 1-10. The City moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims against it, (Dkt. 70), arguing that Plaintiffs' second amended complaint fails to state a claim against the City for discriminatory denial of public services, discriminatory denial of the full and equal benefits of the law, and common law conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). For the reasons addressed below, the City's motion is denied as to Plaintiffs' common law conversion claim and granted in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Davenell L. Ash owns and operates Plaintiff Unique Beauty &amp; Hair Supply, L.L.C. (Unique Beauty), a salon and beauty supply retail outlet in Duluth, Minnesota. Ash is African American, and Unique Beauty caters to the beauty and cosmetic needs of African-American and other non-Caucasian individuals. Ash and Unique Beauty allege that the City and its employees have subjected them to multiple acts of discrimination because of Ash's race. In support of these claims, the second amended complaint identifies six incidents or ongoing courses of conduct that occurred between April 2012 and September 2017. These allegations are summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Plaintiffs allege that Ash called the Duluth police in April 2012 to report a male shoplifter who had sexually assaulted Ash's daughter inside Unique Beauty. Two Duluth police officers responded to Ash's\n   call. But instead of apprehending the shoplifter, Plaintiffs allege, the police officers assaulted Ash's daughter and charged both Ash and her daughter with disorderly conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege that Ash contacted a Duluth police officer a short time after the shoplifting incident and asked what she could do to improve safety conditions at Unique Beauty. In response, the officer advised Ash to remove the street-facing signs at the front of the store that feature African-American and other non-Caucasian models. To the best of Ash's knowledge, no Duluth police officer has ever given similar advice to the proprietors of salons or beauty supply stores that primarily cater to Caucasian customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs allege that Ash called the Duluth police sometime in 2014 to report a fight outside her store among individuals who were not associated with her business. As a result, a Duluth police officer threatened to designate Unique Beauty as a \"nuisance business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs allege that Ash has reported trespassers to the Duluth police on multiple occasions since October 2013, but none of these individuals has been arrested or prosecuted. Ash believes that the City routinely prosecutes trespassers on the premises of Caucasian-owned businesses in Duluth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fifth, Plaintiffs allege that on multiple occasions since 2014, Duluth parking enforcement officers have engaged in discriminatory conduct by selectively enforcing parking laws. On one occasion, Ash observed a Caucasian woman parking in front of Unique Beauty without paying the meter. When Ash complained to a Duluth parking attendant, the parking attendant responded by threatening Ash with mace. In contrast, the City's parking enforcement office issued approximately 25 parking tickets to Ash between 2009 and April 2017 for parking her vehicle near Unique Beauty. Ash also observed a Duluth parking enforcement officer prevent a disabled customer from entering Unique Beauty. And in April 2017, Ash observed two of the City's employees tow Ash's vehicle from a parking spot near Unique Beauty without any legal basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sixth, Plaintiffs allege that multiple Duluth fire trucks and emergency vehicles arrived at Unique Beauty in September 2017 for no apparent reason. This event upset Ash and her customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the foregoing conduct, Ash and Unique Beauty assert four claims against the City: (1) discriminatory denial of public services because of race, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) discriminatory denial of the full and equal benefits of the law, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) discriminatory denial of the full and equal benefits of the law, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (4) conversion of Ash's vehicle, in violation of Minnesota common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City moves to dismiss the claims against it for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The Court addresses in turn each of the four claims Plaintiffs assert against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs' Title VI Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second amended complaint does not identify a specific provision of Title VI that the City allegedly violated. The City construes this claim as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, which Plaintiffs confirm in their memorandum of law in opposition to the City's motion to dismiss. As such, the Court adopts this construction of Plaintiffs' Title VI claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The City contends that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Title VI provides, as relevant here, that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination, not discrimination arising from disparate impact.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Second, the City receives funds under the \"Workforce Investment Act ... to operate employment and training programs.\" The alleged discriminatory conduct, however, is limited to the actions (or inaction) of the City's police department, parking enforcement office, and fire department. Plaintiffs have not alleged either that they are the intended beneficiaries of HUD funds or Workforce Investment Act funds or that a nexus exists between the alleged discrimination and the specific \"program or activity\" that receives those federal funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Alasady v.

As such, the alleged discrimination in\n   <em>\n    Alasady\n   </em>\n   had a clear nexus with the specific \"program or activity\" that received federal funds. But here, the City is not a specific \"program or activity;\" and Plaintiffs have not alleged discriminatory conduct that has a nexus to a specific \"program or activity\" that receives federal funding.
