The issues for trial included whether Arctic Cat infringed the '669 Patent, whether Arctic Cat's infringement was willful, whether the asserted claims of BRP's patents were invalid, and damages.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The jury did not make any findings related to damages or willfulness, consistent with the Court's instructions.

In general, Arctic Cat seeks JMOL that it does not infringe the '669 Patent, and BRP seeks JMOL that its patents are not invalid.

INFRINGEMENT OF THE '669 PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BRP argued at trial that Arctic Cat infringed claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent. At the close of BRP's case in chief, Arctic Cat moved for JMOL under Rule 50(a) that it did not infringe the '669 Patent. (Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2068:10-14, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1087.) The Court denied Arctic Cat's motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2088:11-15.) The jury found claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent infringed. (Verdict at 1.) Now, Arctic Cat renews under Rule 50(b) its motion for JMOL that it does not infringe. Because BRP presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that Arctic Cat infringed claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent, and because the jury's verdict was not substantially influenced by any legal errors, the Court will deny Arctic Cat's motion for JMOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sufficiency of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Arctic Cat's primary noninfringement argument concerns the \"seat position defined by the seat\" limitation in claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the Accused Products include a \"seat position defined by the seat.\" The\n   Court construed \"seat position defined by the seat\" to mean \"a portion of the straddle-type seat positioned beneath the center of weight distribution of a 50th percentile North-American adult male weighing 78 kg and has the body build illustrated in FIGS. 9A, 9B and 10 seated in a natural operating position.\" (Claim Const. Order at 35-36, Sept. 28, 2015, Docket No. 552.) BRP presented evidence, including expert testimony, that the Accused Products meet this claim limitation as construed. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. Vol. V at 960:23-961:2, 969:16-19, 973:18-974:6, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1082; Trial Tr. Vol. VI at 1090:10-1091:18, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1083; Trial Tr. Vol. VII at 1501:2-1504:16, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1084.) Arctic Cat's argument that BRP never presented evidence of numerical measurements regarding the \"seat position\" (or the \"center of weight distribution\") are unavailing, as neither the asserted claims of the '669 Patent, nor the Court's construction of the \"seat position\" limitation require any numerical measurements - unlike, for example, the limitations in claims 92-95 of the '669 Patent that recite numerical measurements for the location of the \"steering position.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '699 Patent at 21:57-22:3.) The Court will therefore deny Arctic Cat's motion for JMOL on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Certificate of Correction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Arctic Cat also argues that it is entitled to JMOL of no infringement of the '669 Patent because a certificate of correction issued with respect to the '669 Patent after this litigation started. Arctic Cat's position fails for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Arctic Cat has waived this issue. Arctic Cat made this argument in one of its motions in limine (which the Court denied before trial), but Arctic Cat omitted this argument from its Rule 50(a) motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2069:7-2073:2.) Although Arctic Cat did not need to renew its evidentiary objection at trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 103(b), it was required to include this argument in its Rule 50(a) motion to preserve it for its Rule 50(b) motion. \"Indisputably, if an argument is raised in support of a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , the motion is\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   , and the argument is not restated at the appropriate time, the argument is not preserved under Rules 50 or 51.\"\n   <em>\n    Repola v. Morbark Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539519\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/483/#p488\">\n    934 F.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (3d Cir. 1991) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128387\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/979/#p983\">\n    538 F.3d at 983-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Arctic Cat fails to engage the proper legal standard. Arctic Cat correctly states that whether a patentee may assert uncorrected claims depends on whether the uncorrected claims \"omit[ ] a material limitation ... not evident on the face of the patent,\"\n   <em>\n    H-W Tech., L.C. v. Overstock.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159298\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/1329/#p1335\">\n    758 F.3d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2014). But Arctic Cat argues that the certificate of correction simply changed the scope of the asserted claims, not that the alleged errors are omitted material limitations not evident on the face of the patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the uncorrected claims of the '669 Patent do not omit material limitations not evident on the patent's\n   face, the Court will deny Arctic Cat's motion for JMOL on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. INVALIDITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At trial, Arctic Cat argued that the asserted claims of the '669 and '847 Patents are invalid on multiple grounds. The jury found the asserted claims invalid on some grounds, but not invalid on others. Arctic Cat and BRP cross-move for JMOL and a new trial on invalidity. The Court will address the parties' motions and arguments ground-by-ground for each patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The '669 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At trial, Arctic Cat argued that claim 88 is invalid for anticipation, and that claims 88 and 92-95 are invalid for enablement, indefiniteness, anticipation, and obviousness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Inst. Nos. 23-28, Dec. 6, 2017, Docket No. 1064.) At the close of Arctic Cat's case in chief, BRP moved for JMOL under Rule 50(a) that claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent are not invalid. (Pls.' Mot. for JMOL, Dec. 2, 2017, Docket No. 1043; Pls.' Mot. for JMOL, Dec. 4, 2017, Docket No. 1058.) The Court denied BRP's motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, Dec. 4, 2017, Docket No. 1061; Minute Entry, Dec. 1065, Dec. 5, 2017, Docket No. 1065.) The jury found claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent invalid. (Verdict at 2.) Now, BRP renews its motion for JMOL under Rule 50(b) that claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent are not invalid. Because Arctic Cat presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found by clear and convincing evidence that claims 88 and 92-95 of the '669 Patent are invalid, the Court will deny BRP's motion. The Court will also deny Arctic Cat's motions related to invalidity of the '669 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Enablement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The jury did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   find that claims 88 and 92-95 are invalid for lack of enablement. Arctic Cat moves conditionally for a new trial in the event that the jury's invalidity finding with respect to the '669 Patent is later reversed or vacated, by this Court or on appeal. The Court will deny Arctic Cat's conditional motion on this ground because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"To be enabling, the specification of a patent must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation.\"\n   <em>\n    MagSil Corp. v.

Although Arctic Cat's expert, Mr. Warner, testified that in his opinion a person having ordinary skill in the art (\"PHOSITA\") would not know how to make and use the invention in light of those alleged errors, BRP's expert, Dr. Raasch, testified to the contrary - that even in light of those alleged errors, a PHOSITA could make and use the invention by using a anthropomorphic dummy to approximate an average male rider to determine a \"seat position.\" (Trial Tr.

Specifically, the jury was required to resolve the factual dispute about whether a PHOSITA would understand, with reasonable certainty, the scope of the \"seat position defined by the seat\" limitation, in light of (1) several errors contained in the specification of the '669 Patent, and (2) the phrase \"natural operating position\" contained in the Court's claim construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Construction of \"seat position defined by the seat\" was quite challenging.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the one hand, the patent specification explicitly defines \"seat position\" by referencing a \"standard rider.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the claim language itself states that the seat position is \"defined by the seat\" - an unambiguous reference to the seat, not a rider. During prosecution, the phrase \"defined by the seat\" was added to overcome a rejection by the examiner who reasoned that defining \"seat position\" in relation to the body of an unspecified rider would make it \"impossible to determine the scope of the claim.\" (Claim Const. Order at 32 (citing JA 2571, 2605-06, Mar. 9, 2015, Docket No. 469)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) After a thorough review of the intrinsic evidence, the Court construed \"seat position defined by the seat\" to reference both the seat and the rider, and to reference a \"standard rider\" as pointed out by the inventors during prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.) The Court - adopting BRP's proposed construction - construed \"seat position defined by the seat\" as \"a portion of the straddle-type seat,\" thereby referencing the seat, \"positioned beneath the center of weight distribution of a 50th percentile North-American adult male weighing 78 kg and has the body build illustrated in FIGS. 9A, 9B and 10 seated in a natural operating position,\" thereby referencing a standard rider. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, Arctic Cat presented evidence that the figures of the standard rider in the '669 Patent contain numerous errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Figure 9A contains total arm-length measurements of 78.2 cm, 42.8 cm, and 87.3 cm; but the sums of the sub-dimensions that comprise the arm lengths equal 80.2 cm, 71.7 cm, and 67.4 cm. (Defs.' App. \u00b6 36, Ex. 36 (Trial Ex. D# 1073) at 50, Feb. 19, 2018, Docket No. 1126.) Also in Figure 9A, the total height measurements are listed as 184.3 cm, 152.7 cm, and 199.7 cm; but the sums of the sub-dimensions that comprise the heights equal 188.1 cm, 174.7 cm, and 160.8 cm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.) Arctic Cat presented expert testimony that the 42.8 cm total arm-length measurement is \"wrong because it's supposed to be between the other two\" (78.2 cm and 87.3 cm), as is the 152.7 cm total height measurement (supposed to be between 184.3 cm and 199.7 cm). (Trial Tr. Vol. XII at 2686:20:-2691:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There was also testimony that the differences between the total measurements and the sum of the corresponding sub-dimensions make it difficult to know what the dimensions of a standard rider are, and\n   that there is no way to know which dimension (the total number or the sum of the sub-dimensions) is the correct one without conducting a \"massive research project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2687:5-2688:11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr.

And, there was testimony that the height measurement is a particularly important one in determining what a standard rider is. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. Vol. XII at 2685:13-2686:3.) Post-\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   , this evidence supports a finding that, because of the errors in the figures, a PHOSITA would not know what dimensions of a standard rider the inventors intended to incorporate into the definition of \"seat position defined by the seat.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dow Chem.

For example, Joel Hallstrom, who worked in the snowmobile industry for almost forty years, testified that he has never heard the term \"natural operating position\" and that such a position does not exist for snowmobile riders. (Trial Tr. Vol. IX at 2021:2-2023:21, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1086.) Mr. Warner, Arctic Cat's technical expert, also testified that \"there is no such thing as a natural operating position.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. XII at 2696:10-11.) Moreover, BRP's witnesses repeatedly testified that a \"natural\" position is one that is subjectively \"comfortable\" for the rider. (Trial Tr. Vol. VI at 1068:13, 1069:1, 1069:4, 1081:4, 1085:10, 1085:19, 1086:1; Trial Tr. Vol. XIV at 3210:12, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1091.) And \"[c]omfort is different for every rider.\" (Trial Tr.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jury Inst. Nos. 25-26.) As such, the jury was instructed - without objection from Arctic Cat - that only claim 88 of the '669 Patent was subject to the Court's anticipation instruction. Thus, because the jury did not find claims 92-95 of the '669 Patent anticipated, Arctic Cat's argument is unavailing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Moreover, Arctic Cat is not entitled to a new trial on obviousness. There was substantial testimony from both BRP and Arctic Cat about modifications to the prior-art snowmobiles that would enable them to meet the limitations of claims 92-95 of the '669 Patent, the effect that such modifications would have on the prior-art snowmobiles, and whether a PHOSITA would be motivated to make such modifications.

Thus, the jury's finding that claims 92-95 of the '669 Patent are not invalid for obviousness was not against the great weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

The Court denied BRP's motion. (Minute Entry, Dec. 5, 2017, Docket No. 1065.) The jury found claims 1 and 6-8 of the '847 Patent invalid. (Verdict at 2.) Now, BRP renews its motion for JMOL under Rule 50(b) that claims 1 and 6-8 of the '847 Patent are not invalid. Because Arctic Cat presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found by clear and convincing evidence that claims 1 and 6-8 of the '847 Patent are invalid, the Court will deny BRP's motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Anticipation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The jury found that claims 1 and 6 of the '847 Patent are invalid for anticipation. There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found by clear and convincing evidence that claims 1 and 6 of the '847 Patent are anticipated by the T/S Mod snowmobile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    First, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the T/S Mod includes a \"pyramidal brace assembly.\" The Court already determined at summary judgment that the T/S Mod included a \"pyramidal\" assembly; the issue for trial was whether the T/S Mod met the \"brace\" limitation. (Mem. Op. &amp; Order\n    (\"Summ. J. Order\") at 21 &amp; n.6, 26-28, Dec. 29, 2016, Docket No. 781; Mem. Op. &amp; Order at 6, Nov. 11, 2017, Docket No. 990.) Arctic Cat presented the physical T/S Mod to the jury. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Parties' Joint Ex. List.) Also, Arctic Cat's technical expert, David Karpik, testified that the T/S Mod pyramidal assembly is \"a brace,\" and explained that \"anybody with common sense that would see that, if you put a tube between two points, that you are bracing something.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. XI at 2466:11-2467:10.) And the T/S Mod's creator, Steve Thorsen, testified that he called the legs of the pyramidal assembly \"braces,\" he agreed that they left the frame \"more rigid\" and \"brace everything,\" and he agreed that he could feel that they reduced \"twist\" when he grabbed the back of the T/S Mod. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2400:7-2402:3, 2408:7-2410:2, 2411:7-11.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Second, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the T/S Mod includes an \"apex.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court construed \"apex\" to mean \"the uppermost part of the pyramidal brace assembly.\" (Claim Const. Order at 15.) Suffice it to say that, given that the jury had a sufficient basis to find that the T/S Mod included a pyramidal brace assembly, it also had a sufficient basis to find that such assembly included an \"uppermost part.\" BRP's argument that the T/S Mod lacks an \"apex\" because one of the four tubes of the T/S Mod's assembly is welded to the side of another tube rather than at the steering bracket was an argument for the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Third, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the \"upper column\" limitation was met.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    For example, there was evidence, drawn from the prosecution history of the '847 Patent, that the \"upper column\" limitation was admitted prior art, (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 195:3-196:24, Jan. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1078; Trial Tr. Vol. XI at 2425:16-21, 2468:11-2470:16); that a prior-art snowmobile contained an upper column, (Defs.' App. \u00b6 29, Ex. 29 (Trial Ex. D# 964); Trial Tr. Vol. XI at 2470:1-2473:4); and that upper columns were common snowmobile components before the subject matter of the '847 Patent was invented (Trial Tr. Vol. XI at 2502:14-2505:10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Fourth, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the T/S Mod is in fact a \"snowmobile\" with \"skis.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Photographs of the T/S Mod\n    clearly show that the jury was free to so find. (Defs.' App. \u00b6 6, Ex. 6 (Trial Ex. D# 269).) BRP's arguments that the T/S Mod was an 'oval ice racer,' and not a 'snowmobile,' were for the jury.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654169\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/692/#p701\">\n     499 F.3d 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 701 (7th Cir. 2007).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    BRP proposed using a special-verdict form that would have asked the jury (1) whether each individual claim was invalid, (2) if so, the ground(s) for each claim found invalid, and (3) the particular prior art used for each ground of invalidity. (Pls.' Proposed Special Verdict Form at 2-4, Oct. 16, 2017, Docket No. 884.) The Court, however, favoring simplicity, used a form that asked simply whether all the asserted claims of each patent were invalid, and on what grounds. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Verdict at 2-3.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    BRP argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the special-verdict form asked whether the jury found \"all\" the asserted claims invalid, rather than on a claim-by-claim basis. BRP argues that the form was prejudicial because the jury would give \"less scrutiny and/or weight\" to the dependent claims than to the independent claims. (Pls.' Mem. at 17, Jan. 3, 2018, Docket No. 1101.) First, BRP cites no authority supporting its argument that a simpler form like the one the Court used caused BRP sufficient prejudice to justify a new trial, or frankly any prejudice at all. Second, to the extent that any such prejudice occurred as a result of the structure of the special-verdict form, the Court's instructions eliminated (or at least substantially mitigated) any such prejudice. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jury Inst. No. 23 (\"Each claim is effectively treated as if it were a separate patent.\"); Jury Inst. No. 27 (\"In determining whether the claimed invention was obvious, you\n    <strong>\n     must\n    </strong>\n    consider each claim separately.\" (emphasis added) );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Jury Inst. No. 15 (describing the difference between independent and dependent claims).) BRP is not entitled to a new trial on obviousness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. DAMAGES AND WILLFULNESS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The jury did not make any findings related to damages or willfulness, consistent with the instructions on the special-verdict form. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Verdict at 3.) Because the Court's rulings on the parties' motions does not result in a finding of liability by Arctic Cat for infringement of a valid patent claim, a new trial on damages and willfulness is not warranted. If after any further proceedings, however, there is a finding of liability by Arctic Cat for infringement of a valid patent claim, then BRP would be entitled to a new trial on damages and willfulness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n    <strong>\n     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    that:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    1.

Arctic Cat conditionally moves for a new trial on indefiniteness in the event that the jury's invalidity finding with respect to the '847 Patent is later reversed or vacated, by this Court or on appeal. Arctic Cat's argument here is that the term \"pyramidal\" is indefinite. A new trial is not warranted. There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that Arctic Cat failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the term \"pyramidal\" is indefinite.

Nevertheless, the Court will address BRP's argument, as the \"upper column\" limitation is relevant to the jury's obviousness finding.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"17\">\n    <p id=\"p-110\">\n     In its post-trial briefing, BRP implies that the Court shirked its claim-construction responsibility with respect to the \"snowmobile\" and \"skis\" limitations. (Defs.' Mem. at 33 &amp; n.5, Jan. 3, 2018, Docket No. 1104.) BRP's complaint is that the Court declined to construe those terms at summary judgment - almost two years after claim construction. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ) At claim construction, the parties requested that the Court construe nearly 20 terms in the '847 Patent and 11 terms in the '669 Patent. (Joint Claim Const. Statement, Ex. B, Sept. 22, 2014, Docket No. 360.) Although \"skis\" made the parties' initial list, \"snowmobile\" did not. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ) The Court ordered the parties to limit their briefing and argument to \"ten representative claim terms, phrases or clauses.\" (Order, Sept. 25, 2014, Docket No. 362;\n     <em>\n      see, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , N.D. Ill. LPR 4.1(b) (limiting by local patent rule the number of claim terms the court will construe to ten).) Neither \"snowmobile\" nor \"skis\" was on the parties' revised list of ten terms requiring construction. (Joint Claim Const. Statement, Nov. 11, 2014, Docket No. 432.) BRP could have insisted to Arctic Cat during the meet-and-confer process that it would seek construction of \"snowmobile\" and \"skis\" and could have made necessary concessions to effectuate that result. But BRP did not. The Court recognizes that it may be difficult to predict how failing to seek construction of a certain claim term will affect the ultimate outcome of a patent-infringement action.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Arctic Cat, Inc. v.
