[Doc. No. 88]. At its core, the dispute in this matter is whether the Caddo Parish Commission can remove the Confederate Monument which sits on the front plat or portion of the Caddo Parish Courthouse Square.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The answer to the question in dispute turns upon what person or entity has the right to control the property upon which the monument sits. By its motion, Defendant contends Plaintiff \"cannot demonstrate a property interest in the land upon which the Confederate Monument sits and therefore cannot assert First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Plaintiff opposes the motion, contending it acquired ownership of the land underneath the monument by acquisitive prescription. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds the Caddo Parish Commission has the authority to remove the monument which sits upon property the Parish holds in trust for public use. Accordingly, Defendant's motion is GRANTED, and Plaintiff's claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendant's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant contends it owns the Courthouse Square by dedication, or alternatively, by acquisitive prescription, and therefore it has the authority to determine what monuments should be displayed in that public space. [Doc. No. 88-1 at 3, 8]. In support of its first position, Defendant submits: (1) \"filings in Natchitoches and Caddo Parish,\" which Defendant argues show Larkin Edwards sold his tract to the Shreve Town Company, and therefore \"maps of Shreveport showing this area dedicated to public use and not reserved for private ownership conform to what is evidenced by the deeds,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; (2) the Minutes of the Caddo Parish Police Jury meeting held June 3, 1856, which reflect the Police Jury appropriated $10,000.00 \"to build a court house and suitable offices for Caddo Parish\" on Block 23,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (citing Doc. No. 88-4 at 10, 20); (3) a 2002 title opinion, which states maps from 1857 display the words \"Court House\" at Block 23,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. No. 10-6); (4) the Minutes of the Caddo Parish Police Jury meeting held January 3, 1860, which authorized the \"building Court House Committee ... to make certain changes in the Clerk's office in said building, ... to let out contract for grading the public square and making side walks around same, and also to have a cistern constructed and gas fixtures put up in said Court House.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. No. 88-4 at 20); and (5) the testimony of Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Gary Joiner, who testified courthouses have sat on the property since the 1850s, and the square has consistently been maintained by Caddo Parish since that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. No. 51 at 58-59). Defendant argues this evidence shows Block 23 was dedicated to public use by the Shreve Town Company, and Block 23 has been used for public purposes since at least the 1860s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In support of its alternative position-that it acquired Block 23 by acquisitive prescription-Defendant argues, \"Based on the fact that the public square was platted\n   and publicly dedicated by Shreve Town Company and that Shreve Town Company bought the reservation from Larkin Edwards and thus wholly owned it, the Parish had just title and good faith as stated in the 1846 minutes.\" [Doc. No. 88-1 at 5]. Accordingly, Defendant contends it acquired the property by prescription of ten years in 1856. In the further alternative, Defendant contends it acquired Block 23 by prescription of thirty years in 1890.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff contends it acquired the plot of ground upon which the monument sits by acquisitive prescription, and therefore the Caddo Parish Commission cannot order removal of the monument (which Plaintiff also contends it owns) from Plaintiff's private property. While Plaintiff concedes Block 23 was originally dedicated to public use, it argues Defendant impliedly revoked the dedication by granting Plaintiff permission to place the monument on the front plat of the Courthouse Square. [\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 90-4 at 3]. In support of this argument, Plaintiff submits the affidavit of its \"expert Mr. Wayne Webb, attorney at law,\" who \"reviewed conveyance records for Caddo Parish, Louisiana, for the purpose of determining the existence of any document purporting to convey any sort of an ownership interest of the ... [plot of land situated within Block 23] into the Shreveport Chapter 237 of the Daughters of the Confederacy....\" [Doc. No. 90 at 16; Doc. No. 99-5 at 4]. According to Mr. Webb, he found no evidence conveying any type of interest in the property to Plaintiff in the Caddo Parish conveyance records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, after reviewing a matter \"off record,\" namely the 1903 Minutes of the Caddo Parish Police Jury, Mr. Webb opined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the action of the Caddo Parish Police Jury in 1903, in reserving a plot of ground for the Daughters of the Confederacy, may have taken the property out of the purview of use as a public square as set forth in the original plat filing, because use of the plot of ground was then for the endeavors of a private entity. Pursuant to R.S. 33:4178, the action of the police jury may have been tantamount to a revocation of the dedication, which would have caused the ownership to revert back to those who dedicated the land. Under those circumstances, the Daughters of the Confederacy would have been occupying the respective plot without the permission of the true owners, thereby causing acquisitive prescription to run in favor the [sic] Daughters of the Confederacy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [Doc. No. 99-5 at 6].\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff notes it \"has possessed\" the property underneath the monument since 1903, when the Caddo Parish Police Jury \"donated $1,000.00 for the construction of the Confederate Monument and gave a plot of land 'in perpetuity' to [Plaintiff].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 90 at 3]. According to Plaintiff,\n   although it \"treated the Caddo Parish Police Jury's actions as an oral donation,\" it now concedes \"the minutes are not an actual written conveyance,\" but argues they constitute \"evidence that the Defendant had relinquished the dedication of said site for the public use for the Caddo Parish Courthouse for the Plaintiff's private use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. From the forgoing, Plaintiff concludes, \"[t]here is no evidence that Caddo Parish owns Shreveport Block 23 in its entirety,\" and Plaintiff \"acquired ownership of the land underneath the Confederate Monument via acquisitive prescription....\" [Doc. No. 90 at 2, 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff additionally attacks Defendant's title, arguing Defendant did not acquire Block 23 by acquisitive prescription.

As argued by Plaintiff, the enactment of various versions of the Louisiana State Constitution resulted in the dissolution of the prior governing authorities of Caddo Parish and the creation of new governing bodies, and therefore, \"there was an interruption of precarious possession and no tacking.\" [Doc.

As there is no evidence in the record showing the Caddo Parish Police Jury obtained express legislative permission to transfer the plot of ground to Plaintiff at any time prior to erection of the monument, and because\n   there is no evidence in the record showing any \"formal revocation, relocation or abandonment\" of Block 23 as a public square, the Court finds the actions of Defendant, in reserving the front plot of ground for placement of a monument, did not constitute a revocation of the dedication. Because the Court finds the Parish did not revoke the dedication of Block 23, Plaintiff could not, as a matter of law, acquire the property at issue by acquisitive prescription. Accordingly, Plaintiff has no private property interest in the plot of ground upon which the Confederate Monument sits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Insofar as Plaintiff alleges its Fifth Amendment rights were violated by a \"taking\" of the ground upon which the monument sits, for the reasons set forth above, the Court finds Plaintiff has not met its burden of showing that it had any private property interest in the front plat of the courthouse.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorn v.

No. 90 at 23]. Assuming the Confederate Monument remains Plaintiff's private property, the Court finds this claim fails for the same reason provided in its Ruling on Plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction-namely, that Plaintiff has presented no evidence that the Commission intends to compel it to bear the burden and cost of removal. Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff's claim under the Fifth Amendment fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues its rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated, because \"no procedural safeguards were in place to allow the Plaintiff to contest the removal of the Confederate Monument.\" [Doc.

The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" To have a protected property interest within the contours of the Fourteenth Amendment, one must have some legitimate claim of entitlement to it, and \"the sufficiency of the claim of entitlement must be decided by reference to state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackburn v.

As discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to show it has a legitimate property interest sufficient to require Fourteenth Amendment protection. Nevertheless, even assuming Plaintiff did have a sufficient property interest, the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states follow fair procedures before depriving citizens of their property. Ordinarily, this requires that the affected individual be given notice of the anticipated deprivation and a fair opportunity to challenge its propriety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullane v.
