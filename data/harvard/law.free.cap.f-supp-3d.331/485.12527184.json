(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 68 at 7 \u00b6 20, 13 \u00b6 54-14 \u00b6 61.)

(ECF No. 68 at 29 \u00b6 141;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1-5 to 1-12.) On or around July 31, 2017, SCE &amp; G alleges it was forced by specified circumstances to conclude it could not complete the Project and \"announce[ ] that it would cease construction of the Units and request[ ] recovery of its abandoned costs, an outcome expressly contemplated by the BLRA.\" (ECF No. 68 at 31-32 \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SCE &amp; G alleges that in response to the Project's abandonment, the South Carolina General Assembly passed Act 287 and Resolution 285. (ECF No. 68 at 36 \u00b6 177.) Further, SCE &amp; G alleges that with the passage of Act 287 and Resolution 285, the South Carolina General Assembly modified the process that was in place for establishing and revising utility rates. Act 287 instructed the PSC to set utility rates for SCE &amp; G at a level equal to their current rates less the increases previously granted under the BLRA within five (5) days of the passage of the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20S.C.%20Acts%20258\">\n    2018 S.C.

July 5, 2011) (\"Implementation of a state policy or custom can be reached in federal court through official-capacity actions for prospective relief under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Upon review, the court is persuaded that SCE &amp; G's allegations regarding Defendants' connection with implementation of Act 287 and Resolution 285 is enough to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defendants, as Commissioners of the PSC, are vested \"with power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate the rates and service of every public utility in this State and to fix just and reasonable standards, classifications, regulations, practices, and measurements of service to be furnished, imposed, or observed, and followed by every public utility in this State.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-3-140\">\n    S.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67 at 6 (\"Act 287 instructed the PSC to set utility rates for SCE &amp; G at a level equal to their current rates less the increases previously granted under the BLRA within five (5) days of the passage of the Act.\") (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20S.C.%20Acts%20258\">\n    2018 S.C.

Moreover, as observed above, the court is not persuaded that this case involves an excessive intrusion into an area of special state sovereign interest. Therefore, upon consideration of the aforementioned allegations in the light most favorable to SCE &amp; G, the court finds the Amended Complaint states plausible allegations under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   charging Defendants with the implementation of the allegedly unconstitutional Act 287 and Resolution 285.
