On November 5, 2016, Plaintiff, who suffered from clinical depression, was taking a nap in his van, which was parked in the backyard of his home. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. His estranged wife, Vanessa Duarte, who was living elsewhere at the time, came to his home and found him asleep in the van.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Concerned about Plaintiff's mental state and worried he may harm himself, Ms. Duarte left the home and called 911 to request assistance for Plaintiff, whom she described as being suicidal and in need of help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Ms. Duarte did not allege that any crime had been committed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Approximately two hours later, Defendant responded to the 911 call and parked in the driveway at the front of Plaintiff's home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Plaintiff, still in the backyard, was not visible from the front of the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather than knock on the front door or otherwise announce his presence to the residents of the home, Defendant opened a closed metal gate to gain access to the backyard without a warrant and without the consent of any resident of the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.

Plaintiff was holding a \"standard sized\" box cutter, which was \"small in length.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. When Defendant noticed the box cutter, he took cover behind a dumpster approximately eighteen feet from where Defendant sat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this point, Defendant was separated from Plaintiff by both the dumpster and the van.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The exit to the property was directly behind Defendant and was unobstructed, and two additional exit routes were readily accessible to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant removed his firearm from its holster, pointed it at Plaintiff, and began \"screaming\" orders at him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Confused, Plaintiff repeatedly asked Defendant to leave his home and leave him alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In an attempt to make Defendant lower his weapon and leave, Plaintiff held the box cutter to his own throat and threatened to harm himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff did not make any aggressive movements towards Defendant, and remained\n   approximately eighteen feet from Defendant while holding the box cutter to his own throat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's brother, Javier Romero, entered the backyard and repeatedly asked Defendant to allow him to speak with Plaintiff to de-escalate the situation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.

Defendant followed Plaintiff behind the van, where Plaintiff stumbled and fell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant then fired another shot at Plaintiff, which struck Plaintiff in the face as he lay on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant made no attempt to render aid to Plaintiff after shooting him in the face at close range.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Approximately twenty minutes after the shooting, emergency personnel arrived and discovered Plaintiff lying on the ground, unconscious and bleeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Plaintiff was found behind the van and approximately ten and a half feet from the dumpster that Defendant was hiding behind when he fired his first shots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.

In Defendant's own description of that case, \"Officer Kisela shot the [p]laintiff after being called on scene responding to a 911 call about a woman acting erratic and hacking a tree with a kitchen knife....

In fact, the only person to whom he could conceivably have posed a threat is Defendant, who was eighteen feet away from Plaintiff when he began shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that distance, and with a van and a dumpster separating Plaintiff from Defendant, the Court finds it highly implausible that Plaintiff's box cutter posed any threat to Defendant. Furthermore, Plaintiff alleges that he was running\n   <em>\n    away\n   </em>\n   from Defendant when he stumbled, fell, and was shot in the face at close range. This contrasts sharply with the facts of\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff \"had taken steps\n   <em>\n    toward\n   </em>\n   another woman standing nearby\" before being shot.\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Similarly, decisions in the Fifth Circuit finding that use of deadly force against an individual armed with a knife was reasonable have also hinged on the individual's threatening action immediately preceding the officer's use of force.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

In his Motion, Defendant asserts that \"Plaintiff alleged as follows in his Original Complaint : .... After repeated orders to the Plaintiff to drop the weapon, which were ignored, [Defendant] fired his service weapon at the Plaintiff. Plaintiff then ran closer to [Defendant], still holding the weapon, and [Defendant] fired one final shot, striking the Plaintiff.\" Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6 (internal citations omitted). This is not what Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint. On the contrary, Plaintiff alleges that he \"ran away from Defendant Officer to [take] cover behind his van\" after Defendant began shooting at him unprovoked. Compl. \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Resp. 5 (emphasizing that Plaintiff was shot \"while running away\" and \"posed no threat to ... any cognizable person\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In his Reply, Defendant ignores this explicit allegation that Defendant was fleeing at the time that he was shot. Instead, Defendant makes much of the fact that, according to the Complaint, \"[t]he distance between [Plaintiff and Defendant] at the time the first shots were fired was approximately eighteen feet,\" Compl. \u00b6 22, while Plaintiff's body was \"approximately 10.5 away from the dumpster\" after the shooting,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he was found \"on the opposite end of\n   the van from where the shooting began, and the side of the van away from where [Defendant] initially stood,\" showing that Plaintiff was running away from Defendant when he was shot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant responds that \"it makes no sense whatsoever that someone could be found closer to another person than originally positioned, in this case 10.5 feet rather that [sic] 18 feet, and clearly be fleeing.\" Reply \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This argument is flawed for a number of reasons. First, it misreads Plaintiff's allegations: Plaintiff alleges that he was eighteen feet from\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   when the shooting began, and ten and a half feet from the\n   <em>\n    dumpster\n   </em>\n   when it ended. Given that Defendant had allegedly taken cover by placing the dumpster between himself and Plaintiff, it is possible that Plaintiff would be closer to the dumpster than to Defendant's starting position after the shooting. Second, it disregards the path of movement described in Plaintiff's Complaint. Plaintiff alleges that he ran to the end of the van away from where Defendant initially stood. Depending on the configuration of the van and the dumpster, it again is plausible that Plaintiff could end up slightly closer to nearest part of the dumpster while fleeing from Defendant. Third, and most importantly, Defendant's argument seeks to evade the requirement that the court must accept well-pleaded facts as true and view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Calhoun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9320545\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/730/#p733\">\n    312 F.3d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has repeatedly and consistently alleged that he was running away from Defendant when he was shot. None of the facts in the Complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, are inconsistent with that claim. As a result, Defendant's pronouncement that Plaintiff's allegation that he was fleeing when he was shot \"makes no sense whatsoever\" is misguided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett, et al. v.

Furthermore, none of his arguments justifying his warrantless entry of the backyard serve to excuse his entry without knocking and announcing his presence. As the Fifth Circuit has held, exigent circumstances \"may give the officer the authority to be inside a home without a warrant, but [they do] not have any bearing on the constitutionality of the manner in which he enters the home.

In\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   , the Court stated that the \"showing [required to justify a no-knock entry] is not high, but the police should be required to make it whenever the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652004\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/385/#p394\">\n    520 U.S. at 394-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652004\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/385/#p394\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the justification for the rule applies just as strongly in this case as it would had Defendant found Plaintiff sitting in his living room instead of the backyard. The Fifth Circuit has noted that \"the [knock-and-announce] rule serves several fundamental interests including '(1) protecting law enforcement officers and household occupants from potential violence; (2) preventing the unnecessary destruction of private property; and (3) protecting people from unnecessary intrusion into their private activities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cantu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094413\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/148/#p152\">\n    230 F.3d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.
