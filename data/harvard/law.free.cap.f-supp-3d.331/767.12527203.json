THOMAS ANDERSON, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 87) and Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 95). Defendant Ciox Health, LLC, d/b/a Healthport Technologies, LLC, seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' class-action and individual claims stemming from allegations of routine and systematic overcharging for access to medical records. Plaintiffs Richard Faber and Jennifer Monroe, on behalf of themselves and similarly situated persons, seek summary judgment on the issue of Defendant's liability in each of their claims. The overarching issue in this case is whether Defendant's actions are remediable under Tennessee law. Plaintiffs have advanced a number of theories to this effect, most prominently that, if Defendant's actions violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH\"), then Defendant can be held liable under a theory of negligence\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also make a number of arguments that Defendant's actions independently gave rise to several Tennessee common law claims. And Plaintiffs further assert that Defendant's actions violated the State's consumer protection statute. The Court ultimately holds, however, that there is no independent cause of action under Tennessee law, even under a theory of negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , for a violation of HIPAA or HITECH. The Court further holds that the evidence supporting Plaintiffs' claims of overcharging does not translate into any of the Tennessee common law claims pursued by Plaintiffs. And finally, the Court holds that Plaintiffs have\n   not established a violation of Tennessee's consumer protection statute. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . This action is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to enter Judgment forthwith in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed by the parties unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendant Ciox Health, LLC, d/b/a Healthport Technologies, LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant is the largest clinical data exchange platform in the United States. Defendant was created by the merger of four medical records providers-HealthPort, IOD, Care Communication, and ECS-that were acquired by Defendant's parent company, New Mountain Capital, in 2016. Defendant subsequently acquired a fifth medical record provider, ArroHealth, increasing its size even further. Today, Defendant is perhaps\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the largest medical records provider in the country and boasts of processing 4.3 million pages of medical records per day. Three out of every five hospitals in the United States utilize Defendant for medical records release services. Defendant holds itself out as a HIPAA-compliant provider of medical records on behalf of its medical provider clients. Defendant also holds itself out as a provider that fulfills requests for medical records in a timely manner. As a routine practice, Defendant charges attorneys requesting medical records on behalf of their clients at a rate that exceeds the standard cost-based rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant does not attempt to track its actual costs incurred in responding to each medical records request it receives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant entered into a contract with Vanderbilt University Medical Center (\"Vanderbilt\") to provide Vanderbilt with medical records request fulfillment services, also known as \"release of patient health information\" or \"ROI\" services. Pursuant to its contract with Vanderbilt, Defendant is required to open mail, verify authorizations, log requests, transmit records, and answer phone calls regarding medical records requests on behalf of Vanderbilt. Defendant likewise receives, opens, and reviews all incoming requests for health information sent to Vanderbilt and processes all written requests, walk-in requests, and telephone requests for copies of patient health information. Further, Defendant maintains a 72-hour turnaround time for all routine requests, provided the records are complete and in their proper place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant also entered into a contract with the Shelby County Health Care Corporation d/b/a Regional One Health (\"the Med\") to provide the Med with medical records request fulfillment services. The Med, under its contract with Defendant, has outsourced its medical records request fulfillment needs to Defendant. Pursuant to that contract, Defendant provides employees on site at the Med, as well as all necessary technology, equipment, and supplies to review requests for health information\n   and fulfill those requests. Defendant is also required to open correspondence requesting medical records, verify all requests to ensure compliance with state and federal law, retrieve the requested information, transmit records, provide personnel for walk-in requests, and answer telephone inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff Richard Faber\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Richard Faber was represented by the law firm of Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, PC., in litigation in connection with an automobile accident. Plaintiff Faber, pursuant to his contract with Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, P.C., understood and agreed to pay all litigation expenses incurred from his share of the settlement or judgment. Plaintiff Faber's case resulted in a favorable jury verdict, from which he was contractually obligated to reimburse Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, P.C., for its litigation expenses. On January 16, 2015, Diane Asbridge, a paralegal with the law firm Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, P.C., sent a letter to the Med on behalf of Plaintiff Faber. At that time, Ms. Asbridge was acting pursuant to her authority as an employee of Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, P.C. Ms. Asbridge's January 16, 2015 letter stated, in part, \"[p]lease provide this office with a complete copy of any and all records on Richard D. Faber....\" Ms. Asbridge's January 16, 2015 letter also enclosed a form titled \"HIPAA Compliant Authorization for Release of Medical Information.\" This form was signed by Melissa Faber. Mrs. Faber is Plaintiff Faber's wife and personal representative. On February 28, 2015, Defendant electronically provided the records requested by Ms. Asbridge through HealthPortConnect, Defendant's online portal. That same day, Defendant sent an invoice to Ms. Asbridge for a total of $235.30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That invoice listed the following charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a \"Basic Fee\" of $18.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 2\" fee of $120 for a \"Quantity\" of 200 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.60; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 4\" fee of $0.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 5 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 3\" fee of $38.25 for a \"Quantity\" of 45 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.85; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 1\" fee of $57.05 for a \"Quantity\" of 163 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.35; and an \"Electronic Delivery Fee\" of $2.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 8, Apr. 26, 2018, ECF No. 89 (quoting HealthPort Invoice No. 0163671769, ECF No. 90-2). On December 8, 2015, Defendant provided additional medical records through HealthPortConnect at Ms. Asbridge's request. That same day, Defendant sent Ms. Asbridge an invoice for a total of $704.65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That invoice listed the following charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a \"Basic Fee\" of $18.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 2\" fee of $120 for a \"Quantity\" of 200 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.60; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 4\" fee of $0.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 5 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 3\" fee of $38.25 for a \"Quantity\" of 45 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.85; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 1\" fee of $526.40 for a \"Quantity\" of 1504 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.35; and an \"Electronic Delivery Fee\" of $2.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 11, ECF No. 89 (quoting HealthPort Invoice No. 0182201188, ECF No. 90-4). Plaintiff Faber testified that he did not recall ever having seen either of these invoices before his deposition and that they were never sent to him personally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ballin, Ballin &amp; Fishman, P.C., paid both invoices on Plaintiff Faber's behalf. Plaintiff Faber testified that he had no relationship or contract with Defendant. Plaintiff Faber testified that he was not asserting any claim for unreasonable delay in the provision of his medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff Jennifer Monroe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff Jennifer Monroe, acting individually and on behalf of her minor child, authorized her attorneys to act on her behalf in requesting medical records. Plaintiff Monroe retained the law firm of Wolff Ardis, P.C., as her attorneys for her minor daughter's personal injury case. Plaintiff Monroe did not retain any individual attorney from Wolff Ardis, P.C., to act on her behalf. On January 20, 2016, Plaintiff Monroe, acting through said attorneys, requested that her daughter's medical records be provided to Wolff Ardis, P.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 29, 2016, Andrea Harris, a paralegal at Wolff Ardis, P.C., re-sent or sent for the first time,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 6, Plaintiff Monroe's request to the Center for Health Information Management in Tennessee. Ms. Harris, at the time she sent letters on Plaintiff Monroe's behalf, was acting pursuant to her authority as an employee of Wolff Ardis, P.C. At least one of these letters stated, in part, \"our office represents Jennifer Monroe and her minor daughter ... please forward copies of all CT Scans, X-Rays, and MRIs in their native or DICOM format....\" Ms. Harris's January 2016 letter or letters included a form titled \"Center for Health Information Management Authorization for Release of Medical Information\" signed by Plaintiff Monroe. A request letter from Plaintiff Monroe attached to the letter from Ms. Harris asked for the records to be provided \"in electronic form on CD in the Adobe Acrobat .pdf format.\" On February 11, 2016, Defendant sent an invoice to Ms. Harris for a total of $40.51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That invoice listed the following charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a \"Basic Fee\" of $18.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 1\" fee of $17.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 20 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.85; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 2\" fee of $0.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 5 at a \"Unit\n   Price\" of $0.00; a \"Shipping\" fee of $2.08; and \"Sales Tax\" of $3.43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 18, ECF No. 89 (quoting HealthPort Invoice No. 0186100957, ECF No. 90-7). Having not yet received the records, Plaintiff Monroe had her attorneys or their paralegals send the request once again by facsimile on February 16, 2016, and again on February 17, 2016. On February 25, 2016, Plaintiff Monroe's attorneys advised Vanderbilt that it was in violation of state and federal law by failing to provide the medical records requested. On March 2, 2016, Defendant sent Ms. Harris hard copies of certain medical records of Plaintiff Monroe's minor child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also in March 2, 2016, Defendant sent an invoice to Ms. Harris for a total of $30.74.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That invoice listed the following charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a \"Basic Fee\" of $18.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 1\" fee of $8.50 for a \"Quantity\" of 10 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.85; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 2\" fee of $0.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 5 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.00; a \"Shipping\" fee of $1.64; and a \"Sales Tax\" of $2.60.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 22, ECF No. 89 (quoting HealthPort Invoice No. 0187519649, ECF No. 90-9). Plaintiff Monroe testified that she did not recall ever having seen these invoices before her deposition. Plaintiff Monroe also testified that she was not aware of any attempts to collect on the invoices until her attorneys made her aware the week before her deposition. Neither Plaintiff Monroe, nor Ms. Harris, nor anyone else at Wolff Ardis, P.C., paid Defendant for these invoices. And on August 2, 2016, Ms. Harris once again sent a letter to the Center for Health Information Management. The letter stated, in part, \"[p]lease forward a copy of any and all of [Plaintiff Monroe's minor daughter's] medical records....\" Defendant, however, sent a letter on August 12, 2016, to Plaintiff Monroe's attorneys, stating it would not provide the requested records unless Plaintiff Monroe completed a HIPAA authorization in the form approved by Defendant. On August 16, 2016, Defendant sent Wolff Ardis, P.C., an invoice for a total of $21.34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   That invoice listed the following charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   a \"Basic Fee\" of $18.00; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 1\" fee of $0.85 for a \"Quantity\" of 1 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.85; a \"Per Page Copy (Paper) 2\" fee of $0.00 for a \"Quantity\" of 5 at a \"Unit Price\" of $0.00; a \"Shipping\" fee of $0.68; and \"Sales Tax\" of $1.81.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 28, ECF No. 89 (quoting HealthPort Invoice No. 019860061, ECF No. 90-10). Wolff Ardis, P.C., paid Defendant the amount reflected in the invoice. Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (ECF No. 15) does not reference that invoice because the invoice was generated after Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint. Defendant ultimately provided records from the January 29, 2016 request on November 9, 2016. Then, on January 30, 2017, Defendant received an additional letter requesting the medical records of Plaintiff Monroe's minor daughter. Attached to the letter was a form titled \"HITECH and HIPAA Compliant Authorization for the Release of Patient Information Pursuant to 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)(I) &amp; 164.508.\" This form stated, in part, that \"[t]his is request under the HITECH Act to provide any attorneys\n   with my medical records in electronic format.\" It also stated that \"[t]his protected health information is disclosed for the following purposes: At the request of the individual patient.\" It further stated that Defendant was \"authorized to release my requested records to Wolff Ardis, P.C. My lawyers agree to pay reasonable charges made by [Defendant] to supply electronic copies of such records.\" The form was signed by Plaintiff Monroe. On February 7, 2017, Defendant sent an invoice to Erin K. Bradley at Wolff Ardis, P.C., for a total of $12.00. That invoice stated the following charges: \"a 'Reproduction Fee Paper 0.07 per page' for $4.27; a 'Mailing Supplies' fee of $0.32; a 'Supplies' fee of $3.05 at a 'Unit Price' of $0.05 for a 'Quantity' of 61; a 'Shipping' fee of $3.29; and 'Sales Tax' of $1.07.\" Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 34, ECF No. 89 (quoting Ciox Health Invoice No. 0209791467, Feb. 7, 2017, ECF No. 90-11). Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does not reference that invoice because the invoice was generated after Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint. Wolff Ardis, P.C., paid Defendant the amount reflected in that invoice. Defendant threatened Plaintiff Monroe's attorneys with collection actions and legal activities when she refused to pay the allegedly excessive rates for her medical records. Defendant refused to provide the records requested by Plaintiff Monroe, her attorneys, or their paralegals until the instant lawsuit was filed. Throughout this process, Plaintiff Monroe made medical decisions for her minor daughter; Plaintiff Monroe's attorneys did not. Plaintiff Monroe testified that her daughter's case settled out of court, but that Defendant's delay \"could have hurt the case a lot more.\" Plaintiff Monroe does not recall speaking to any employee of Defendant regarding her minor daughter's medical records. Plaintiff Monroe testified that she did not know if she had a contract with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiffs as a Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs were charged \"per page (paper)\" fees despite requesting and receiving medical records in an electronic format.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   From May 13, 2010, to October 31, 2017, Defendant collected $19,449,024.49 from 427,143 medical records requests made by individuals or their attorneys in Tennessee. During that same timeframe, Defendant charged Class Members per-page (paper) fees when records were delivered electronically on 83,325 invoices, charging a total of $3,655,535.24. Defendant charged Plaintiffs, their attorneys, or their paralegals electronic delivery and basic fees that exceeded $6.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

After reviewing the parties' various statements of facts and the responses thereto, the Court agrees. In this case, summary judgment is a particularly appropriate method of evaluating Plaintiffs' claims and determining whether the undisputed record supports each of Plaintiffs' claims, thus entitling Plaintiffs to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of Defendant's liability, or whether Plaintiffs have failed to establish such claims, thereby entitling Defendant to the dismissal of those claims. The Court considers each claim below in the context of the arguments made by parties in their respective supporting memoranda, responses, and replies. Ultimately, however, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish any of their claims in the undisputed record. And therefore it is Defendant who is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the dismissal of each of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Though the law firms were merely representing Plaintiffs in these interactions, they were no doubt sought-and the undisputed record reflects as much-by Plaintiffs precisely because of their sophistication or else Plaintiffs might have simply handled the matter themselves. The Court fails to see how Defendant might have influenced or controlled Plaintiffs when, despite Defendant's possession of Plaintiffs' medical records, every interaction that was ostensibly between Defendant and Plaintiffs was at the very least filtered through the classic fiduciary relationship of client and attorney.

Defendant holds itself out as being in compliance with HIPAA, something that any individual or entity that is involved with medical records must do.

But some evidence is needed to show that, in advertising itself as compliant with HIPAA, Defendant was not engaging in mere puffery or salesmanship but actually sought to incorporate HIPAA as part of a contract between itself and Plaintiffs. No such evidence was provided here. There is no indication of a price term or timeliness-of-the-performance term that the Court is able to adequately perceive and enforce. Thus, Plaintiff has not established any contract term implied in fact that is sufficiently definite for the Court to determine whether Defendant breached it.

Because Plaintiffs have failed to establish such a contract, the Court will assume that it does not exist. Thus, the issue is whether Defendant will be unjustly enriched if the Court does not impose a \"quasi-contractual obligation\" upon it. Defendant argues that it will not be unjustly enriched because Plaintiffs have articulated no basis for the Court to find that an injustice has occurred beyond the inapplicable statutes referenced by Plaintiffs. Defendant makes two additional arguments against imposing such an obligation: first, that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the voluntary payment doctrine; and second, that Plaintiffs may not recover for an unjust enrichment theory because Plaintiffs have not exhausted all of their remedies. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, maintain that Defendant unjustly retains the benefits of overcharging for Plaintiffs' access to their medical records. Plaintiffs also argue against the application of the exhaustion theory, asserting that exhaustion of remedies is not required when exhaustion would be futile, or the voluntary payment doctrine, maintaining that it is inapplicable in this instance because the transactions at issue here were violative of public policy. The Court does not reach the parties' arguments regarding the voluntary payment doctrine or exhaustion. Instead, it finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Defendant's retention of certain fees would be unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A defendant is unjustly enriched if (1) the plaintiff conferred a benefit upon the defendant; (2) the defendant is aware of the benefit, and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant would be unjust.\n   <em>\n    Freeman Indus.

While there is no dispute that Defendant knowingly received a benefit, the parties do dispute whether Plaintiffs or their law firms actually conferred that benefit. It appears, however, that this dispute is inconsequential. Plaintiffs point to the Tennessee Supreme Court's holding that a plaintiff need not directly confer the benefit upon the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8509254\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/219/45/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In support of its holding, the Tennessee Supreme Court specifically notes a decision that concluded that \"benefits can be direct or indirect, and can involve benefits conferred by third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8509254\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/219/45/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Thus, the issue here is whether Defendant's retention of its fees above the costs needed to provide the medical records is unjust. Plaintiffs assert that it is because neither federal nor Tennessee law authorized Defendant to collect basic fees, electronic delivery fees, or per-page paper fees when those fees exceeded the actual labor and supply costs of providing the records. But the Court is not persuaded. The idea that an individual or entity must be \"authorized\" by the State to charge for a service is antithetical to our form of government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But if Tennessee\n   and the federal government prohibit the collection of fees for the provision of medical records with certain exceptions, which is perhaps what Plaintiffs intended to assert, then the fees charged by Defendant may be precluded if said fees do not fall within the exceptions. The problem with this argument, however, is that the Court has previously concluded that the Tennessee statute cited to by Plaintiffs is inapplicable to Defendant, Tenn.

LEXIS 218524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23-24 (citing\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Sunrise Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8382141\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/249/301/#p310\">\n    249 S.W.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (Tenn. 2008) ). The TCPA generally prohibits \"[u]nfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting the conduct of any trade or commerce....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-18-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-18-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In its Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that \"Defendant made deceptive representations, material non-disclosures, and misrepresentations of its conduct as lawful\" all in violation of the TCPA. But specifically, Plaintiffs only pointed to subsection 47-18-104(b)(15), alleging that \"Defendant failed to disclose to Plaintiffs that a charge for Plaintiffs' medical records was, in whole or in part, based on a predetermined rate or charge instead of the value of the services actually performed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Defendant correctly points out that Plaintiffs cannot effectively amend their Complaint by raising claims for the first time at summary judgment lest Defendant be subjected to unfair surprise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v. Union of Needletrades, Indus., &amp; Textile Employees.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8973621\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/784/#p788\">\n    407 F.3d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788 (6th Cir. 2005). In this instance, Plaintiffs specifically reference subsections 47-18-104(b)(5), (7), and (9) for the first time in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. And Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument in their Reply. Thus, the Court agrees with Defendant and will only consider Plaintiffs' argument as to subsection 47-18-104(b)(15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendant violated the TCPA by failing to disclose that it charged a predetermined per-page\n   rate rather than the cost-based fees it incurred in processing the requests. But as Plaintiffs make clear by referencing the federal statutes in the same paragraph of their Response, this is a HIPAA-based argument of no relevance to the TCPA. Plaintiffs raise no argument that Defendant did not charge \"the values of the services actually performed\" as they alleged in their Amended Complaint. Therefore, as to Plaintiffs' TCPA claims, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiffs' TCPA claims are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   , and the Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to enter Judgment in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court notes with some concern that this result is a harsh one considering that Defendant had sole control of Plaintiffs' medical records and by all accounts charged fees that, in other situations, would be considered excessive and potentially unlawful. Any direct remedy, however, lies within the purview not of the Court but the Tennessee General Assembly or the United States Congress. Here, Congress has seen fit to limit enforcement of HIPAA to the Government. And the General Assembly has likewise seen fit to limit the application of Tennessee's own medical records statute to hospitals. The Court cannot ignore those legislative decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Defendant points out, without expressly disputing the fact, that Plaintiffs did not provide support for its statement that Defendant is the largest medical records provider in the country.
