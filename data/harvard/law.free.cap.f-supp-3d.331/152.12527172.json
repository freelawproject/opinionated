Smith Corporation d/b/a Smith Drug Company (\"Smith\") and Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc. (\"RDC\") (collectively, \"Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs\" or \"Plaintiffs\") commenced this antitrust suit on behalf of themselves and a putative class of similarly situated purchasers of Namenda. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants - Actavis PLC (now known as Allergan PLC), Forest Laboratories, LLC, Forest Laboratories, Inc., and Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd. (collectively, \"Forest\" or \"Defendants\") - schemed to delay entry of generic versions of an Alzheimer's disease treatment by entering into collusive settlements with various generic drug companies and attempting a hard switch in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Namenda \u00ae (\"Namenda\") is a branded drug used to treat moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer's, a neurodegenerative brain disease that causes memory loss, among other symptoms. Forest had a license to market both Namenda IR (immediate release), a twice-daily drug, and Namenda XR (extended release), a once-daily drug, in the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C061%2C703\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,061,703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"'703 Patent\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2, Dkt. No. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Forest engaged in a two-part anticompetitive scheme to improperly block generic competition for Namenda IR by: (1) conspiring with manufacturers of generic versions of Namenda IR to drop their legal challenges to the '703 Patent and delay launch of generic versions of Namenda IR until an identical date three months after the expiration of the '703 Patent ; and (2) using this improperly obtained period of additional exclusivity to launch the successor branded product, Namenda XR, in order to force the conversion of the market from Namenda IR to the clinically equivalent Namenda XR (hereinafter the \"hard switch\") before market entry of the generic versions of Namenda IR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C061%2C703\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C061%2C703\">\n    at \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' illegal hard switch strategy included prematurely removing Namenda IR from the market before its patent expiration such that only Namenda XR would be available for purchase in the months before Forest faced generic competition for Namenda IR. Plaintiffs allege Defendants knew that, given the nature of Alzheimer's treatment, once a patient was on Namenda XR, there was a decreased likelihood that the patient would \"reverse commute\" back to a generic version of Namenda IR after cheaper generic versions of the drug became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court are two motions: Defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims in Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (Dkt.

The motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs offer Ms. DeLeon as an expert in the process of developing and launching a generic drug. Plaintiffs offer two reports from Ms. DeLeon: (1) an initial report dated September 15, 2017 (Hamburger Decl. Ex. 10, Dkt. No. 438 (\"DeLeon Rep.\") ); and (2) a supplemental report dated October 23, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 11 (\"DeLeon Supp. Rep.\").) Ms. DeLeon was asked to answer the following question: whether there were any supply, equipment or manufacturing challenges that would have prevented five generic competitors - Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Mylan\"), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. - or Forest itself from launching a generic version of Namenda IR prior to July 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeLeon Rep. \u00b6 6.) Her answer is that there were none. She rests her opinion on \"[her] educational background, [her] professional experience, [her] knowledge and understanding of pharmaceutical industry practices, [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") ] regulations, guidelines, and enforcement policies, and publicly-available materials such as FDA MAPPs [Manual of Policies and Procedures] and Guidances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. DeLeon's credentials certainly qualify her to offer an opinion on this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   She has spent 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, much of which was spent\n   working on new drug launches, including specifically the launching of generics. She has sat on launch teams for 25 years. She has experience at Aventis as a liaison with external manufacturers of drug products and active ingredients, and she managed several applications to the FDA for approved products. At Beckloff, she helped companies develop new and generic drugs and get approval for them to go to market. Moreover, before starting her own pharmaceutical consultancy, Ms. DeLeon was Associate Director and then Director of Product Development at Cypress Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Hawthorn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together \"Cypress\") for seven years where she handled at least 12 separate drug launches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Her three decades of experience give her familiarity with both the drug launch process and with impediments to launch - including barriers to entry like supply, new technologies, or need for new equipment. In short, her credentials are impeccable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary of Ms. DeLeon's Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. DeLeon divides her analysis into three sections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, she explains, in considerable detail, the process for launching a new generic - a process with which she is intimately familiar - including the relevant regulatory and manufacturing background, and standard pharmaceutical industry practices employed in preparing for the launch of a new drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   She then evaluates the extensive evidence derived during discovery about each generic's process leading up to the July 2015 launch of its generic Namenda IR. This revealed that each generic had followed precisely the launch process she outlined based on her own experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, she opines - \"based on her review of the evidence and [her] almost 30 years of pharmaceutical industry experience,\" - that nothing would have prevented the generic competitors from doing exactly the same thing as early as 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) She writes: \"[I]n my opinion, there would have been no supply, equipment, or manufacturing challenges that would have prevented the Generics from launching their respective generic Namenda IR tablet products during that time period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) She continues, \"I have seen no evidence in the record suggesting that Defendants could not have followed the same process and launched an authorized generic concurrently with the five Generics, if the Generics had a launch date any time between June 2012 and July 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In reaching her conclusions, Ms. DeLeon stressed that Namenda IR is categorized as a solid oral dose product, which is among the most common pharmaceutical products on the market; that immediate release tablets are among the easiest pharmaceutical products to manufacture; and that the supply of the active ingredient in Namenda IR (memantine hydrochloride) was readily available at all relevant times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs asked Ms. DeLeon to draft a supplemental report - in light of her review of additional documents and deposition testimony that became available after her initial report - in which her opinions and conclusions about the generics' and Forest's ability to launch generic Namenda IR in 2012 did not change. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DeLeon Supp. Rep.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Analysis: Motion to Exclude Ms. DeLeon's Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants' principal argument is that Ms. DeLeon's conclusions are highly speculative. The Court agrees that her\n   opinion is little more than expert \"\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    139 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). As discussed below, the problem lies in the way Ms. DeLeon derived her opinion. It adds nothing to the direct evidence that cannot be elicited from fact witnesses - nothing other than the use of Ms. DeLeon's impressive credentials to bolster the credibility of those witnesses impermissibly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. DeLeon did not review in-house documents or deposition testimony from any of the generics or Forest to support her conclusion that the generics and Forest could have launched Namenda IR in 2012. Instead, she relies solely on her review of documents and testimony regarding the actual product launches by these parties in 2015. Defendants cite to several portions of Ms. DeLeon's deposition testimony in which she admitted as much. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamburger Decl. Ex. 25, Dkt. No. 438 (\"DeLeon Dep. Tr.\") at 91:2 - 11; 143:24 - 144:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Of course, Ms. DeLeon has a perfectly sensible and credible explanation for the lack of contemporaneous evidence; she specifically opines that drug companies place a low priority on tasks related to a drug that they cannot manufacture for a few years, so it was no surprise that they did not engage in pre-launch activity three years before they were permitted, by the terms of the settlements, to enter the generic market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Lacking the kind of evidence she was able to connect to the 2015 launches, Ms. DeLeon relied on three things in order to reach her conclusion about the lack of barriers to entry in 2012: the companies had been able to effectuate a normal launch, without experiencing any disruption or challenge arising from supply, equipment or manufacturing issues, in July 2015; the companies were all major drug manufacturers with the capacity to have done exactly the same thing in earlier years; and a representative of each generic, testifying pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), had indicated under oath that his/her employer could in fact have undertaken the launch process for Namenda IR much sooner than it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Ms. DeLeon's conclusions are based on an application of her extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry to the facts presented. However, Ms. DeLeon's experience is no substitute for \"scientifically sound analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But simply saying, \"They could do it in 2015, so they could have done it in 2012,\" without any analysis of the market\n   and corporate conditions that might have impacted the generics' ability to launch generic Namenda in 2012, is a conclusion tethered to nothing whatever.

Those fact witnesses can be called to testify at trial. They can repeat their testimony that then respective employers could have entered the generic Namenda market earlier but for the settlement of the patent suit. And they can offer an explanation, grounded in the actual circumstances facing each individual generic, about why that was so. Plaintiffs can then argue that the patent settlements were anticompetitive, and the trier of fact can accept or reject that argument after evaluating the credibility of these witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[T]he amended Rules of Evidence require that expert testimony be based on 'sufficient facts or data' and on 'reliable principles and methods' that the expert 'witness has applied reliably to the facts of the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R. Evid. 702 ). Here, the only thing that Ms. DeLeon's \"expert\" opinion does is bolster the credibility of the 30(b)(6) witnesses - misleading the trier of fact into thinking that, if an \"expert\" like Ms. DeLeon accepts the testimony of the 30(b)(6) witnesses, so should it. That is not the province of an expert; indeed, it is an arrogation of the function of the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos v. Nat'l R.R.

While Ms. DeLeon's experience might make her capable of assessing Defendants' adherence to \"standard pharmaceutical industry practice,\" that experience does not transform her into an oracle.

In the professor's opinion, without a reverse payment to generic competitors, the generic competitors would have entered the market on November 2, 2012, approximately 26.3 months earlier than they did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs offer Revised Expert Report of Professor Einer Elhauge dated September 20, 2017 (Hamburger Decl. Ex. 1, Dkt. No. 438 (\"Elhauge Rep.\").) Plaintiffs retained Professor Elhauge to address, among other things, what economic analysis reveals about Forest and Mylan's settlement of the Namenda IR patent litigation. He was asked to opine on: (a) whether an alleged reverse payment from Forest to Mylan delayed generic entry into the market; (b) what the settlement entry date would have been in a no-payment settlement; (c) whether a reverse payment was reasonably necessary and the least restrictive means to achieve a settlement between Forest and Mylan; and (d) whether there were any procompetitive justifications for the reverse payment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elhauge Rep. \u00b6 1.) Professor Elhauge was asked to model a but-for world \"with no payment.\" (Hamburger Decl. Ex. 14, Dkt. No. 438 (\"Elhauge Dep.

Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Professor Elhauge is the Petrie Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where he teaches and writes about the economic analysis of antitrust law, health policy, and various other subjects. (\n   <em>\n    See Elhauge Rep.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) He has authored and co-authored several leading antitrust casebooks, and written articles on monopolization, bundled discounts, loyalty discounts, and reverse-payment settlements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p266\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Professor Elhauge has served as an expert on antitrust economics before Congress, arbitration panels, and foreign competition agencies. He has also testified as an expert witness on antitrust economics in dozens of federal cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary of Professor Elhauge's Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Professor Elhauge begins by summarizing the settlement agreement, signed on July 21, 2010, between Forest and Mylan, which resulted in Mylan dropping its challenge to the Namenda IR patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elhauge Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 6 - 11.) He then estimates the parties' actual bargaining strength based on the settlement terms. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28 - 33.) He uses this estimate - along with other factors, such as the two companies' profit projections and their expectations regarding the pending patent litigation - to predict what the generic entry date would have been in a no-payment settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Professor Elhauge considers how sensitive his analysis is to changes in the estimates of each parties' strengths (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , patent strength, litigation costs, litigation end date, etc.). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33 - 54.) He concludes that his finding - that the reverse payment caused a significant delay in entry of generic memantine hydrochloride into the market - is robust enough to hold true even given changes to these estimates. Finally, he posits that Defendants' risk aversion could not have justified the reverse payment.

That, however, is a mischaracterization of Professor Elhauge's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   specifically declined to hold that \"reverse payment settlement agreements are presumptively unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n    570 U.S. at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He determines that the reverse payment from Forest to Mylan, which he estimates to be $30.9 million, was large enough to exceed Forest's avoided litigation costs (an estimated $3.5 million) and was thus potentially anticompetitive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11, 20.) Only after determining that the payment exceeded avoided litigation costs did Professor Elhauge proceed to use economic analysis to assess the degree of delay the reverse payment caused.

(Lamb Rep. \u00b6 81 - 82.)

Under the first scenario, Dr. Lamb considers damages arising from Forest's alleged reverse payment to Mylan (the \"No Reverse Payment But-For World\"). He assumes that had \"Defendants not entered into an allegedly illegal agreement with Mylan, they still would have settled, but without a large reverse payment and with an entry date [in 2012\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] (rather than in 2015 as provided for in their ... agreement).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Using an economic model, Dr. Lamb compares the actual price purchasers paid for memantine hydrochloride to the prices that would have prevailed but for Defendants' conduct, and compares the actual volumes of brand Namenda purchased to the volumes of Namenda that would have been purchased but for Defendants' conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127 - 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   He concludes that \"all or nearly all proposed [c]lass members were impacted by Defendants' allegedly anticompetitive agreement with Mylan, assuming that generic entry was delayed and would have occurred earlier otherwise, in that they paid higher prices for brand-name Namenda IR, Namenda XR, and/or generic memantine hydrochloride than they otherwise would have had generic competition started sooner, because they would have purchased (or purchased more) generic memantine hydrochloride at prices below branded Namenda and would have purchased the generic at lower prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    No Hard Switch But-For World\n   </em>\n   . Under the second scenario, Dr. Lamb considers damages suffered by direct purchasers of Namenda products arising solely from Forest's announcement of a hard switch from Namenda IR to Namenda XR (the \"No Hard Switch But-For World\"). To confirm his hypothesis that Forest's February 2014 discontinuation announcement had an impact on the market, Dr. Lamb conducted a statistical analysis called a \"structural break test\" to analyze conversion to Namenda XR using market share data from NSP. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.) He concludes that \"there is a structural break in the Namenda XR conversion rate at the time the Hard Switch strategy was implemented beginning in February 2014,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which illustrates that the hard switch was effective in converting more Namenda IR prescriptions to Namenda XR than otherwise would have been the case. He goes on to analyze the case in which Defendants did not engage in their hard switch strategy (never announced that they would remove Namenda IR from the market) and no generic entry occurred prior to the actual date at which AB-rated generics for Namenda IR became available (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , July 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   He concludes that \"all or nearly all proposed [c]lass members who purchased at least Namenda IR and XR, or XR, were impacted by Defendants' anticompetitive [h]ard [s]witch strategy in that they paid higher prices for Namenda XR than they otherwise would have for generic memantine hydrochloride, and they would have purchased the less expensive generic (or more of it) in place of the more expensive branded Namenda.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For purposes of class certification, Dr. Lamb finds that aggregate overcharge damages can be proven through classwide economic models using formulas and methodologies that do not require individualized analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121-61.) Where available, he uses transaction-level data produced by Forest and some of the generic manufacturers to calculate damages. He calculates the \"aggregate, class-wide damages arising from Defendants' alleged misconduct under the two separate but-for worlds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) He estimates that \"Total damages suffered by Proposed Class members are between $6.09 billion and $6.93 billion under the No-Reverse Payment But-For World, and between $776 million and $814 million under the No Hard Switch But-For World.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendants claim that Dr. Lamb's test fails because it utilizes market-wide data rather than purchaser-specific information, which approach fails to isolate and measure those patients who switched from Namenda IR to XR\n   <em>\n    because of the February 2014 announcement\n   </em>\n   from those patients who switched for other reasons. Stated otherwise, Defendants claim that Dr. Lamb's analysis understates the degree to which Namenda XR could have captured the market even without the hard switch strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Dr. Lamb's conclusion that the hard switch announcement increased conversion to Namenda XR was based on a number of observations that are consistent with Plaintiffs' allegations. Plaintiffs allege \"that as a result of Forest's dissatisfaction with the extent of conversion to Namenda XR for several months after its launch, Forest began to consider an option where it would discontinue or dramatically restrict the supply of Namenda IR several months before the availability of generic memantine hydrochloride in order to accomplish a 'forced switch' whereby physicians and patients would have little choice but to switch to Namenda XR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89.) In support of this theory, Dr. Lamb reviewed Forest's internal documents and forecasts confirming the company's formation and implementation of their strategy to reduce the level of competition from generic memantine hydrochloride products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95.) Dr. Lamb relied on forecasts that contained both a \"withdrawal\" (or \"hard switch\") scenario and a \"conventional\" (or \"soft switch\") scenario, as well as internal high-level discussions of and reliance upon these forecasts to reach conclusions about what the conversion rate of Namenda IR to XR would have been absent initiation of the hard switch strategy. For example, Figure 6 entitled\n   <em>\n    Forest Namenda Forecasts\n   </em>\n   , is a copy of Forest's soft switch and hard switch projections which show that Namenda XR's share of the memantine hydrochloride market would be significantly higher under the hard switch strategy versus the soft switch strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Lamb also notes that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   In a May 2013 speech concerning the launch of Namenda XR, Mark Devlin of Forest stated: '[T]he core of our brand strategy with XR is to convert our existing 1R business to Namenda XR as fast as we can and also gain new starts for Namenda XR. We need to transition volume to XR to protect our Namenda revenue from generic penetration in 2015 when we lose IR patent exclusivity.' Mr. Devlin added that the 'better job we do moving business form IR to XR, the more Forest revenue we hopefully shelter from generic threats down the road,'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence includes sworn statements from doctors stating that they stopped prescribing Namenda IR after the hard switch announcement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104.) Dr. Lamb concludes that the evidence demonstrates that Forest's intention to withdraw Namenda IR was to trigger wide-spread conversion to Namenda XR and that the February announcement was successful in starting to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   To confirm his hypothesis, Dr. Lamb conducted a regression analysis called a \"structural break test\" showing that Forest's implementation of its hard switch strategy would impact the market by increasing conversion to Namenda XR. He used actual sales data from IMS National Sales Perspectives (\"NSP\"). He concludes that \"there is a structural break in the Namenda XR conversion rate at the time the Hard Switch strategy was implemented beginning in February 2014,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119), which illustrates that the hard switch was effective in converting more Namenda IR prescriptions to Namenda XR than otherwise would have been the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants' complain that Dr. Lamb's structural break test fails because it does not isolate the cause of the February 2014 break. However, Dr. Lamb testified that the test was not designed to do so. He testified that \"[the test] is not able to tease out where the source of the structural break comes from by itself. One has to implement it because one believes that there is some event which leads to a structural break... I had reason to believe that the hard switch strategy which began somewhat before February '14 and which included the announcement... would have an effect at that point. And that's why I chose that date.\" (Hamburger Decl. Ex. 19, Dkt. No. 438 (\"Lamb Dep. Tr. I\") at 96:2 - 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In other words, Dr. Lamb's test demonstrates that there was a \"structural break\" in February 2014, which happened to be the date when the hard switch was announced. Correlation does not prove causation, but the coincidence in timing between the announcement and the structural break shown by the data is some evidence of causation in support of Plaintiffs' theory. Perhaps other things were happening in the market in February 2014, and Forest may go into them to undercut Dr. Lamb's data. Taken together with the other evidence analyzed by Dr. Lamb, the\n   regression is designed to confirm a hypothesis that is itself based on other indicia. For the purposes of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Lamb's analysis passes muster. \"At most, [Forest's] arguments concerning the assumptions in [Dr. Lamb's] analysis go to its weight, not admissibility of that testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Dial Corp. v.

In his report, Dr. Lamb cites documents demonstrating that, before the February 2014 announcement, Forest had already begun discussed its hard switch plan outside the company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lamb Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 89, 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Lamb included discussion of pre-February 2014 conduct in order to undercut Forest's theory - that increased conversion to Namenda XR after February 2014 was the result of better formulary placement for XR rather than the hard switch.

Thus, Dr. Lamb factored Forest's forecasts into his damages analysis. Specifically, based on Forest's predictions of Namenda XR conversion absent the hard switch, he concluded that the \"Namenda XR conversion rate would rate 30 percent in 18 months after Namenda XR entered the market absent the Hard Switch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150.) For purposes of his damages calculation, \"The difference between the actual and but for Namenda XR conversion rates, multiplied by total market DOT [days of therapy] times the generic penetration rate, yields the amount of branded XR purchases that would have been generic Namenda IR purchases but for the Hard Switch.

However, a substantial portion of Dr. Lamb's report and the entirety of Dr. Berndt's report are dedicated to analyzing and evaluating Forest's forecasts for reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   That hardly renders their conclusions inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants advance three reasons why this testimony should not be admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   First, Defendants argue that Dr. Berndt and Dr. Lamb did not perform any economic analysis to determine what the conversion rate would have been in the but-for world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that neither of the doctors applied any expert methodology to average forecasts or to select which forecasts to include in their averages, and that as a result both doctors haphazardly selected forecasts for their averages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that neither doctor tested the forecasts to determine their reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   None of these arguments holds water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In his report, Dr. Berndt undertook a robust analysis of the process by which Forest came to its forecasts and expectations for the conversion rate between Namenda IR and Namenda XR under a soft switch and a hard switch scenario. He closely studied the inputs into Forest's analysis, analyzed the evolution over time of that analysis, and Forest's internal and external use and reliance upon that analysis. In particular, Dr. Berndt considered that Forest had been in the market for many years, was very familiar with the dynamics between physicians, caregivers, patients, and the various health care entities involved in the treatment of Alzheimer's patients. (Berndt Rep. \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Dr. Berndt considered that Forest had done a searching analysis of analogous situations in which pharmaceutical manufacturers had brought an extended release product into a market in which that company already had an immediate release product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Dr. Berndt considered that Forest surveyed physicians, caregivers, pharmacists and health care entities about the Namenda XR launch and conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Dr. Berndt considered that Forest specifically factored in the impact of a cost-conscious and critical segment of the market for Namenda Alzheimer's patients, Long Term Care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Dr. Berndt considered that Forest's analysis evolved over time, including with the assistance of actual sales data after Namenda XR launched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Dr. Berndt also considered that Forest's executives valued these analyses as reliable and accurate as they used them when communicating their expectations about Namenda XR share in the soft switch scenario internally (including to Forest's Board of Directors) and externally to the investing community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32-38, 48-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Thus, Dr. Berndt did not just assume, as Defendants argue, that Forest's estimates of a 30% conversion in a \"soft switch\" scenario were reliable (as found by Judge Sweet and adopted for purposes of the motion to dismiss by me). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 253 at 24 - 25 (citing\n   <em>\n    New York v.

Dec. 11, 2014) ). Instead, Dr. Berndt applied his scholarship, knowledge, and experience from his many decades of studying the pharmaceutical industry. He analyzed the work that Forest put into its forecasting, as well as the extent to which Forest relied upon those forecasts in making business decisions and communicating with the investor community. He endeavored to determine that the forecasting effort was robust and reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Dr. Berndt concludes that \"the [internal] forecasts reviewed by Dr. Lamb [were] reliable,\" as they were based on Forest's own study of the Namenda market and\n   analogous experiences of other drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Berndt Reply Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 4 - 20.) He further concludes that \"[t]he appropriate 'but for' analysis in this case is one in which Forest makes no hard switch announcement of any kind, executes no communications campaign of any kind aimed at alerting patients ... and others of the impending withdrawal of Namenda IR, and makes no other effort of any kind to implement the hard switch.\" (Berndt Rep. \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Likewise, Dr. Lamb independently reviewed and analyzed Forest's internal document and testimony regarding the soft-switch conversion rate. He did not blindly adopt Dr. Berndt's analysis. He factored in the fact that, \"Forest used various analogues of drug franchises that had experienced conversion from an immediate release to an extended release product when forecasting the conversion rate from Namenda IR to XR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 151.) He noted that Forest updated the Namenda XR conversion forecasts regularly, sometimes creating multiple forecasts in a few weeks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207015198\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Using the forecast documents that were created after Namenda XR had entered the market and before the hard switch was implemented, Dr. Lamb averaged the forecasted soft switch Namenda IR to XR conversion rate for November 2014, 18 months after Namenda XR entered the market, and found the but-for conversion rate to be approximately 30 percent.

Contrary to Defendants' argument, Dr. Lamb did not \"cherry-pick.\" He averaged multiple iterations of Forest's forecasts and came up with a 30% conversion rate. He then confirmed this number was reasonable based on its specific use in numerous company presentations, statements by company executives on earnings calls, and testimony by these executives.

Indeed, it is commonly used in courts considering generic delay damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v.

Analysis: Motion to Exclude Professor John R. Thomas, Esq.'s Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants move to exclude the reports and testimony of Professor Thomas on three grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, Defendants call certain portions of Professor Thomas's opinion irrelevant and prejudicial. For example, the professor writes, \"When competitors within the pharmaceutical industry ... choose to bypass or subvert the legislative framework, they potentially engage in strategic behavior that defies the policy goals embodied in the Hatch-Waxman Act.\" (Thomas Rep. \u00b6 30.) They argue that Professor\n   Thomas implies that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Hatch-Waxman patent settlements are \"suspect\" or \"inherently 'subvert' Congressional intent to make low-cost generic pharmaceuticals broadly available to the public.\" (Defs.' Mem. of Law at 1.) This argument lacks even a scintilla of merit. Defendants cannot point to a single instance where Professor Thomas actually offers such an opinion. As for what Defendants believe he \"implied,\" their beliefs are of no moment. This basis for the motion to exclude is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Professor Thomas should not be allowed to explain the Hatch-Waxman statutory scheme, its regulations, and how they relate to the generics and potential authorized generics in this case. According to Defendants, those explanations would constitute improper legal opinions. They are wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   While, \"This circuit is in accord with other circuits in requiring exclusion of expert testimony that expresses a legal conclusion,\"\n   <em>\n    Hygh v.

In his report, Professor Thomas explains the procedures under the complex law governing approvals of generic drugs, which is subject matter that is foreign to the average person. He does not provide \"legal conclusions\" or opine on whether Defendants violated the Act, but simply explains the mechanics of drug approval, which provides context that is likely to \"assist the trier of fact.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702. I will not preclude this testimony. If Thomas's testimony strays beyond that into matters that are irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible, I will be the first to disallow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, Defendants claim that Professor Thomas is not qualified to opine on Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") approval, since he has neither personally prepared nor filed an ANDA, has never communicated with the FDA regarding an ANDA, and has never worked within the FDA or any pharmaceutical company. That all may be true, but it is of no moment. Professor Thomas has taught courses on the Hatch-Waxman Act at Georgetown Law School since 2002, has written a textbook concerning the Hatch-Waxman Act, patent law, and pharmaceutical drugs, and has been qualified to opine on ANDAs in district court before.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apotex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2012818164\">\n    2011 WL 12818164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20154863\">\n    2011 U.S. Dist.

Plaintiffs retained Mr. Johnston to assess what a reasonable and competent patent attorney would have advised the litigants at the time they settled the Namenda patent litigation in terms of 1) their likelihood of success in the litigation; 2) each of the parties' likely litigation costs; and 3) the likely litigation timing, if the parties had not settled, but rather had continued to litigate through a final, non-appealable\n   judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnston Rep. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Mr. Johnston has spent his entire legal practice as a patent attorney, has over 40 years of experience, and has prosecuted hundreds of patent applications before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"). His experience with patents includes evaluating the patentability of inventions, the scope of patent claims, the validity and enforceability of patents, and the infringement of patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   He served for 17 years as Chief Patent Counsel for Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (\"Roche\") - a global pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic health care organization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6.) During his tenure at Roche, Mr. Johnston \"advise[d] senior management on the likelihood that Roche would prevail in potential and actual patent litigations, the cost of the associated litigations, and the possible timing and duration of the litigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Mr. Johnston retired from Roche in 2013 as a Vice President and Chief Patent Counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) He continues to practice intellectual property law as Counsel at Gibbons P.C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Mr. Johnston has impressive credentials as a patent attorney and legal adviser to drug companies. He is certainly an expert in that capacity. The question is whether the opinions he offers in his report go beyond his area of expertise. I conclude that they do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary of George W. Johnston, Esq.'s Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Mr. Johnston's detailed report begins with a brief description of the patenting process - clarifying that a \"U.S. patent provides the patent holder with the right to seek to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention claimed in the patent for the period during which the patent is in force.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) He also \"discuss[es] the process for extending the term of a pharmaceutical patent under the Hatch-Waxman [and] the procedure under the Hatch-Waxman Act by which a generic manufacturer can challenge pharmaceutical patents listed in the Orange Book so it can enter the market before the patents expire.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Then he provides summarized factual information about the Namenda patent ( '703 patent) that would be known to a general counsel who was advising his client whether or not to settle a lawsuit - information about the patent's filing, its alleged inventive concept, and Forest's New Drug Application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26-35.) He notes that \"The '703 patent relates generally to methods for the treatment or prevention of cerebral ischemia using adamantine derivatives, including memantine and amantadine. [It] recognizes that certain adamantine derivatives, including memantine, were already known and described in the art for the treatment of central nervous system disorders.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) The '703 patent describes an alleged \"new mode\" of action of certain adamantine derivatives. As named inventor, Dr. Bormann, explained: \"[t]he invented concept is that neurodegeneration is caused by calcium overload of the cells and that you can prevent neurodegeneration by memantine or by adamantine derivatives. That's the invention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) This summary of background information sets the stage for his opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Mr. Johnston also recounts the prosecution history of the '703 patent, the USPTO's reexamination of the patent in 2004, and Forest's receipt of Paragraph IV challenges from 15 generic companies in 2007\n   and 2008. \"In their Notice Letters, the Generic Companies argued a variety of defenses including noninfringement and invalidity of the '703 patent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102, 103, 112, 156, and 305.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.) \"In response to the ... Notice Letters, Forest and Merz instituted a number of Hatch-Waxman litigations in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and elsewhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b659.) \"In their Answers and Counterclaims in the Namenda Litigation, the Generic Companies asserted a number of defenses including: noninfringement; invalidity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102, 103, 112, 156, and 305 ; failure to state a claim; lack of subject matter jurisdiction; unclean hands; prosecution history estoppel; inequitable conduct; failure to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20156\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; patent misuse; equitable intervening rights; as well as counterclaims seeking: declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity; an order to de-list the '703 patent from the Orange Book; and a declaratory judgment of invalidity of the patent term extension of the '703 patent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.) A patent lawyer advising a client about the probability of success in an infringement lawsuit would of course have studied the file wrapper and become familiar with the patent's prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   He then summarizes the history of all 15 of Forest's '703 patent litigations against the generic companies leading up to and including settlements in 2009-2010. That information is, of course, a matter of public record. He notes that \"Mylan's case progressed the farthest,\" not settling until August 26, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   He then examines other information that a reasonable patent counsel who was evaluating whether or not to settle a case would have taken into account. He explained data that showed the statistical likelihood that either a patentee or a challenger would win a Hatch-Waxman lawsuit - the actual track record in real litigations. He then evaluated, in the manner that a reasonable and competent patent attorney would, the information that was available to him about the merits of the Namenda litigation between Forest and Mylan. And as part of that analysis, he discussed in depth the legal claims and defenses raised. For example, he evaluates the strength of Mylan's invalidity defenses, including anticipation, obviousness, enablement and patent term extension. In doing so, he brought to bear his extensive knowledge of patent law and patent litigation. He reviews the evidence and expert opinions that Forest and Mylan planned to offer at trial. He analyzes them, and assesses the likelihood that a trier of fact would accept that evidence and those opinions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20156\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 398 - 401.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In short, he does exactly what he did time and again during his years as Chief Patent Attorney at Hoffman-LaRoche.

They urge that allowing Johnston to offer his opinion would run counter to the Federal Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Sundance, Inc. v.

They argue that he opines, from the perspective of a reasonable patent attorney with extensive experience in the area of patent law, about the likelihood that Mylan would succeed in its lawsuit against Forest. Plaintiffs note that Johnston relies on the conclusions of the parties' technical experts - persons who are \"skilled in the art\" - in reaching his own conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opper Decl. Ex. 8, Dkt. No. 421 (\"Johnston Dep.\") at 172:23 - 173:6 (\"I had a different role than that of a technical expert. I had a very focused role in terms of what a reasonable patent attorney ... say, a chief patent counsel, because we did it all the time, would have perceived as the likelihood of success at the time of settlement.\").)

Instead, he offers a \"reasonable patent attorney's\" assessment of the likelihood that Mylan would win its patent case - exactly the sort of assessment he would have offered his client during the nearly two decades when he served as Chief Patent Counsel of Hoffman-LaRoche.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Nonetheless, it would be na\u00efve to conclude that Mr. Johnston's assessment of Mylan's likelihood of succeeding on its claims in the lawsuit does not include some tangential assessment on his part on the issues of the validity and infringement. True, he does not offer the sort of opinion that one skilled in the art would offer - a black-and-white, yes or no, opinion that the patent was or was not valid or infringed. But Johnson's assessment that Mylan's experts were more likely to be believed that Forest's, and his assignment of statistical likelihoods to those technical opinions necessarily depends on his lawyerly assessment of how the ultimate issues in that patent litigation would play out. His conclusion - that Mylan would more likely than not have managed to prove either invalidity or lack of infringement - had to rest on some assessment of the patent's validity and Mylan's defenses to Forest's charge of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   That said, testimony by experienced lawyers about the likelihood that patent litigations will succeed or not succeed has been admitted in several post-\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   reverse-payment cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 14-MD-02503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20563144\">\n    2018 WL 563144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 (D.

Unfortunately, in none of those opinions does the court analyze the lawyer's credentials in any detail or so much as mention the issue identified by this Court in the preceding paragraph. But in every such case the issue was litigation risk and lawyers, not chemists, normally assess litigation risk for their clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Mr. Johnson unquestionably has the expertise to evaluate the things he assessed - from expert reports to patent file folders - and to draw conclusions about who is more likely to win a patent lawsuit. He has done it dozens of times for his employer; there is no reason why he should not be able to do it for Plaintiffs in this lawsuit. To the extent that his opinions rest on his evaluation of technical material - the opinions of the technical experts - he can be cross-examined about his knowledge of the underlying art, or the lack of the same. And of course Forest is offering the testimony of its own expert (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hamburger Decl. Ex. 13, Dkt. No. 438 (Expert Report of Roderick McKelvie, Esq. (\"McKelvie Rep.\") ) ) who will be testifying about his assessment of the merit or lack of merit to the Mylan patent case - the assessment that was actually made before the case settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   As Judge Casper noted when she admitted \"Johnston-like\" expert testimony in\n   <em>\n    In re Solodyn\n   </em>\n   , \"To the extent Defendants seek to challenge [an expert's] conclusions as to the likely outcome of the patent challenges, they may do so with their own expert testimony - as they have proposed to do.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20563144\">\n    2018 WL 563144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Defendants also argue that Mr. Johnston's opinion is flawed because he opines on the likelihood of succeeding on issues that Forest and Mylan did not intend to raise at trial. Defendants point to a \"301-page pretrial order, which includes 187 pages of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from both sides\" in the '703 patent case that Forest and Mylan were prepared to try. (Defs. Mot. to Exclude at 8.) Defendants complain that many of Mr. Johnston's opinions raise issues and legal arguments that were either\n   undeveloped or completely absent from the parties' pretrial order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   However, Defendants have failed to identify any issue raised by Mr. Johnston that cannot be traced back to documentary evidence related to at least one of the Mylan's defenses identified in its pretrial order. That specific cases or facts were not identified with sufficient granularity in the pretrial order does not justify tying Mr. Johnston's hands. As Defendants do not point to either facts or case law that would justify such a conservative approach, the Court refuses to accept this argument. That said, if Mr. Johnson really did go beyond the issues that were actually in the Mylan-Forest litigation, it should be an interesting cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Defendants also protest that Mr. Johnston's opinions constitute impermissible legal opinions and conclusions. However, this is a complex antitrust case involving a secondary body of law - here, patent law - that is not directly at issue. Given the nature of what Mr. Johnston was asked to opine on - the likelihood of success in a patent suit - he necessarily incorporates patent law into his opinion. The Court will not exclude this analysis. As I held with respect to Professor John Thomas's legal testimony, if Mr. Johnston strays beyond into matters that are irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible, I will be the first to disallow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Finally, Defendants complain that Mr. Johnston is not allowed to provide opinions that undermine the statutory presumption of patent validity - a presumption, they argue, that can be overturned only by clear and convincing evidence. After a review of the challenged portions of Mr. Johnston's report, it is clear that his opinions do nothing of the sort. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnston Rep. \u00b6 76 - 86; 87 - 109; 112 - 20.) Again, Defendants are free to cross-examine Mr. Johnston and to argue that he gave insufficient weight to that hard-to-disprove presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Defendants' motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Mylan Reverse Payment Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   By 2002, Forest had a license to market a drug named Lexapro. (DSoF \u00b6 180.) On October 3, 2005, Forest and Alphapharm (later acquired by Mylan), entered into a distribution and supply agreement for authorized generic Lexapro (\"the Original Lexapro Agreement.\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 182.) By the terms of the Original Lexapro Agreement, Forest would supply Alphapharm's requirements of generic Lexapro for sale and distribution, and Alphapharm would market, but not manufacture, an authorized generic version of Lexapro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Alphapharm agreed to pay Forest a 40% share of its \"product profit,\" which the agreement defined as Alphapharm's net sales less Forest's manufacturing costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 189-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The '712 Patent was set to expire on March 12, 2012, at which point Teva, the sole first-filing ANDA applicant, was permitted to launch its version of generic Lexapro on March 12, 2012 and was entitled to 180 days of exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act, in that the FDA would not finally approve another ADNA during that time. (DSoF \u00b6 194; PRSoF \u00b6 194.) Under the Agreement, Alphapharm was allowed to launch its authorized generic two weeks before Teva's date of entry on February 27, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 188, 193;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   PRSoF \u00b6 193.) The Original Lexapro Agreement had a five year term (starting with Lexapro patent expiry), with a one-year minimum. (PRSoF \u00b6 218(e).) Mylan acquired Alphapharm in 2007. (DSoF \u00b6 218.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (\"MDRP\"), which was established by Congress in 1990, required brand manufacturers to pay a rebate to the government on prescription drugs reimbursed by Medicaid. (DSoF \u00b6 197.) The MDRP requires participating drug manufacturers to pay a rebate on those drugs for which a state's Medicaid agency has paid pharmacies to dispense the drug to Medicaid beneficiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 198.) To determine the rebate amount owed by a manufacturer, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") calculates a per-unit rebate amount (\"URA\") based on a statutory formula. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 199.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The URA for a drug is tied to a product's \"Best Price\" or, \"the lowest price available from the manufacturer during the rebate period to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity within the United States...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 200.) The URA is calculated, in part, using a brand manufacturer's commercial sales and discount data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 201.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (\"DRA\"), in large part, became effective on January 1, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 202.) The Final Rule implementing the DRA (the \"DRA Final Rule\") became effective October 1, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 203.) The DRA amended the definition of Best Price to include, for the first time, the lowest price of an authorized generic drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 206.) On January 23, 2008, the CMS clarified that the DRA Final Rule \"provides that the primary manufacturer include the best price of an authorized generic drug in its calculation of best price when the drug being sold by the primary manufacturer to the secondary manufacturer. In accordance with this provision, we expect that the primary manufacturer report a BP [best price] which incorporates the transfer price at the time of sale to the secondary manufacturer for the quarter in which the sale occurs, regardless of when the product is launched.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 207.) The transfer price is generally reflective of the cost to manufacture a drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Under the Original Texapro Agreement, Forest was a primary manufacturer, and Alphapharm was a secondary manufacturer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208.) Generally, the lower a manufacturer's best price is, the higher its Medicaid Rebate liability will be. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   It is undisputed that the DRA exposed Forest to more Medicaid liability than it was exposed to when it entered the agreement in 2005, since under the new rule Forest would now have to include the best price of generic Lexapro in its calculation of best price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208-14; PRSoF \u00b6 214.) It is also undisputed that the parties negotiated and amended its Lexapro Agreement (\"the Lexapro Amendment\"), which was executed on July 21, 2010. (DSoF \u00b6 255.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The parties dispute, however, the content and validity of Forest's cost-benefit analysis while it was negotiating the Lexapro Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   According to Defendants, Forest performed three analyses to assess the potential benefits of amending the Original Lexapro Agreement: (1) a comparison of Forest's post-DRA Medicaid Liability under the Original Lexapro Agreement and Forest's liability pursuant to a potential amendment requiring Mylan to manufacture generic Lexapro (\"Medicaid Liability Analysis\"), (2) a forecast projecting Forest's profit share revenue under the Original\n   Lexapro Agreement and a potential amendment to that agreement (\"The Lexapro Sales Forecasts\"), and (3) a projection of the potential costs of goods sold savings Mylan could achieve if it manufactured generic Lexapro (\"COGS Summary\"). (DSoF \u00b6 215.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the documents underlying Forest's analysis are unreliable. Plaintiffs point out that the final analyses were not created until after Forest and Mylan told the Namenda IR patent court that it had reached a settlement in principle; thus, they could not have been performed to assess the \"potential benefits\" of the transaction, which had already been agreed to. (PRSoF \u00b6 214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Other Reverse Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The parties do not provide the Court with the same level of detail about the other reverse payment agreements. Here is what we know: Forest settled with approximately eleven generic companies, with each settlement providing for up to a $2 million cash payment, and generic launch dates three months prior to Forest's statutory exclusivity, absent any extension for pediatric exclusivity or the triggering of the accelerated launch provisions if other generics came in early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   There have been two dispositive motions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   On September 13, 2016, this Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss - finding, in brief, that Plaintiffs stated a claim for product hopping (based on the planned \"hard switch\"), stated a claim based on the settlement agreements with generic manufacturers, and Plaintiff claims were not time-barred. (Dkt. No. 106.) This Court dismissed Plaintiffs' overarching scheme claim (Count II) as duplicative. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   A few months later, Plaintiffs moved for collateral estoppel and partial summary judgment on Count One (Dkt.

On May 23, 2017, this Court denied both motions for partial summary judgment on Count IV. This Court also granted Plaintiffs' motion for collateral estoppel, finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   Because all of the elements of collateral estoppel are met, Forest is precluded from relitigating the questions of (1) whether it possessed monopoly power over the U.S. memantine market up until the entry of generic competition; (2) whether its February 2014 announcement of the upcoming discontinuation of Namenda IR was coercive and anticompetitive; and (3) whether Forest had any non-pretextual procompetitive justification for its illegal conduct.

Count I alleges unlawful maintenance of monopoly power under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for forcing Namenda IR consumers to switch to Namenda XR. Count III alleges unlawful maintenance of monopoly power under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for entering into agreements with generic manufacturers to delay generic entry for three months past the expiration of the '703 patent.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 26 at \u00b6\u00b6 244 - 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   As mentioned above, this Court dismissed this count in its September 13, 2016 decision on Defendants' motions to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 106 at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs have abandoned their inter-generic conspiracy claim (Count IV).

Mot. for Summary Judgment at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   There are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment with respect to Forest's two other grounds for summary judgment, which I address in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on all Claims Arising from Forest's Alleged Reverse Payments to Generic Manufacturers is DENIED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims arising from Forest's patent settlement agreements with generics, arguing that Forest made no illegal reverse payments as part of their settling of the various Namenda patent challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence such that a reasonable juror could find that Forest's payments to generics did not merely compensate them for avoided litigation costs or fair value for services - and thus were large and unjustified reverse payment in violation of the antitrust laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Which Settlement Agreements Are at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   As an initial matter, Forest argues that discovery eliminated the vast majority of Plaintiffs' reverse payment claims. In their First Amended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 29), Plaintiffs asserted that Forest entered into anticompetitive reverse payment settlement agreements with approximately eleven first filer generic manufacturers. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 113.) Forest contends that, after discovery failed to support their wide-ranging allegations, Plaintiffs functionally abandoned their challenges to all but one of these agreements - the Forest-Mylan Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The following discussion analyzes the Forest-Mylan Agreement only. The fact remains, however, that the anticompetitive conduct at issue in this case is premised on the alleged barriers to entry put in place by Forest to prevent\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   generic competition, not just Mylan's. Given that the Forest-Mylan settlement was the very last patent settlement agreement Forest entered into, all of the other settlements to keep generic companies from competing that were signed before the Forest-Mylan settlement undergird and compound the anticompetitive effect of the Forest-Mylan deal. This fact is well-illustrated by a February 11, 2010 Forest-Mylan settlement presentation, in which Forest explained that if Mylan would have won the Namenda patent litigation, there would have been \"No Financial Upside\" because Mylan's profits would have been \"miniscule\" due to the ... prior settling Namenda generics having provisions in their agreements that provided for immediate and simultaneous market entry if Mylan won the patent dispute, [thereby] lowering Mylan's potential generic Namenda profits.\" PASoF \u00b6 236 - 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Nonetheless, Forest argues that Plaintiffs have abandoned their claims relating to all but Mylan. As a result, in the papers supporting its motion, Forest does not make a particularized showing about why summary judgment should be granted with regard to any of the other agreements that were identified in the complaint as anticompetitive. It simply asserts that Plaintiffs have abandoned those claims, and offers evidence and argument about why the Forest-Mylan settlement does not violate the antitrust laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Plaintiffs have taken no affirmative steps to indicate that it has abandoned all claims related to its other eleven or so alleged reverse payments - that is simply an assertion by Forest. In its responsive papers, it neither agrees with Forest that those claims have been abandoned nor offers any evidence that would tend to show that the agreements were in fact anti-competitive. Of course, as the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs had no obligation to discuss agreements that were not addressed on the merits by Forest. But they should have addressed Forest's contention that they were abandoning those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   I am going to address the Forest-Mylan agreement, as to which there are myriad genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment. Plaintiffs have ten days from the date of this decision to advise the Court whether they are pursuing claims related to the other reverse payment agreements. If they are, we will simply take those claims to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

Although Defendants have offered procompetitive justifications for the Lexapro Amendment -particularly evidence that may indicate that the Lexapro Amendment was a fair market value deal - Plaintiffs have offered some evidence that the Amendment was not fair, but instead, constituted overcompensation for agreeing not to compete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <em>\n    a.

Nonetheless, it is undisputed that both the settlement agreement and Lexapro Amendment were executed on the same day, July 21, 2010, and that there were certain personnel of whom were aware of both agreements. (PASoF \u00b6 239.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the Lexapro Amendment was linked to the Namenda patent settlement. As evidence, they point to Mylan Deal Concept documents reflecting the \"proposed structure\" of the Namenda patent settlement, which featured the amendment to the Original Lexapro Agreement. (PASoF \u00b6 229.) The January 20 document listed, as \"Potential Transaction Benefits to Mylan,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   \"at least $1.5MM in manufacturing cost savings gained through Mylan's control of drug product manufacturing and packaging!.]\" (PASoF \u00b6 232.) Plaintiffs also point to Forest's in-house and outside counsel repeatedly referring to the Lexapro Amendment as a \"side-deal\" to the Namenda patent dispute (PASoF \u00b6 243), along with a February 11, 2010 Forest-Mylan meeting presentation that explicitly presents the Lexapro Amendment and Namenda patent settlement as a package. (PASoF \u00b6 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   On this point, Plaintiffs have presented enough evidence to allow a rational juror to conclude that the Lexapro Agreement was a part of the Forest-Mylan patent settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Plaintiffs have also presented sufficient evidence to allow a rational juror to conclude that the Lexapro Amendment had an anticompetitive effect that outweighed its procompetitive effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Forest contends that the Lexapro Amendment did not disguise a payment for delayed generic entry, but was instead a fair value business deal between Forest and Mylan, based on arm's length negotiations and reasonable business expectations at the time of the agreement. Plaintiffs counter that the Lexapro Amendment was both large and unjustified. They claim that the Lexapro Amendment conferred $32.5 million to Mylan - ten times Forest's saved litigation costs of $3.5 million. (PRSoF \u00b6 280.) Plaintiffs point again to Forest's 2011 settlement presentation, in which Forest points out that \"the money it was proposing to pay to Mylan - including 'millions of dollars' from modifying the 'LEXAPRO authorized generic deal' - 'provides\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   value than Mylan's forecasted profits for generic memantine[.]\" (PASoF \u00b6 235-38 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   This admission is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact. \"A reasonable jury could find that a reverse payment to a generic manufacturer that comes close to or exceeds the expected profits to be earned by prevailing in the patent litigation could induce a generic manufacturer to forfeit its claim.\"\n   <em>\n    King Drug Co. of Florence v.

Plaintiffs point out that the final analyses were not created until after Forest and Mylan told the Namenda IR patent court that it had reached a settlement in principle. (PRSoF \u00b6 214.) Plaintiffs claim that Forest employees manipulated the rebate liability analyses to inflate the forecasted rebate savings to just about equal the reverse payment to Mylan.

Early Entry Date But for Reverse Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Plaintiffs' first causation theory is that the parties would have agreed to an earlier generic entry date but for the alleged reverse payment. Plaintiffs rely primarily on expert opinions to support this causation theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   As discussed in section I.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs rely on a report from Professor Einer Elhauge addressing what economic analysis reveals about Forest and Mylan's settlement of the Namenda IR patent litigation, including whether an alleged reverse payment from Forest to Mylan delayed generic entry into the market and what the settlement entry date would have been in a no-payment settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elhauge Rep. \u00b6 1.) Professor Elhauge's report was admitted with the caveat that he cannot offer an opinion about when entry \"would have\" occurred, so as not to usurp the role of the factfinder. Professor Elhauge is, however, allowed to testify that by specific dates \"it would have been economically rational for both parties\" to enter into a no-payment settlement in a \"but for\" world (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , November 2012). (Elhauge Dep. Tr. at 225:18 - 227:18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Forest attacks Professor Elhauge's assertions as speculative and largely repeats the arguments made in its motion to exclude. This Court has already held that it will not prevent Professor Elhauge from offering his opinion on this but-for scenario as a general matter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section I.2.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Forest argues that the evidence suggests that it would not have agreed to a settlement allowing generic Namenda entry in November 2012. In support of this argument, Forest cites to\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   testimony of its own employees. For example, Forest points to testimony from its Chief Intellectual Property Counsel, who was responsible for overseeing the Namenda patent litigation at the time of the settlement. He testified that a settlement agreement with Mylan allowing generic entry in 2012 would have been neither feasible nor acceptable to Forest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamburger Decl.

Plaintiffs counter that the subsequent settlements had nothing to do with the patent merits, but are instead evidence - as Forest explained to Mylan during settlement discussions - that the generics recognized that there was \"no financial upside to litigating.\" (PASoF \u00b6\u00b6 56 - 57.) In other words, they argue that the settlements were recognition that there were fourteen first filers who would share the 180-day exclusivity window and that sales and profits for generic memantine would be miniscule as a result.

They are Bellco, Burlington Drug, The Harvard Group, and Valley Wholesale. Defendants assert that Bellco is owned by Amerisource Bergen; that Burlington Drug is owned by JM Smith Corporation; that The Harvard Group is owned by Cardinal; and that Valley Wholesale is owned by H.D. Smith LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Plaintiffs' Exhibit 9 addresses the corporate status of these entities. (Pls.' Ex. 9, Corporate Status of Certain Entities Listed in Manufacturer Transactional Data.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   The record indicates that Bellco is the wholly owned subsidiary of Amerisource Bergen Drug Corporation and has been incorporated in New York State since May 1960. (Pls.' Ex. 9-B.) Burlington Drug is a subsidiary of JM Smith Corporation, formed under the laws of Vermont in January 1998. (Pls.' Ex. 9-C.) The Harvard Group is a majority-owned subsidiary of Cardinal, incorporated under the laws of Michigan in June 1997. (Pls.' Ex. 9-D.) And Valley Wholesale is a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.D. Smith, formed under the laws of Delaware in October 2012. (Pls.' Ex. 9-E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that these subsidiaries are each entitled to a presumption of separateness from their parent corporations because the companies are separately incorporated, separately listed in the manufacturers' transactional data, and, most importantly, separately purchased (and were overcharged for) the. product. (Pls.' Reply at 6.) In other words, related or not, each Class member that bought Namenda \"suffered independent injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   I agree. Defendants do not dispute the fact that these entities each independently purchased Namenda products.

July 28, 2017) (allowing subsidiaries to vindicate their own antitrust injuries).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Plaintiffs provide sufficient evidence of separateness between these subsidiaries and their parent corporations. Any overcharges they paid for their own purchases of memantine are separately and distinctly applicable to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Miscellaneous Uninjured Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Defendants' objections to the following entities are variations on a theme. At bottom, their arguments pertaining to Publix, HE Butt, Kerr Drug, Bartell, DMS, Drogueria\n   Central, Kroger, Discount Drug Mart, and The Harvard Group come down to the claim that, for one reason or another, these entities were not injured by Forest's alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   To frame the following discussion, it is instructive to review the proposed class members' alleged injuries. All members of the class claim that they were overcharged for their memantine requirements due to Forest's allegedly anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   With respect to the reverse payment claim, Plaintiffs allege that \"all or nearly all\" members of the class were overcharged. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 13-a.) They allege that any member who purchased Namenda IR, Namenda XR, and/or generic memantine hydrochloride paid higher prices than they otherwise would have had generic competition started earlier, \"because they would have purchased (or purchased more) generic memantine at prices below branded Namenda and would have purchased the generic at lower prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, Plaintiffs claim that the reverse payment injured any member who purchased Namenda IR, any member who purchased Namenda XR, and any member who purchased a generic alternative once it became available (from Forest or from a generic competitor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   With respect to the hard switch claim, Plaintiffs allege that \"all or nearly all proposed Class members who purchased at least Namenda IR and XR, or XR\" were overcharged. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 13-b.) In other words, Plaintiffs allege that any entity that purchased Namenda XR paid a higher price than they otherwise would have for the generic memantine they would have purchased in place of the more expensive brand name drug, and that they would have purchased more of that generic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the aggregate overcharges break down into two categories: \"Brand-Generic\" and \"Generic-Generic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125.) The former relates to Forest's alleged foreclosure of class members' switching to generic memantine via both the reverse payment and the hard switch strategy. Absent the reverse payment, Plaintiffs allege, a large volume of branded Namenda IR and Namenda XR purchases would have been replaced by generic memantine at a significantly reduced price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Brand-Generic\" injuries thus include the higher prices paid by class members for the branded Namenda IR and XR they actually bought instead of the lower-priced generic alternative they would have bought absent the reverse payment and the hard switch strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   \"Generic-Generic\" overcharges relate to the higher prices that class members paid for the generic alternatives they actually bought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126.) The reverse payment led to such overcharges because it delayed generic entry and \"prices for generic drugs tend to decline over time as generic manufacturers compete against each other.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The hard switch strategy led to Generic-Generic overcharges because it shifted the Namenda IR prescription base to Namenda XR before generics had the chance to compete for Namenda IR business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.) In light of the 89.9% substitution rate of generic memantine for brand Namenda IR over the three months following generic entry, Dr. Lamb concludes that generic entry would have affected a larger base of IR prescriptions absent the hard switch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81.) Plaintiffs submit that generic memantine purchasers paid higher prices because this suppressed generic sales and their attendant savings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.) The Generic-Generic category would apply to any member who purchased generic memantine, whether they previously purchased branded Namenda products or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Moving to Defendants' specific objections, they first argue that Publix, HE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Butt, Kerr Drug, and Bartell were not injured because they never bought Namenda IR and stopped buying Namenda XR before the hard switch announcement. (Defs.' Opp'n at 12.) These entities were injured under the Brand-Generic theory described above insofar as Plaintiffs allege that Namenda XR purchases would have been replaced by generic memantine at a significantly reduced price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   Publix and HE Butt were also injured to the extent they purchased generic memantine. The record indicates that Kerr Drug and Bartell never purchased generic memantine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamburger Decl. Ex. 13, Dkt. No. 410 (Expert Report of Pierre-Yves Cremieux (\"Cremieux Rep.\") ), at \u00b6 63 (Ex. 1.2, Summary of Findings: Reverse Payment).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   Defendants argue that DMS could not have been injured by the alleged scheme because it did not make any purchases of Namenda IR or Namenda XR until after generic entry.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 13.) To the extent Plaintiffs allege that DMS purchased generic memantine during the class period, DMS suffered injury in the form of Generic-Generic overcharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   Defendants argue that Bartell, Drogueria Central, Kerr Drug, and Kroger should be excluded because they did not buy generic memantine, even after it became available following generic entry. They submit that there is no basis to assume that such brand-only purchasers \"would have purchased generic Namenda IR in the but-for world.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   I understand Defendants' argument that the decision to continue buying branded Namenda products, even after generics entered the market, casts doubt on the fact that these entities would have purchased the generic earlier had it been available to them. But Defendants are not entitled to the benefit of that doubt when the very reason we cannot know the answer to that question is because of their alleged wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p695\">\n    585 F.3d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Defendants argue that Discount Drug Mart, Drogueria Central, and The Harvard Group \"could not have been injured by the hard switch\" because they never purchased Namenda XR or stopped purchasing Namenda XR before the February 2014 announcement, and should therefore be excluded with respect to the hard switch claim. (Defs.' Opp'n at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   That these entities never purchased Namenda XR does not establish that they were uninjured by the hard switch. If the jury finds Forest liable on Plaintiffs' theory of liability, these members were injured insofar as the hard switch strategy shifted the Namenda IR prescription base, thereby suppressing generic sales and their attendant savings. In the case of Discount Drug Mart, the question of whether its purchases were \"due to\" the hard switch strategy is a question for the trier of fact, given the evidence of Defendants' pre-announcement communications with key stakeholders and customers regarding the launch of Namenda XR and withdrawal of Namenda IR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   That brings Plaintiffs to a total proposed class of 31 members, which is still below the commonly accepted threshold of 40 members needed to warrant class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   And so we turn to the largest and most complicated group of potential class members - the one as to which Forest levels the most objections. If they can be included in the class, it will easily exceed the 40 member threshold. If they cannot, certification becomes more problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Generic Purchaser Group\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   This category includes members who purchased generic memantine hydrochloride. They are Albertsons LLC; American Health Packaging; Associated Pharmacies; Auburn Pharmaceutical; Bloodworth Wholesale Drugs; Blupax Pharmaceuticals, LLC; CVS Caremark; Drugs Unlimited, Inc.; Express Scripts Inc.; Genetco Inc.; Hannaford Brothers; HC Pharmacy Central Inc.; Healthsource Distributors, LLC; Humana, Inc.; Independent Pharmacy Cooperative; Kaiser Permanente; Keysource Medical, Inc.; Major Pharmaceuticals/Rugby Lab; Masters Pharmaceutical Inc.; Medco Health Solutions Inc.; Meijer Inc.; Optumrx Inc.; Peytons; Quest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Richie Pharmaceutical Company; RX Outreach; Supervalu Inc.; Tel Drug of PA LLC Joann Christens; Top RX LLC; Walmart; and Winn Dixie Logistics Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Forest objects to the inclusion of the entire Generic Purchaser Group because generic purchasers were not included in the original class definition proposed in the complaint. It also argues that their claims are not typical of Forest Direct Customers, and that their claims either lack common questions with the Forest Direct Customers' hard switch claim, or any common issues do not predominate. Forest argues that named Plaintiffs' interests are not aligned with the Generic Purchaser Group as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Finally, because all but one Generic Purchaser - Meyer, Inc. - purchased memantine from Forest's generic competitors, not from Forest itself, Forest objects to the Non-Forest Generic Purchasers on the further ground that they lack antitrust standing under\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick Co. v.

Expanded Class Definition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   Defendants are correct that the inclusion of the Generic Purchaser Group expands upon the definition found in Plaintiffs' complaint, which proposed a class consisting only of members who purchased Namenda IR or XR\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   from Forest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 193.) They are wrong, however, when they argue Plaintiffs \"were obligated to seek leave to amend the Complaint well before fact discovery closed.\" (Defs.'

Adequacy of Named Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   Defendants claim that RDC and Smith (both Forest Direct Customers) are inadequate representatives of a class including the Generic Purchaser Group because the majority of that group faces a unique standing hurdle, and no member of that group has an interest in the product-hopping claim.

Plaintiffs allege that the Generic Purchaser Group was impacted by the hard switch strategy because it led to higher generic prices. Dr. Lamb concluded that absent the hard switch strategy, and given the 89.9% substitution of generic memantine for brand Namenda in the three months following generic entry, generic entry would have affected a larger base of IR prescriptions and led to increased generic memantine purchases and savings.

The class members in this case are spread across the country; a fair number are located on the East Coast, others on the West, and still others in Puerto Rico. (Lamb Reply Rep. at Fig. 2.) Their disparate locations constitutes both a significant and practical difficulty to joinder. Individual suits filed in each of these locations would also impose an unnecessary and substantial burden on the judicial system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   There is also evidence that a number of the potential class members are small wholesalers that lack the financial resources to bring individual actions. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 42.) While all members might have the same incentive to bring individual actions, they do not have the same ability to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Typicality, Commonality, and Predominance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   Defendants' objections to the various subgroups addressed above are, in reality, arguments about typicality, commonality, and predominance.

(Defs.' Opp'n at 19 - 20.) As to the inclusion of AmerisourceBergen, McKesson, and Cardinal Health, Defendants argue that because \"the Big Three\" are large national wholesalers, they are in a fundamentally different position than RDC and Smith and enjoy significantly more negotiating power and leverage with suppliers like Forest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) The size of these entities, however, does not change the fact that their claims arise from the same course of conduct alleged by all class members - the reverse payment and the hard switch strategy. As members who purchased both branded Namenda products and the generic alternative, these entities advance legal arguments identical to members in the Forest Direct Customer subgroup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   It is a more complicated question whether common questions can be said to exist, and indeed, to predominate, when the class includes all subgroups.

That discussion also addresses the typicality argument Defendants raise with respect to the Generic Purchaser Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   The parties agree that Plaintiffs must show that three elements are capable of proof at trial through evidence common to the class: (1) a violation of antitrust law; (2) injury and causation; and (3) damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleischman v.

Plaintiffs claim that \"the proof necessary to establish Defendants' wrongdoing will not vary Class member-by-Class member.\" (Mem. in Support of Direct Purchaser Class Pls.' Mot. for Class Certification at 17.) They argue that the reverse payment with Mylan presents \"solely\" common issues, and that the product-hop theory presents \"predominantly\" common issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   As to liability, I agree that common questions predominate over the class, including the generic-only purchasers. If each Class members were to pursue this theory individually, \"each would have to prove the same course of conduct, using the same documents and witnesses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) To establish the reverse payment claim, for example, all members will need to present evidence of the agreement and its terms. Similarly, to establish the hard switch claim, members have indicated that they will offer evidence of pre-announcement communications with key stakeholders and customers regarding the forthcoming launch of Namenda XR and withdrawal of Namenda IR; evidence of the announcement itself; evidence pertaining to Judge Sweet's December 15, 2014 order; and evidence related to the aftermath of that order, including Forest's communications regarding its intention to challenge Judge Sweet's order in the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that 58 of the 62 members in the proposed class were impacted by the Brand-Generic and/or the Generic-Generic overcharge because they either switched from branded Namenda to the generic alternative once it became available, or just bought the generic. (Pls.' Reply at 2.) (Only 4 purchasers - Bartell, Drogueria Central, Kerr Drug, and Kroger - continued to buy branded Namenda following generic entry.) They claim that the brand-to-generic purchasers suffered Brand-Generic overcharges during the time they were purchasing branded Namenda products and also suffered Generic-Generic overcharges once they switched to the generic alternative. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   Common questions predominate as to injury. First and foremost, at trial, all but 4 members of the class would need to prove they were injured by the Generic-Generic overcharge - that, but for Defendants' conduct, \"generic prices by July 2015 would have been lower.\" (Pls.' Reply at 4.) This is but one aspect of the injury suffered by the 27 customers who allege they also paid higher prices for the branded Namenda they actually purchased. For the remaining 31 members, the Generic Purchaser Group, this is the ultimate question with respect to injury. Therefore, 58 of the 62 members (just about 94% of the class) allege they were injured by paying higher prices for the generic memantine they actually purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   This issue is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof. As Defendants point out, Plaintiffs' proof of injury will necessarily be intertwined with proof of damages. (Defs.' Opp'n at 23.)

They will also need to show that the hard switch strategy further suppressed generic competition (and therefore savings) by shifting the Namenda IR prescription base to Namenda XR before generic entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   All class members indicate that they plan to rely on Dr. Lamb's analysis of antitrust injury and damages, which, in turn, is based on three categories of proof that he states is \"common to the proposed Class as a whole rather than specific to individual members.\" (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 67.) His conclusions are based on: (1) peer-reviewed economic and government research showing that generics typically enter the market at lower prices than their brand name counterparts and capture a significant share of the total unit sales for that drug; (2) Forest's internal forecasts of the impact that generic competition would have on the memantine market; and (3) data on the actual sales volumes and prices of Namenda IR, Namenda XR, and generic memantine (which shows a 95% price discount for the generic and an 89.9% substitution rate by September 2015), derived from IMS Health's NSP database. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68 - 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   They also intend to rely on his analysis of the impact that the hard switch had on generic competition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.) For example, while Forest lost 96.5% of Namenda IR sales within six months of generic entry, it retained significant sales of branded Namenda because over 50% of existing Namenda patients had already switched to Namenda XR - \"far more than the approximately 30 percent that [Forest's] own planning indicated would be possible in the absence of a hard switch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 16.) This analysis again relies in part on internal forecasts, including Forest's comparison of its loss of exclusivity over Namenda IR with the Hard Switch strategy and without it. Other common evidence includes communications from Forest to various stakeholders (physicians, caregivers, pharmacies) and customers regarding Forest's \"Namenda IR to XR Conversion Project\" and informing them of the withdrawal of Namenda IR \"immediately and for the next six months.\" (Pls.' Reply at 11; Lamb Rep. \u00b6 98.) All members indicate they will rely on this evidence at trial to prove that, while Namenda IR was never fully removed from the market, due to Judge Sweet's December 15, 2014 order, \"this communications strategy was successful for Forest in triggering wide-spread conversion to Namenda XR.\" (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   While the Generic Purchaser Group will not (and could not) prove that they were injured by any Brand-Generic overcharges, determining Brand-Generic damages does not overwhelm the predominantly common issues that govern the class. To determine Brand-Generic damages, Plaintiffs indicate that they will rely on some of the same evidence discussed in connection with the Generic-Generic damages. To determine Brand-Generic damages, Dr. Lamb used the NSP database to calculate both \"the price differential between the actual average Namenda IR and Namenda XR prices and\n   <em>\n    but-for average monthly generic memantine hydrochloride prices\n   </em>\n   \" and \"the price differential between the actual average Namenda XR monthly prices and\n   <em>\n    but-for average monthly generic memantine hydrochloride prices\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125 (emphasis added).) For both Brand-Generic and Generic-Generic damages, class members will need to establish the price of\n   average monthly generic memantine but for Defendant's alleged misconduct. The additional factor in the Brand-Generic computation is the actual average monthly price of Namenda IR and Namenda XR, which is a far less complicated question. It does not overwhelm the predominating issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n   .

Their overarching objection is that Dr. Lamb's models assume the injury that they purport to prove. To the extent I have addressed these objections in connection with Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Lamb as an expert, I will not readdress them here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Hard Switch Methodology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   To calculate hard switch damages, Dr. Lamb started with actual Namenda XR sales volume over the class period. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 146.) He subtracted from that number the estimated sales volume of Namenda XR that Forest predicted would occur if\n   it did not commence the hard switch (lawful conversion). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The difference between those figures, Dr. Lamb concludes, is attributable to the hard switch. (Pls.' Reply at 11; Lamb Rep. \u00b6 146.) He performed a structural break / statistical significance test to confirm this conclusion. He then used this figure (the difference between actual and but-for Namenda XR sales) to calculate the price that class members who purchased Namenda XR would have paid for generic memantine instead of purchasing Namenda XR. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Lamb's hard switch model, including the structural break test that purports to confirm his conclusion, fail to prove causation. (Defs.' Opp'n at 31.) Without proving that proposed class members' Namenda XR purchases were made because of the hard switch, Defendants claim that Dr. Lamb's models fail to show that members were injured. This is more or less the same argument made in Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Lamb's expert testimony. Defendants again argue that Dr. Lamb's hard switch methodology fails to show causation because it includes market-wide, rather than purchaser-specific information, and imposes a 30% threshold of lawful Namenda XR adoption. I remain unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   In the class certification context, Defendants emphasize that market-wide data cannot establish causation because it does not account for patient and physician prescribing preferences, which would require individualized proof. I reiterate what I said in my discussion of Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Lamb's expert testimony - Plaintiffs' allegation is that Forest worked to ensure a \" 'forced switch' whereby physicians and patients would have little choice but to switch to Namenda XR.\" (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 89.) They allege that limiting patient and physician preferences was precisely the point of \"discontinu[ing] or dramatically restrict[ing] the supply of Namenda IR several months before the availability of generic memantine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   In this case, the idiosyncrasies of patient preferences do not require a degree of individualized proof that makes class certification inappropriate. Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   is undermined by the fact that the proposed members were not individual consumers - a fact of fundamental importance to the court's decision in that case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p227\">\n    522 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   224 ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 229 ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 225 n.7. Here, proposed members are not patients; they are \"wholesalers and other direct purchasers.\" (Pls.' Reply at 14.) Forest does not contest the fact that it \"deals with wholesalers, not patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) I agree with those courts that have rejected the argument that a class comprising direct purchasers must show that individual patient decisions were the result of the defendant's alleged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140790\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/516/#p528\">\n    391 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528-29 (3d Cir. 2004) (plaintiffs' allegation of overpayment for drug was \"purely an economic injury\" supporting a finding of commonality and predominance);\n   <em>\n    In re Solodyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204621777\">\n    2017 WL 4621777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 ;\n   <em>\n    Teva Pharm.

Del. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   As to the 30% lawful adoption rate imposed in Dr. Lamb's model, I have already addressed the propriety of this figure in response to Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Lamb and Dr. Berndt's use of forecast averages in their respective analyses. This threshold was derived from Forest's own documents and forecasts, which compared hard switch and soft switch scenarios, as well as internal high-level analysis of how these forecasts impacted potential Namenda XR conversion rates. These forecasts were not, as Defendants state, \"cherry-picked.\" Dr. Lamb relied on forecasts that\n   were (1) \"closest in time to Forest's decision to enact the hard switch, after Forest had market experience with Namenda XR and predicted generic entry in July 2015 (when it actually occurred), and thus incorporated the best analysis Forest had at the time\"; and (2) \"consistent with Forest's actual conversion rate through January 2014, before the switch announcement.\" (Pls.' Reply at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   In any event, disputes over which forecasts are the appropriate forecasts do not discredit Dr. Lamb's methodology at the class certification stage. It is for the jury to decide whether the his opinions are persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Solodyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204621777\">\n    2017 WL 4621777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   It is also worth noting that, when estimating the adoption rate of Namenda XR absent the hard switch, it stands to reason that Forest took factors such as patient and physician prescribing preferences into account. As Dr. Lamb indicates, Forest's Namenda XR conversion rates were both thorough and kept up to date, with multiple forecasts being created in the space of a few weeks. (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   Defendants raise the additional argument that Dr. Lamb dismisses the impact of Judge Sweet's injunction and Forest's \"campaign to comply with it.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 30.) Dr. Lamb considered this possibility at length. He concluded, however, that the injunction \"was unlikely to have eliminated the anticompetitive effects of Forest's Hard Switch strategy.\" (Pls.' Reply at 12; Lamb Reply Rep. \u00b6 69 - 75.) He reached this conclusion based on two categories of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   First, when Forest informed customers of the injunction, it indicated that it was \"appealing\" the order and intended to \"convince the higher court that, in fact, the lower court's decision was in error.\" (Opper Decl. Ex. 13, Dkt. No. 421 (\"Cremieux Dep. Tr.\") at 13:18 - 21.) After the Second Circuit upheld the injunction, Forest continued to challenge it through November 2015, and communicated this to its customers. (Pls.' Reply at 12; Lamb Rep. \u00b6 114.) Plaintiffs' argue that the effects of the hard switch continued because, contrary to Forest's alleged campaign to comply with the injunction, Forest \"intentionally sowed doubt\" as to whether it would stand. (Pls.' Reply at 12.) This is supported by evidence cited in Dr. Lamb's report that \"physicians were often hesitant to prescribe Namenda IR following the Court's injunction.\" (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   Second, Dr. Lamb reviewed evidence indicating the difficulty of transitioning patients back to Namenda IR once they had switched to Namenda XR. This includes evidence that physicians were hesitant to prescribe, and pharmacies and health plans no longer covered, Namenda IR following the injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.) Plaintiffs thus argue that, regardless of the injunction, \"the marketplace, once shifted, would be slow to revert back to IR.\" (Pls.' Reply at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reverse Payment Methodology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   Because Dr. Lamb's reverse payment model incorporates hard switch damages, Defendants argue that it suffers from the same flaws described above. That discussion applies with respect to those objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   Defendants claim that the reverse payment model suffers from additional flaws. They argue both that it is \"premised on assumptions regarding generic pricing and penetration that are untethered from the actual world and sound economic theory,\" and that it allocates damages on the assumption that each member was injured by the reverse payment and the hard switch strategy. (Defs.' Opp'n at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   The first objection is without merit. I disagree that Dr. Lamb's methodology in\n   connection with the reverse payment model is divorced from sound economic theory. Dr. Lamb explains that he used a \"benchmark analysis\" to measure the overcharge resulting from the reverse payment, which \"has been widely used for many years in calculating damages that arise from anticompetitive conduct of the sort alleged in this case.\" (Lamb Rep. \u00b6 131.) I have reviewed Dr. Lamb's qualifications and the soundness of his expert testimony in the motion to exclude that testimony. To the extent that Forest disagrees with the generic entry date and number of generics that Dr. Lamb uses in his calculations, they are free to explore those issues on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   The second part of Defendants' challenge to the reverse payment model speaks to their previous objections about which members were and were not injured. For example, they state, \"Dr. Lamb's allocation awards damages for the hard switch to entities that never even purchased Namenda XR,\" and \"allocates damages and assumes injury to entities that never purchased generic IR and thus could not have been injured by any of Forest's conduct.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 32.) These are arguments about Plaintiffs' theory of injury, not about Dr. Lamb's methodology. I have already addressed these arguments in the discussion of which members could and could not be included in the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   Finally, a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this controversy, as required under Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   The first consideration under Rule 23(b)(3)(A) is whether the class members have an interest in controlling the prosecution of separate actions. There is no evidence that any of the direct purchasers would prefer to control the prosecution of their claims through separate lawsuits. On the contrary, Plaintiffs submit that many members of the class would forego their claims altogether rather than pursue them individually because, as small wholesalers, they \"lack the resources to bring complex, expert-intensive antitrust suits on their own.\" (Class Cert. Mot. at 9.) The Court is not aware of any other litigation concerning this controversy by or against the direct purchaser class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

No. 561) is DENIED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to remove the motions at Dkt. Nos. 400, 434, 437, 439, 441, 443, 445, 505, and 561 from the Court's list of pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-465\">\n    For the purposes of calculating damages under this scenario, Dr. Lamb relies on an analysis conducted by Professor Einer Elhauge in which he determines that a payment-free settlement would have provided for an entry date of November 2, 2012. Dr. Lamb alternatively assumes a June 2012 generic entry date based on George Johnston's alternative theory that absent a settlement agreement, Mylan would have prevailed in the patent litigation brought against it, resulting in generic entry by it in June 2012, and by other generic competitors under the terms of their agreements with Forest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-466\">\n    Defendants ask the Court to strike Dr. Bemdt's Amended Reply Report as an improper sur-rebuttal based on Dr. Bemdt's treatment of issues and documents raised during his deposition about his initial report.
