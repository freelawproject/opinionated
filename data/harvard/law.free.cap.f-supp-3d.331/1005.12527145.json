Mot. at 8 (citing Fernandez Decl. \u00b6 4; RJN \u00b6\u00b6 1-13, Exs. 1-11). Defendants argue that the marks are invalid because they are generic. Opp'n at 1-7.

Reply at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants have presented evidence that consumers understand unloader to mean a particular category of knee braces-not Ossur's Unloader line of knee braces specifically. Defendants rely on various medical websites that refer to unloader as one of four types of knee braces, along with \"prophylactic,\" \"functional,\" and \"rehabilitative\" braces.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Theriot Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-9, Exs. 2-6, 12, 28. According to these websites, an unloader knee brace is \"[a] brace that produces a valgus force on the knee to reduce compressive forces on the medial articular surfaces. It is used to treat patients with deformity and pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee.\" Theriot Decl. \u00b6 32, Ex. 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, Exs. 10-12 (same).

For instance, the VA administrative law judges refer to such a brace as \"an unloader brace\"-without regard to any specific brand. Finally, Defendants also attached medical studies examining the effect of unloader braces, including several models not made by Ossur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 15, 24, 25-27. These too refer to such a brace generally as \"an unloader brace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In total, this evidence shows that consumers, as well as medical and insurance professionals, use unloader to refer to a type of knee brace rather than a specific firm's knee brace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advertise.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768365\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/974/#p977\">\n    616 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Yet Defendants have not presented any evidence that consumers use Unloader One generically. Defendants' evidence solely concerns the use of unloader to refer to a broad category of knee braces. Although Unloader One may, like \"park and fly,\" appear facially generic, the Court cannot find the term generic without evidence that consumers primarily use the mark to refer to the service it offers (relieving knee pain) and not its source (Ossur).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park'NFly\n   </em>\n   , 718 F.3d at 330. Defendants have not presented consumer surveys or relevant testimony; nor have they shown that trade journals or other competitors use the mark in a generic sense. Instead, Defendants have only shown that consumers may generically use the term \"unloader.\" Defendants cannot meet their burden without more specific evidence that consumers generically use \"Unloader One.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the hearing, Defendants argued that the Court should not consider the composite mark because its individual components-\"unloader\" and \"one\"-are generic. But the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly rejected this argument. For instance,\n   <em>\n    CaliforniaCooler\n   </em>\n   held that \"California Cooler\" was not generic, even though neither \"California\" nor \"Cooler\" could alone qualify as distinctive.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"35772\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/774/1451/#p1452\">\n    774 F.2d at 1455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Intent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   If the defendant knowingly adopts an infringing mark to deceive the public, courts presume that such confusion will occur.\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   , 559 F.2d at 354.

Lasso previously served as the president of an Ossur distributor. Fernandez Decl. \u00b6 12. Theriot also served as a sales representative for that distributor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Therefore, they undoubtedly knew of the \"Unloader One\" mark. Furthermore, Ossur terminated Lasso for breaching his fiduciary duties\n   and forming a competing entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that Defendants intended to deceive the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, Ossur has shown that a likelihood of confusion exists.

Furthermore, Ossur argues that the Offloader One may actually damage patients' knees. Mot. at 20 (citing Romo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12).
