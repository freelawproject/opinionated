Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff My Pillow, Inc., initiated this trademark-infringement lawsuit against Defendant LMP Worldwide, Inc. (LMP). Currently before the Court are LMP's motion to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, (Dkt. 11), and LMP's motion to dismiss My Pillow's complaint for failure to state a claim, (Dkt. 18). For the reasons addressed below, the Court denies LMP's motion to transfer and grants in part and denies in part LMP's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   My Pillow is a Minnesota-based company that manufactures and sells pillows. My\n   Pillow has used the registered trademark \"MYPILLOW\" (the My Pillow mark) since 2009. LMP has used the registered trademark (the LMP mark) since 2007. In January 2012, My Pillow initiated a lawsuit against LMP in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. The lawsuit was terminated when the parties signed a settlement agreement (the agreement), which establishes the terms under which each party can use the marks at issue. The agreement, which is governed by Michigan law, authorizes LMP to use the LMP mark. The agreement also contains the following provision: \"The Parties agree that the [LMP mark], as used in the manner and form reflected in [the agreement], is not confusingly similar to and not likely to cause confusion with the My Pillow Mark.\" The agreement also prohibits LMP from using the My Pillow mark in connection with pillows and from making any \"ad word\" purchase\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the words \"my\" and \"pillow,\" whether together or separate, unless accompanied by additional words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   My Pillow alleges that LMP's conduct in the subsequent years violated the agreement and infringed the My Pillow mark. First, My Pillow alleges that, despite the terms of the agreement, LMP purchased the prohibited ad words (i.e., \"my,\" \"pillow,\" and \"mypillow\" without the accompaniment of additional words). My Pillow notified LMP of this alleged breach of the agreement in December 2016 and, although LMP claimed that it then ceased purchasing the prohibited ad words, My Pillow alleges that LMP continued to purchase the prohibited ad words. Second, My Pillow alleges that an LMP employee used the My Pillow mark in connection with the My Pillow goods and made false representations about My Pillow in an email to a wholesale customer. Third, My Pillow alleges that LMP produced radio advertisements that aired in the state of Minnesota that were designed to cause confusion between My Pillow and LMP. On December 20, 2017, My Pillow notified LMP of these alleged breaches of the agreement, and on January 23, 2018, My Pillow terminated the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   My Pillow subsequently initiated this lawsuit, asserting breach of contract (Count 1), trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count 2), unfair competition and false representation in violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Count 3), common-law trademark infringement and unfair competition (Count 4), unfair competition and false representation in violation of the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325D.44 (Count 5), and trademark cancellation (Count 6). Presently before the Court are LMP's motion to transfer the lawsuit to the Eastern District of Michigan and LMP's alternative motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Neither party disputes that My Pillow could have brought the lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Convenience for the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The convenience of each venue for the parties is the first factor considered under Section 1404(a).\n   <em>\n    Huggins v. Stryker Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885281\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/932/972/#p982\">\n    932 F.Supp.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 982 (D. Minn. 2013). This factor includes the travel expenses that each party would incur for airfare, meals, lodging, and loss of productivity if required to litigate in an out-of-state forum.\n   <em>\n    Oien v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3965535\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/824/898/#p903\">\n    824 F.Supp.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (D.

When each party prefers to litigate in its home forum and the moving party \"has not presented convincing evidence that its financial position makes it incapable of litigating in Minnesota,\" this factor is neutral.\n   <em>\n    Bae Sys. Land &amp; Armaments L.P. v. Ibis Tek, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063771\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/124/878/#p885\">\n    124 F.Supp.3d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 885 (D. Minn. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LMP argues that this factor favors transfer because of the inconvenience and greater expense of litigating in Minnesota. LMP is based in Michigan, and its employees and records are located there. Requiring its employees to travel to Minnesota for litigation, LMP argues, would cripple its business operations and impose considerable financial hardship. Moreover, at least one of LMP's witnesses is an hourly employee who would be financially burdened by taking time away from work to travel to Minnesota to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   My Pillow, which is based in Minnesota and maintains its records here, counters that transfer would simply shift the inconvenience of out-of-state litigation from LMP to My Pillow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Dusen v. Barrack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/#p645\">\n    376 U.S. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645-46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/#p645\">\n    84 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/#p645\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964) (\" Section 1404(a) provides for transfer to a more convenient forum, not to a forum likely to prove equally convenient or inconvenient.\"). A transfer of venue \"should not be granted if the effect is simply to shift the inconvenience to the party resisting the transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Huggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885281\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/932/972/#p982\">\n    932 F.Supp.2d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). My Pillow does not refute LMP's argument that My Pillow is a larger company that is better able to absorb the expense of out-of-state litigation. But, although it is undisputedly a smaller company, LMP has not demonstrated that it is financially incapable of litigating in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In short, because the inconvenience to LMP of litigating in Minnesota would be\n   only slightly greater than the inconvenience to My Pillow of litigating in Michigan, this factor only slightly favors transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Convenience of the Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   LMP argues that, because essential non-party witnesses are located in Michigan, the convenience-of-the-witnesses factor favors transfer. My Pillow counters that LMP's non-party witnesses are not essential and, because there are also non-party witnesses in Minnesota, this factor does not favor transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Witness convenience is \"often considered the most important factor in the transfer analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872501\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/677/1134/#p1137\">\n    677 F.Supp.2d at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The focus of this factor is the inconvenience to non-party witnesses as \"it is generally assumed that witnesses within the control of the party calling them, such as employees, will appear voluntarily in a foreign forum.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bae Sys.

This factor does not pose \"a contest between the parties as to which of them can present a longer list of possible witnesses located in the respective districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Master Lease Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4092260\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/759/1397/#p1402\">\n    759 F.Supp. 1397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1402 (D. Minn. 1991). Rather, the party seeking the transfer must clearly identify the essential witnesses to be called and provide a general statement of what their testimony will cover.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4092260\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/759/1397/#p1402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, each party intends to call non-party witnesses; but neither party explains the significance of the testimony of each of these witnesses. LMP intends to call employees of the Michigan-based production company and marketing company that worked on the radio advertisement referenced in the complaint. LMP argues that those employees and their companies will be burdened by travel to Minnesota. My Pillow intends to call radio-station employees from Minnesota to testify about the radio advertisement. But neither party explains how this non-party testimony is relevant, much less essential, to the disposition of the claims. LMP also argues that relevant documents are located in Michigan. But, given the advent of document-reproduction technology, \"the location of documents is no longer entitled to much weight in the transfer of venue analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    CBS Interactive Inc. v. Nat'l Football League Players Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248927\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/259/398/#p410\">\n    259 F.R.D. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (D. Minn. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because it would be inconvenient for the non-party witnesses of both parties to participate in out-of-state litigation, and because neither party establishes that its non-party witnesses are essential, this factor weighs neither for nor against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Interests of Justice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   LMP argues that the interests of justice favor transferring the lawsuit to Michigan. My Pillow counters that the interests-of-justice factor is no more supportive of transfer than the previously addressed factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When analyzing the interests of justice, \"courts consider, among other things, judicial economy, the plaintiff's choice of forum, docket congestion, each party's ability to enforce a judgment, obstacles to a fair trial, conflict-of-law issues, and each court's relative familiarity with the applicable law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872501\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/677/1134/#p1137\">\n    677 F.Supp.2d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . LMP maintains that it\n   is in the interests of justice to transfer the case to Michigan because the lawsuit requires the application of Michigan law and because doing so would preserve judicial economy. My Pillow disagrees, arguing that its choice of forum is entitled to deference and this Court is equipped to apply Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   LMP first argues that the significance of Michigan law weighs in favor of transfer to Michigan. It is generally preferable for local courts to consider local issues of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terra Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199980\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/688/#p691\">\n    119 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The application of local law is particularly important when the legal questions at issue are novel.\n   <em>\n    Brockman v. Sun Valley Resorts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7802750\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/923/1176/#p1182\">\n    923 F.Supp. 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182-83 (D. Minn. 1996). LMP maintains that disposition of most, if not all, of its claims depends on the application of Michigan law to My Pillow's breach-of-contract claim. But LMP does not explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the disposition of My Pillow's breach-of-contract claim will be dispositive of all of My Pillow's other claims. Nor does LMP argue that the application of Michigan law in this lawsuit is complicated or novel. When, as here, the legal questions to be determined by state law are not complex, the Court affords little weight to familiarity with applicable law.\n   <em>\n    Oien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3965535\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/824/898/#p903\">\n    824 F.Supp.2d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   LMP next argues that judicial economy considerations favor transfer. Judicial-economy considerations encompass the Court's case load as well as other litigation activity between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valspar Corp. v. Kronos Worldwide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052265\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/50/1152/#p1157\">\n    50 F.Supp.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (D. Minn. 2014). But minor differences in case loads across dockets are inconsequential when the differences do not create a significant threat of delay or additional expense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brockman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7802750\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/923/1176/#p1182\">\n    923 F.Supp. at 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the record reflects that, although there is a considerable difference in the case loads of judges in the two districts at issue, only a minor difference exists in the average lengths of time from filing to disposition. LMP also asserts that My Pillow regularly initiates litigation in Michigan, but LMP substantiates this claim only by alleging that My Pillow initiated a lawsuit against LMP in the Eastern District of Michigan in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the 2012 lawsuit settled one year later in 2013, LMP asserts that, if\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   lawsuit is transferred to Michigan, it would \"likely be treated [as] a companion\" to the 2012 lawsuit because the two lawsuits involve the same parties and \"substantially similar evidence.\" It is not apparent that this case would be treated as a companion case, however. This lawsuit involves claims for breach of contract, which was not alleged in the 2012 lawsuit, and trademark infringement based on conduct that had not occurred in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. City of Allen Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2650854\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/167/398/#p409\">\n    167 F. App'x 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (6th Cir. 2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in district court's decision that second lawsuit involving same parties was not a companion case because the focus of the witnesses' testimony would be different and the cases did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence). Moreover, it is not apparent that a companion-case designation would preserve judicial economy. The 2012 lawsuit was in its early stages when it settled; any benefit to a judge derived from familiarity with the 2012 lawsuit's brief record is minimal. The possibility of being designated a companion case is not legally significant in this transfer analysis. In short, judicial economy only slightly favors transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   My Pillow argues that its choice of forum is entitled to deference. LMP disagrees, arguing that this factor is entitled to little weight because the majority of the operative facts took place in Michigan, not Minnesota. The presumption favors the plaintiff's choice of forum, particularly\n   when the plaintiff resides in the district in which the lawsuit was filed.\n   <em>\n    Datalink Corp. v. Perkins Eastman Architects, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327106\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/33/1068/#p1078\">\n    33 F.Supp.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (D. Minn. 2014). But \"a plaintiff's choice of forum is simply one factor to be considered in the analysis,\" and the choice garners less weight when residency is the only connection to the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Valspar Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052265\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/50/1152/#p1157\">\n    50 F.Supp.3d at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). My Pillow's choice to initiate this lawsuit in its home state carries some weight, but it is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In short, judicial economy slightly favors transfer, deference to the plaintiff's choice of forum slightly disfavors transfer, and the application of the forum state's law has little significance. Thus, the interests of justice neither favor nor disfavor transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In summary, the convenience of the parties only slightly favors transfer, and the interests of justice and convenience of the witnesses are both neutral. Based on these factors, LMP has not carried its heavy burden of establishing that the relevant factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872501\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/677/1134/#p1137\">\n    677 F.Supp.2d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

My Pillow alleges a specific fact that does not require a chain of inferences. My Pillow alleges that LMP, through its employees and agents, purchased specific ad words.

The complaint's only allegation pertaining to the LMP mark is a screen shot of LMP's website featuring the LMP mark and photographs of LMP pillows. The use of the LMP mark in the screen shot appears to be consistent with the agreement's example of permissible use of the LMP mark. My Pillow does not explain how the use of the LMP mark in the screen shot is not authorized by the agreement.
