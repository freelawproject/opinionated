(\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl. \u00b6 3). The Secret Service's protection also extends to the edifices associated with the offices of the President and Vice President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056A(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Executive Office of the President (the \"EOP\") comprises various bodies, including the White House Office, which, in turn, includes the President's immediate staff, the White House Counsel's Office, and the Staff Secretary's Office. (Herndon Decl. \u00b6 2). The EOP also encompasses the Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\"); the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"); the Office of National Drug Control Policy (\"ONDCP\"); the Office of Science and Technology Policy (\"OSTP\"); and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (\"USTR\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Records of Presidential Visitors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs seek from the DHS records maintained by the Secret Service spanning the period of January 20, 2017, through March 8, 2017, related to visits to the White House and to President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower residences. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 34, 39). DHS contends that although the security responsibility of the Secret Service extends to the White House Complex, it \"does not have a similar statutory authority to protect Mar-a-Lago or Trump Tower.\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 3). The declarations that DHS has submitted in support of its motions thus focus on the policies and procedures attendant to records of White House Complex visitors, and this section summarizes those guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Records of White House Complex Visitors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In order to vet, identify, and monitor visitors to the White House Complex, the Secret Service employs two interconnected electronic systems: (i) the Executive Facilities Access Control System (\"EFACS\"), through which the Secret Service controls and monitors White House Complex access; and (ii) the Worker and Visitor Entrance System (\"WAVES\"), which the Secret Service uses to vet visitors to the White House Complex. (Murray Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Authorized White House Complex passholders may request permission for a visitor to the White House Complex by providing visitor information to the Secret Service through a system called \"Appointment Center\" or the \"WAVES Request System\" (\"WRS\"). (Murray Decl. \u00b6 8). Through these systems, WAVES gathers information related to prospective visitors, which information allows a Secret Service member to verify that the requestor is authorized to make appointments for the location requested, to acquire additional information, to conduct a background check, and to transmit the information to the EFACS server. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). WAVES records include a variety of information fields, such as whether a visit is related to a certain\n   event at the White House Complex or is subject to certain restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When an individual receives approval to visit the White House Complex, he or she typically receives a badge to \"swipe\" over electronic badge readers located at entrances and exits to the White House Complex; each swipe generates an \"Access Control Record\" (\"ACR\") within the EFACS system. (Murray Decl. \u00b6 10). An ACR contains information such as the visitor's name, and the date, time, and location at which the ACR was generated, which, \"[o]nce a visit takes place,\" is integrated into the WAVES records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11). These aggregated records contain information identifying the visitor, visitee, and individual who made the appointment; as well as details of the visit, such as the points of entry and departure, the type of escort the visit requires, and whether the visit involved a highly sensitive meeting. (Willson Decl. \u00b6 7). This dispute principally revolves around WAVES and ACR records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Recordkeeping Practices Related to WAVES and ACR Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DHS contends that because the Secret Service utilizes WAVES records to vet potential visitors and verify visitors' admissibility at the time of a visit, the Secret Service ceases to have an interest in maintaining such information after the completion of a visit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13). Thus, \"[s]ince at least 2001,\" the Secret Service has maintained a practice of transferring WAVES records to the White House Office of Records Management (\"WHORM\") \"generally every 30 to 60 days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Droege Decl. \u00b6 4). \"[A]s early as 2001,\" the White House and Secret Service agreed that ACR records \"should be treated in a manner generally consistent with WAVES records,\" and thus, \"[s]ince at least 2006,\" the Secret Service has transferred ACR records to the WHORM every 30 to 60 days. (Droege Decl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[S]ince at least 2009,\" the Secret Service has transferred WAVES records to WHORM every 30 days. (Murray Decl. \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Willson Decl. \u00b6 5; Droege Decl. \u00b6 4). After transferring the records, \"[i]t is the intent of the Secret Service\" that the records \"be erased from [their] computer system,\" and WAVES records over 60-days old are normally \"auto-deleted\" and \"overwritten on the servers.\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Willson Decl. \u00b6 6 (\"Records that are older than 60 days are ordinarily auto-deleted from the server operated by the Secret Service on a rolling basis.\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Currently, the after-visit records that are transferred to the WHORM constitute a combination of WAVES and ACR information.\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In May 2006, the Secret Service Records Management Program and WHORM entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the \"2006 MOU\"), which reflected the above practices regarding WAVES and ACR records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl. \u00b6 14; Droege Decl. \u00b6 6). The 2006 MOU also expressed the Secret Service's and WHORM's understanding that such records \"are at all times Presidential Records,\" \"are not Federal Records,\" and \"are not the records of an 'agency' subject to the Freedom of Information Act[.]\" (Murray Decl., Ex. A at \u00b6 17). The 2006 MOU also provided that (i) such records \"are at all times under the exclusive legal custody and control of the White House\"; (ii) only the White House has a \"continuing interest\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   in such records; (iii) \"the Secret Service has no continuing interest in preserving or retaining\" such records; and (iv) the Secret Service \"will regularly transfer\" such records to WHORM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 19, 2015, President Obama issued a memorandum creating the position of the Director of White House Information Technology (\"DWHIT\"), who is \"responsible for the information resources and information systems provided to the President, Vice President and [EOP].\" (Herndon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3). The memorandum also established the Presidential Information Technology Community in order to \"bring[ ] various [information] systems and resources into a single community under the auspices of the DWHIT,\" which \"would enhance the security of those systems and resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Pursuant to the authority vested by President Obama's memorandum and in furtherance of the aims of that memorandum, in September 2015, the Presidential Information Technology Community entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the member-entities of the Presidential Information Technology Community (the \"2015 MOU\"), including the Secret Service,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which MOU purported to provide protocols governing its operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The 2015 MOU provides that \"[a]ll records created, stored, used, or transmitted by, on, or through the unclassified information systems and information resources provided to the President, Vice President, and EOP shall remain under the exclusive ownership, control, and custody of the President, Vice President, or originating EOP component.\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 17 (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Herndon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Pursuant to the 2015 MOU-and despite the facts that the \"WAVES servers are located at the Secret Service's headquarters ... and Secret Service personnel operate this machinery\"-DHS maintains that \"the President is the business owner of the EFACS and WAVES systems, and the Secret Service operates those systems on behalf of the President, acting as a service provider.\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 16). As a result of the 2015 MOU, after a visit has concluded, the Secret Service must request permission from the White House to view records of the visit, and if the records have been transferred to WHORM, the Secret Service must also contact WHORM to access the records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). The Secret Service must similarly request permission from the DWHIT to modify the WAVES or EFACS systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the Obama Administration, on September 15, 2009, the White House implemented a policy of voluntarily disclosing certain information contained in WAVES and ACR records. (Droege Decl. \u00b6 12). This disclosure policy contained various exceptions, including information implicating personal privacy or law enforcement concerns, personal safety of EOP staff, and national security concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). The current administration rescinded this policy on April 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The FOIA Requests Preceding This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiffs' FOIA Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that on January 23, 2017, Plaintiff Kate Doyle sent a FOIA request via facsimile to the Secret Service \"requesting all WAVES and ACR records for\" January 20 through January 22, 2017. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 34). More specifically, Doyle\n   requested 28 data fields that were previously made available to the public through the Obama Administration's Visitor Records Requests website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After receiving no response from the Secret Service, on February 24, 2017, Doyle sent an administrative appeal of her request to the Secret Service via facsimile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). DHS contends that it has no record of receiving either the initial request or the administrative appeal, but it acknowledges that after filing the complaint in this case, Plaintiffs provided documentation indicating that both the request and administrative appeal had been faxed to the DHS. (Campbell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In any event, on March 10, 2017, Plaintiffs sent a second FOIA request to the Secret Service, seeking the extraction of the same 28 data fields from (i) \"all WAVES and ACR records from January 20, 2017 until March 8, 2017,\" and (ii) \"records of presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower from January 20, 2017 to March 8, 2017.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 39). This second request also sought expedited processing \"in light of [Plaintiffs'] significant concerns ... about how President Trump [was] using his private properties at Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower, the extensive media coverage of this issue, and the refusal of the President to date to commit to releasing the visitor logs data.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). Unlike the first request, DHS acknowledges receiving this request, to which DHS responded by letter on April 11, 2017, in which it denied Plaintiffs' request for expedited treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Campbell Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203056\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Secret Service's Response to the Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response to Plaintiffs' FOIA requests, DHS maintains that WAVES and ACR records are not Secret Service records, but rather are Presidential Records not subject to FOIA; DHS therefore \"did not seek to search for, locate, or process these records.\" (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 7). Further, \"the Secret Service \"was aware that President Trump had not traveled to Trump Tower during the requested time period\" and \"after confirming this information, the Secret Service did not seek to search for the material requested by Plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Secret Service handled Plaintiffs' request for information regarding Mar-a-Lago visitors in a different fashion. Although the Secret Service \"easily ... confirmed\" that it did not \"utilize WAVES or ACR records at Mar-a-Lago, it was unclear what, if any, record systems or record groupings might exist in regard to who visited the President at Mar-a-Lago, or where such record systems or record groupings might be located.\" (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 9). The Secret Service thus undertook a set of searches \"to determine what, if any, record systems or record groupings existed that might contain information potentially responsive to Plaintiffs' request,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but according to DHS, this search ultimately revealed \"no system for keeping track of visitors to Mar-a-Lago, as there is at the White House Complex.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11). DHS therefore contends that, regarding the 28 data fields Plaintiffs seek, \"the Secret Service maintains no record and has no access to any record directly responsive to Plaintiffs' request for records of presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, aside from the 28 data fields that were available under a prior administration,\n   DHS contends that its search uncovered only one record that was subject to FOIA-a two-page email from the Department of State that was forwarded to the Secret Service-which DHS provided to Plaintiffs in redacted form. (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The email \"evidenced potential visitors to Mar-a-Lago, some of whom were scheduled to attend a dinner with the President.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Before turning the email over to Plaintiffs, the DHS redacted \"the names, email addresses, and a cell phone number of third parties,\" claiming that such information was exempt from disclosure under FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Secret Service's search also revealed records involving a visit by the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, along with his wife, to Mar-a-Lago; in addition, the search produced \"a handful of records that referred to individuals who were scheduled to meet with the President at Mar-a-Lago.\" (Campbell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   DHS contends that documents in the latter category \"contain, reflect, or directly relate to Presidential schedules\" and are therefore \"Presidential records within the meaning of the [Presidential Records Act]\" and are not subject to FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). As to the records involving Prime Minister Abe, DHS decided that they are \"not records of Presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago,\" but instead \"operational material that merely contain a repeated statement that the Prime Min[i]ster of Japan and his spouse would be meeting or dining or present with the President and First Lady at Mar-a-Lago, a widely published fact that [w]as already disclosed by the White House.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). DHS also argues that the records involving Prime Minister Abe are \"duplicative\" of the redacted State Department email that was provided to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 10, 2017, after receiving no response from the Secret Service within the timeframe required under FOIA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed the initial complaint in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-45; Dkt. # 1). On July 14, 2017, the parties appeared for an initial pretrial conference, pursuant to which the Court issued an order directing the \"Secret Service [to] complete its search for and processing of responsive 'records of presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago,' and produce any non-exempt responsive records, by September 8, 2017\"; the Court scheduled summary judgment briefing after such production. (Dkt. # 23). The Court later extended the deadline for such production to September 15, 2017. (Dkt. # 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court also granted Plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint and issued a revised summary judgment briefing schedule on September 14, 2017. (Dkt. # 30). The next day, Plaintiffs amended their complaint, which they now bring under FOIA, the APA, the FRA, and the PRA, in pursuit of injunctive and declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 32). On October 23, 2017, DHS moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' FOIA claims and to dismiss the remaining claims for failure to state a claim\n   and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 45-51). On December 4, 2017, Plaintiffs opposed the motion (Dkt. # 52), and DHS replied to Plaintiffs' opposition on January 12, 2018 (Dkt. # 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court's analysis will proceed as follows:\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Court addresses a request for judicial notice that Plaintiffs made after summary judgment briefing closed;\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , the Court addresses Plaintiffs' FOIA claims;\n   <em>\n    third\n   </em>\n   , the Court addresses Plaintiffs' claims involving the APA, FRA, and PRA; and\n   <em>\n    fourth\n   </em>\n   , the Court addresses Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Court Denies Plaintiffs' Request for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Before addressing the merits of Defendants' motions, the Court resolves a late-breaking dispute among the parties. On February 20, 2018, after summary judgment briefing had concluded, Plaintiffs filed a letter requesting that the Court take judicial notice of a settlement into which the Secret Service had entered in\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Secret Service\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 1669 (CRC) (D.D.C.) (the \"\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen\n   </em>\n   Settlement\" or the \"Settlement\"). (Dkt. # 58). The Settlement explains that, much like the case at bar, the plaintiff in that action, Public Citizen, Inc., had submitted FOIA requests to the defendant, the United States Secret Service, seeking WAVES and ACR records, along with records from \"any other system used to track visitors to the White House complex.\" (Dkt. # 58, Ex. A (Settlement Agreement) ). These requests \"specifically sought records related to visits\" to the following EOP components: the OMB, OSTP, ONDCP, and CEQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result of the Settlement, the White House was to \"add computer functionality to the existing system containing WAVES records by which it can sort WAVES records by the requester's email address[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties' Positions on Plaintiffs' Judicial Notice Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In requesting that the Court judicially notice the Settlement, Plaintiffs contend that the agreement establishes that the \"Secret Service can distinguish between records of visits to agency components [of the EOP] from records of visits to non-agency components,\" as the Settlement requires the Secret Service \"to add a functionality to its system that would allow it to sort WAVES records by the requester's email address, process the records [requested by the plaintiff in that separate action], and post them in agency online reading rooms.\" (Dkt. # 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On February 27, 2018, Defendants responded to Plaintiffs' request, providing no objection to the Court taking judicial notice of the Settlement, but arguing that the agreement in fact supported Defendants' pending motions. (Dkt. # 59). In particular, Defendants argue that the Settlement expressly acknowledges that an appointment requester's email address \"does not necessarily show that a WAVES record reflects an EOP agency component visit,\" and that any functionality changes pursuant to the Settlement would be within the control of the White House rather than the Secret Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Indeed, Defendants contend that the Settlement renders moot Plaintiffs' FRA and PRA claims, insofar as they \"allege wrongful treatment of agency records by EOP and the Secret Service\" for failing to \"distinguish between records of visits to Presidential components of EOP (which are not subject to FOIA) and records of visits to agency components of EOP (which are).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In Defendants' view, the Settlement \"creates a mechanism for doing just that, thereby mooting Plaintiffs' FRA and PRA claims in their entirety,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   and \"the [S]ettlement provides virtually all the relief that [P]laintiffs could achieve under FOIA, and more.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, Defendants argue that the only aspect of Plaintiffs' FOIA claim \"that is not moot is the possibility that plaintiffs may wish to challenge any redactions that the EOP agency components may apply to the records before posting,\" but because any such redactions and corresponding objections are unknown at this point, the Court should hold this portion of Plaintiffs' FOIA claim in abeyance and dismiss the remainder of Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs replied to Defendants' response on March 2, 2018, arguing at the outset that Defendants' opposition letter improperly raised grounds for summary judgment and dismissal that were not raised in Defendants' formal briefing. (Dkt. # 60). In addition, Plaintiffs contend that the\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen\n   </em>\n   Settlement does not render the claims at issue moot for three reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Settlement \"expires\" if either the EOP modifies its email system so that email addresses no longer indicate that an employee works for an EOP component, or the White House modifies the WAVES system so that it does not automatically populate the email address of an appointment requester. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , until Defendants have searched for the records that Plaintiffs are seeking and produced all non-exempt records, the Settlement does not speak to any challenges Plaintiffs might raise to Defendants' withholding of records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Settlement defines \"FOIA components\" within the EOP more narrowly than Plaintiffs' operative complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' Request for Judicial Notice Is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a \"court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute\" where it \"can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). \"[B]ecause the effect of judicial notice is to deprive a party of the opportunity to use rebuttal evidence, cross-examination, and argument to attack contrary evidence, caution must be used in determining that a fact is beyond controversy under Rule 201(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Braun\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United Recovery Sys., LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221384\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/14/159/#p164\">\n    14 F.Supp.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). \"A court may take judicial notice of a document filed in another court 'not for the truth of the matters asserted in the other litigation, but rather to establish the fact of such litigation and related filings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Star Class Yacht Racing Ass'n\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11825842\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/66/#p70\">\n    146 F.3d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Although Defendants do not object to judicial notice of the fact of the Settlement, the parties' submissions on the issue make clear that they vehemently disagree as to which facts the Court should glean from the Settlement Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 58, 60,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 59). Because both sides have offered plausible views of the practical implications of the Settlement,\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fortiori\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot find that the factual purpose for which Plaintiffs urge the Court to consider the Settlement would be beyond \"reasonable dispute.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, to grant Plaintiffs' request would not only require the Court to consider the Settlement for the truth of the matters stated therein, but to make the inferential leap of drawing facts from the Settlement that are not necessarily borne out by its terms. To be sure, a court may judicially notice a settlement agreement to establish the fact of a prior litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deylii\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Novartis Pharm.

Of particular relevance to the case at bar, the Court hewed to the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   by explaining that sufficient control under the second prong \"mean[s] that the materials have come into the agency's possession in the legitimate conduct of its official duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, considering the FOIA request at issue there, the Court held that district court decisions received by the Department of Justice while litigating tax cases were agency records; although the Department of Justice did not internally generate the decisions, they had received and possessed them at the time of the FOIA request at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    at 146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Circuit considered a FOIA claim mirroring the one at bar, in which the plaintiffs sought from the Secret Service \"[a]ll official visitors logs and/or other records concerning visits made to the White House from January 20, 2009 to [August 10, 2009].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (first alteration in original). After explaining the Secret Service's recordkeeping procedures, and while acknowledging that the circumstances presented \"a difficult case,\" the court held that\n   WAVES and ACR records \"that disclose the kind of information\" presented in \"documents like the President's appointment calendar\" are not agency records subject to FOIA, while WAVES and ACR records \"that reveal visitors to those offices within the White House Complex that are themselves subject to FOIA\" would constitute agency records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the D.C. Circuit first found no dispute that the Secret Service had \"obtained\" the WAVES and ACR records at issue, thus satisfying the first prong of the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case thus turned on whether the Secret Service had sufficient control over the documents to render them agency records. To answer that inquiry, the D.C. Circuit generally looked to four factors originally announced in the Court of Appeal's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court later affirmed, albeit on different grounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts I\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333776,10549262\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/845/1060/\">\n    845 F.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1988), and collecting D.C. Circuit cases applying the four-factor test). These four factors consist of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [i] the intent of the document's creator to retain or relinquish control over the records; [ii] the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit; [iii] the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document; and [iv] the degree to which the document was integrated into the agency's record system or files.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333776,10549262\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/845/1060/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333776,10549262\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/845/1060/\">\n    845 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1069 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Applying these factors produced an equivocal result. The first factor weighed in the Secret Service's favor in light of the 2006 MOU, which as discussed above expressed the intention of the Secret Service and the White House to place WAVES and ACR records under the control of the White House rather than the Secret Service.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second factor, considering the Secret Service's authority to use and dispose of the records, weighed in neither party's favor; although the Secret Service used the records to vet potential White House visitors and verify their identities, it had a \"longstanding practice\" of turning those records over to the White House and the 2006 MOU further restricted the Secret Service's ability to use and dispose of the records as it pleased.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    at 218-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The third factor, assessing the extent of the Secret Service's reliance on the records, indicated Secret Service control, as the agency used the records to vet and verify the identity of White House visitors \"without restriction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the fourth factor, taking into account the degree to which the records were integrated into the Secret Service's systems or files, was found by the D.C. Circuit to weigh in favor of neither party; the Court acknowledged that the records were in the Secret Service's system at least at one point, but the physical servers on which the records were stored were located in the White House Complex and the records were removed from those servers within 60 days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    at 219-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having found that only two of the four factors yielded decisive answers-and even then pointed in different directions-the Court drew parallels to another line of cases, one involving \"documents that an agency has either obtained from, or prepared in response to a request from, a governmental entity not covered by FOIA: the United States Congress,\" where the four-factor \"test does not apply[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As in the context of FOIA requests for congressional records obtained by an agency, the Court noted that it should defer to an \"affirmatively expressed intent\" to control such documents, which the White House had expressed toward the WAVES and ACR records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1920184,3792852\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/724/201/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1920184,3792852\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/724/201/\">\n    at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Paisley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878048,5709812\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/712/686/\">\n    712 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   693 n.30 ). And more importantly, subjecting these records to FOIA would force the President to \"either 'surrender [his] constitutional prerogative of maintaining secrecy' regarding his choice of visitors (and therefore of outside advisors), or to decline to cooperate with the executive branch agency entrusted with (and necessary for) his personal protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United We Stand Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    I.R.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722418,9285342\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/595/\">\n    359 F.3d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (D.C.

Nevertheless, the Court will address Plaintiffs' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs hone in on a discussion in\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   that rejected the notion that \"the intent of the creator of a document relied upon by an agency\" should determine whether material is an agency record subject to FOIA, reasoning that \"[s]uch a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement is nowhere to be found in the Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But these statements of law are reconcilable: In the discussion above from\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   , the Court was responding to an argument by the Department of Justice that would \"limit 'agency records,' at least where materials originating outside the agency are concerned, 'to those documents prepared substantially to be relied upon in agency decisionmaking.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court was thus considering an issue separate and apart from whether a document's creator intended \"to retain or relinquish control\" of the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, the intent of a document's creator in retaining or relinquishing control over the document accords with\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit's analysis in FOIA cases. In\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Supreme Court did not blind itself to Henry Kissinger's demonstrated intent to retain control over notes of his phone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   445 U.S. at 140-41, 157,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Kissinger's records did not\n   become subject to FOIA when he stored them in his State Department office and considering his efforts to determine whether the documents were \"agency records\"). And the Second Circuit has similarly looked to the President's intent in determining whether a governmental entity created in part by the President is an agency subject to FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Main Street Legal Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    National Security Council\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that the National Security Council System, parts of which were created by statute and other parts of which were created by presidential directive, was not an agency subject to FOIA based in part on the President's intentions as expressed in a presidential directive.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n    811 F.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544-45, 553 (2d Cir. 2016). The court reasoned that \"separation of powers ... counsels a respectful measure of deference to the President's own statements of intent,\" and the presidential directive did not \"indicate[ ] any intent to transfer presidential authority so that it c[ould] be exercised [by the National Security Council System] independent of the President.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n    at 558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case law to which this Court is bound therefore supports consideration of the drafter's intent in determining whether a document is an agency record subject to FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As to\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   's remaining three factors, Plaintiffs concede that they \"are certainly\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   to whether an agency has\" sufficient control over materials to render them subject to FOIA (Pl. Opp. 10), but argue that the D.C. Circuit's application of those factors goes beyond the Supreme Court's definition of \"control\" as \"hav[ing] come into the agency's possession in the legitimate conduct of its official duties,\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court declines to adopt Plaintiffs' restrictive reading of\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that a \"strict application\" of the second factor-\"the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333776,10549262\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/845/1060/\">\n    845 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1069 )-would render two of the nine enumerated FOIA exemptions superfluous. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 10). Those two exemptions shield materials from disclosure under FOIA if they are either (i) \"established by\" and \"properly classified pursuant to\" \"an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; or (ii) \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(3). Plaintiffs' argument, however, fails to displace the probative value of considering an agency's ability to use and dispose of a record in determining whether that agency controls such record. Moreover, the D.C. Circuit's analysis under this factor considers, as a practical matter, how an agency handles particular material to the extent it is authorized to do so,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   218-19 ; this does not mean, as Plaintiffs would have the Court believe, that if an agency's authorization in this regard were in some way limited, such limitation would render materials exempt from FOIA to the same extent as an Executive Order protecting their secrecy or a specific statutory exemption from disclosure under FOIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On the topic of FOIA's exemptions, Plaintiffs argue that \"even if there is reason to credit 'special policy considerations' when addressing whether congressionally created documents are 'agency records,' \" as\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   reasoned, \"executive prerogatives\" are sufficiently protected by FOIA's exemptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and any further protection for presidential documents would be Congress's responsibility. (Pl. Opp. 11). But this argument puts the cart before the horse. Notwithstanding the applicability of any FOIA exemption, as\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   recognized, \"Congress did not intend for 'the President's immediate personal staff or units in the [EOP] whose sole function is to advise and assist the President' to be 'included within the term 'agency' under the FOIA.' \"\n   <em>\n    Main St. Legal Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n    811 F.3d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , 445 U.S. at 156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This congressional intent speaks to the inapplicability of FOIA to the President and his immediate staff without regard to any statutory exemptions. For this reason, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' contention that the D.C. Circuit's analysis of agency \"control\" over materials \"is simply inconsistent with FOIA's text and purposes\" and would create \"an amorphous tenth exemption\" to FOIA. (Pl. Opp. 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Mindful of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , the Court also disposes of Plaintiffs' argument that revealing \"information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   the [P]resident\" does not raise the same concerns as subjecting the President himself to FOIA. (Pl. Opp. 12 (emphasis in original) ). This is a rhetorical sleight-of-hand: Surely, if the Supreme Court had shared Plaintiffs' view, it would not have interpreted Congress's intent as carving out from FOIA's definition of an agency the President's immediate staff and advisers. In addition, Plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish \"subjecting the\n   <em>\n    [P]resident\n   </em>\n   to FOIA\" from \"subjecting\n   <em>\n    presidential information in the possession of agencies\n   </em>\n   to FOIA\" is unpersuasive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original) ). Although this difference is certainly relevant to\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   's first prong-whether requested materials are \"create[d] or obtain[ed]\" by an agency-the mere fact of possession would have much less relevance in deciding the second prong-whether that agency had \"control\" over such materials.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 144-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that \"FOIA routinely is applied to records that reveal presidential decision-making\" (Pl. Opp. 12), but none of the examples to which Plaintiffs cite, such as policy directives or redacted memoranda, is as personal to the President as his daily schedule. This differentiation \"accords with\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   's teaching that the term 'agency records' is not so broad as to include personal materials in an employee's possession, even though the materials may be physically located at the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, without citing to any particular cases, Plaintiffs argue that many federal agencies obtain information from the President and his aides, and that courts treat records generated by such interactions as subject to FOIA, though\n   they may be exempt for other reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court derives little from Plaintiffs' contention on this point, as it is unable to compare the facts of this case to the abstract examples Plaintiffs have provided. Moreover, Plaintiffs' argument is not without examples to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Main St. Legal Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n    811 F.3d at 549-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming dismissal of FOIA claims seeking records from National Security Council related to drone strikes of United State citizens and foreign nationals on grounds that Council was not \"agency\" subject to FOIA because its sole statutory function is to advise and assist the President).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Having considered and rejected Plaintiffs' arguments, the Court hereby adopts the D.C.

As discussed above, this intention weighs in favor of finding that the WAVES and ACR records are not agency records subject to FOIA, and in determining whether to command disclosure of documents under FOIA, \"separation of powers further counsels a respectful measure of deference to the President's own statements of intent[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Main St. Legal Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082646\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/542/#p544\">\n    811 F.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to the White House's exerted control over the records at issue, the Secret Service \"cannot make changes to the [WAVES or EFACS] systems, or make purchases related to the systems, without the consent of the DWHIT.\" (Herndon Decl. \u00b6 8). In addition, pursuant to the 2015 MOU, the Secret Service's access to the records is \"limited ... as necessary to perform its protective functions,\" and \"once a visit is concluded,\" the Secret Service \"may not access EFACS or WAVES records without White House Approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). These considerations,\n   and particularly the later restriction on the Secret Service, compel a finding that the White House (rather than the Secret Service) controls the WAVES and ACR records, as they indicate that the Secret Service's ability to utilize and dispose of these records is subject to constraints imposed by the White House that were not present at the time that the D.C.

Having adopted the D.C.

Here, Defendants contend that the 2015 Presidential Memorandum creating the DWHIT and the 2015 MOU undermine this portion of\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   , and even if not, that Defendants are unable to segregate records of visits to EOP Agency Components from EOP components that employ members of the President's immediate staff whose \"sole function\" is to \"advise and assist the President.\"\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , 445 U.S. at 156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The creation of the DWHIT and terms of the 2015 MOU do not speak to this analysis, and the Court therefore dismisses out of hand Defendants' assertion that such developments undermine\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   's determination that records of visits to EOP Agency Components are subject to disclosure under FOIA. Although the Secret Service does not exert sufficient control over WAVES and ACR records of visits to the President or EOP components that advise and assist the President, the reasoning underlying that conclusion does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   extend to WAVES and ACR records of visits to members of EOP components that are themselves subject to FOIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As to Defendants' contention that they are unable to segregate records of visits to EOP Agency Components, Defendants admit that \"[i]n most cases\" a WAVES record will contain the email address of the individual scheduling a visit that \"will provide an indication of whether the person making the appointment is employed by\" an EOP Agency Component or an EOP component that is not subject to FOIA. (Def. Br. 24). According to Defendants, this information does not indicate with certainty whether such visit implicated an EOP component that is not subject to\n   FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But such an assertion proves too much, as the Court will not hold that material ceases to be an agency record because of information that it does not contain. Indeed, the lack of any indication that a visit implicated the President or an EOP component involved in advising and assisting the President should lessen Defendants' concerns regarding revealing the President's schedule and related information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To the extent that any WAVES or ACR record from an EOP Agency Component contains information that would not constitute agency records in light of its connection to the President, Defendants may redact such information. Indeed, FOIA \"expressly authorize[s]\" redaction and places the burden on \"the agency when it seeks to justify the redaction of identifying information in a particular document as well as when it seeks to withhold an entire document.\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Press\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Def.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684858\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/274/#p284\">\n    554 F.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221063\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/164/#p173\">\n    502 U.S. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173-74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221063\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/164/#p173\">\n    112 S.Ct. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221063\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/164/#p173\">\n    116 L.Ed.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) ).

Records of Presidential Visitors at Mar-a-Lago\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court's analysis of this category of records proceeds in two stages:\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Court considers the adequacy of Defendants' search for records responsive to Plaintiffs' FOIA request, and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , the Court considers the propriety of Defendants' withholding of two categories of documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Adequacy of Defendants' Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   At the time of Plaintiffs' request, the Secret Service's approach to providing security at Mar-a-Lago was \"newly developed,\" and \"it was unclear what, if any, record systems or record groupings might exist in regard to who visited the President at Mar-a-Lago, or where such record systems or record groupings might be located.\" (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 9). The Secret Service maintains that the ensuing search resulted in only one \"arguably responsive\" document that is \"not duplicative of information previously made public by the White House\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14), and that the search also confirmed that \"there is no Secret Service system that controls access to Mar-a-Lago, nor is there any grouping, listing, or set of records that would reflect Presidential visitors to Mar-a-Lago\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Secret Service has provided an affidavit detailing its search for responsive records. Early on in its search, the Secret Service identified three offices as potentially holding responsive documents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   the Office of Strategic Intelligence and Information (SII), which oversees the Protective Intelligence Division (PID).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   This office conducts background checks pursuant to a sensitive security program;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   the Office of Investigations (INV), which oversees the Miami Field Office (FO) and the West Palm Beach Resident Office (RO). These offices would most likely\n   have involvement in President Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago as they are geographically located in proximity to Mar-a-Lago; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   the Office of Protective Operations (OPO), which oversees the Presidential Protective Division (PPD). This is the division with direct operational responsibility for the protection of the President of the United States, including when the President is at Mar-a-Lago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 16). A search of the first office resulted in no responsive documents, while a search of each of the latter two offices indicated \"that an individual visited with the President at Mar-a-Lago during the time period January 20 to March 8, 2017\"; any \"potentially responsive documents\" proceeded to \"further responsiveness review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Separately, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\") searched the email accounts of employees within the PPD, Dignitary Protective Division, as well as the Miami FO and West Palm Beach RO. (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 20). The CIO carried out this search by applying a series of search terms to the body, subject line, or attachment of any email, for the period January 20 to March 8, 2017, contained in a database of any emails \"sent, received, or deleted by all Secret Service employees including during the time period at issue in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Any responsive emails proceeded to \"further responsiveness review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   All responsive records from these searches were aggregated, and any duplicate emails were electronically removed, leaving \"[o]ver four thousand e-mails and documents\" for further responsiveness review. (Campbell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Any materials that were \"merely copies of media reports concerning Presidential visits to Mar-a-Lago\" were removed \"as non-responsive, as [they were] not considered [ ] Agency record[s] of a Presidential visit, and [were] as available to the public as to the Secret Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Further winnowing down the universe of responsive documents, the parties agreed \"that the Secret Service need not produce records regarding Presidential family members, cabinet members, and White House staff who were present at Mar-a-Lago,\" as well as \"the names of local law enforcement and support personnel scheduled to have their photographs taken with the President.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   After refining the documents in that manner, \"the largest remaining category of records\" consisted of documents related to Prime Minister Abe's visit to Mar-a-Lago. (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 26). These included \"operational records\" regarding the Secret Service's security for the Prime Minister's visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Aside from this category of documents, the search yielded \"only a handful of records\" referring to persons scheduled to meet with the President at Mar-a-Lago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). The following section considers the content of these records; here, the Court considers the antecedent issue of the adequacy of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   To prevail on a summary judgment motion in a FOIA case, the defending agency bears the burden of establishing the adequacy of its search, and it may satisfy this burden by submitting \"[a]ffidavits or declarations supplying facts indicating\n   that the agency has conducted a thorough search[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Long\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Office of Pers.

Because the Secret Service had not established a formal recordkeeping system at the time of Plaintiffs' FOIA request, the search began by identifying the offices that could potentially possess responsive documents. Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants' search was inadequate because the affidavit detailing the search failed to \"explain why it was reasonable to look only at records from specific components of\" the SII, INV, OPO (Pl. Opp. 24) is simply wrong, because the affidavit provides such explanations: The PID, under the auspices of the SII, \"conducts background checks pursuant to a sensitive security program\"; the Miami FO and West Palm Beach RO, which are overseen by the INV, \"would most likely have involvement in President Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago as they are geographically located in proximity to Mar-a-Lago\"; and the PPD, which the OPO oversees, has \"direct operational responsibility for the protection of the President ..., including when the President is at Mar-a-Lago.\" (Campbell Decl. \u00b6 16).

In fact, Defendants considered only one such document to be responsive to Plaintiffs' FOIA request-an email from the State Department to the White House Office and forwarded to the Secret Service listing individuals who would accompany the Japanese Prime Minister to Mar-a-Lago.

Br. 10-11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants withheld the remainder of the documents, maintaining that they were either (i) \"Presidential schedules or information directly relating to Presidential schedules\" provided from the White House to the Secret Service \"for the limited purpose of providing information necessary for the Secret Service to perform its statutory duty to protect the President\" and thus not agency records under FOIA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (ii)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \"operational materials that merely contain a repeated statement that the Prime Minister of Japan and his spouse would be meeting, dining, or present with the President and First Lady at Mar-a-Lago, which had already been publicly released by the White House,\" which Defendants consider \"non-responsive because they are not records of Presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As with the WAVES and ACR records considered above, the parties do not dispute that the Secret Service obtained these records. Whether they qualify as agency records subject to FOIA therefore depends on the extent to which the Secret Service, as opposed to the White House, exerted control over them,\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 144-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or whether special policy considerations necessitate removing such documents from FOIA's scope,\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 220-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considers Defendants' categorical withholdings in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Presidential Schedule Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants refer to the first category of withheld documents as \"Presidential Schedule Documents.\" (Def. Br. 20-23). The Court understands by way of background that a member of the White House transmits the Presidential Schedule Documents to the Secret Service on a nightly\n   basis by \"upload[ing] the schedule to an EOP web portal,\" which generates an automated email to certain members of the Secret Service. (Murray Decl. \u00b6 22). The White House provides access to the web portal and the automated emails to \"a limited number of Secret Service personnel with an operational need to know the scheduling information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To acquire this privilege, a Secret Service member must request the access from the White House and obtain approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Secret Service members who receive the Presidential Schedule Documents utilize the records \"solely to fulfill [their] operational needs,\" and the White House similarly provides these records \"solely for the limited purpose of allowing the Secret Service to perform its statutory duty to protect the President, Vice President and other protectees, as well as the White House Complex.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Defendants urge the Court to extend the rationale behind\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   to encompass these documents, thereby moving them outside of FOIA's scope for failing to qualify as agency records. The Court agrees with Defendants' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The considerations that render FOIA inapplicable to WAVES and ACR records apply with equal force to the Presidential Schedule Documents. The White House's intent to control these documents is apparent from its selective disclosure only to approved Secret Service members. Moreover, these handpicked Secret Service members had no part in creating the documents, but only passively received them from the White House.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   To be sure, the Court does not read the 2015 MOU, along with its requirements for the use and disposal of WAVES and ACR records, as applying to the Presidential Schedule Documents, and Defendants do not so contend. Nor does the Court doubt that the Secret Service members who receive these documents rely on them to carry out their statutory duty to protect the President. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl. \u00b6 22 (\"The Secret Service relies on information regarding the President's schedule that is provided by the White House Office to fulfill its protective mission.\") ). But these differences do not assuage the Court's concerns that exposing these documents to disclosure under FOIA would produce the same problems as applying FOIA to WAVES and ACR records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Further, the same separation-of-powers concerns that animated\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   apply here. Just as \"the Secret Service must monitor and control access to the building in which the President lives and works,\" which \"requires presidential staff to request access [from the Secret Service] for visitors,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[t]he Secret Service uses the Presidential [S]chedule [D]ocuments ... solely to fulfill its operational needs\" (Murray Decl. \u00b6 2p). In one sense, subjecting the Presidential Schedule Documents to FOIA would intrude more deeply into the Office of the President than doing so for WAVES and ACR records: whereas the latter would allow \"a FOIA requester effectively [to] receive\n   <em>\n    copies\n   </em>\n   of [the President's] calendars,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), the former would provide\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   access to these calendars in their original forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In removing the Office of the President from FOIA's scope, Congress surely did not \"intend[ ] to require the effective disclosure of the President's calendars in this roundabout way.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Presidential Schedule Documents also track the definition of \"presidential records\" in the PRA even more closely than WAVES and ACR records: They are \"documentary materials ... created ... by the President, the President's immediate staff, or a unit or\n   individual of the [EOP] whose function is to advise or assist the President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to\" the President's \"official or ceremonial duties[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). And by providing them to the Secret Service, like WAVES and ACR records, \"they are essential to ensuring that the President can go about these core activities without risking his security or that of his family and staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that adopting Defendants' position would create an \"unsustainable rule that documents that merely relate to information about the president's schedule are also, as a matter of law, beyond FOIA's reach.\" (Pl. Opp. 29). This argument is a straw man. The Court's holding is limited to the documents at issue, consisting of correspondence detailing the President's daily schedule that was transmitted from the White House to a select set of Secret Service members. It does not speak to, or even anticipate, a broader set of documents than those presented here. The Presidential Schedule Documents are not agency records subject to FOIA, and Defendants properly withheld them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Operational Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court next considers Defendants withholding of \"a small number of operational records related to the Japanese Prime Minister's visit that also referred to the fact that the Prime Minister and his spouse were scheduled to meet or dine with the President and First Lady at Mar-a-Lago.\" (Def. Br. 29). Defendants maintain that \"[t]he only arguably responsive information in these documents is the statement, repeated in each document, that the Prime Minister of Japan and his spouse would be meeting, dining, or present with the President at Mar-a-Lago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, Defendants argue, they were not required to disclose these records \"only to release a minute amount of already public information\" that \"is also duplicative of the information contained in the State Department email released to [P]laintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants' position, however, does not have a basis in FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   That the responsive material contained in these documents is relatively slim is of no moment. Information that would be valuable in public discourse may be expansive or contracted; in either case, FOIA expressly provides that \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Nor may the Government withhold production of records simply because they are publicly available by other means. \"If Congress had wished to codify an exemption for all publicly available materials, it knew perfectly well how to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 152-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And although an agency need not \"produce multiple copies of the exact same document,\" an agency may not withhold documents based on the fact that the documents merely contain similar statements.\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p10\">\n    314 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (D.D.C. 2004). Defendants therefore have improperly withheld the operational records and must disclose these materials-subject, as always, to any applicable FOIA exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' APA Claims Based on the FRA and PRA Is Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court next considers Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' APA claims that seek judicial review, under the FRA and PRA, of the 2015 MOU. Specifically, Claim Three alleges that the EOP \"enter[ed] into an MOU that declares that the records of visits to agency components of the EOP are under the exclusive ownership,\n   control, and custody of the President, Vice President, or originating EOP component,\" which violated the EOP's \"mandatory, nondiscretionary obligation under the FRA and the PRA to treat [WAVES and ACR records] as agency records of DHS subject to the FOIA.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 63). Similarly, Claim Four alleges that by entering the same MOU, \"DHS violated its mandatory, non-discretionary obligation under the FRA to treat and manage these records as agency records of DHS subject to FOIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addressing Defendants' motions, the Court first summarizes the law relevant to Plaintiffs' claims based on the FRA and PRA. It then considers the specifics of Defendants' motion. Because the Court grants Defendants' motion on jurisdictional grounds, it does not-as it may not without a proper jurisdictional basis-consider Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Complaint Does Not Allege a Guideline That Is Subject to Judicial Review for Compliance with the FRA or PRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiffs' Claims Are Premised Only on the 2015 MOU\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court begins by determining which MOU forms the basis of Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs' opposition brief urges the Court to review Defendants' \"functional classification of WAVES and ACR records as presidential records\" pursuant to the terms of both the 2006 and 2015 MOUs (Pl. Opp. 34), but the operative complaint makes no mention of the 2006 MOU. Indeed, the only citation to any MOU in the Amended Complaint reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   In its opposition to [a] motion for a temporary restraining order [filed in this case,] the Secret Service relied in part on a 2015 Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") that, on information and belief, has never before been made public. That MOU states in relevant part: \"[a]ll records created, stored, used, or transmitted by, on, or through the unclassified information systems and information resources provided to the President, Vice President, and EOP shall remain under the exclusive ownership control, and custody of the President, Vice President, or originating EOP component.\" The Secret Service has interpreted this provision as applying to all the records at issue in [a separate] lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 50). As mentioned above, the claims at issue go on to reference this provision of the 2015 MOU as violating the EOP's \"obligation under the FRA and the PRA to treat [records of presidential visitors] as agency records of DHS subject to FOIA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63), and violating DHS's \"obligation under the FRA to treat and manage these records as agency records of\n   DHS subject to the FOIA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). The operative complaint thus does not reference the 2006 MOU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court recognizes that it may refer to evidence outside of the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to resolve factual disputes on which subject matter jurisdiction depends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zappia Middle E.

The FRA and PRA Preclude the Court's Review of the 2015 MOU\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The excerpted language of the 2015 MOU on which Plaintiffs' claims are premised is not the sort of guideline or directive that courts have reviewed for compliance with either the FRA or the PRA. In\n   <em>\n    Armstrong II\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the D.C. Circuit found reviewable, for compliance with the FRA, instructions from the EOP and National Security Council (\"NSC\") to employees, \"that when any electronic document\n   <em>\n    meets the definition of a federal record\n   </em>\n   , the employee should either print out the information that appears on her computer screen or incorporate that material into a written memorandum.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    1 F.3d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Court held that this guidance did not comply with the FRA because the hard-copy printouts of the records could omit information that formed \"an integral part of the original electronic records[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To avoid confusion, the Court provided a hyperbolic example of a guideline that would surely be reviewable as covering an initial classification of documents as presidential records-\"a\n   guideline defining 'presidential records' as 'all records produced or received by, or in the possession or under the control of, any government agency or employee of the United States.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   As these examples make clear, judicial review for compliance with the PRA extends only to guidelines that categorize materials as presidential records, such that by doing so, an agency may run afoul of the PRA's definition of \"presidential records\" and, thus, treat records as presidential when they would otherwise fall within the FRA.\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701110\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/194/#p218\">\n    593 F.Supp.2d at 201, 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (subjecting to judicial review (i) executive order providing that PRA \"applies to the executive records of the Vice President,\" and (ii) policy under which Vice President, EOP, and Office of Vice President indicated they were \"not part of the executive branch\" to avoid record preservation under the PRA);\n   <em>\n    Am.

The portion of the 2015 MOU excerpted in the Amended Complaint simply states the understanding of the parties to the MOU that certain records \"shall remain under the exclusive ownership, control, and custody of the President, Vice President, or originating EOP component.\" This section of the MOU thus does not command recordkeeping practices that could result in improper disposal under the FRA,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    1 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1282 ; \"encompass[ ] the initial classification of materials as presidential records,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1294 ; or constitute the functional equivalent of such impermissible steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   As to judicial review for compliance with the FRA, Plaintiffs \"challeng[e] the Secret Service's failure to treat the WAVES and ACR records as agency records under the FRA,\" by transferring those records to the WHORM rather than retaining them. (Pl. Opp. 34). But this practice, rather than constituting a reviewable guideline, is precisely the sort of claim that the FRA, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, has precluded courts from reviewing. As the\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   Court noted, \" 'the [FRA] establishes only one remedy for the improper removal of a 'record' from the agency': the agency head, in conjunction with the Archivist, is required to request the Attorney General to initiate an action to recover records unlawfully removed from the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488854,10542487\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/282/\">\n    924 F.2d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , 445 U.S. at 148,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Plaintiffs argue that through the 2015 MOU, the EOP improperly categorizes WAVES and ACR records as presidential records, and that the Court must be able to review this categorization \"[t]o maintain the integrity of the line Congress drew between agency records ... and presidential records[.]\" (Pl. Opp. 34). But the MOU does no such thing. By stating that certain documents \"shall remain under the exclusive ownership, control, and custody of the President, Vice President, or originating EOP component,\" the MOU does not \"purport to implement the PRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    1 F.3d at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, it says nothing of whether the\n   parties understand these records to constitute presidential records, and as discussed above, the judicial determination of whether material constitutes an agency record under FOIA, and is thus exempt from the PRA by its own terms, takes into account the drafter's intent as just one factor among several others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (defining \"Presidential records\" as excluding agency records as defined by FOIA). Rather, this portion of the MOU describes which governmental entities will be responsible for such documents on a day-to-day basis. Construing this portion of the MOU as a guideline amenable to review for compliance with the PRA would thus muddy the \"narrow, clearly defined limitation on the scope of the PRA\" that restrains courts only to consider \"guidelines describing which\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   materials will be treated as presidential records in the first place[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    1 F.3d at 1292, 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court may not review Plaintiffs' claims premised on the FRA and PRA, and Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The issue depends on whether a federal court may award declaratory judgment based solely on a FOIA claim. Plaintiffs do not address the issue, aside from stating that \"[t]his case presents an actual and adversarial issue that entitles Plaintiffs to declaratory relief.\" (Pl. Opp. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a federal court to \"declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such a declaration\" in \"a case of actual controversy[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
