Currently pending before this Court are Defendant Rote's Objection to Plaintiff's Form of Judgment and Defendant Rote's Motion to Vacate for Lack of Jurisdiction, Alter or Amend Judgment, or For a New Trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court denies Defendant's motion for a new trial but finds that Plaintiff's noneconomic damages award should be capped pursuant to ORS 31.710.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is the former IT director of Defendant Northwest Direct Teleservices, Inc. (\"NDT\"). Defendant Rote (\"Defendant\") is the former executive of Defendant NDT and the other business entities involved in this case. After their relationship deteriorated in 2003 and Plaintiff was\n   terminated, the parties began almost 15 years of litigation culminating in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sometime after his termination, Plaintiff succeeded in arbitration on a claim for whistleblower retaliation against Defendant NDT. Defendant subsequently created a blog to write about his experience in the arbitration. At times, Defendant wrote about Plaintiff. After discovering the blog, Plaintiff filed the present suit alleging that Defendant's blog was an act of retaliation. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that Defendant aided and abetted his former employer, Defendant NDT, in retaliating against him for his participation in the former arbitration where he succeeded on his whistleblower claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because they were unrepresented, all the business entities in this case have defaulted. The claims against Defendant Rote, however, proceeded to a two-day jury trial on January 16 and 17, 2018. The jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff and awarded him $1,000,000 in noneconomic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under Rule 59, a district court has the discretion to grant a new trial \"for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court\". Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(1)(A). Because \" Rule 59 does not specify the grounds on which a motion for a new trial may be granted,\" courts are \"bound by those grounds that have been historically recognized.\"\n   <em>\n    Zhang v.

Plaintiff's Closing Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court should grant a new trial because Plaintiff's counsel made improper arguments in closing. In particular, Defendant contends that counsel's arguments that the jury should \"send a message\" with its damages award were inappropriate given that punitive damages had been excised from the case. Defendant, however, did not object to any of these arguments during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Improper argument by counsel can be grounds for a new trial, but \"generally, misconduct by trial counsel [only] results in a new trial if the flavor of misconduct sufficiently permeate[s] an entire proceeding to provide conviction that the jury was influenced by passion and prejudice in reaching its verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Hemmings v.

The words that aren't on the jury instructions, but they feed into these words are \"terror,\" \"torment.\" The list, it-yeah. You saw Mr. Zweizig testify. That's-that's obvious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   So what do we look at? I mean, how do you-how do you put a number on that? What I'm going to encourage you to do is look at the community. What kind of message do we want to send to the world to say this-not only is this wrong, but it's real. What Mr. Zweizig has gone through, it's not just a blog on the Internet. We're not up here about a couple comments that hurt his feelings on Facebook. This is a smear campaign, being stalked on the Internet. What do we do with that fear?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   So when you look at community, there's a couple contexts I want to talk to you about. The first is the broad context. The community here is massive, and the problem is great. And blogging, Googling, Facebooking, Twittering, LinkedIn, that's part of our world today. And what I argue to you is you need to be responsible about how you use that stuff. And we need to send a message to that big community that that's not acceptable. You can't do that. That really hurts people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   And the other context is it's the small context. It's about the individual, the family, what happens at home day to day. You know, how do we interact with ourselves? How do we interact with the people we love? What kind of messages do we want to send to our children or our neighbors, that small community? And that's really important here, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   And so the question is what do we, as a community-how do we value that? It's been 14 years. Mr. Zweizig would like to be done. At the very least, he would like your help to show him that what he's going through is real. So later on, if he needs to, when he Googles his name, it's not just a bunch of lawsuits he's had to file, and hopefully not for long, these things that are written out there, but there's something that says this is real.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   And then the bigger picture, it's not just Mr. Zweizig. It's so when our community looks, when you click and say, what is this thing, like what is it when you write terrible things about people on the Internet, that it's real.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   When the technology companies in San Francisco sit down and decide, what is our privacy policy or how are we going to deal with takedowns or whatever, it's another drop in the bucket to say that human lives matter and these things actually affect real people. So that's why I'm asking for $2 million. And I beg of you to award every penny of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds that many of these statements could reasonably be interpreted as a request by counsel that the jury hold Defendant liable rather than a request that the jury punish Defendant in awarding damages. Further, the Court has reviewed the rest of the trial transcript and finds no other instances where such comments were made. Thus, even if these comments could only be interpreted as asking the jury to improperly punish Defendant with its award, the alleged misconduct did not sufficiently permeate the entire proceeding to warrant a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kehr v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587661\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/1283/#p1285\">\n    736 F.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285-86 (1984) (affirming the district court's decision to deny the defendant's motion for a new trial where isolated improper remarks were made principally during opening and closing argument, the jury's damage award was not excessive, and the defendant made no objection).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff offered undisputed testimony in support of the noneconomic damages award about the substantial impact that the blog had on his life and his emotional health. Plaintiff testified that he felt \"absolute distress\" when he first saw the blog. He felt he was being \"stalked and terrorized at a pretty high level\" and as though \"somebody [had] taken [his] identity.\" Plaintiff described the blog as \"a dark cloud that just follows [him] all the time\" and invades everything in his life. He fundamentally altered the way he interacts with the world as a result of the blog, which uses both his name and his photo. In trying to keep a low profile, Plaintiff said he was limited in his ability to interact and network with other IT professionals, seek out guitar students, and put up webpages about his music. In his own words, Plaintiff has had to \"anonymize himself.\" He also testified about how he watched the blog impact his family as it also names Plaintiff's fianc\u00e9. He said that the blog hangs over both of their heads. At times, Plaintiff was emotional in describing how Defendant's actions had impacted him. In light of this testimony and Plaintiff's demeanor at trial, the Court cannot find that the jury was improperly influenced by counsel's statements in rendering its damages award. This is not one of those \"extraordinary cases\" requiring a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Insufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find Defendant liable. This Court disagrees. In this case, the jury's verdict was not clearly against the weight of the evidence. Plaintiff testified as to the mental and emotional distress he suffered as a result of Defendant's actions. The evidence reasonably shows that Defendant aided and abetted Plaintiff's employer because, at the time that Defendant obtained rights from Defendant NDT to publish information about the arbitration online, it was not administratively dissolved.\n   <em>\n    Comapre\n   </em>\n   Ex. 546 (license agreement dated January 2, 2015)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ex. 599 (showing Defendant NDT was not administratively dissolved until April 3, 2015). Further, based on the contents of the blog, the jury could conclude that Defendant's motivation was retaliatory in nature. In other words, it could have concluded that without Plaintiff's participation in a protected legal action against Defendant NDT, Defendant would not have created the blog. Because the jury's verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence in this case, the Court declines to grant Defendant a new trial on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roy v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538962\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1174/#p1176\">\n    896 F.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176 (9th Cir. 1990) (\"While the trial court may weigh the evidence and credibility of the witnesses, the court is not justified in granting a new trial 'merely because it might have come to a different result from that reached by the jury.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.

For example, Defendant contends that the Court erred in giving Instruction No. 10, arguing that it misstates the \"but-for\" causation standard used in retaliation cases. But the instruction given required the jury to find that, in the absence of Defendant's unlawful motive, he would not have retaliated against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Instruction No. 10, ECF 189 (\"A plaintiff is 'subjected to an adverse employment action because of his participation in the protected activity' if he shows that an unlawful motive was a substantial factor in his adverse employment action, or, in other words, that the plaintiff would have been treated differently in the absence of the unlawful motive.\"). Moreover, the instruction given is consistent with the language used in recent Oregon appellate decisions, which state that: \"in the context of\n   ... retaliation claims, we have observed that, to show causation, a 'plaintiff must prove that defendant's unlawful motive was a substantial factor in his termination, or, in other words, that [the plaintiff] would have been treated differently in the absence of the unlawful motive.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

Evidentiary Objections\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also contends a new trial is warranted because the Court erred by: (1) not allowing Defendant to submit the original expert reports and testimony from the arbitration into evidence; (2) excluding Defendant's Exhibits 541 and 543; and (3) not requiring Plaintiff to disclose the identities of his employers. The Court finds that it did not err in these evidentiary rulings and they did not result in an injustice to Defendant.

A new trial may be granted because of newly discovered evidence where \"(1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) the exercise of due diligence would not have resulted in the evidence being discovered at an earlier stage and (3) the newly discovered evidence is of such magnitude that production of it earlier would likely have changed the outcome of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife v.

Objection to the Form of Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant objects to the form of Plaintiff's proposed judgment and argues that Oregon Revised Statutes (\"ORS\") \u00a7 31.710(2)(b), which caps noneconomic damages in certain cases to $500,000, applies to this case. Plaintiff, citing two recent state trial court decisions, argues that ORS 31.710 is inapplicable to employment claims. In the alternative, Plaintiff argues that the application of the statute to this case would violate the remedy clause in Article I, section 10 of the Oregon Constitution. The Court agrees with Defendant and finds that the application of the statute in this case is not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Interpretation of ORS 31.710\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The issue in this case is whether ORS 31.710 encompasses purely emotional injuries arising out of employment claims. ORS 31.710(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Except for claims subject to ORS 30.260 to 30.300 (Oregon Tort Claims Act) and ORS Chapter 656 (Workers' Compensation), in any civil action seeking damages arising out of bodily injury, including emotional injury or distress, death or property damage of any one person including claims for loss of care, comfort, companionship and society and loss of consortium, the amount awarded for noneconomic damages shall not exceed $500,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   No Oregon appellate court appears to have directly addressed the applicability of ORS 31.710 to employment claims arising out of purely emotional injury. In\n   <em>\n    Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Company\n   </em>\n   , however, the Oregon Court of Appeals applied this statute to employment claims seeking purely noneconomic damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4454663\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/127/511/#p518\">\n    127 Or.App. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4454663\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/127/511/#p518\">\n    873 P.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (noting in passing that the language of the statute \"limits noneconomic damages to $500,000 in any civil action' \").

Pl. Resp. Am. Obj. 2-3, ECF 200. Because Plaintiff's claim arises out of an unlawful employment practice, Plaintiff contends that the cap is inapplicable to this case.

Reply Am. Obj., 2-3, 9, ECF 202. Defendant further contends that a narrower interpretation of the statute would frustrate the purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The three Oregon trial courts to address this issue have come to different conclusions on the meaning of the statute. In a decision issued just last year, Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge Karin Immergut found that \" 'bodily injury' ... includes claims for purely emotional injury under ORS 659A.030.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.Daimler Trucks North America, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 15CV24701, at 4 (Mult.

In her decision, Judge Immergut relied on the text and context of the statute, the statute's clear exclusion for claims under the Oregon Tort Claims Act and the Oregon Workers' Compensation Law, and the application of this statute by the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Tenold. Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4454663\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/127/511/#p518\">\n    873 P.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She further noted that the goal of the legislature, as evidenced by the legislative history of the statute, was to reduce insurance premiums associated with tort litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   By contrast, both Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge Michael Greenlick and Lane County Circuit Court Judge Marilyn E. Litzenberger offered narrower interpretations of ORS 31.710. Judge Greenlick found the cap was not intended to apply to (1) claims for purely emotional injury or distress or (2) claims for employment discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Loczi v. Daimler Trucks North America, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14CV15365, at 3 (Mult. Cty Cir. Ct. Mar. 4, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Christiansen Decl. Ex. 1 at 3-4, ECF 200. Specifically, he determined that the legislature only intended the cap to apply to claims for emotional injury or distress where those damages stemmed from bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Judge Litzenberger determined that the statute only applies to three types of civil actions: \"the categories of claims to which the cap applies include claims arising out of bodily injury, death or property damage; and, by omission, not claims arising out of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    McMillan v.

Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, the Court finds Judge Immergut's interpretation more persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, the text of the statute itself supports Defendant's contention that this statute applies to employment cases seeking purely emotional distress damages. If the legislature had intended the statute to apply only to claims arising out of bodily injury, death, or property damage, the legislature could have so limited the scope of the statute. Instead, the legislature tethered the application of the cap to the type of damages sought in civil actions: \"any civil action\n   <em>\n    seeking damages arising out of\n   </em>\n   bodily injury, including emotional injury or distress, death and property damages.\" ORS \u00a7 31.710 (emphasis added). Thus, it is the type of damages-not the type of civil claim-the legislature was ultimately concerned with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, by its use of the word \"including,\" the statute clarifies that emotional injury or distress is an example of bodily injury subject to the statute's cap.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ex. 5 (emphasis added). Although the noneconomic damages cap was \"included in a larger bill aimed at tort reform generally, the noneconomic damages cap itself was labeled as a stand-alone provision within the bill.\"\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

Laws 1987, ch. 774 \u00a7 6). By adopting a broader understanding of \"damages arising out of bodily injury\" to include damages arising out of purely emotional injury, the Court's interpretation better fulfills the legislature's goal. By contrast, a narrower reading-requiring any emotional injury to be connected to a physical harm-would result in the exclusion of certain tort claims, such as those for Intentional or Negligent Infliction\n   of Emotional Distress, from the damages cap. Such an approach would therefore be inconsistent with the legislature's goal of reducing the cost of tort litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In light of the broad language of the statute and the legislative history, the Court finds that the legislature intended ORS 31.710 to apply to employment actions where the damages sought are purely emotional in nature.

The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   both suffered debilitating physical injuries as a result of serious workplace accidents. Similarly, the plaintiff's wife in\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   suffered a grievous emotional injury and was accordingly compensated for a lifetime loss of consortium as the result of her husband's paraplegia. Accordingly, the remedies these individuals would have received had the cap been imposed were not \"substantial\" remedies. Certainly, Plaintiff has suffered significant emotional distress over the past few years as a result of Defendant's actions. But when viewed in light of the case law described above and the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that a $500,000 noneconomic damages award is still a substantial remedy within the meaning of Article I, section 10 of the Oregon Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant also objects to the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. He argues that the issue of attorney's fees was decided in the 2010 arbitration decision applying the terms of the employment agreement to the parties' litigation. The Court finds this objection without merit. First, as the Court previously noted, the terms of the employment agreement are not applicable to this case. Opinion &amp; Order, ECF 96 at 4-7; Order, ECF 133 at 8 n.5. Additionally, Plaintiff is permitted to recover attorney's fees for successful claims brought under ORS 659A.030.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 659A.885(1) (\"In any action under this subsection, the court may allow the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court DENIES Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Judgment [211]. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff's award for noneconomic damages is capped at $500,000 pursuant to ORS 31.710(1).

The Court already addressed Defendant's arguments regarding arbitration and the applicability of the terms of the employment agreement in its January 5, 2017 Opinion and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.

The record, however, suggests that Defendant had ample time to conduct discovery. At a scheduling conference held on October 14, 2016, the parties were given almost five months to complete discovery.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minutes of Proceedings, ECF 74.
