Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls have also filed a separate but related motion for summary judgment (filing 241) asking the Court to dismiss Bauer Built's and Road Star's contribution claims. And there are several outstanding motions mostly relating to discovery and case progression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Filing 256; filing 258; filing 261; filing 264; filing 269; filing 286; filing 311; filing 315; filing 319; filing 325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As set forth below, the Court will grant Bauer Built's and Road Star's motion to reconsider in part, and deny it in part. The Court will grant Southern Pride's and Thunder Rolls' motion for summary judgment. And the Court will clear out the remaining discovery and progression motions so that the parties can assess the effect of the Court's ruling on the motion to reconsider and motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. MOTION TO RECONSIDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Bauer Built and Road Star move for reconsideration of this Court's Memorandum and Order of January 30, 2018 (filing 217).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, they ask the Court to alter its conclusions with respect to two issues: (1) apportionment of liability, and (2) proximate cause. Their arguments with respect to proximate cause are without merit, and will not be revisited here-the Court abides by its previous decision. Their arguments with respect to liability, however, raise broader issues of law and policy not previously addressed by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And those issues warrant reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All the parties have, at various points in this litigation, made inconsistent arguments.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , filing 131 at 16,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   filing 234 at 10. As a general matter, the positions taken by the parties up to this point, embedded in thousands of pages of briefing, often seem to be based on advocacy of the moment, as opposed to a genuine attempt to grapple with the complex issues presented by this case-and therefore to help the Court grapple with those issues as well. In other words, instead of describing the forest, the parties have been pelting the Court with trees. And the barrage\n   of filings has created its own problems, because the pleadings and motions never seem to sit still long enough to present a stationary target, for the Court or the parties-to the point that one of the pending motions (which will be dealt with below) actually asks the Court to rule on whether certain claims have been pled. Filing 319.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court's previous memorandum and order (filing 217) solved some of those problems, but exacerbated others. It did, however-if nothing else-have the salutary effect of narrowing the parties' vision, such that the last round of briefing on the pending motions was a bit more focused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the Court is now in a position, for perhaps the first time in this litigation, to concretely assess the scope of the remaining parties' liability-which it will now address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Broadly, the Court reaches two conclusions with respect to the apportionment of liability and the applicability of Nebraska's contributory negligence statutes. First, the Court finds that because Certain Underwriters' Carmack Amendment claims have been dismissed, and the remaining claims sound in negligence, Nebraska's contributory negligence statutes are applicable. And second, the Court concludes that it erred in the first instance in concluding that those statutes were inapplicable, regardless of whether Carmack Amendment claims were pending. Here's why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. EFFECT OF DISMISSING CARMACK AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Certain Underwriters originally sued four defendants for their alleged role in causing or contributing to a roadside accident. Filing 115. Two of the defendants-Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls-were sued under the Carmack Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 115 at 7. The other two defendants-Bauer Built and Road Star-were sued in negligence. Filing 115 at 9-11. Certain Underwriters has since settled (and dismissed) its claims against Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls, leaving only its remaining claims in negligence against Bauer Built and Road Star. Filing 203; filing 206. Thus, the question before the Court is: What effect, if any, did the settlement and dismissal have on the apportionment of liability?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a threshold matter, there are two bodies of substantive law that govern the apportionment of liability in Nebraska civil tort actions: common law, and Nebraska's comparative negligence statutes. The comparative negligence statutes apply\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   where contributory negligence may be a defense to the underlying claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-21\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,185.07. State common law applies in every other instance.\n   <em>\n    Dykes v. Scotts Bluff Cty. Agr. Soc., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317656\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/375/\">\n    260 Neb. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317656\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/260/375/\">\n    617 N.W.2d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (2000). But before addressing which body of law governs this case, it is worth discussing how they are similar, and different, as that relates to the underlying dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nebraska's comparative negligence statutes abrogate the common law in some respects, but do not supplant it entirely. Indeed, the statutes\n   <em>\n    retain\n   </em>\n   common\n   law joint and several liability for economic damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-21\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,185.10 ;\n   <em>\n    Tadros v. City of Omaha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    273 Neb. 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    735 N.W.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382 (2007). So, as a general matter, joint and several liability applies under the statutes and common law where-as here-two or more causes produce a single indivisible injury.\n   <em>\n    Kudlacek v. Fiat S.p.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2455610\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/244/822/\">\n    244 Neb. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2455610\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/244/822/\">\n    509 N.W.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The analysis changes, however, when a claimant settles with one or more of the jointly and severally liable defendants. At common law, the \"traditional rule\" for apportioning liability amongst the remaining, non-settling defendants is applied. Under the common-law traditional rule, \"[when] the plaintiff settles with one of the jointly and severally liable tort-feasors, then the plaintiff's recovery against the remaining tort-feasors is reduced by the actual settlement amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Tadros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    735 N.W.2d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, non-settling tort-feasors remain jointly and severally liable for the total damages assessed, less the actual dollar amount of the settling parties' agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nebraska's statutory scheme abrogates the traditional rule. Under the statute, when the plaintiff settles with one of the jointly and severally liable defendants, the plaintiff's recovery against the remaining tort-feasors is reduced by the settling tort-feasor's\n   <em>\n    proportionate\n   </em>\n   share of liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383. Thus, by settling with a joint tort-feasor, the claimant \"forfeits ... joint and several liability,\" and the trier of fact must instead apportion a percentage of liability to each defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382. The court then reduces the total percentage apportioned to the settling defendants from the overall damage award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And because any right to contribution arises only when a joint tort-feasor discharges more than his or her proportionate share of the judgment, that apportionment has the practical effect of extinguishing contribution claims by the remaining defendants against a settling defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Not surprisingly, the parties disagree as to which law governs this dispute. Bauer Built and Road Star argue that the statutes apply, and that Certain Underwriters-as a result of its settlements-\"[cannot] recover[ ] from Bauer Built and Road Star more than their proportionate share of individual liability ... as determined by the trier of fact.\" Filing 233 at 4. Certain Underwriters, however, argues that common law applies, and that Bauer Built and Road Star are jointly and severally liable for any and all damages awarded by the jury (less Certain Underwriters' settlement with Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Nebraska Supreme Court has suggested that, when a negligence defendant is sued alongside a strict liability defendant, courts do not apply the statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipler v. General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088891\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/271/194/\">\n    271 Neb. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088891\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/271/194/\">\n    710 N.W.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (2006). After all, in order to trigger the statutory scheme, contributory negligence must be, pursuant to law, a potential defense to the underlying claim. \u00a7 25-21,185.07. And contributory negligence is not a defense to an action based upon strict liability.\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088891\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/271/194/\">\n    710 N.W.2d at 831-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, in\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   , the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed applying common law principles where the plaintiff sought recovery in both negligence and strict liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 824-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   , Certain Underwriters has voluntarily dismissed its claims against the only two defendants who were arguably sued in strict liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 203; filing 206. In other words, there are no strict liability claims that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   , might preclude application of Nebraska's statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   does not expressly address whether an action is one \"to which contributory negligence may be, pursuant to law, a defense\" within the meaning of \u00a7 25-21,185.07 when strict liability claims are settled-and therefore dismissed-before trial. And as Road Star and Bauer Built correctly point out, the applicability of Nebraska's statutory scheme may vary during litigation depending on the then-pending claims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , filing 233 at 8-9;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tadros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    735 N.W.2d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   So, at least at this stage of the litigation, under an ordinary reading of \u00a7 25-21,185.07, the statutory scheme governs. And that is true because the remaining claims sound in negligence-to which contributory negligence may be a defense pursuant to law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jensen v. Archbishop Bergan Mercy Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2780456\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/236/1/\">\n    236 Neb. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2780456\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/236/1/\">\n    459 N.W.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (1990). The next question, then, is whether liability should be apportioned pursuant to \u00a7 25-21,185.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That's not a foregone conclusion: the Nebraska Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    Tadros\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 25-21,185.11 provides for a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   reduction of the plaintiff's recovery because \"the language of \u00a7 25-21,185.11(1) is similar to the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-21\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,185.10, relating to the allocation of noneconomic damages amongst multiple defendants, 'in direct proportion to that defendant's percentage of negligence.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    735 N.W.2d at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court said in\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 25-21,185.10\"allows the jury to compare the negligent conduct of codefendants\" but \"does not provide that one defendant's negligence may be compared to another in a cause of action for strict liability in tort.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088891\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/271/194/\">\n    710 N.W.2d at 830-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But the Court nonetheless concludes that \u00a7 25-21,185.11(1) should be applied. First, the Court sees little basis in the statutory scheme to conclude that \u00a7 25-21,185.11 does not apply in any instance in which \u00a7 25-21,185.07 is satisfied, even if it was satisfied as a consequence of dismissing other claims. Second, as a general matter, there is no conceptual reason why comparative fault principles cannot be used to apportion liability between tortfeasors even when liability for one rests on strict liability and liability for the other on negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazer v. A.F. Munsterman, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551099\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/123/245/\">\n    123 Ill.2d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Ill.%20Dec.%20473\">\n    123 Ill.Dec. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20N.E.2d%201248\">\n    527 N.E.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1257 (1988) (collecting cases). And finally, as will be explained in more detail below, the Carmack Amendment\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   contemplate comparing the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   negligence, even if it shifts and raises the burden of proof with respect to such issues. Accordingly, Certain Underwriters' claims against Bauer Built and Road Star are to \"be reduced by the amount of [Southern Pride's and Thunder Rolls]'s share of the obligation as determined by the trier of fact.\" \u00a7 25-21,185.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   And that result makes sense. After all, as the Nebraska Supreme Court articulated in\n   <em>\n    Tadros\n   </em>\n   , the law ought to encourage rather than discourage settlement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n    735 N.W.2d at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And under the common law rule, there is little, if any, incentive to settle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, common law fails to provide finality of liability for the settling tort-feasor because its remaining defendants maintain the right to contribution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, under the statutory scheme, finality and fairness are achieved: the non-settling parties will not be prejudiced by a settlement amount over which they had no control, the settling parties can be sure that their share of liability is limited to the bargained-for settlement amount, and the plaintiff may benefit in the event that its settlement with settling parties exceeds their proportionate shares of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085773\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/273/935/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, Certain Underwriters relies on\n   <em>\n    Downey v. W. Cmty. Coll. Area\n   </em>\n   , in which the Nebraska Supreme Court held that \u00a7 25-21,185.11 did not apply where the injured plaintiff received workers' compensation benefits from his employer, then sued a third-party tort-feasor for negligence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20Neb.%20970\">\n    282 Neb. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=808%20N.W.2d%20839\">\n    808 N.W.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845, 851-52 (2012). According to Certain Underwriters,\n   <em>\n    Downey\n   </em>\n   supports the proposition that \"that parties that do not face liability for negligence are not within the statute and their fault, if any, will be recoverable jointly and severally from the other tortfeasors[.]\" Filing 234 at 10 (emphasis omitted). But\n   <em>\n    Downey\n   </em>\n   is clearly distinguishable-or, more to the point, a workers' compensation claim is clearly distinguishable from a Carmack claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Downey\n   </em>\n   , the Nebraska Supreme Court held that the employer was not a \"released person\" to whom fault could be allocated under \u00a7 25-21,185.11, because the employer had never been a \"person liable\" in tort for the injury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=808%20N.W.2d%20839\">\n    808 N.W.2d at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that's because under the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act, \"employers are immune from lawsuits by their employees\" and \"an employer covered by workers' compensation has no liability in tort[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=808%20N.W.2d%20839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=808%20N.W.2d%20839\">\n    at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As will be discussed in more detail below, however, a Carmack claim \"does indeed sound significantly in tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulton v. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; P. R.

Thus, despite the divergent language in the various cases, it is clear that the duty therein sought to be imposed on the common carrier with respect to transportation and delivery of goods is based on the law of negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1317971\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/481/326/#p333\">\n    481 F.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the Carmack Amendment, the shipper's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case is established when it shows that the cargo was delivered to the carrier in good condition, that the cargo arrived at its destination in damaged condition, and the amount of the damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1317971\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/481/326/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1317971\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/481/326/#p333\">\n    at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If the cause of the damage can't be proved, then the carrier is liable. But, unlike a product liability claim, liability is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   imposed \"irrespective of [the carrier's] negligence or freedom from it.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088891\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/271/194/\">\n    710 N.W.2d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1317971\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/481/326/#p333\">\n    481 F.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   And that means, contrary to the Court's initial conclusion, that contributory negligence\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a defense to a Carmack Amendment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1317971\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/481/326/#p333\">\n    481 F.2d at 335-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (comparing common-law contributory negligence to the Carmack Amendment).

A carrier's net liability for damages after recovery from third parties based on their relative culpability does not depend on the legal mechanism by which a carrier may recover, but rather the extent of the third party's culpability and that party's preference for settlement. Under any settlement regime, these variables are unpredictable, and therefore cannot affect a carrier's ability to set rates.

DISCOVERY AND PROGRESSION MOTIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   After the motion for reconsideration and motion for partial summary judgment were filed, the parties became embroiled in significant disputes regarding discovery and progression, and those disputes have resulted in a number of ancillary motions, some less necessary than others. The Court had hoped that counsel's recent resolution of some of those motions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   filing 303, was an encouraging sign that the lawyers had resumed respectful cooperation. Alas, it wasn't so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a general matter, the Court is disappointed by the state of things. There is some reason to believe that counsel have become more invested in settling their personal beefs-and having the Court validate them-than in resolving the underlying dispute, either by consensus or at trial. Having driven one another mad, counsel are apparently determined that the Court\n   should join them by reviewing months' worth of their correspondence and discovery materials in order to assess who's at fault. But deciding which side is more to blame for this situation presents an apportionment problem that may well be more difficult than the one found in the merits of the case. For now, the Court still holds counsel, at least, jointly and severally liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although the parties may disagree, the Court is doing them a favor by resetting the board so they can try to do better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But with that said, the Court needs to directly address the pending motions. Several are directly discovery-related.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 258; filing 261; filing 264; filing 311; filing 315. But, as has been the situation before in this case, the landscape has changed since the motions were filed. The parties have, no doubt, framed their discovery requests-and their opposition to opposing counsels' discovery requests-on the framework set forth in the Court's January 30, 2018 Memorandum and Order (filing 217). Some of the discovery issues presented might be moot-and other new issues might be presented-as a result of the Court's revisitation of that order. In particular, Southern Pride's and Thunder Rolls' potential liability has been reduced, changing their relationship with the remaining parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court also has no inclination to referee the parties' squabbling about Certain Underwriters' requests for admission. Road Star and Bauer Built sought to be excused from answering them at all, contending that they're overly burdensome. Filing 258; filing 261. And there's at least a little truth to that: it's not clear, for instance, why Bauer Built should be required to essentially sign off on the accuracy of deposition transcripts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 313-1. But it's not insensible, either: an Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 admission has a conclusive effect that the testimony of a witness-even a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness-does not.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Praetorian Ins. Co. v.

Many of the requests to which objections were posed appear to the Court to be anodyne, and easily admitted or denied.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   filing 313-1. Nor are over-inclusive boilerplate objections particularly helpful to a court that's been asked to assess the propriety of the requests. On the other hand, there's a fair case to be made that some of the requests sought admissions that Certain Underwriters should have known to be contested or unknown-suggesting there may have been disregard for the burden imposed on opposing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Having looked over the requests for admissions, responses, and arguments about them, the Court's answer for now is this: a plague on both your houses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained elsewhere, the Court is resetting the progression\n   schedule, so the parties will have another chance to be reasonable. Beyond that, \"[t]he court may defer its final decision [regarding the sufficiency of an answer or objection] until a pretrial conference or a specified time before trial.\" Rule 36(a)(6). The parties should not expect the Court to sort out their disagreements before then-and, in the meantime, they can consider the potential pitfalls of their current course. None of them should feel particularly confident that the Court would eventually endorse their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court will, therefore, deny the motions for protective order (filing 258 and filing 261), motion to compel (filing 264), and motion to determine the sufficiency of answers and objections to requests for admission (filing 311) without prejudice, to give the parties an opportunity to reevaluate their position in light of current circumstances. (This is also an opportunity for the parties to make one more effort to professionally resolve their disagreements before reasserting them to the Court. The Court recommends that counsel make the most of that opportunity.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Road Star and Bauer Built also seek to extend the progression schedule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   filing 256, and Certain Underwriters does not oppose some extension,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   filing 266. They do not agree on the proposed schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   filing 266. But they are also not that far apart on most points.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   filing 256 at 19,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   filing 266 at 4. Surely, counsel can find a reasonable compromise. And this, too, is a matter on which the parties may now wish to revise their positions. The Court accepts its fair share of the responsibility for where these proceedings are at-but, they are where they are, and the Court suggests that the parties set aside the question of who's responsible for it and make a concerted effort to agree on what needs to be done, and how quickly it can be achieved. The Court will set aside the progression schedule and direct the parties to confer, make\n   <em>\n    every effort\n   </em>\n   to reach consensus, and set a conference with the Magistrate Judge for purposes of setting a new progression schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Certain Underwriters has also asked the Court to compel another mediation. Filing 269. Perhaps another mediation session would be productive, particularly now that the parties are better able to assess the risk of going to trial-but the Court will not compel mediation on the present motion, which does not indicate an expressed willingness, on everyone's part, to discuss settlement. The parties should confer on this matter as well, and the Court will entrust the Magistrate Judge with determining, after discussing the matter with the parties, whether an additional session of mediation should be held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Next, Bauer Built has filed a motion (filing 319) for a \"declaration\" regarding the status of its cross-claims: specifically, Bauer Built asks the Court to \"declare that its cross-claims against Cross-Defendants Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls remain pending, or in the alternative, grant Bauer Built leave to re-file its cross-claims against Southern Pride and Thunder Rolls as previously set forth in Bauer Built's Answer to the original Complaint.\" Filing 319 at 8. That's a peculiar request, because the Court has previously explained at length (and with significant consequences for everyone involved) that \"once an amended pleading is interposed,\n   the original pleading no longer performs any function in the case.\" Filing 159 at 4 (quotation omitted) (citing Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur Miller, 6 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2017) ). And Bauer Built's operative pleading (filing 178) contains no cross-claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   So, the Court cannot declare that Bauer Built's cross-claims remain pending, because they don't. And the Court will not give leave to file an amended answer at this point, for two reasons: (1) Bauer Built may or may not still want to assert a cross-claim, in light of this memorandum and order, and (2) Bauer Built's \"motion for declaration\" does not comply with the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) and, particularly, NECivR 15.1. If Bauer Built still wants a cross-claim, it should file an appropriate motion showing good cause for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherman v.

Filing 325. The Court will deny that request without prejudice, because it too is a subject best addressed in association with the larger questions of case progression that the Court is directing the parties to discuss with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   1.

Filing 232 at 2-3. But with respect to proximate cause-the issue on which the Court will deny the motion to reconsider-there is no controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and an immediate appeal would not advance the ultimate termination of this litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).

Accordingly, their request will be denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Court's previous memorandum and order left the door open for alternative argument and evidence as to why general common law principles governing joint and several liability did not apply, filing 217 at 20, which the parties have now done.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Court acknowledges Certain Underwriter's contention that the Court's memorandum and order should not be reconsidered on this basis because \"the parties extensively briefed [the effect of the settlement] with case law explaining the legal effect that the settlement had upon the joint and several liability of the other parties, under both federal and Nebraska law.\" Filing 243 at 3. The Court disagrees. In the previous round of briefing, Certain Underwriters' arguments addressed the effect of the settlement under federal law, rather than Nebraska law. Filing 201 at 112-134. And Bauer Built's and Road Star's arguments only addressed\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    Nebraska's statutory scheme would apply, not\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    the statutory scheme should apply following the settlement.
