Johnson, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Third Cause of Action (Claims Arising Under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act), filed on March 20, 2018 by Defendants Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners and Mark Gallegos (\"County Defendants\" or \"Defendants\" for purposes of this motion)\n   <strong>\n    (Doc. 59)\n   </strong>\n   . Having reviewed the parties' briefs and applicable law, the Court finds that Defendants' motion is not well-taken and, therefore, is denied. The Court finds that class action tolling principles do not apply to Plaintiffs' state law claims. However, these claims survive because the Court also finds that Defendants have waived the statute of limitations defense, are estopped from asserting the defense, and that Plaintiffs' state law claims are equitably tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is a putative class action arising from Defendants' renovation of the shower facilities at the Santa Fe Adult Correctional Facility (\"ACF\") in 2014 when Plaintiffs and the class members were inmates at the ACF. Plaintiffs allege that they were exposed to dust, debris, and hazardous chemicals, which caused them injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This federal action is a continuation of a prior state court class action by Plaintiffs, Case No. D-101-CV-2016-00671 in the First Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, State of New Mexico. The state court action was filed on March 11, 2016 by two of the named Plaintiffs in this case, Joe Martinez and Christopher Mavis, on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons. The state court action raised timely claims under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 41-4-1 et seq, and according to Plaintiffs, was brought within the two year limitations period set forth in NMSA 1978, \u00a7 41-4-15. See Doc. 63 at 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The federal case was initiated on March 14, 2017 when Plaintiffs Mavis and Martinez\n   joined with additional named Plaintiffs to file a Class Action Complaint for Damages Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Doc. 1). The federal action brought claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the County Defendants on behalf of the Plaintiffs and a class of similarly situated persons based on the same underlying facts as the state court action. After Plaintiffs filed the original complaint in the federal case, parties agreed to litigate the two cases together in this case in federal court to conserve resources of both the parties and the courts. See Doc. 63 at 1-5. As part of that agreement, Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend the complaint to add Industrial Commercial Coatings, LLC (\"ICC\") as a Defendant and to include Plaintiffs' claims against ICC, Santa Fe County and Gallegos under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and New Mexico common law. Following the filing of the amended complaint, Plaintiffs dismissed the state case without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The currently filed complaint states four causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) Deprivation of Civil Rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against County Defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Supervisory Liability under \u00a7 1983 against County Defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) Claims under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, NMSA 1978, \u00b6 41-4-7 and \u00a7 41- 4-12 against County Defendants; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) Claims against Defendant ICC under New Mexico Common Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doc. 20. The Court recently allowed Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to add what the Court considered to be minor changes, leaving intact the above description of the four causes of action. Doc. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This motion concerns only the claims in the Third Cause of Action brought under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7 41-4-7 and \u00a7 41-4-12 (\"Tort Claims Act\") against the County Defendants, with these defendants seeking dismissal of those claims because they are barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Defendants argue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiffs' state law claims under the Tort Claims Act) against the County Defendants are barred by the statute of limitations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The two-year statute of limitations was not tolled by the prior state court action filed by Plaintiffs Mavis and Martinez; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Even if a principle of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling applied, it would apply only to subsequent \"individual\" lawsuits by putative class members and not to successive class actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that class action tolling principles apply to their state law claims and if not, the Court should find that Defendants have either waived the limitations defense or that they should be estopped from asserting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs' alleged injuries occurred in the spring of 2014, and so to be timely under the Tort Claims Act, the complaint should have been filed before the end of spring 2016, within the two-year limitations period of the Tort Claims Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA \u00a7 41-4-15(A). Instead, the complaint was filed on March 14, 2017, almost three years after the date of the alleged incidents resulting in harm and one year too late. Plaintiffs do not dispute the chronology or the fact that the Tort Claims Act limitations period has run on these claims, but they maintain that the filing of the state court case suspended the tolling of the statutory clock. Thus, the Court's inquiries here will be twofold:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 whether class action tolling principles apply; and if not,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 whether Defendants should be estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense and allow Plaintiffs' claims to be equitably tolled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court's stated purpose was to promote \"efficiency and economy of litigation\" which is a \"principle purpose\" of Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/#p544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/#p544\">\n    at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/#p544\">\n    94 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a case decided nine years later, the Court concluded that so-called\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling applies not only when members of the pleaded class intervene in the original suit, but also when they file their own individual cases.\n   <em>\n    Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188175\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/345/#p350\">\n    462 U.S. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350, 353-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188175\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/345/#p350\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188175\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/345/#p350\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). There remained an open question in the wake of both these cases: did these tolling principles also apply to subsequent class actions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Supreme Court answered this question very recently in\n   <em>\n    China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh\n   </em>\n   , holding that the equitable tolling rule does not apply to subsequently filed class action claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612250\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1800/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612250\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1800/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thus, while\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   allows a putative class member to file an individual claim upon denial of class certification even if the statute of limitations would have by that time otherwise run out,\n   <em>\n    China Agritech\n   </em>\n   does not permit the maintenance of a follow-on class action past the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Court explained that \"[e]ndless tolling of a statute of limitations is not a result envisioned by\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612250\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1800/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Tolling Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is undisputed that this federal action was filed in March 2017, three years after the alleged injuries occurred and one year past the two-year limitations period under the Tort Claims Act. The question is whether the initial state court action tolled the running of the clock under the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have no basis for any claimed tolling because the federal tolling rule in\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   does not provide that a state law class action filed in state court tolls the limitations period of a later cause of action filed outside that state's judicial system, that is, in another state or in the federal courts. Defendants point out that because Plaintiffs' Tort Claims Act claims arise under New Mexico law, this Court must apply New Mexico law and cannot allow Plaintiffs to assert claims in federal court that would be barred in a New Mexico court under the state's statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie Railroad v.

The Court agrees that\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   itself does not provide a tolling mechanism for Plaintiffs' state law claims unless Plaintiffs can show that New Mexico would apply that federal rule to state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants claim that the state legislature has not provided for class-action tolling, and no New Mexico case has adopted\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They refer to\n   <em>\n    Barela v. Showa Denko K.K.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   a case from the District of New Mexico, where the plaintiff sought to bring state common law claims in a diversity action in federal court, despite the running of the applicable statutes of limitations. No. Civ. 93-1469 LH/RLP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20316544\">\n    1996 WL 316544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.N.M. Feb. 28, 1996). The plaintiff argued that her claims were tolled during pendency of two prior class action lawsuits-one filed in the District of Maryland and another in the District of New Mexico-in which she was a putative class member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Under\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the court was required to apply New Mexico state law to determine if the prior class action lawsuits served to toll the statute of limitations. The court concluded that\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   did not apply to the case because New Mexico had no statute providing such tolling and had yet to address whether\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   should be used to toll the statute of limitations for putative class members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4 (\"This Court does not believe that any overriding federal interest in class actions mandates application of\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   ... in the absence of applicable state tolling law.\"). Because\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   has no direct application to parallel state procedures, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot rely on this federal tolling rule to toll their state law claims, and they should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs distinguish\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   to minimize its impact. First, they claim that\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue at stake here.\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   addressed \"whether the New Mexico Supreme Court would toll the New Mexico statutory period during the pendency of a class action brought outside its judicial system-in another state or in the federal courts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20316544\">\n    1996 WL 316544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. They describe the issue here as whether the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule applies to state court class actions, but the Court finds this to be too simplistic a description. Plaintiffs would have the Court consider this federal action to be a continuation of the state court class action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63 at 20 (\"This action is not a \"subsequent\" class action; it is a continuation of the timely class action that was initially filed in state court.\"). However, this case involves two class actions, one that was filed in state court and then voluntarily dismissed by Plaintiffs and the other one that was filed a year later in federal court (the instant action).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs note that in a footnote, the court in\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that its holding was contrary to two opinions authored by the Hon. E.L. Mechem, Senior United States District Judge for the District of New Mexico in which Judge Mechem concluded that the New Mexico Supreme Court would apply\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling in almost identical circumstances to the case at bar.\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20316544\">\n    1996 WL 316544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that there is one New Mexico appellate decision that addresses the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule demonstrating that New Mexico would follow it and its principles under the right circumstances. In\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a group of shareholders sued a corporation and its officers for fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and violations of state securities law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n    2006-NMCA-084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n    140 N.M. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n    140 P.3d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Ct. App. 2006). The putative class action complaint was filed in 1997 in state court and in 2003, Butler joined as a defendant. His answer included cross-claims, counter claims and third-party claims, asserting several causes of action including defamation and antitrust violations. The court found all Butler's claims time-barred, and Butler contended that the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule for putative class members applied to him, courtesy of the filing of the original complaint. The New Mexico Court of Appeals found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule of equitable tolling for putative class members did not apply to Butler because he was a defendant in the original class action and did not belong to the category of persons intended to be protected by the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) the policy underlying the rule would not be served by allowing Butler to take advantage of tolling principles. The purpose of a statute of limitations is to \"put defendants on notice of adverse claims and to prevent plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights,\" but the filing of the class action complaint would not have alerted defendants in that case to any of Butler's claims. Thus, there would be no reason to apply the tolling rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n    140 N.M. at 116-117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670945\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/111/\">\n    140 P.3d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants dismiss any significance to\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   because the New Mexico Court of Appeals finally concluded that it did not apply to the situation presented. Plaintiffs' view is that the\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   court applied the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   rule to the particular facts of the case without any analysis or debate about whether the rule or its principles should be applied in New Mexico. In the end, the court did not apply the tolling rule was because the particular circumstances did not fit within its purpose-not because of any\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   considerations-leaving it fair to say that the court would have applied the rule in different circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Despite the promise of\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the Court's analysis here does not fare well for Plaintiffs in the end, whether or not\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   can be used under an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   analysis. If the tolling rule does not apply, the statute of limitations has expired for the class members in this federal action. However, Plaintiffs would not get the relief they seek even if New Mexico courts would apply\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' state law claims.

Neither\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Crown\n   </em>\n   addressed the specific issue of whether tolling applies to subsequent\n   <em>\n    class actions\n   </em>\n   , and so Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs would benefit from tolling only as to their\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   claims. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    China Agritech\n   </em>\n   forecloses any arguments offered by Plaintiffs that tolling should include class action claims. The best\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   offers Plaintiffs-if it applies at all-is a tolling of the individual claims of putative class members; it would not allow a successive class action claim based on the state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants are also correct that Plaintiffs Mavis and Martinez, the two named Plaintiffs in the state court class action, would not be able to benefit from tolling under\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   , for two reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, Plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal without prejudice under NMRA 1-41(A)(1)(b).

Plaintiffs seek to preclude (or\n   estop) Defendants from raising a statute of limitations defense, and to have the limitations period equitably tolled for their state law claims. They avail themselves of the equitable doctrines of waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling but unfortunately they do not discuss at any length the distinction between these doctrines. It seems clear that the doctrines of equitable tolling and estoppel are related, although the differences between them are not so clear.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lauren v.

The Court intends to make factual findings here regarding Defendants' role in the decision to stipulate to dismissal of the state court case.

They argue that Defendants' filing of this motion goes against the parties' agreement and understandings, and that they are now trying to take advantage of the procedure they initiated. Defendants do not dispute any of the background facts, but they do attempt to put their own spin on the facts, offering different rationales for their position that they did nothing outside the bounds of the parties' agreement:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Plaintiffs \"elected\" to dismiss the state lawsuit\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In this argument, County Defendants admit that they suggested the maneuver to federal court in order to have Plaintiffs \"rectify their impermissible claim splitting,\" Doc. 69 at 2, but that Plaintiffs are the ones who \"elected\" to dismiss the state lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A word about claim splitting here-the Tenth Circuit has weighed in on the issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The rule against claim-splitting requires a plaintiff to assert all of its causes of action arising from a common set of facts in one lawsuit. By spreading claims around in multiple lawsuits in other courts or before other judges, parties waste \"scarce judicial resources\" and undermine \"the efficient and comprehensive disposition of cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Katz v. Gerardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828037\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1212/#p1217\">\n    655 F.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoted case omitted). Defendants note that Plaintiffs' counsel frequently make use of a claim splitting strategy, that is, pursuing piecemeal litigation of the same facts in both state and federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69 at 2-3, n. 1, 2 &amp; 3. A court may use its discretion to disallow such claim splitting by plaintiffs where it interferes with a court's management of its own docket. Had Defendants elected to challenge Plaintiffs' claim splitting, they had the option of seeking the Court's intervention. Defendants can be assured that, given the Court's heavy docket in a southwest border district with seven authorized district judge positions that now has two vacancies, the Court would have been highly sensitive to any waste of resources. Instead, County Defendants took matters into their own hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   County Defendants were obviously not happy about Plaintiffs' claim splitting, which prompted them to approach Plaintiffs and suggest moving both cases into the one federal case. However, it certainly appears that after getting Plaintiffs to agree to dismiss the state court case,\n   which is what actually happened, Defendants then turned around and moved to dismiss the very claims that were moved into the federal case, which was not any part of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus, if Plaintiffs \"elected\" to dismiss the state lawsuit, it was at the behest of County Defendants and in in reliance on their representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Plaintiffs Cannot Show \"Extraordinary Circumstance\" to Justify Equitable Tolling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants next contend that Plaintiffs offer no legal authority suggesting that Defendants' insistence on retaining available defenses creates the required \"extraordinary circumstance\" to obtain equitable tolling. The problem with this argument is that Defendants mischaracterize their desire to retain their defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   During the parties' negotiations, Plaintiffs exercised their due diligence by clarifying whether Defendants intended to be \"inserting '\n   <em>\n    otherwise unavailable defenses.\n   </em>\n   ' \" As described above, Defendants countered by stating that Defendants \"may also have defenses to the new\n   <em>\n    federal claim(s)\n   </em>\n   and/or to the additional plaintiffs that are different from and in addition to those raised in the state court proceeding.\" Doc. 63-3 at 1. Defense counsel also added \"I'm not sure what you mean by otherwise unavailable defenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss runs counter to their representations in their correspondence with Plaintiffs, and on which Plaintiffs relied. Defendants represented to Plaintiffs that they intended to keep defenses to federal claims with no mention of defenses to state law claims and yet it is the state law claims they seek to dismiss here. Under any plain reading, the phrase, \"that are different from and in addition to those raised in the state court proceeding (and that were not applicable in the state court proceeding), refers to \"defenses to the new federal claim(s) and/or to the additional plaintiffs....\" There is no reasonable way to construe this language as referring to statute of limitations defenses to either federal claims or the plaintiffs in the state court case. In the same vein, the phrase \"otherwise unavailable defenses\" could only mean those defenses that would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be available to Defendants without the dismissal of the state court lawsuit-such as the statute of limitations defense on which Defendants now rely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    (3) Plaintiffs' \"Attempt\" to Avoid Consequences of Limitations Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Last, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleged tolling of the statute of limitations, presumably in an attempt to avoid the natural consequences of the County Defendants' Tort Claims Act limitations defense. Doc. 69 at 5. Defendants point to language in the Amended Complaint stating that the applicable statutes \"were tolled as of the filing of the [state court complaint] on March 11, 2016.\" Doc. 20, \u00b6 335. They claim that these assertions show that Plaintiffs' expected the defense to be raised and were trying to avoid its effect. The Court disagrees with Defendants, and views this assertion in the Amended Complaint as a way to memorialize the party's agreement regarding the effect of the stipulated dismissal of the state court case, based on Plaintiffs' efforts for clarification and the parties' communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs should have expected Defendants to raise a statute of limitations defense because it had been asserted in: (1) the then-existing state court litigation as well as (2) in the Answer to the Amended Complaint. The\n   Court rejects both of these contentions for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, the Answer to the state court complaint does not assert a statute of limitations defense in connection with Tort Claims Act claims. Instead, it asserts the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims are barred and\n   <em>\n    limited\n   </em>\n   by the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and New Mexico common law and/or their failure to satisfy the prerequisites to suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Doc. 69-2 at 18, \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). Given this specific language and the parties' e-mail exchanges regarding the defenses which Defendants intended to keep, Plaintiffs could not reasonably expect that if the state court case was dismissed, Defendants would be raising a statute of limitations defense to the state law claims that were to be incorporated into the federal action. Moreover, the state court action was concededly filed within the applicable limitations period and so there would be no reason for Defendants to include this defense in the state court Answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, the Answer to the federal Amended Complaint includes a statute of limitations defense in that Defendants assert that Plaintiffs claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 34 at 40. However, the chronology does not fit into Defendants' argument. The Answer to the Amended Complaint was filed on October 20, 2017, more than two weeks\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the state court case was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63-5 (Order of Dismissal). Therefore, there was no reason for Plaintiffs to expect Defendants to raise a statute of limitations defense as a result of agreeing to dismiss the state court case. Based on the parties' e-mail exchanges, Plaintiffs' expectations would have been just the opposite, and the Court agrees with Plaintiffs' assessment of what has occurred between the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Clearly, Plaintiffs would never have agreed to this proposal if doing so would create an otherwise unavailable statute of limitations defense. By proposing this procedure and by representing to Plaintiffs that they only intended to assert \"defenses to the new federal claim(s) and/or to the additional plaintiffs\" in this case, ... the County Defendants either implicitly waived the statute of limitations defense they are now asserting, or what is worse, actively misled Plaintiffs by causing them to believe that the County Defendants would not raise the statute of limitations defense that was unavailable to them in the state court action and that they now raise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Doc. 63 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Courts have not been reluctant to find waiver of defenses based on a defendant's conduct.

Kan. 1997), the district court held that defendant had waived his right to rely on the statute of limitations as a defense. The plaintiff in that case had voluntarily dismissed his timely filed Title VII case without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal with the defendant. However, when plaintiff refiled the case, defendant claimed that the second suit was untimely. The court reasoned that defense counsel \"must have contemplated that any refiling by the plaintiff would necessarily fall outside the limitation period\" and thus, defense counsel must have \"intended to\n   waive, albeit implicitly, his client's right to rely on the expiration of the applicable limitations period as a defense to plaintiff's action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"58526\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/1257/#p1258\">\n    985 F.Supp. at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pacheco v.

Defense counsel's communications with Plaintiffs is tantamount to waiver of the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations for Plaintiffs' state court claims. Defense counsel appeared to be agreeing to the dismissal of Plaintiffs' state court case without pursing that defense on Plaintiffs' state court claims. County Defendants have therefore waived the statute of limitations defense for those claims;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   2. The Court finds that the representations of counsel for County Defendants to Plaintiffs' counsel regarding retained defenses were relayed in such a way as to induce Plaintiffs to believe that the state court case could be dismissed without adverse consequences occurring as a result of the dismissal. The Court further finds that in response to Plaintiffs' good faith inquiry for assurances and specifics, counsel for County Defendants avoided a direct answer and instead made a deliberately obtuse comment about \"not being sure\" of the meaning of \"otherwise available,\" when the meaning should have been perfectly clear;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3. Plaintiffs exercised due diligence in trying to determine whether their clients' claims would be prejudiced by agreeing to the dismissal. This is not a situation where Plaintiffs should have been better prepared or where they demonstrated any ignorance of the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gatewood v. R.R. Ret.

Plaintiffs' inquiries to defense counsel were directed to the defenses that would be available to County Defendants and that County Defendants intended to use if\n   Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the state court case;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   4. The conduct of counsel for County Defendants amounted to falsely representing or concealing their intent to pursue an affirmative statute of limitations defense upon Plaintiffs' dismissal of the state court case, in order to lull Plaintiffs into agreeing to the dismissal, and that Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the state court case believing that the defense would not be used against Plaintiffs' state court claims. County Defendants are therefore estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense of Plaintiffs' claims asserted under the Tort Claims Act;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   5.
