Steven, by and through his mother Carrie Fernandez, seeks reversal of the COAC's decision. For the reasons stated herein, the Court REVERSES the COAC's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a dispute about whether the District violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") by failing to provide Steven with a free appropriate public education. Steven is an autistic child who lives in the District. Steven has been attending the Alpine Center (\"Alpine\"), a private out-of-district treatment and education center for individuals with autism, since 2013. This case arose from the District's decision in 2016 to move Steven out of Alpine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before summarizing the factual background of Steven's case, it is helpful to provide a brief overview of the IDEA's relevant provisions. The purpose of the IDEA is \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for future education, employment, and independent living.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).

ECF No. 2 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2014, after Steven's first year at Alpine, the District attempted to change his placement to the School of Excellence (\"SOE\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Steven's mother and several other parents of children subject to the District's 2014 decision filed a complaint with the Colorado Department of Education asserting that this decision violated the IDEA. R. 105-35. The State Complaints Officer who reviewed this complaint reversed the District's decision to change the students' placement, finding that the District had violated the IDEA in its decision-making process. R. 131-32. The first state complaint decision ordered that Steven's placement remain at Alpine, required the District to submit a proposed corrective action plan to the Department of Education to address its violations, and prohibited any changes to Steven's or the other students' placements until after the corrective action had been taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first state complaint decision also contained several placement procedures designed to prevent future violations by the District. In particular, the District was prohibited from changing Steven's placement until (1) it conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Steven; (2) staff members from any proposed new placement observed Steven at Alpine to understand his educational and behavioral functioning; and (3) the District convened an IEP meeting facilitated by a neutral facilitator\n   \"not employed by the School District\" that complied with all the procedural requirements of the IDEA, particularly those that the District had violated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2015, the year after the first state complaint decision was issued, Steven's IEP was again reviewed, and his placement at Alpine remained unchanged. However, when Steven's IEP was reviewed again the following year in a meeting begun on March 29, 2016 and concluded on April 5, 2016, the District decided-based on a majority vote-to change his placement from Alpine to SOE. R. 451-54. The IEP meeting was facilitated by Amy McFall (nee Spayd), a District-employed psychologist. R. 219. No one from SOE was present at the meeting, nor had any SOE staff or teacher observed Steven at Alpine prior to the District's decision to change Steven's placement. R. 28 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The final summary of the IEP meeting reflects that the team determined that Steven required a separate school, meaning one which exclusively serves handicapped children, which is the most restrictive category of placement options. R. 452. In deciding on a separate school rather than a placement where Steven would spend less than 40% of his time in general education the team \"decided that Steven required more individualized instruction and 1:1 adult supervision and instruction.\" R. 453. The team considered three placement options before deciding on SOE: Alpine, the Roundup School, and SOE. R. 452.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SOE is a separate public school located in the District's catchment area. R. 30, 222. However, SOE is operated by the Pikes Peak Board of Cooperative Educational Services rather than by the District, so it is considered an out-of-district school. R. 222. It is comprised of at least four programs, two of which are appropriate for autistic students: the Communication and Learning Program (\"COLA\") and Learning Independence by Educating Responsible Trustworthy Youth (\"LIBERTY\"). R. 29, 222, 634. Although the District concluded that Steven's placement would be changed to SOE, it did not specify which of the SOE programs Steven would attend. R. 453. The record reflects that at the end of the IEP meeting, no one present knew whether Steven was being placed at COLA or at LIBERTY, Steven's mother included. R. 901, 942, 995, 1042, 1080, 1343, 1351-52. Steven's mother was upset at the outcome of the meeting, as she did not feel that Steven would be well-served at SOE. R. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The day after the IEP meeting, then-District Coordinator of Special Programs Amy Lloyd\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   reached out to the Assistant Principal at SOE to ask whether SOE had room for Steven. R. 331. Ms. Lloyd indicated that Steven would \"need to be in either the COLA or Liberty [sic] programs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Assistant Principal indicated that she would \"like to review the IEP to determine possible placement,\" R. 337, and the two discussed scheduling a meeting and a tour of SOE for Steven's mother. R. 336.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the meantime, Steven's mother filed her second state complaint with the Colorado Department of Education on May 5, 2016, alleging that the 2016 IEP decision violated the IDEA and the first state complaint decision. R. 25. She noted that the IEP meeting had been conducted by a District employee in direct violation of the first state complaint decision's requirement that any IEP meeting be facilitated by a neutral facilitator \"not employed by the District,\" and that no representative\n   from any proposed future placement had observed Steven at Alpine prior to the District's decision to change his placement. R. 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 134. She also alleged that the District had failed to make a specific offer of placement, failed to base its decision on Steven's individual needs, and predetermined its decision to change Steven's placement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 16, 2016 Ms. Lloyd reached out to Steven's mother to schedule a meeting with SOE \"to discuss a transition for Steven,\" R. 92, but Steven's mother's attorney declined the invitation on the basis of the pending state complaint. R. 91. On June 30, 2016 the State Complaints Officer issued her decision on Ms. Fernandez's second complaint, finding that the District had again violated the IDEA in the 2016 IEP meeting. R. 35. The second state complaint decision found that the District had violated the express terms of the first state complaint decision, that its decision to change Steven's placement was not based on his individual needs and was predetermined, and that the District had failed to make a sufficiently specific offer of placement to put Steven's mother on notice of what was being proposed. R. 35-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the second state complaint decision, the District filed a due process complaint with the Colorado Department of Education. R. 2. The District alleged that the State Complaints Officer had selectively interviewed Steven's mother and Alpine staff without interviewing District staff members on the IEP team. R. 4. Moreover, the District argued that the complaint process had not afforded the District the opportunity to engage with the process, including by cross-examining witnesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the District alleged several errors on the part of the State Complaints Officer in reaching her decision. R. 4-9. The District requested that the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Robert Spencer find that the District had made a timely offer of FAPE. R. 225. The ALJ decided in the District's favor that it had made a timely offer of FAPE, and that any procedural violation did not deprive Steven of FAPE or an educational benefit or deprive his mother of her right to participate in the decision. R. 233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In response to the ALJ's decision, Steven and his mother filed the present complaint before this Court seeking a de novo review of the administrative record and asking that the Court find that the 2016 IEP denied Steven the FAPE to which he is entitled. ECF No. 2 at 15. Moreover, Steven requests that the Court award his mother reimbursement for the educational services she provided him at Alpine during the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, he seeks a declaration that the District violated his rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties have fully briefed the issues before the Court.

R. 223, 453. SOE is comprised of four programs for students on IEPs, one of which also supports students who are not on IEPs. R. 634. COLA and LIBERTY are the two SOE programs designed to support students\n   with autism. Although the District refers to COLA and LIBERTY as \"classrooms\" located in SOE, the record reflects that they are in fact distinct programs within SOE for autistic students with different abilities and needs. ECF No. 29 at 10. Amber Brown, a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst at SOE, testified that \"the COLA program is for students who have a diagnosis of autism\" with \"very limited to no functional communication.\" R. 1092. In contrast, \"the LIBERTY program is for students who have a dual diagnosis and/or autism.... Those students have more functional language.\" R. 1094. Ms. Lloyd also described her understanding of the differences between the two programs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   COLA is more restrictive. They have a more intense one-on-one support, and they focus primarily on those behaviors relating to autism. And the LIBERTY program is less restrictive in-where it takes a more-three-students-to-one adult setting, and they shift the focus more into the academics as the behaviors have become more under control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   R. 635. Finally, occupational therapist Nancy Morin described the differences between the \"two programs\" at SOE, noting that \"the COLA program tends to be a little more restrictive, a little more lower [sic] teacher/student ratio.\" R. 457. In contrast, \"LIBERTY is a little less restrictive. It's more focused on autism, more emphasis on academics.\" R. 458. She confirmed that \"COLA and LIBERTY are two separate educational placements within the physical building of School of Excellence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Steven argues that the District failed to make a specific offer of an educational placement because the IEP meeting resulted only in the conclusion that he would be placed at SOE, which is merely the building that houses various educational programs. ECF No. 28 at 14. Steven argues that the District's failure to determine his specific educational placement violated regulations requiring that his parent be in the group that makes the placement decision and be afforded the opportunity to participate in meetings concerning her child's educational placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.116\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 300.501.

The ALJ concluded that \"[t]he lack of a final decision whether [Steven] would enter the COLA or LIBERTY classroom at the SOE is not a procedural violation.\" R. 231.

They serve different populations of autistic students, employ different student to teacher ratios, and have different focuses. Even if Steven's IEP could be implemented in either program, there are sufficient essential differences between the two programs to make them distinct placements. For one thing, the difference in the student to teacher ratio is an essential element in Steven's education program, as highlighted by his IEP. The members of the IEP team acknowledged that Steven requires 1:1 attention from a teacher or staff member. R. 453;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 443. As Amber Brown, the Board-Certified Behavior Analyst at SOE noted, LIBERTY would not provide that type of attention,\n   and COLA would be more appropriate given its smaller staff-to-student ratio. R. 349. Moreover, as the IEP team members acknowledged, COLA and LIBERTY are designed to serve different populations: COLA serves those autistic individuals with more behavioral issues who are less capable of working on teams and have less functional communication skills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast, LIBERTY serves students with greater communication skills and the ability to engage more in academic work. Additionally, the programs differ in their focus on academics versus behavior, a fact Ms. Brown acknowledged when she found that Steven should start at COLA until his behavior was improved enough for him to move to LIBERTY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These differences reflect essential differences in the programs' purposes and aims, and as such indicate that they are distinct educational placements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I am not convinced by any of the District's arguments to the contrary. First, the District argues that an \"educational placement\" is merely the \"program of services described\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   the child's 'individualized educational\n   <em>\n    program.\n   </em>\n   ' \" ECF No. 29 at 22 (emphases in original). Thus, according to the District, though COLA and LIBERTY \"may have used different groupings or interventions to implement Steven's IEP, they were not different educational placements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If educational placement were synonymous with the provision of the IEP's services, then deciding on an institution or school to provide these services would be superfluous: the description of the services to be provided pursuant to the IEP would suffice to establish a child's educational placement. And yet that is plainly not the case. The culmination of the IEP meeting is a decision on when and where they child will receive the services described therein.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(i)(VII). According to the Colorado Rule referenced above, the determination of placement is \"\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   the child's IEP.\" 1 CCR 301-8, Rule 4.03(8)(a) (emphasis added). When one institution's \"classes, individualized attention and additional services a child will receive\" are different from what the child will receive at a different institution or program, they are distinct placements, and the District must choose between them.\n   <em>\n    T.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891957\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/412/#p419\">\n    584 F.3d at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The process conducted at the IEP meeting and thereafter belies the District's contention that a placement is merely the program outlined in the IEP. After the group agreed about Steven's current status, his goals and objectives, and the particular interventions or services needed to reach those goals, the group then discussed three potential educational placements for Steven: Alpine, SOE, and the Roundup school. Moreover, the day after the meeting, the District reached out to SOE to begin determining whether Steven should attend COLA or LIBERTY. R. 331. If an \"educational placement\" meant only the provision of the services dictated in the IEP, then the group would have been done with its task before it ever contemplated which of the three schools Steven would attend, and the District's attempting to choose between COLA and LIBERTY would have been superfluous. Moreover, under this rationale, Alpine, SOE, and Roundup would each be considered the same placement since they would be expected to provide the same IEP services. Thus, the fact that the group did not stop at determining the services Steven would need according to his IEP, but instead went on to consider which schools could provide the services, indicates that the District understands that an educational placement in fact involves the institution, school or program where a child's IEP will be provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The District also argues that Steven's differentiating between COLA and LIBERTY is tantamount to calling a teacher's discretionary decision to change the way she uses her time a change in placements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 29 at 23. Not so. The differences between COLA and LIBERTY are well understood and are institutional rather than based on teachers' discretion. The record indicates that these programs catered to different audiences and offered distinct services, teacher-to-student ratios, focuses, and supports. ECF No. 28 at 21. Moreover, the fact that the District explained its decision to transfer Steven from Alpine to SOE on the basis of the latter school's more academic focus belies its argument. Similarly, the District's own actions after the IEP meeting to decide which program Steven should be placed in indicate that the District understands the legitimate differences between the programs that go beyond any teacher's discretion. Thus, the District's attempt to minimize these differences is disingenuous and contradicts its own actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Indeed, despite the District's argument that placement does not involve a physical location, the District's contention that SOE is an educational placement and the COLA and LIBERTY programs are merely classrooms therein seems to rest largely on the fact that COLA and LIBERTY are in the same physical building. Given these substantial differences, it is difficult to understand why the District would consider the programs to be the same educational placement aside from the fact that they are both housed in the same SOE building. This is not a valid ground for determining educational placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, I am not persuaded by the District's alternative argument that even if the two programs were different placements, there is no need to choose which is ideal, since either one could provide the services specified in the IEP. ECF No. 29 at 23. The District's argument would indicate that so long as all the placement options being considered are reasonable and can provide the services needed in the child's IEP, the parents need not be involved in any decision about the placement. This argument plainly contradicts the requirement that parents be involved in the decision about where their child is placed.\n   <em>\n    Rowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p181\">\n    458 U.S. at 181-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p181\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

The email inviting Steven's mother to discuss Steven's transition to SOE was sent a month after the final decision. R. 92. Steven's mother was well within her right to file a complaint within that time objecting to the procedural violations at the IEP meeting. The burden was on the District to comply with its procedural requirements in the IEP meeting, not on Steven's mother to wait and see whether the District would correct its errors at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I conclude that SOE was not a valid final educational placement, but that instead the COLA and LIBERTY programs were distinct placements within SOE. As such, the District's decision to transfer Steven to SOE without identifying which program he would attend failed to provide his mother with sufficiently specific information about where her son was being placed and prevented her from participating in the ultimate placement decision. This is especially problematic in light of the District's failure to comply with the placement procedures ordered by the Colorado Department of Education's first state complaint decision, discussed below.

Although I need not reach these further arguments given my finding that Steven's mother was denied the opportunity to participate in the decision on Steven's placement, I will address the District's failure to comply with the placement procedures enacted in the first state complaint decision. I am troubled by the failure and the District's defense of this failure before the ALJ and this Court, both of which indicate a lack of regard for the state complaint procedure. The District's failure to comply with these procedures compounded Steven's mother's difficulty in participating in the decision about her son's educational placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The placement procedures ordered by the State Complaints Officer, to which the District did not object at the time, dictate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [T]he School District shall be prohibited from changing the Students' placement until:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   a.

ECF No. 29 at 30-31. Be that as it may, the placement procedure expressly required that the individual be neutral by virtue of the fact that she not be employed by the District, not by virtue of her neutral behavior. This requirement was put in place for a reason: to give Steven's mother a fair hearing led by an individual without an interest in the outcome. Despite Ms. McFall's apparently disciplined and neutral behavior at the meeting, the mere fact of her employment by the District may have exerted a pressure or bias on the proceedings and given Steven's mother the sense that the proceedings were not fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The ALJ also noted that the District failed to have a staff member from a proposed placement observe Steven before changing his placement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11143685\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/755/#p765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the ALJ, this second error is less clearly a violation of the placement procedures, since there is some ambiguity in the procedures as to whether such observation must occur before the placement decision is made or before the change in placement occurs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11143685\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/755/#p765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I disagree that there is any ambiguity.

As a result, the District's failure to have a staff member from SOE observe Steven prior to the decision to place Steven at SOE violated the plain language of this procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, as discussed above, the District's failure to specify which program Steven would be attending at SOE violated the third placement procedure, which prohibited the District from changing a placement until the District \"develops an IEP that includes a description of placement sufficient to allow the Parents to understand what is being proposed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11143685\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/755/#p765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since COLA and LIBERTY were distinct placements,\n   the outcome of the IEP meeting did not clearly describe Steven's placement for his mother's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   These violations of the placement procedures resulted in a failure to provide Steven's mother with the process she was guaranteed by the Colorado Department of Education through its State Complaints Officer, and are further evidence of the District's failure to ensure Steven's mother had the opportunity to participate fully in the decision on Steven's placement. Unlike the ALJ, I cannot condone these violations of the state placement procedures. Although the particular requirements ordered by the State Complaints Officer may not be enshrined in state or federal regulations,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232, I find that the IDEA's requirement that states establish such state complaint proceedings requires that the remedies devised therein be respected and enforced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The state complaint process that is mandated by the IDEA would become a sham proceeding if the remedies devised pursuant to that process were not enforceable. To ignore these requirements would discourage parents and school districts from pursuing such remedies in the first place. Such an outcome would pervert the intention in the IDEA that states create such systems to provide a remedy for parents before they seek relief in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.151\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 300.153 (establishing the requirement for state complaint procedures, including that each state education agency must adopt written procedures for \"[r]esolving any complaint\").

These federal regulations pursuant to IDEA indicate that state complaint remedies are a required component of the state complaint procedures. Thus, it would be nonsensical to fail to enforce the remedies mandated by the State Complaints Officer in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, the placement procedures devised in Steven's case were designed to ensure that his mother in particular-as opposed to parents in a general sense-would have meaningful participation in a fair IEP meeting with a clear outcome. The violation of these procedures set out for Steven's and his mother's benefit is arguably more egregious than the violation of a non-particularized procedure set out in regulation or statute that applies equally to all children and all parents. As such, the ALJ's decision not to enforce these procedures on the grounds that they are not found in regulation or statute ignores the fact that they were developed in a state complaint proceeding created pursuant to federal regulations to provide more individualized protections in just such a situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Therefore, the District's ignoring the placement procedures designed to protect Steven's mother's right to a fair IEP process, in conjunction with its failing to provide a clear offer of educational placement, infringed Steven's mother right to meaningful participation in the IEP process.

R. 595-96.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Steven also alleges that the District violated the Colorado Exceptional Children's Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 22-20,101,\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    , but this allegation was made only in passing in his opening brief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 28 at 2. Because Steven does not address the terms of this statute or substantiate the alleged violation, I will deem any additional argument thereunder to be waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    It is no excuse that the District's employees at the time of the 2016-17 IEP meeting were not personally aware of the placement procedures. The District must ensure that procedures mandated by the State Complaints Officers be complied with despite predictable and inevitable changes in District personnel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
