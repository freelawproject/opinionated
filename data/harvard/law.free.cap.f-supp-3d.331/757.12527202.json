(Dkt. 10.) The charges are based on evidence seized by Dearborn, Michigan police officers pursuant to a warrant to\n   search Elizondo's home issued by a state-court judge. Elizondo now moves to suppress that evidence. He argues that the warrant lacked probable cause because there was an insufficient nexus between the items to be seized and defendant's alleged criminal conduct, and it cannot be saved by the good faith exception set forth in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government responds that the affidavit set forth probable cause, and if it did not, the good faith exception applies. (Dkt. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts are not in dispute. On November 29, 2017, a Dearborn, Michigan police officer, Joshua Urbiel, who was then serving as a Corporal in the Dearborn Police Narcotics Unit, submitted a request for a search warrant to State of Michigan 19th District Court Judge Sam Salamey. The affidavit in support of the warrant had been reviewed by an Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor. The affidavit set forth Officer Urbiel's experience as a narcotics investigator and indicated that as a result of his training and experience, he is aware that drug traffickers conceal contraband, including drugs and firearms, in their homes, along with various records and large amounts of cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The affidavit further indicated that Officer Urbiel had received information from a confidential informant, CI# 508, regarding a cocaine and fentanyl dealer that the CI knew as \"Miguel.\" CI # 508 indicated that Miguel was a Hispanic man who \"distributed drugs from a red Ford Explorer Sport Trac and possibly lived in the area of Silvery Lane and Cherry Hill, in Dearborn, MI.\" (Dkt. 20 at 14.) The CI also indicated that he believed \"Miguel supplies large quantities of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl to area strip clubs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The affidavit goes on to describe how the affiant verified the information from CI# 508. For example, the CI provided a phone number for Miguel and the affiant traced it to a Miguel Antonio Elizondo, who lives at 460 Kingsbury, Dearborn, Michigan. Although that Elizondo had a 1965 date of birth, the affiant checked law enforcement databases and located a Michigan driver's license for a man with the same name and same address who is much younger, having been born in 1983. Officer Urbiel showed the license photograph to the CI, and he positively identified that individual as the defendant, Miguel Elizondo. Sure enough, Officer Urbiel went to the 460 Kingsbury address, and a red Ford Explorer Sport Trac was parked on the street next to the home. He then ran a lien check on the license plate number and the connection was complete. The Ford Explorer was registered to Miguel Elizondo, of 460 Kingsbury, in Dearborn, Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A criminal history check revealed that Elizondo had the following \"drug related charges/convictions:\" a February 1990 felony\n   drug conviction, a June 1992 felony drug conviction, an October 2008 felony prostitution-related conviction, and an August 2011 felony drug conviction. This information was contained in the affidavit. (Dkt. 20 at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Urbiel went on to describe the controlled buy in some detail. All of the usual activity took place to make sure the CI did not already have drugs on him, and his call to the defendant was monitored by Officer Urbiel. He was given pre-recorded money for the transaction and was kept under surveillance throughout the buy. Meanwhile, another Dearborn police corporeal was surveilling Elizondo's home on Kingsbury Street. That officer saw Elizondo exit the side door to his home and enter the red Ford Explorer Sport Trac that the CI had previously told them Miguel used to distribute drugs. At the hearing on this motion, the Court asked the government whether this officer saw anything in Elizondo's hands, or whether he was carrying a backpack or holding anything at all that might contain drugs or other contraband. Counsel for the United States indicated that he was not seen carrying anything. (Tr. at 31, March 26, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The affidavit indicates that the controlled buy was successful, and CI # 508 turned over the suspected heroin. He and his vehicle were searched again with negative results. The suspected heroin was tested by the Dearborn Police Narcotics office and a preliminary field test confirmed that it was, indeed, heroin. Interestingly, \"[f]ollowing the controlled purchase, surveillance was terminated on ELIZONDO.\" (Dkt. 20 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based upon this, Officer Urbiel believed there was probable cause to search Elizondo's home, and 48 hours later he submitted a warrant request with an affidavit setting forth the information above. State of Michigan 19th District Court Judge Salamey agreed. The warrant was executed the same day, November 29, 2017. Officers recovered drugs and guns from the house, and on December 12, 2017, Miguel Elizondo was indicted on three counts of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) : one count for distribution of heroin, another count for distribution of cocaine, and the third count for distribution of crack cocaine. The indictment also contained one count of felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This motion was filed in a timely manner on January 19, 2018, and the government responded. Oral argument was held on March 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

To be sufficient, the affidavit supporting the warrant must establish probable cause to believe that evidence of narcotics trafficking would be present at the place to be searched, in this case the 460 Kingsbury Street home on November 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the Sixth Circuit, being a drug dealer and living in a home is not enough to establish probable cause to search the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peffer v. Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263935\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/256/#p269\">\n    880 F.3d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (6th Cir. 2018) (\"[W]e have never held ... that a suspect's status as a drug dealer, standing alone, gives rise to a fair probability that drugs will be found in the home.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336683\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/375/#p382\">\n    828 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   383 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the present case, the affidavit establishes that \" 'Miguel' supplies large amounts of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl to area strip clubs.\" (Dkt. 20 at 14.) This, arguably, establishes that defendant was engaged in a \"continual and ongoing\" distribution scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9148463\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/631/#p636\">\n    389 F.3d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (6th Cir. 2004). It is not clear, however, how this establishes that drugs would be found at his residence. The affidavit also establishes that defendant left his home, entered his car, and drove directly to a controlled buy. (Dkt. 20 at 15.) Again, it is not clear that this establishes-as required by\n   <em>\n    Peffer\n   </em>\n   -any \"other reason to believe\" that additional drugs would be found in a search of defendant's home.\n   <em>\n    Peffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263935\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/256/#p269\">\n    880 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government argues that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   stands for the principle that \"where, like [in the present case], an affidavit explains observations connecting the suspect to the place to be searched, the nexus requirement is satisfied.\" (Dkt. 24 at 9.)\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   does not support such a broad proposition. Instead, the case asserts a more narrow holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Commission of a drug transaction outside of a house and one participant's walking back into the house, as observed in this case, plainly demonstrated a sufficient nexus with the house.\n   </em>\n   The affidavit explained that a confidential informant had observed someone come out of Ellison's house, engage in a drug transaction [immediately outside of the house], and then return into the residence. These incriminating actions are inextricably connected to the residence for which the search warrant was sought. From these actions, the affiant and the issuing judge could infer that there was a fair probability that drugs were being stored in the residence or that drug trafficking was taking place from the residence, such that a search of the residence would be likely to yield contraband or evidence of a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089167\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/347/#p349\">\n    632 F.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (6th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   , the CI observed the drug transaction taking place in the immediate vicinity of the property. Because the CI observed the entire sequence of events-exiting the house, conducting the transaction, and returning to the house-it is undeniable that the drugs involved in the transaction were kept in defendant's home prior to the sale. And although the transaction did not take place\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   the home, it took place\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   the home. Accordingly, it was clear to the court that \"there was a fair probability that ... drug trafficking was taking place\n   <em>\n    from the residence.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The facts are not as clear here. In this case, the affidavit states only that defendant was observed exiting his home, entering his car, and driving to a different location to engage in a drug transaction. Police did not continue to observe defendant after the controlled buy was completed. The affidavit does not provide any information regarding what, if anything, defendant was carrying when he exited his home. The affidavit makes no mention of any criminal activity suspected or observed at the residence, and, in fact, confirms only that \"Miguel ... distributed drugs from a red Ford Explorer Sport Trac.\" (Dkt. 26-1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government emphasizes that \"the affiant noted that it is common for drug traffickers to secret contraband in their homes.\" (Dkt. 24 at 11.) They further argue that \"the incriminating actions of defendant are inextricably intertwined with his residence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And finally, they assert\n   that \"[t]he affidavit also does not describe [defendant] stopping at any other location prior to controlled buy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The government concludes by asserting \"[f]rom a practical, commonsense standpoint, it is more likely than not that [defendant] retrieved drugs from his home before the controlled buy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   None of the government's arguments successfully rebut defendant's argument from\n   <em>\n    Peffer\n   </em>\n   : \"Recognizing that '[i]n the case of drug dealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live,' we nevertheless held that 'if the affidavit fails to include facts that directly connect the residence with the suspected drug dealing activity, ... it cannot be inferred that drugs will be found in the defendant's home-even if the defendant is a known drug dealer.' \"\n   <em>\n    Peffer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263935\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/256/#p269\">\n    880 F.3d at 272-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336683\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/375/#p382\">\n    828 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   383-84 ).

In dicta, the court appeared satisfied that the connections between the defendant to the house, the house to the car, and the car to the house were sufficient. The affidavit in the present case provides precisely those connections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   supports his proposition that the good faith exception should not apply because \"there was 'no modicum of evidence, however, slight, to connect the criminal activity to the place to be searched.' \" (Dkt. 26 at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957246\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/744/#p748\">\n    409 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   749 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is true that in\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   the Sixth Circuit held that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply, even in a situation where \"the affidavit at issue [ ] included statements indicating that the informant purchased methamphetamine multiple times and that the informant observed controlled substances at or in the defendant's residence.\" (Dkt. 26 at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957246\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/744/#p748\">\n    409 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   746-47 ).) However, the shortfall identified in the affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   is that it did not provide any information whatsoever about the \"residence\" in question. On the face of the affidavit, there was\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   (no address, no description, etc.) from which the magistrate could have determined that there was probable cause to search the particular residence for which the warrant was issued. As the court stated \"[t]he warrant in this case failed to make any connection between the residence to be searched and the facts of the criminal activity that the officer set out in his affidavit. That affidavit also failed to indicate any connection between the defendant and the address given or between the defendant and any of the criminal activity that occurred there.\"\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957246\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/744/#p748\">\n    409 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When the court in\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   asserted that \"[t]he warrant in this case failed to make any connection between the residence to be searched and the facts of the criminal activity that the officer set out in his affidavit,\" it was true the most literal sense. Within the four corners of the affidavit, there was\n   <em>\n    literally nothing\n   </em>\n   to connect the defendant or the criminal activity to the address for which the warrant was sought because the affidavit referred only in general terms to defendant's residence and/or home. On that basis, the Sixth Circuit declared that the good faith exception did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The affidavit in this case clearly establishes the precise residence, and includes corroborated evidence that the residence in question is defendant's home. The question is whether the limited information connecting the criminal activity to the residence established a sufficient nexus. Given the facts of this case,\n   <em>\n    Laughton\n   </em>\n   is not instructive regarding whether the good faith exception applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The affidavit in this case connects defendant to the vehicle, the vehicle to the\n   house, and the house to defendant.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   confirms that these are the precise connections required to overcome the \"so lacking in minimal indicia\" test in order for the good faith exception to apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9209594\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/236/#p242\">\n    380 F.3d at 242-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
