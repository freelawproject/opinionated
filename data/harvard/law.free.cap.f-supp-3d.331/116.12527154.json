In September 2015, he was shot in the leg in his neighborhood in the Bronx, after which he was hospitalized for several days. Following his release from the hospital, Plaintiff was handcuffed and detained by officers of the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") and brought to a local police precinct. At the precinct, Plaintiff was interrogated by Defendant Detective David Terrell about the identity of Plaintiff's shooter. Plaintiff later sued Detective Terrell and the City of New York, bringing claims for false arrest and municipal liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1983\"). Defendants now move for summary judgment. Because it is undisputed that Detective Terrell was not involved in Plaintiff's arrest, summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's false arrest claim. And because Plaintiff points to no evidence in the record of a policy or custom by the City of New York to support his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, summary judgment is GRANTED on that claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Instead, it is merely one of multiple inferences that may be drawn.

If a non-arresting officer were to remove an arrestee from his cell to have him fingerprinted, for example, that officer might then be liable for false arrest. Or if an officer merely transports an arrestee from a precinct to central booking, that officer might be liable for false arrest. Plaintiff points to no legal authority that supports such a rule.

Detective Terrell's History of Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on Detective Terrell's alleged history of misconduct as evidence of a pattern or practice. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 77-87; Pl.'s Opp'n at 8-10. Specifically, Plaintiff describes a February 9, 2005 incident in which Detective Terrell falsely arrested Peter Thomas and used excessive force against him, SAC \u00b6 80; a June 2006 incident in which Detective Terrell \"falsely arrested and physically brutalized Taisha Carter,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81; a February 2009 incident in which Detective Terrell \"brutally assaulted\" a fifteen-year-old girl,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82; a March 2011 incident in which Detective Terrell \"brutalized Charmaine Dixon and her infant son, then falsely arrested Ms. Dixon and charged her with bogus crimes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83; a January 2012 incident in which Detective Terrell and other officers falsely arrested and \"brutalized\" a teenager,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84; and a June 2015 incident in which Detective Terrell \"made a false official statement and abused process by failing to show a search warrant,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. The false arrest allegations are stated in conclusory fashion, and the only evidence outside of the pleadings that Plaintiff cites to is a short excerpt of Detective Terrell's deposition testimony. In that testimony, Detective Terrell describes a 2009 incident in which he hit a fifteen-year-old girl twice and received no disciplinary action as a result. Nwokoro Decl., Ex. B at 62:3-63:22. No lawsuits, complaints, or claims resulted from that incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:16-63:3. This evidence is insufficient to support a claim that the City is liable for Plaintiff's false arrest here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Town of E.

Mar. 26, 2015) (\"[T]he fact that there were allegations of thirteen instances of excessive force during arrests over four years (none of which involved findings or admissions of culpability) during which hundreds, if not thousands, of arrests were made does not plausibly demonstrate that the use of excessive force during arrest was so frequent and pervasive as to constitute a custom\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even if these incidents were sufficient to establish a widespread pattern of misconduct by Detective Terrell, Plaintiff shows no causal link between that pattern and his arrest. As the Court has explained, Detective Terrell did not participate in Plaintiff's arrest, and the only constitutional violation for which Plaintiff has filed this suit is false arrest. And there is no evidence in this record to even hint that whatever past misconduct Detective Terrell is guilty of was the cause of Plaintiff's alleged false arrest in September 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4281667\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/895/526/#p531\">\n    895 F.Supp.2d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 85; ECF No. 90. Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 counterstatement incorporates both the statement of facts from Defendant's Rule 56.1 statement and Plaintiff's responses. Defendant's Rule 56.1 statement cites primarily to the allegations made in the second amended complaint (ECF No. 54) and does not contest those allegations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The parties' 56.1 statements contain limited facts.

Pl.'s Opp. at 5. Yet, Plaintiff has provided no evidence that Detective Terrell was personally involved in Plaintiff's detention, formal or otherwise. It is undisputed that, following the interrogation, Plaintiff was returned to his cell by Detective Terrell. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7. Plaintiff does not argue, however, that merely returning Plaintiff to his cell constituted false arrest. For the reasons noted above, such an argument would be unavailing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As discussed above, Plaintiff cites to the class action settlement in\n    <em>\n     Stinson\n    </em>\n    as evidence supporting his\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim. To the extent that Plaintiff relies on the Stinson settlement as evidence that the City was on notice of the practice of issuing unfounded summonses to fill quotas, that reliance is misplaced. The\n    <em>\n     Stinson\n    </em>\n    settlement was not approved until June 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273522\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/283/\">\n     256 F.Supp.3d 283\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Plaintiff's alleged false arrest occurred in September 2015-almost two years prior to the settlement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While Plaintiff only cites to the settlement in\n    <em>\n     Stinson\n    </em>\n    , the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to attach the actual settlement itself to the documents submitted to the Court. Further, the Court conducted additional research on the settlement and found that neither the settlement-which references earlier proceedings in the case-nor the earlier case proceedings contains reference to any substantiated claims against the NYPD through the Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") that would have effectively put the City of New York on notice regarding any potential constitutional violations on behalf of the NYPD. Although Plaintiff does not cite to any other earlier proceedings except the June 7, 2017 settlement, such earlier proceedings themselves and complaints associated therewith do not constitute the requisite \"actual or constructive notice\" necessary to establish the deliberate indifference for a\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harrison v.
