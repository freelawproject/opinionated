Dkt. No. 867. The jury awarded BladeRoom $10 million in lost profits damages, $20 million in unjust enrichment damages, and found by clear and convincing evidence that Emerson's misappropriation of trade secrets was willful and malicious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Emerson now moves for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). Dkt. No. 898. BladeRoom opposes the motion.

This measure of value is reflected in CUTSA's definition of what can constitute a \"trade secret,\" which makes no reference to novelty or complexity. Instead, a trade secret is \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.1\">\n    Cal.

Va. 2012), the plaintiff essentially alleged that a former customer disclosed its formula for a chemical soil additive to another manufacturer, which manufacturer then began to supply a competing product. Because the parties disagreed\n   about the extent of the products' similarity, the district court held the plaintiff needed expert testimony to explain issues outside the common knowledge of a juror, including \"the commonalities of the formulae, the likelihood that [plaintiff's] microbes would wind up in another manufacturer's product, and the inventive process by which a competitor would have created its product.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582806\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/771/\">\n    859 F.Supp.2d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than embodying a per se rule,\n   <em>\n    Trident Products\n   </em>\n   merely indicates that the need for expert testimony to prove a trade secret is determined on a case-by-case basis, like any other case arising under any other area of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 702 (providing that expert testimony is admissible if it \"will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The particular trade secret at issue in\n   <em>\n    Trident Products\n   </em>\n   - a chemical formula - and the conduct alleged to constitute misappropriation - the copying of the formula - make it understandable why a jury would need assistance from an expert to compare the two products; a visual comparison of the additive's components was impossible, and most jurors are not chemical engineers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With no expert testimony requirement, the real question for this case becomes whether the evidence submitted by BladeRoom to prove trade secret ownership was so far beyond the common knowledge of a layperson that the jury required the assistance of expert testimony? The answer to that question is no, because BladeRoom proved it owned Trade Secret 1 and Combination Trade Secret 8 with testimony from fact witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   BladeRoom's CEO, Paul Rogers, identified the trade secrets in their asserted forms and recounted at length how his experience with modular building techniques eventually led BladeRoom to develop \"throughout the course of 2011\" the technology that became BladeRoom's proprietary construction methods and designs for a warehouse-sized data center, including the subassemblies known as the \"chassis\" and the \"service cassette.\" Tr., Vol. 2, at 377:8-437:21; Tr., Vol. 3, 546:8-550:9. The assessment of whether Rogers was capable of creating these methods and designs is not outside the experience of a layperson. The jury, therefore, permissibly found that BladeRoom satisfied the predicate element of Civil Code \u00a7 3426.1(d) by showing it owned \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process\" without expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Testimony from Rogers and Barnaby Smith, one of BladeRoom's directors, also permitted the jury to find in BladeRoom's favor on the other two elements of Civil Code \u00a7 3426.1(d), and neither required expert testimony. On the topic of confidentiality, Rogers stated that BladeRoom maintains secrecy by using \"employment contracts ... written to protect [ ] confidential information;\" non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements with clients, suppliers, and distributors; and a computer system with password protection. Tr., Vol. 3, at 550:12-24. He also stated that BladeRoom does not maintain all of its confidential information \"in the same place,\" limits access to the business (\"We don't just let anybody just wander into our business normally.\"), and marks documents \"to be treated in confidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 550:24-551:16. Smith testified that BladeRoom protects the details of its product with non-disclosure agreements with clients and curates the amount of information disclosed on its website. Tr., Vol. 6, at 1285:16-1287:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to economic value, Rogers testified that no other company provides a similar data center product, and that the development of its confidential technology increased BladeRoom's sales from just under $50 million to just under $400 million. Tr., Vol. 3, at 552:19-553:4. In addition, Rogers identified several partners and clients who have utilized BladeRoom's confidential technology or purchased data centers incorporating the technology, including Metronade, Ark, and Mercedes Benz.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 551:17-552:8. Crediting the testimony of BladeRoom's witnesses as true, the jury's finding on trade secret ownership is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Emerson's arguments to the contrary do not alter this outcome. Most of them are improper invitations for the court to reweigh or determine the credibility of evidence presented to the jury. For example, Emerson argued at trial that BladeRoom's trade secrets were disclosed in patents.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr., Vol. 20, at 4170:23-24 (\"There is a mountain of patents, and we'll go through those later.\"); 4233:23-4234:4 (\"Every phrase, and these are page after page, the patents of BladeRoom system, protected by key patents, a patented revolutionary air cooling system.

First, BladeRoom's Rogers stated that despite efforts to keep the teams from Facebook and Emerson apart during their visits,\n   he received a subsequent email from Emerson's David Gerhart indicating the two teams nonetheless met while in the United Kingdom. Tr., Vol. 3, at 590:12-17. In fact, the meeting was arranged in advance, unbeknownst to Rogers. Trial Ex. No. 919; Tr., Vol. 9, at 1962:16-21. According to Emerson's Rebarber, one purpose of this meeting was to understand Facebook's \"level of interest and engagement in BladeRoom.\" Tr., Vol. 13, at 2808:7-9; Trial Ex. No. 880. Rebarber wrote in his notes, along with technical information describing BladeRoom's technology:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   This is facebook's second visit to BladeRoom.

Tim commented that they could get the BladeRooms manufactured, installed and in operation much earlier than the current planned structures would be available which has been in planning for a year with DPR and Fortis Construction.... Although Facebook says they are still evaluating BladeRoom, BladeRoom commented that they are in the quotation stage. Tim also mentioned that technically they are satisfied with BladeRooms approach and they are confident that BladeRoom could make some changes that facebook requires (potential elimination of DX back-up, ceiling height, cable tray management).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, Facebook's Tin Tse testified about a meeting between Facebook and Emerson in St. Louis in July, 2012. Tse agreed that though Emerson was \"starting from scratch\" with a modular data center product at the time, the purpose of the meeting was to determine whether Emerson could build a data center comparable to BladeRoom's product. Tr., Vol. 7, at 1448:7-9; 1449:10-15. Tse later wrote an email to his supervisor, Jay Park, on July 27, 2012, about his upcoming goals.

In one email from Emerson's Wilcox to Tse and others at Facebook from this time period, Wilcox specifically references \"the approach taken by others in the modular solution business (UK) that has the air-handler located at the end of the data halls to allow for stacked solutions.\" Trial Ex.

Tr., Vol. 7, at 1473:18-1474:7. The evidence showed that during the charrette, Tse presented the \"BladeRoom Solution,\" which presentation included parts of the proposal that BladeRoom made to Facebook for the construction of Lulea 2.

Emerson's Jon Carr emailed notes from the presentation meeting to Wilcox on October 31, 2012, which included the entry: \"Do not use the word 'Cassette' - This is Bladeroom terminology.\" Trial Ex.

BladeRoom's Rogers stated that after receiving BladeRoom's information, Emerson applied for patents based on BladeRoom's technology. Tr., Vol. 3, at 623:23-624:12. Emerson's Wilcox confirmed that Emerson's patents cover inventive aspects of Lulea 2, including the Unit I.T. and the sectional modularized air handling unit. Tr., Vol. 10, at 2126:16-2127:6; Trial Ex. No. 1260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Emerson's challenge to the misappropriation verdict - focused solely on improper use - collapses against the disclosure evidence, all of which independently supports the jury's finding. The jury's examination of disclosure by improper means did not require the assistance of an expert, and Emerson does not argue otherwise in this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In any event, the jury was also capable of analyzing evidence of improper use without technical expert testimony. The court has previously explained that a plaintiff need not undertake a patent infringement analysis to prove an improper use claim, because \" 'use' is not such an inflexible term when it comes to trade secret misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    BladeRoom Group Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20514923\">\n    2018 WL 514923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.

A layperson is able to compare Rogers' recitation of the trade secrets with the evidence describing Emerson's design and construction of Lulea 2 and determine whether Lulea 2 was \"substantially derived\" from the trade secrets, given Emerson's access to BladeRoom's confidential information and its prior lack of experience with a modular data center solution.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr., Vol. 10, at 2088:10-2113:17; Tr., Vol. 14, at 3029:23-3036:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Emerson's argument that BladeRoom failed to prove any element of a misappropriation or breach of contract claim neglects the substantial evidence recited above, all of which the jury could have used to establish the requisite elements. Emerson also invites the court to accept evidence it finds convenient to its position, reject contrary evidence, and draw inferences from the evidence in Emerson's favor. The court cannot do so on this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p149\">\n    530 U.S. at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p149\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, the absence of expert testimony does not undermine the substantial evidence supporting the jury's misappropriation verdict, all of which was within the reach of a layperson.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Emerson argues that in a case like this one involving the loss of a contractual opportunity, BladeRoom needed to show it would have obtained the contract for Lulea 2 from Facebook had Emerson not breached the confidentiality agreement or misappropriated its trade secrets. That framing is not completely accurate under California law, however, because it is not consistent with the cause-and-effect language of the substantial factor test. BladeRoom's burden was not to affirmatively prove it would have otherwise obtained the Lulea 2 contract, but rather to admit sufficient evidence upon which the jury could find that Emerson's conduct was a substantial factor in causing BladeRoom to lose or not be awarded the Lulea 2 contract. Though subtle, the distinction is important because the record shows that BladeRoom satisfied its burden under that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Facebook's Park testified that BladeRoom and Emerson were the only two companies being considered for the construction of Lulea 2. Tr., Vol. 9, at 1858:7-10. Moreover, the jury could reasonably infer from the testimony of Facebook's witnesses, Tse and Marco Magarelli, that only BladeRoom satisfied all of Facebook's design preferences, that Facebook was willing to work with BladeRoom's proposal submitted on July 20, 2012, and that Facebook was \"probably going to use BladeRoom for Lulea 2.\" Tr., Vol. 7, at 1525:23-1526:19; Tr., Vol. 12, at 2578:11-2579:1; Trial Ex. No. 1455. The jury could also infer from the evidence - including the short timeframe in which Emerson developed a modular solution and the subsequent, ongoing interactions between Facebook and Emerson after meeting with BladeRoom in the United Kingdom - that Emerson would not have otherwise been able to compete against BladeRoom in the two-business race for Lulea 2, and could not have submitted a winning proposal in October, 2012, had Emerson not misappropriated BladeRoom's confidential information. In sum, substantial evidence in the record supports the jury's finding that Emerson's conduct was a substantial factor in causing BladeRoom to lose the Lulea 2 contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Emerson's argument to the contrary is unpersuasive. For the most part, it employs a backwards Rule 50(b) analysis by citing to causation evidence in its favor but ignoring the evidence supporting the jury's verdict. As an example, Emerson relies on evidence suggesting Facebook was considering BladeRoom only for the data hall portions of Lulea 2, but overlooks that the jury could permissibly find that Emerson could not have competed with BladeRoom at all unless it submitted a design similar to BladeRoom's product for that portion of the data center. Trial Ex. No. 926; Tr., Vol. 8, at 1708:17-20. And because of that evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, Emerson's challenge to the amount of the unjust enrichment award falls apart. As Emerson itself recognizes, it was\n   <em>\n    Emerson's\n   </em>\n   burden to prove any portion of its earnings from Lulea 2 not attributable to BladeRoom's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 45 cmt. f (1995). To the extent Emerson presented evidence for the jury to parse its earnings between the data hall and other portions of that project, the jury was free to disbelieve it. It apparently did in some form, instead accepting evidence that Emerson would not have been compensated for Lulea 2 had it not used BladeRoom's trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Emerson also argues that BladeRoom \"terminated its longshot play\" for Lulea 2. But as the embellishment suggests, Emerson supports the argument with its own interpretation of cherry-picked evidence. The evidence was not undisputed on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Emerson argues it could not have used BladeRoom's confidential information in its proposal for Lulea 2 because, in its view, any contractual confidentiality restrictions expired on August 17, 2013. The court rejected that interpretation of the contract in an order filed during trial (Dkt. No. 839) and finds no reason to reconsider that issue for this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the jury's causation verdict is supported by substantial evidence, Emerson's Rule 50(b) motion on that topic must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Willful and Malicious Finding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Emerson's challenge to the jury's willful and malicious finding requires little discussion because it rests upon issues already decided by the court. Emerson argues BladeRoom \"never gave Emerson clear or fair notice regarding what precisely were the trade secrets.\" The court, however, found otherwise at summary judgment. Dkt. Nos. 493, 494. Nothing new is asserted now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Furthermore, Emerson's representation of \"massive differences between [BladeRoom's] standard offering and what Facebook asked Emerson to design and build\" does not cut against the verdict for two reasons. First, that statement embodies an evidentiary inference by Emerson adding no value to this motion. Second, it reflects a narrow approach to the types of evidence that can prove trade secret misappropriation. But as the court has explained, the jury could permissibly find misappropriation based on inferences drawn from the evidence, including inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence, even if Emerson's design for Lulea 2 was not an exact reproduction of BladeRoom's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 40 cmt. c (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, the court will not disturb the finding that Emerson engaged in willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Emerson argues the jury's damages awards are unsustainable because (1) the jury was not asked to apportion damages among the trade secrets, (2) the evidence of future lost profits was speculative, and (3) the amount of unjust enrichment is either a double-recovery or based on speculative evidence. These bases are each unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court has already considered, and rejected, the first basis. Dkt. No. 738. Relevant California authority does not require an apportionment of damages. In the absence of such a rule, BladeRoom's theory was not legally improper in the context of this case; that is, BladeRoom could argue that since its trade secrets encompass the designs and methods used to create parts of a unified structure, the misappropriation of any of the asserted trade secrets would have caused all of the damages it sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The second basis is equally unavailing. Emerson's argument focuses only on problems with the evidence of future lost profits, not the evidence of actual lost profits. Since the verdict does not specify which type of profits the jury awarded, and since the latter type could independently support the verdict, there is nothing gained from examining the sufficiency of the future lost profits evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The third basis similarly fails. Like lost profits, the jury was not asked to specify\n   the basis for the amount of unjust enrichment damages it awarded. As such, Emerson can only speculate exactly how the jury measured unjust enrichment, and certainly cannot show with any reasonable certainty that the jury double-counted \"Emerson's supposed operating profit\" from Lulea 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Furthermore, the court disagrees that BladeRoom's unjust enrichment evidence \"is contrary to the basic foundation of disgorgement damages in trade secret misappropriation matters.\" As the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   While the sale of Emerson Network Power may represent a unique form of unjust enrichment damages - it is not \"sales\" in the classic sense - no authority provides that an award cannot be made based on the sale of a business so long as causation and the fact of existing damages are proven. Furthermore, Emerson is in the better position to show any portion of the sale not attributable to the trade secret, which observation conforms to the purpose of the burden shifting occurring when unjust enrichment damages are at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Dkt. No. 850.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The unpublished opinion cited by Emerson,\n   <em>\n    Litton Systems, Inc. v. Ssangyong Cement Industrial Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20F.3d%2030\">\n    107 F.3d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1997), does not provide reasons to alter that analysis. There, the Federal Circuit understandably found the calculation of unjust enrichment damages \"unsupported in the law of unfair competition\" because the district court based it on an\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   stream of income. Here, the unjust enrichment evidence described\n   <em>\n    realized\n   </em>\n   profits from the sale of Emerson Network Power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In short, Emerson has not shown an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on any portion of the damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The standing of BladeRoom Group Ltd. is challenged for a third time. Addressing this issue twice before (Dkt. Nos. 191, 493), the court determined that BladeRoom Group Ltd. has standing since it possesses confidential information that could be misappropriated. Emerson raises nothing new, and its argument for judgment on this issue is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Emerson's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (Dkt. No. 898) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    In this order, \"BladeRoom\" refers to both BladeRoom Group Ltd. and Bripco (UK) Ltd.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The court understands Rebarber to reference Facebook's Tin Tse, rather than another individual named Tim Tse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
