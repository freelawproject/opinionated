His next hearing is scheduled for mid-November, at which time he will have been detained for over nine months. He now brings this petition for a writ of habeas corpus against the respondents: Thomas Decker,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kirstjen Nielsen,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Jefferson\n   B.

He seeks an order requiring the respondents to provide a bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . The respondents are ordered to provide a bond hearing or release the petitioner with in\n   <strong>\n    seven days\n   </strong>\n   of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dalbido Antonio Gil Cabral is a 26-year-old lawful permanent resident of the United States. (Pet. \u00b6 1.) He is from the Dominican Republic, but has lived in the United States since he was fourteen years old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)His mother (a lawful permanent resident), sister (a United States citizen), brother (a lawful permanent resident), grandfather, and partner all live here as well. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Pet. Ex. A \u00b6 3.) He is the father of one United States citizen child, and also serves a paternal role for his partner's three children, who are United States citizens. (Pet. \u00b6 21; Pet. Ex. A \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 22, 2018, the respondents transferred the petitioner to civil immigration detention. (Pet. \u00b6 2.) He was sent to the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey, and removal proceedings were initiated against him at the Executive Office for Immigration Review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26; Pet. Ex. B.) The respondents charged the petitioner as removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Under \u00a7 1226(c), the Government\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   detain a limited class of noncitizens without bond for the period of time while removal proceedings are pending. Certain crimes, known as \"crimes of moral turpitude,\" can be the basis for detention under \u00a7 1226(c). Two crimes of moral turpitude are required if that is the basis for removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the Government initially claimed that two of the petitioner's prior convictions - attempted robbery and turnstile jumping - satisfied that requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Ex. B.)On February 22, 2018, the petitioner appeared at his first immigration hearing. (Pet. \u00b6 28; Pet. Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)At that hearing, his case was adjourned to April 6, 2018. (Pet. \u00b6 28; Pet. Ex. A\u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 23, 2018, the petitioner filed a motion to terminate the immigration proceedings. (Pet. \u00b6 29.) He argued that a conviction for turnstile jumping was not a crime involving moral turpitude. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; Pet. Ex. F.)The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\")later filed a written opposition, (Pet. \u00b6 30), and the immigration judge adjourned the case until May 1, 2018, to consider the motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 13, 2018, DHS amended the petitioner's notice to appear to add an allegation that the petitioner was convicted of petit larceny - a misdemeanor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the May 1 hearing, the immigration judge declared that she would not make a formal ruling on the petitioner's motion to terminate because DHS had amended the notice to appear to include another purported crime of moral turpitude: the conviction for petit larceny. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) That same day, the immigration judge held a\n   <em>\n    Matter of Joseph\n   </em>\n   hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine whether the petitioner was properly subject to detention under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). (Pet. \u00b6 33; Pet. Ex. A \u00b6 8.) The petitioner argued that DHS was substantially unlikely to prevail on its charge that the petitioner is deportable. (Pet. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The immigration judge disagreed, holding the petitioner had not met his burden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The judge then adjourned the case until May 31, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 31, 2018, the immigration judge denied the petitioner's Amended Motion to Terminate Removal Proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) The immigration judge stated that she believed she was bound to conclude that a New York petit larceny conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The judge then scheduled a merits hearing for adjudication of the petitioner's applications for relief from removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The judge set the hearing for August 7, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the August 7 merits hearing, the petitioner was allowed to present only one witness. (Aug. 8, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, at 1, Dkt. No. 16.) The immigration court then continued the hearing to a date more than three months in the future: November 14, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )At the November 14 hearing, the petitioner will have spent over nine months in custody without a bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 14, 2018, the petitioner submitted a letter to notify the Court about a recently issued opinion from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"),\n   <em>\n    Matter of J. M. Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20420\">\n    27 I. &amp; N. Dec. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (B.I.A. 2018). (Sept. 14, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, Dkt. No. 21.) In that case, the BIA held that \"a conviction does not achieve finality for immigration purposes until the time for filing an initial direct appeal has expired under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of J. M. Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20420\">\n    27 I. &amp; N.

(Sept. 14, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, Dkt. No. 21.) The petitioner claims that this strengthens his arguments against removability but is likely to extend his already prolonged detention.

July 25, 2018).In this case, the weight of these factors tilt in favor of the need for a bond hearing for the petitioner at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the length of detention. The petitioner has already been detained for over seven months without a bond hearing. By his next hearing he will have been in detention for over nine months without any assurance that it will end at that time. (Aug. 8, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, at 1, Dkt. No. 16.) This length of time is within the range that this Court has found sufficient to show a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201176706\">\n    2015 WL 1176706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (eight months);\n   <em>\n    Faure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206143801\">\n    2015 WL 6143801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (detention would exceed nine months by the petitioner's next hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the party responsible for the delay. It does not appear that the petitioner has unreasonably delayed the proceedings. During the course of his detention, the petitioner has attended four calendar hearings. (Respondents' Mem. at 22.)He has filed a motion to terminate, an application for relief from removal, and a supplemental motion to terminate.(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23; Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 11-17.) But it does not appear that he ever requested a continuance or an adjournment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Mem. at 22-23; Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 11-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The most recent adjournment of the hearing from August 7, 2018, to November 14, 2018 - over three months - was occasioned because the immigration judge did not have sufficient time to hear all of the evidence on August 7. The respondents claim that the petitioner's continued detention is \"the natural and foreseeable consequence of his own decision to avail himself of further process.\" (Respondents' Mem. at 23.) But the petitioner should not be penalized for using procedural remedies available to him. At the argument of this motion, both parties agreed that there has been no showing of dilatory conduct by either party. This factor weighs in favor of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , whether the petitioner has asserted defenses. The petitioner here has asserted\n   several defenses to his removal, including asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. He also asserts that \u00a7 1226(c) does not apply because he has not committed crimes of moral turpitude. This factor weighs in the petitioner's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the time of detention as compared to the potential jail time for the underlying offense. The petitioner will have been in detention for over nine months at his next hearing date. (Aug. 8, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, at 1, Dkt. No. 16.) The underlying offenses here are attempted robbery in the second degree and petit larceny. For these crimes, the petitioner received a nine-month sentence for the attempted robbery and \"time served\" - for an unspecified length of time - for the petit larceny. The length of time that the respondent was incarcerated for the underlying crimes is not so long that it suggests that it is clear that the defendant is a danger to the community or a risk of flight so that a bond hearing would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , the penal nature of the detention facility. The petitioner has in fact been detained by the immigration authorities in a criminal detention facility. (Pet. \u00b6 35(\"Respondents have held Mr. Gil at the Bergen County Jail, in conditions identical to those of county jail inmates serving criminal sentences ....\").) This factor favors the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Sixth\n   </em>\n   , the nature of the crimes the petitioner committed. The underlying offenses for detention here are attempted robbery and petit larceny. The petitioner has also been convicted of turnstile jumping, criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminal trespass, intent to obtain transportation without paying, criminal possession of a weapon, and disorderly conduct. (Respondents' Mem. at 2-3.) Based on his multiple convictions, this factor weighs in favor of the respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Seventh\n   </em>\n   , whether the petitioner's detention is near conclusion. The petitioner's next hearing is rescheduled for November 14, 2018. (Aug. 8, 2018, Z. Jones Letter to the Court, at 1, Dkt. No. 16.)There is no assurance that the hearing will be concluded at that time. This factor weighs in the petitioner's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based upon all of these factors, the petitioner's continuing detention without a bond hearing is unreasonable. Therefore, due process requires the petitioner's release or a bond hearing to determine if the petitioner is a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p682\">\n    533 U.S. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p682\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Freedom from imprisonment-from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint-lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process Clause] protects.\").
