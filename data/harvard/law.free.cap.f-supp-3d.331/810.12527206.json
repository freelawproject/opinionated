Jane Magnus-Stinson, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Peter Daza, who is Hispanic, Native American, and over the age of forty, worked as a geologist for the State of Indiana Department of Transportation (\"\n   <em>\n    INDOT\n   </em>\n   \") from 1993 until his termination in 2015. Mr. Daza initiated this lawsuit in 2017, alleging that he was discriminated against based on his race, color, age, and \"political speech and association,\" and that his termination was in retaliation for complaining about discrimination and exercising his right to free speech and political association. Defendants the State of Indiana, INDOT District Deputy Commissioner Russell Fowler, INDOT District Human Resources Manager Nina Daniel, and INDOT Technical Services Director Valerie Cockrum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   have moved for summary judgment, [Filing No. 46 ], and that motion is now ripe for the Court's consideration. Also ripe for the Court's consideration is Defendants' Motion to Strike Surreply Arguments. [Filing No. 82.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO STRIKE MR. DAZA'S SURREPLY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before analyzing the substantive arguments Defendants raise in their Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court will consider Defendants' Motion to Strike Surreply Arguments. [Filing No. 82.] This is necessary because the motion relates to the scope of information that the Court could consider in deciding the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Daza filed a twenty-one page Surreply in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on June 8, 2018. [Filing No. 81.] Defendants move to strike portions of the surreply, arguing that those portions do not address Defendants' evidentiary objections but \"merely seek[ ] to respond to the Defendants' arguments....\" [Filing No. 82 at 2.] They assert that the portions they seek to strike \"rehash[ ] arguments [Mr. Daza] has already made, or attempt[ ] to further argue with points raised in the Defendants' reply brief.\" [Filing No. 82 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, Mr. Daza argues that the entire surreply addresses Defendants' objections to the evidence he submitted in response to the Motion for Summary Judgment, and so is appropriate. [Filing No. 84 at 3-4.] Mr. Daza also contends that Defendants' reply brief \"contains new arguments, and [he] has a right to file a Surreply to new arguments.\" [Filing No. 84 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Local Rule 56-1(d) permits the filing of a surreply \"only if the movant cites new evidence in the reply or objects to the admissibility of the evidence cited in the response.\" Defendants seek to strike pages 9 through 20 of Mr. Daza's Surreply, and the Court finds that some of the arguments contained in that section relate to Defendants' admissibility objections while others do not. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Strike Surreply Arguments to the extent that it will only consider arguments in Mr. Daza's Surreply that relate to the admissibility of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A motion for summary judgment asks the Court to find that a trial is unnecessary because there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and, instead, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant's factual assertion can result in the movant's fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court need only consider disputed facts that are material to the decision. A disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\n   <em>\n    Hampton v.

In other words, while there may be facts that are in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate if those facts are not outcome determinative.\n   <em>\n    Harper v. Vigilant Ins.

Cambridge Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9348876\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/892/#p901\">\n    325 F.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (7th Cir. 2003).

The Court need only consider the cited materials, Fed. R. Cv.

Evidentiary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before setting forth the facts relevant to the Motion for Summary Judgment and analyzing the parties' substantive arguments, the Court will consider the eight groups of evidence to which Defendants object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Defendants object to the \"Summary of Events\" and the \"Summary of Actions of Other Employees Showing Lack of Judgment and Bringing the Agency Into Disrepute\" that Mr. Daza submitted in connection with his response brief. [Filing No. 72-1; Filing No. 72-2.] They argue that the documents are not admissible evidence, lack any authentication, are based on hearsay, and are \"improper attempts to bypass the 35-page limit on response briefs.\" [Filing No. 78 at 2.] Mr. Daza argues that these documents are proper under Fed. R. Evid. 1006, which allows a party to \"use a summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court.\" [Filing No. 81 at 2 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 1006).] The Court will not consider the summaries provided at Filing No. 72-1 and 72-2, as the information contained in the summaries is also contained in other exhibits provided by Mr. Daza. The summaries are not of the type discussed in Rule 1006, but rather summarize other evidence submitted by Mr. Daza in a way that is favorable to Mr. Daza. The Court will consider the other evidence submitted by Mr. Daza (and referenced in the summaries) as appropriate, but will not consider the summaries themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Defendants object to portions of Mr. Daza's Affidavit, [Filing No. 72-3], as hearsay, outside Mr. Daza's personal knowledge, contradictory to Mr. Daza's emails or deposition testimony, and exceeding the scope of lay testimony. The objection is well-taken, and the Court will only consider portions of Mr. Daza's Affidavit that it finds are not hearsay, that include statements within Mr. Daza's personal knowledge, that do not contradict Mr. Daza's emails or deposition testimony, and that do not exceed the scope of lay testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, Defendants object to messages from nonparties, because they are hearsay and lack authentication. [Filing No. 78 at 3-4 (objecting to Filing No. 72-5; Filing No. 72-6; Filing No. 72-7; Filing No. 72-8; Filing No. 72-9; and Filing No. 72-10).] To the extent the messages discuss the basis for Mr. Daza's termination and his contributions to INDOT, Defendants object for lack of personal knowledge. Mr. Daza responds that the messages are authenticated by Mr. Daza's testimony that he personally received the messages, and that they are offered to corroborate his testimony that he was well-liked by other employees. [Filing No. 81 at 6.] The Court finds that there are authentication issues with the messages. For example, Filing Nos. 72-5, 72-6, and 72-7 appear to be screenshots of text messages, but Mr. Daza did not submit an affidavit authenticating the messages, nor did he specify for the Court where in his deposition testimony\n   he testified regarding the specific messages. In any event, the Court discusses the messages to which Defendants object below, and concludes that they are not relevant to the issue of whether Defendants discriminated against Mr. Daza or retaliated against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fourth, Defendants object to several newspaper articles Mr. Daza submits, [Filing No. 72-16; Filing No. 72-25; Filing No. 72-34; and Filing No. 72-35], because \"newspaper articles offered for the truth of what they report are inadmissible hearsay.\" [Filing No. 78 at 4 (citation and quotation omitted).] Mr. Daza responds that the articles are not offered for their truth, but rather \"as evidence of the disrepute that other employees brought to the agency.\" [Filing No. 81 at 6.] As with the messages discussed above, the Court discusses below why the newspaper articles - even if they are considered - do not help to save Mr. Daza's claims from summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fifth, Defendants object to certain documents, [Filing No. 72-23; Filing No. 72-32; Filing No. 72-68], that they argue Mr. Daza has used in violation of a protective order entered in Mr. Daza's appeal of his termination before the State Employees' Appeals Commission (\"\n   <em>\n    SEAC\n   </em>\n   \"). [Filing No. 78 at 4 (referencing Filing No. 78-1).] The protective order limits the use of personnel documents and information relating to certain individuals to use in Mr. Daza's appeal before the SEAC. [Filing No. 78-1 at 3.] Mr. Daza responds that this case \"is a continuation of\" the SEAC proceeding. [Filing No. 81 at 7.] The Court has already found that Mr. Daza's use of the documents does not violate the protective order, [Filing No. 85 ], so considers the documents in connection with Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sixth, Defendants object to the Facebook feed of a nonparty, Logan Mort-Jones, because it has not been authenticated, is inadmissible hearsay, and is irrelevant. [Filing No. 78 at 4.] Mr. Daza responds that Defendants do not specify how the Facebook feed is \"not authentic,\" nor do they dispute that \"the Facebook feed is that of Mort-Jones.\" [Filing No. 81 at 8.] The Court agrees with Defendants, and finds that the Facebook feed document is not authenticated and is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Seventh, Defendants object to a Report from the Indiana Inspector General regarding Troy Woodruff, [Filing No. 72-36], because it \"is impermissible character evidence, is unfairly prejudicial to the Defendants, is inadmissible hearsay, and is irrelevant.\" [Filing No. 78 at 4-5.] Mr. Daza responds that the report \"is evidence that Woodruff brought disrepute to the agency, by being investigated for possible criminal violations but was not warned, counseled, disciplined, suspended, or terminated, whereas Daza, who was not accused of any criminal violation, was terminated for bringing disrepute to the agency, which was a false allegation against him.\" [Filing No. 81 at 8.] To the extent Mr. Daza relies upon Mr. Woodruff as a comparator, the Court will consider this evidence below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendants object to a document that purports to be the Twitter feed of T.J. Brink, [Filing No. 72-73], because it has not been authenticated, is inadmissible hearsay, is unfairly prejudicial, and is irrelevant. [Filing No. 78 at 5.] Mr. Daza argues that Defendants do not make a specific objection as to how the document is not authentic, do not dispute that it is the Twitter feed of Mr. Brink, and do not make \"any specific effective objection.\" [Filing No. 81 at 9.] As discussed below, the Court considers this evidence but ultimately concludes that it is not relevant to Mr. Daza's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following factual background is set forth pursuant to the standards detailed above. The facts stated are not necessarily objectively true, but as the summary judgment standard requires, the undisputed facts and the disputed evidence are presented in the light most favorable to \"the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Premcor USA, Inc. v. American Home Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173362\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/523/#p526\">\n    400 F.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526-27 (7th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. 1993-2010\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Daza began working as a geologist for INDOT in June 1993. [Filing No. 72-11 at 4-5.] Along with his duties as a geologist, Mr. Daza was the supervisor of the Independent Assurance Program, which is a federally-mandated program that requires certain qualifications for individuals to conduct testing of construction materials. [Filing No. 72-11 at 4.] In March 2006, Mr. Daza's position was reclassified to a Geologist 2 and he received a 15% salary increase. [Filing No. 72-3 at 2.] Mr. Daza's supervisor told him at the time that the pay increase was due to his excellent performance. [Filing No. 72-3 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September 2009, former Republican Indiana State Representative Troy Woodruff was appointed as District Deputy Commissioner (\"\n   <em>\n    DDC\n   </em>\n   \") of the Vincennes District of INDOT where Mr. Daza worked. [Filing No. 72-3 at 4-5.] In August 2010, Mr. Woodruff was promoted to INDOT Chief of Operations, and Russell Fowler, a personal friend of Mr. Woodruff, was appointed as DDC of the Vincennes District. [Filing No. 72-3 at 5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. 2011: Mr. Daza Complains Regarding Treatment of Terry Goff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2011, Director Shane Spears told Mr. Daza to talk to an INDOT employee that Mr. Daza supervised, Terry Goff, because INDOT's Human Resources Manager (a Republican and the wife of the Knox County Republican Party Chairperson) had inquired regarding Mr. Goff's Facebook page and commented that she had heard it contained political posts. [Filing No. 72-4 at 1-2; Filing No. 72-11 at 39.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On August 9, 2011, Mr. Goff complained to INDOT Director Valerie Cockrum regarding not receiving a promotion. [Filing No. 72-18.] Mr. Goff wrote in an email to Ms. Cockrum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   To no surprise, I was informed of the decision on filling the ETS slot in our department. I feel that I need to meet with Rusty to discuss a few things. Brent knows how I feel and I wanted to follow a chain of command before talking to Rusty.... On kind of the same note, I wanted to talk to you about the actions of [one of the interviewers] during my interview. I had already discussed this issue with [Mr. Daza] and decided I would not say anything until after the selection was made. He basically asked me to follow through you instead of confronting her directly. During the interview, she was texting on her phone. I asked Brent if he saw it and he did not. She was sitting to my left and had her phone in her lap where neither of you would have seen it. The problem with that is that shows a total lack of respect and should have never taken place. I went through the exact same thing when I interviewed...for the ETS slot previous and again something like this takes place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I in no way want you to think that I am upset with your or Brent. It just feels like I do an excellent job and keep getting kicked in the face and it is really hard to keep doing a good job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [Filing No. 72-18 at 1-2.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ms. Cockrum responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Terry, I hear what you are saying about not being selected for the position and I appreciate you following the chain of command. No, I didn't see [the interviewer] texting during the interview but will follow up on that. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [Filing No. 72-18 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On August 14, 2011, Mr. Daza sent a lengthy email to Ms. Cockrum regarding Mr. Goff not receiving the promotion for which he had applied. [Filing No. 72-19.] Mr. Daza set forth why he thought Mr. Goff was a good candidate, and why he was the \"logical and best choice\" for a prior promotion. [Filing No. 72-19 at 1.] He also discussed his belief that Mr. Goff did not get the promotion, and other past promotions, because he is a Democrat, stating in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Now why is Terry so poisonous? Because he is a Democrat. Terry was well connected in the Democrat party but what did he get for it. Let's see, the Democrats were in power for 16 years and Terry got an entry level job 19 years ago, that's it. No promotions, no big raises. He's not even the highest paid tech. As a matter-of-fact he is way underpaid. I am not na\u00efve. I have been in INDOT for 18 years. Politics has always been played but not really in promotions in Testing, just entry level.... The only other opportunity for Terry was the Prestressed/Steel Supervisor job. Terry was the best choice. I know the man picked has experience in the steel industry and will probably be ok but the few promotions available to Testing shouldn't be handed outside our Department if we have suitable candidates from within and we had one excellent candidate, the best in the Department. You can't go around slapping our best tech in the face multiple times (which you have done twice) and expect him to take it. We're going to lose him or at least you will ruin him. He'll stop caring or trying. You want Testing to run on a skeleton crew. We can pull it off as long as you allow us to put the right people in the right slots, but you guys can't keep from interfering. And all because of one reason, Terry's politics. Mark quit in part because of this crap. Mark is a Republican and you guys couldn't help but screw with him too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [Filing No. 72-19 at 1-2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Cockrum responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I will keep this to myself and won't forward unless you want me to for some reason. I always appreciate your total honesty Pete. And, your support for Terry is commendable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [Filing No. 72-19 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On August 15, 2011, Mr. Goff emailed Mr. Fowler, DDC of the Vincennes District, regarding not receiving the promotion for which he had applied. [Filing No. 72-20 at 2-4.] Mr. Goff outlined his qualifications and accomplishments while at INDOT. Mr. Goff then wrote, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   My job performance has not been affected by the party holding office. I have continued to educate myself and be an asset to INDOT. Politics should not be the deciding factor when promotions come up. And NO political party should be proud of hiring or promoting under-qualified staff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I am neither a woman, a person of color, American Indian or any other minority but I am sure I am being discriminated against because of my political affiliation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I am certain I was the most qualified of the internal applicants and I am 95% sure I was selected. So why would I continue to be the BEST technician in our department when being the best gets you absolutely no where (sic)? I ask you this......Did our Civil service training mean nothing? During the Training, it was stated that \"evaluations are heavily weighed when a promotion is being considered\".. (sic) obviously the Vincennes District is exempt from this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [Filing No. 72-20 at 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Fowler responded to Mr. Goff, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   I certainly understand disappointment when not being selected for a position - many of us can relate to that. A common misconception is that INDOT experience makes a candidate a \"shoe-in\" for a position. In fact, other things impact the decision: communication, team skills, personality, attitude, capability, performance, etc.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   I respect the fact that you have done very well in department ratings and pay for performance - that is commendable.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   While I cannot speak specifically for my predecessors - as I was not privy to the references in your e-mail - I have the utmost confidence that they made the best decisions for the agency at the time as required.

I will leave it to you guys to decide what his level should be, but it's not outstanding and I would question if it should be exceeds either.\" [Filing No. 72-21 at 2.] Mr. Goff's performance appraisal ultimately reflected an overall rating of \"Exceeds Expectations.\" [Filing No. 72-11 at 8; Filing No. 72-23 at 7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. 2012-2013: Mr. Daza is Disciplined for Complaining About Phone Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In May 2012, Mr. Woodruff was promoted to Chief of Staff at INDOT. [Filing No. 72-3 at 5.] In 2013, due to heavy construction on the I-69 corridor through the Vincennes District, the District was especially busy. [Filing No. 49-21 at 2.] As a result, Mr. Fowler informed his subordinates that anyone with an INDOT-issued cell phone would be required to be available for phone calls after regular business hours to ensure that construction could continue without delays. [Filing No. 49-21 at 2.] This was not an expectation that INDOT employees be on call 24/7. [Filing No. 49-24 at 5.] Mr. Daza complained about the directive, and explained to employees that it was not part of his job to work overtime or work on the weekends, \"like construction and emergency personnel did.\" [Filing No. 72-3 at 13-14.] About a week after Mr.\n   Daza made those statements, his supervisor at the time, Brent Schmitt, asked him to answer calls after hours. [Filing No. 72-3 at 13.] Mr. Daza ultimately complied and answered calls after hours, for which he received no additional compensation. [Filing No. 72-3 at 14.] INDOT issued a Written Reprimand, in which Mr. Schmitt described Mr. Daza's unacceptable behavior as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   On March 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2013 Pete Daza and I sat down to discuss comments that he made at the spring construction conference for I-69. During the construction conference Mr. Daza made the statement that he would not follow the expectation of carrying his state issued cell phone after hours, set forth by the Vincennes DDC Rusty Fowler. I informed Mr. Daza that his expression of defiance in front of the employees he supervises, the members of the construction staff, and other directors did not exhibit the professional and leadership qualities that are expected of a supervisor in this department and agency. I informed Mr. Daza that the expectation to have his cell phone on him for urgent matters after hours was an expectation from both Rusty and I. Mr. Daza then repeatedly informed me he would not follow the expectation set forth by Mr. Fowler and that I could not make him. This defiant and insubordinate behavior is not acceptable nor does it reflect the core four principles that all employees of this agency are expected to exhibit, especially supervisors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [Filing No. 72-26.] The Written Reprimand is signed by Mr. Daza.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In August 2013, the\n   <em>\n    Indianapolis Star\n   </em>\n   published a story entitled \"INDOT official benefited from his and his family's sales of land along I-69 route,\" which discusses Mr. Woodruff's sale of a piece of land to the state as part of the I-69 expansion project.

[Filing No. 72-29 at 3.] Mr. Daza responded that Mr. Goff ultimately came in to plow, so would not need a doctor's note, and that Mr. Goff \"is allowed one mandatory OT refusal in a six month period so he is going to use it.\" [Filing No. 72-29 at 3.] Mr. Daza also emailed Ms. Cockrum and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   If someone has a medical reason they cannot plow and they have a doctor's excuse how can a refusal be issued? If you get two refusals disciplinary action is warranted. So if Terry were to have the flu, let's say, and he was called to plow again and couldn't they will issue a second refusal and write him up? Valid medical reasons should not subject the employee to refusals and consequently disciplinary action. If you extrapolate this out he could ultimately be fired if he continually was sick over a course of a snow event. Is it our position that Terry should know when a snow event is to occur, and since it is his duty to plow, only get sick when the weather is good? How dare he have an illness during snow season? Look at how we treat our people. Maintenance is out of control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [Filing No. 72-29 at 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Ms. Cockrum responded that she would \"find out what the directive is on this today,\" and later emailed Mr. Daza and wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Yes, a doctor's excuse may not exclude an individual from plowing snow. A doctor's excuse may not necessarily exclude the individual from receiving a first notice of refusal. However, a doctor's excuse could exclude an individual from disciplinary action if his/her condition was serious enough to warrant work restrictions which would include snow plowing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Although Terry received a corrective action form for his first refusal, he will not receive a penalty (Written Reprimand).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Also, someone in upper management saw Terry at a ballgame in Richmond Saturday so that is not helping the perception of the situation because the thought is \"if he could drive on Saturday what happened on Sunday?\" I know that may be out of context as to actual events but that is the general feeling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [Filing No. 72-29 at 1-2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Mr. Daza responded to Ms. Cockrum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   An illness can happen suddenly. Just because an individual is fine on one day doesn't mean he is faking it if an illness\n   strikes the next. The last time he had a shingles outbreak he had a rash for several days he commented on before he finally went to the doctor. By the time he went the rash had increased in severity and was quite painful so, to address the comment below, you could have saw him out for several days appearing ok then overnight he is incapacitated. None of this is out of the realm of possibility and since no one is a medical doctor within INDOT and therefore not qualified to make such judgments, people's \"general feelings\" should not play into any evaluation of the situation when medical issues are concerned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [Filing No. 72-29 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Later that same day, Human Resources Manager Nina Daniel emailed Jeff Sullivan\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding Mr. Daza. [Filing No. 72-30.] Ms. Daniel wrote that Brent Schmitt had discussed with her several issues regarding Mr. Daza, most of which were behavioral.

I think the back story is that Pete was up for or wanted the position that Brent now holds. Pete was not qualified because he does not have a[n] engineer's license. Everyone agrees that Pete is more knowledgeable than Brent in some areas, even Brent acknowledges this. However, I find Brent to be very personable, in tuned and onboard with where SPD and INDOT are moving toward culturally. He's a smart young man that will eventually grow into the position with the right support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Yesterday Rusty [Fowler] asked me to sit in on a discussion about Pete.

Everyone seems exhausted with the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   My take is if he is salvageable than we need a CTI meeting. We need to set specific expectations about his behavior and what that should look like. All three state that this has been addressed with Pete and while his behavior seems to improve for a few weeks it doesn't take long for it to tank again. I then offer that they should just have a frank discussion with Pete and ask if he is happy here. If he says \"Yes\" than (sic) we set guidelines and expectations for him to continue in his current position. If he says \"No\" we ask why. If his reasons are things we can help correct we make a plan, if not, we help him form an exit strategy. All respond that sometimes Pete will simply shutdown and not give any input. My understanding is this has happened twice. I suggested that if that happens we simpl[y] tell Pete that we are giving him an opportunity to express his thoughts and that a decision will be made with or without his input. We prefer he has input.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   So, here's my/our question to you. If Pete is not happy or if the final decision is that this position is not the \"right fit\" does Pete have any options for moving to another district?

What options are there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Side note: I have very little on file discipline wise.

People needing respirators are to be fitted in order to receive the proper safety benefit. TJ was very upset and stated he thought Pete had purposely checked the respirators out knowing it was prohibited to do so. I pointed out the respirators had been checked out prior to the respirator portion of the OSHA training by one day but would take care of notifying people to not use them and to return them if they had checked one out recently. TJ was not happy with Pete's behavior or responses to TJ's questions during the OSHA training. He felt that Pete's attitude towards him was poor and that Pete was a bad influence on Clint Morgan. Clint works with Pete in the Testing Department. We talked about Clint as well and how he responded to one of TJ's questions during the training.

[Filing No. 72-11 at 13-14.] When Mr. Daza arrived at the training, he thought that the trainer, Sheryl Proctor, did not like him and gave him \"dirty looks.\" [Filing No. 72-11 at 13.] Mr. Daza \"engaged in the training,\" [Filing No. 72-3 at 11], although he did \"close[ his] eyes from time to time without reading glasses, and...did not say much,\" [Filing No. 72-3 at 22]. Mr. Daza's then-supervisor, Testing Engineer Bill Tompkins, was sitting at the same table as Mr. Daza at the training, and did not notice anything \"out of the ordinary\" or inappropriate. [Filing No. 72-12 at 3-5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Ms. Proctor wrote down her observations from the first day of training. [Filing No. 72-55.] She stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Pete arrived at the same time with Bill and Tim. Britni and I exchanged introductions with the group. Bill and Tim engaged in conversation, but Pete said nothing other than his name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   During the training, Pete frequently leaned back in his chair with his arms crossed over his chest. He did not take notes or follow along too often in the binder of handouts. Several times he closed his eyes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Incident to be reported: Participants were asked to take a 5x8 card and write a brief recognition note that they would deliver verbally to someone the next day. They were told that we would share these notes with a partner for discussion. Pete sat with arms folded and did not participate. All 29 other participants were writing. Since his table had 5 people, I moved over to pair up with someone during the partner activity portion. I paired with Pete's boss Bill Tompkins. Pete was paired with his peer, Tim Mercker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   I was eager to observe how Pete might participate since he wrote nothing on a card. Even though I was working with my partner, I glanced at Pete and heard him say to Tim, \"This is f___ing gay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I could not hear his partner's response, but his partner did go on to share the recognition he had written.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Once I finished with my partner, I turned to Pete (both others could hear me) and asked \"I noticed you didn't write a recognition note, is there a reason why?\" He replied (paraphrased) \"I don't need to do this. I tell my guys when they do a good job. It's all in my head. Why do I need to write it down?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   His supervisor, Bill, said, \"That's right, Pete is good at giving feedback to his guys.\" I asked Peter how many direct reports he had and he said \"Three\". Bill then added, \"Actually he oversees way more than that and he does a good job with all of them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   At that point, the training resumed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Additional note: Pete again had his eyes closed when the facilitator asked participants\n   to pull out the evaluation form to complete. He 'woke up' while everyone was writing, looked around, but did not pull out the form to complete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   [Filing No. 72-55.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Heather Devocelle, Ms. Proctor's supervisor, emailed Ms. Proctor's notes to Eric Kleinert,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stated \"Here is one page of notes regarding Pete. I would like to have this addressed and I'm trying to determine best next steps. I don't want Pete coming to Day 2 'as is' so I need to work quickly. Who should I work with? Vincennes and Seymour share Bill Tompkins and then he reports to Val and Becky. These folks sit in Vincennes though. Thanks for your help.\" [Filing No. 49-12 at 1.] The email eventually reached Mr. Fowler, who forwarded it to Ms. Cockrum and Ms. Daniel and wrote \"Please see attachment. We need to sit down with Nina on Monday &amp; determine next steps. This behavior from Pete, as a supervisor, &amp; reinforcement from Bill, as his Supervisor, troubles me greatly. To say my patience is worn thin with Pete is grossly understated.\" [Filing No. 49-12 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   On December 7, 2015, Ms. Daniel emailed Employee Relations Specialist Suzanne Kent and Mr. Kleinert regarding Mr. Daza's behavior at the training session. [Filing No. 72-60 at 10-11.] Ms. Daniel wrote, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Mr. Daza is a Geologist 2 for the Vincennes District. While his work ethic and knowledge cannot be denied; his behavior and attitude have been called in to question several times. Mr. Daza's inappropriate behavior was brought to my attention as early as 2/18/14, the day after I arrived in the district.... Pete's then manager, Brett Schmitt, submitted his resignation soon after on 4/10/14. Pete's behavior was not addressed by Mr. Schmitt and later discussions with Pete brought Mr. Schmitt's performance as a manager in to question. Pete's behavior did improve, but continued to be on the edge of arrogant and insubordinate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   On the Monday before the final issue brin[g]ing this cause of action, Pete's Director, Valerie Cockrum, had a discussion with Pete in which she specifically warned him about \"creating a situation with another employee\"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   You will also find attached Pete Daza Observation Notes, which are a recount of Mr. Daza's actions during Beyond the Appraisal training on 12/2/15. Additionally I have attached his Written Reprimand from 3/11/13..., Disciplinary Action Justification Form (Pete Daza 12-7-15) and a copy of his 2013 Appraisal which notes Pete's abrasiveness in relating to other employees.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Although Pete has attended Core4 training, as well as, Act1 training, he continues to exhibit behavior which is not in line with the Culture and professional expectations of INDOT managers. It is the feeling of Rusty, Val and myself that Pete willfully refused to participate in training, used derogatory language, and was disrespectful to his instructors. His behavior is neither modeled nor condoned by the Vincennes Leadership team and can no longer be tolerated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 10-11 (emphasis omitted).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Ms. Kent responded to Ms. Daniel as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   In review of the information..., the following are my suggestions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   1. The discipline policy provided is a good resource, but note that it is for classified employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   2. Make sure that you are consistent with discipline policies across the district. Have others used derogatory language, not participated in training or crossed their arms during training as we have noted with Pete? If this has happened with other employees, how were they disciplined?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   3. His performance appraisals are very good and there has been no discipline issued for his unprofessional demeanor and insubordination since 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   4. Was Clint disciplined for any inappropriate behavior during the OSHA training? Why was Clint to apologize to TJ if he didn't do anything wrong? Are you wanting to terminate because he refused to admit the incident and apologize to TJ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   His actions dot (sic) contravene public policy and he can be terminated at any time without just cause. But, I would advise that we continue to be consistent with levels of discipline for the same behavior. It would be our recommendation that we give a 3 day or 5 day suspension for his language and unprofessional behavior with documentation in writing that any further behavior of this kind would result in termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 10.] Ms. Daniel responded to several of the questions Ms. Kent asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   2.... We have not terminated an employee for displaying the specific behaviors listed in this item, but have terminated an employee for a continued pattern of negative behavior, which did not conform to INDOT culture. We feel that Pete shows a continued pattern of negative behavior, which has been brought to his attention on several occasions and yet he refuses to change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   3.... True, his appraisal are very good and as mentioned earlier [his] work ethic and job knowledge are above reproach. However, his continued poor interpersonal behavior leaves much to be desired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   4.... Neither Clint nor Pete were disciplined for this action. The note was to serve as another instance where Pete was notified that his behavior was less than acceptable. The fact that two days after this discussion he displayed this type of behavior in a training session seems to be an explanation point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 10.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In the same string of emails, Mr. Fowler wrote to Ms. Daniel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   I have given this great consideration. Mr. Daza is a leader within INDOT. With that authority, comes great responsibility - to model the behaviors that we expect of all employees. His behavior at the training presented by the Talent Management Group last Wednesday was unacceptable; language aside, he sent a clear message that he did not want to be there, &amp; was not going to participate - to the trainers and other attendees. It must be noted that while his performance has been historically good, in fact above meets last FY, this incident rises to critical level from a cultural standpoint. We disciplined Mr. Daza in 2013 for failure to live up to Core4 expectations as a supervisor - for exhibiting defiance and below the line behavior in a meeting, not unlike last week. Mr. Daza was informed at that time that this type of behavior was unacceptable &amp; that future incidents would lead to further action - potentially dismissal. While I understand the recommendation for suspension, it shows a level of acceptance of this behavior - that it is ok to behave in this manner as a supervisor, and quite frankly, it is not. I am willing to accept the possibility of\n   SEAC review. For the reasons noted, I wish to proceed with termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 9.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Ms. Daniel responded to Mr. Fowler \"If we do decide to do a 5 day hard suspension and not terminate it is Val's feeling (and I agree) that Pete no longer manage anyone.\" [Filing No. 72-60 at 6.] Mr. Fowler replied \"I don't know where we would put him where he wouldn't supervise people. Also, I'm not sure that his influence on others will improve. I still feel termination is the right action.\" [Filing No. 72-60 at 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Ms. Kent wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   On point # 2 you state that this pattern of negative behavior has been brought to Pete's attention on several occasions. Has this been in writing and with progressive discipline each time the negative behavior has been expressed? I think this is the part where we are trying to get the agencies on board with disciplining accordingly during the entire process, instead of what appears to be jumping from a written reprimand to termination. The gap of prior discipline until now can put the agency at a greater risk for having the employee come back with a CS complaint that would potentially have to be settled. It is up to the agency's discretion on the next step of discipline, but we feel a 3 or 5 day suspension prior to termination would be the better next step so that it is in writing and he is notified with written documentation vs. verbal communication only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Ms. Daniel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   You're absolutely on point. The discussions have not been documented with progressive discipline. I have reviewed with Val and will be reviewing with Rusty. Val understands the lack of formal corrective action and would support a 5 day suspension. She was also adamant that she no longer wants him to have any supervisory responsibilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 3.] Ms. Daniel also wrote to Mr. Kleinert:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   Should a termination be supported we plan to emergency suspend Pete and address this termination on Thursday after the I-69 ribbon cutting with the Governor. While none of us feel that Pete would be violent we also do not want to risk that he would show up and disrupt the ceremony in any way. We would also need to do this to keep him out of the 12/9 training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   [Filing No. 72-60 at 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Also on December 7, 2015, Mr. Daza sent an email to various INDOT employees under his supervision stating that he had nominated them for \"spot bonuses\" for their work in \"successfully implementing a pavement evaluation SOP to determine whether roads should receive pavement preservation treatments.\" [Filing No. 72-58 at 1.] Mr. Daza had notified employees in the past when he had nominated them for spot bonuses. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 72-39 at 2; Filing No. 72-43.] While notifying employees of their nominations did not violate INDOT policy, Mr. Daza acknowledged that spot bonuses are \"supposed to be a surprise\" and that not ultimately receiving the spot bonus after being made aware of the nomination \"fosters hard feelings and resentment.\" [Filing No. 72-11 at 56; Filing No. 72-58 at 1.] Ms. Daniel forwarded the email from Mr. Daza to the employees to Mr. Kleinert, and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   I thought I'd share this with you as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   Pete did not include his Director, Val Cockrum, in the original email, but it was cc'ed to her when [one of the nominated employees] responded. Since Val worked with Pete on the justification for this bonus I think she felt it was a bit underhanded and passive aggressive for\n   Pete to send out such an email when they had not settled on an appropriate bonus amount. Now how is management going to look if the bonus amount is changed or if the bonus has to be denied?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   This is typical behavior from Pete. All bonuses have been approved for Testing since I have been here with the exception of two. One was a $250.00 bonus for an employee who decorated their office for Christmas and the other was for employees who did some landscaping around the office area. Therefore, Pete has nothing historical to base[ ] his \"if the nomination is denied\" statement on. Additionally, he knew the bonus was preapproved although the amount had not been settled on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   [Filing No. 49-8 at 1.] Mr. Kleinert responded \"100% concur w/ Val.

[Filing No. 72-3 at 21.] When Mr. Daza asked Ms. Cockrum why, she said she did not know and refused to give him any other information. [Filing No. 72-3 at 21.] After speaking with Ms. Cockrum, Mr. Daza asked Mr. Fowler what was happening but he would not give Mr. Daza any information and said that he would meet with Mr. Daza at 3:00 p.m. on December 10, 2015. [Filing No. 72-3 at 21.] On December 9, 2015, Britni Saunders (one of Ms. Devocelle's subordinates) emailed Ms. Devocelle to let her know that Mr. Tompkins had asked her and Ms. Proctor why Mr. Daza would not be attending the second day of training. [Filing No. 49-7 at 3.] She wrote, in part, \"I...shared my observations from that day [of training] of his lack of professionalism, disrespect and lack of engagement. I also mentioned that this behavior had also occurred in a recent Core4 class Pete had participated in. I described this incident as well.... It was clear in our conversation with Bill that he sees Pete as 'one of his best employees' and he is confused about why he would behave in this way when he had had so much leadership training and is such a competent worker.

[Filing No. 72-3 at 23.] He told Ms. Kent that he believed he might be terminated based on a trainer's complaint and that the trainer had a problem with his ethnicity. [Filing No. 72-3 at 23.] Instead of stating that she would investigate Mr. Daza's complaint of discrimination, Ms. Kent told him to go to the meeting scheduled for later that day.

While the Court assumes that his discrimination and retaliation claims based on his political affiliation are brought under the First Amendment, his race and color discrimination and retaliation claims are brought under Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and his age discrimination and retaliation claims are brought under the ADEA, Mr. Daza also references the Fourteenth Amendment in his Amended Complaint, but does not specify what type of Fourteenth Amendment claim he is making. The Court understands Mr. Daza's reference to the Fourteenth Amendment to be a reference to the application of the First Amendment to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court notes that any Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claims would fail for the same reasons his claims under the First Amendment, Title VII, \u00a7 1981, and the ADEA fail. The Court does not discern a Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim from the allegations in the Amended Complaint or in Mr. Daza's Statement of Claims.

Defendants argue that it is not enough for Mr. Daza to merely show that he is a Democrat, and that in any event Mr. Daza admits that he does not know the political affiliation of any of the Defendants, and has never heard any of them express negative opinions about the Democratic Party. [Filing No. 50 at 12.] Defendants also argue that Mr. Daza's defense of Mr. Goff is not constitutionally protected, and that there is no evidence that it factored into the decision to terminate Mr. Daza. [Filing No. 50 at 12-16.] Finally, Defendants contend that there is no evidence that Mr. Daza's mother's letter to the editor played any role in Mr. Fowler's decision to terminate Mr. Daza, that the evidence shows that Mr. Fowler - the decisionmaker - did not even know about the letter, and that Mr. Daza's theory that the letter played a role in his termination is based on pure speculation. [Filing No. 50 at 16-18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Mr. Daza responds that he has more evidence of political discrimination than just the fact that he is a Democrat, that Defendants knew he was a Democrat, and that several INDOT employees are Republicans. [Filing No. 73 at 22.] Mr. Daza argues that evidence of political discrimination includes \"the harsh treatment of Daza compared to the favorable treatment of the employees associated with the Republican Party or employees who have not complained about political discrimination,\" and \"the harsh treatment of Daza shortly after his complaints of political discrimination and he and his mother opposing the position of the Governor.\" [Filing No. 73 at 23.] Mr. Daza argues that his defense of Mr. Goff is constitutionally protected, and motivated Defendants to terminate him. [Filing No. 73 at 26-28.] He also contends that his employment was terminated shortly after his mother's letter to the editor, and that Mr. Fowler \"had already called\n   Daza a 'cancer on the department' the year before..., so Fowler did not need the additional influences that [Ms.] Cockrum eventually succumbed to.\" [Filing No. 73 at 29.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   In reply, INDOT argues that Mr. Daza's claims that his termination was a result of him being a Democrat rely \"on wild speculation about the political nature of INDOT,\" and that \"Mr. Daza's speculative gloss on, or personal opinions about, various current and former INDOT employees' motivations and actions does nothing to help answer the question of whether the Deputy Cmm'r terminated Mr. Daza's employment as a result of any protected political activity.\" [Filing No. 78 at 5-6.] Defendants again note that Mr. Fowler did not know about Mr. Daza's mother's letter to the editor when he made the decision to terminate Mr. Daza, and that there is no evidence that Mr. Daza's support of Mr. Goff played a role in the decision to terminate him. [Filing No. 78 at 6-8.] Defendants also assert that the decision not to promote Mr. Goff was made in 2011, long before Mr. Daza was terminated in 2015, and that Mr. Goff's performance review in 2011 has nothing to do with Mr. Daza's termination in 2015.

The most glaring example of Mr. Daza's kitchen-sink approach is his contention that the fact that Mr. Fowler vacationed with Mr. Woodruff shortly after Mr. Daza's termination somehow indicates that Mr. Daza's termination was politically motivated. Mr. Daza's status as a Democrat, and his citation to unconnected events along with his opinion that he was discriminated against because he is a Democrat, are not enough to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Mr. Daza's Defense of Mr. Goff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Mr. Daza also bases his political discrimination claims on a 2011 complaint regarding INDOT's failure to promote Mr. Goff, a 2011 performance review for Mr. Goff, and the fact that Mr. Daza defended Mr. Goff in connection with a March 2014 incident where INDOT requested that Mr. Goff provide a doctor's note related to missing work due to shingles. As for the 2011 complaint regarding INDOT's failure to promote Mr. Goff and the 2011 performance review for Mr. Goff, not only has Mr. Daza failed to tie those incidents to Mr. Fowler - the decisionmaker here - they are also both too temporally removed from Mr. Daza's termination in 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181545\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/888/#p899\">\n    763 F.3d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting political discrimination claim where speech occurred six months before adverse employment action and there was no evidence linking the two events). Mr. Daza's defense of Mr. Goff in connection with INDOT's requirement that Mr. Goff provide a doctor's note relating to missing work does not appear to be political, but rather related to INDOT's policies regarding missing work. And, in any event, Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that his actions regarding Mr. Goff were a factor in the decision to terminate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Letter to the Editor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Finally, Mr. Daza argues that he was fired shortly after his mother submitted a letter to the editor that was critical of then-Governor Pence's immigration policy, and that the letter is evidence of political discrimination against him. The undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Fowler, who made the decision to terminate Mr. Daza, did not know about the letter to the editor when he terminated Mr. Daza. [Filing\n   No. 49-21 at 3 (Mr. Fowler stating in his declaration \"After I terminated Mr. Daza's employment, I learned that his mother wrote a letter to the editor of [a newspaper] opposing one of former Gov. Pence's policies. No one contacted me about this letter prior to the termination of Mr. Daza's employment, and it did not play any role in my decision to terminate his employment\").] The fact that Mr. Daza discussed the letter to the editor with Ms. Cockrum and other INDOT employees before his termination is of no moment. He still must link knowledge of the letter to Mr. Fowler, the decisionmaker, and provide some evidence that the letter factored into the decision to terminate him. This he has not done. Additionally, the close proximity between the publication of the letter (November 2015) and Mr. Daza's termination (December 2015) - without more - is not enough to defeat summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mintz v.

They assert that Mr. Daza claims that he was subject to race and color discrimination because Ms. Proctor \"was motivated by his ethnicity to complain about his misconduct during the December 2015 training session,\" and because Mr. Daza did not conform to INDOT's \"culture.\" [Filing No. 50 at 18-20.] Defendants argue that there is no evidence other than Mr. Daza's speculation that Ms. Proctor was motivated by racial animus and that, even if she was, she was not involved in the decision to terminate his employment. [Filing No. 50 at 20.] Defendants note that neither Ms. Proctor nor Ms. Saunders made any kind of disparaging statements relating to Mr. Daza's race or ethnicity, and that Mr. Daza's belief that they were motivated by his race or ethnicity is speculation on Mr. Daza's part. [Filing No. 50 at 21.] Defendants assert that Mr. Daza also has not explained how INDOT's Core4 Principles - Respect, Teamwork, Accountability, and Excellence - are racially discriminatory, other than arguing that he \"can't comply to that culture\" and does not \"fit in with what they consider the norm because I don't look like them....\" [Filing No. 50 at 23 (discussing Filing No. 49-20 at 17).] Defendants argue further that it is a legitimate business expectation that INDOT's employees act in accordance with the Core4 Principles and that Mr. Daza was not doing so. [Filing No. 50 at 24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In response, Mr. Daza argues that the training conducted by Ms. Proctor did not discuss diversity or different cultures, and instead \"promoted a culture of conformity,\" and that Ms. Proctor \"emphasized that he had to have the same culture as the white trainers....\" [Filing No. 73 at 30.] He contends that he had been rated well on the Core4 Principles in his reviews. [Filing No. 73 at 30.] Mr. Daza denies saying that the training was \"f***ing gay,\" and maintains that the trainer did not confront him about saying that at the\n   training and admitted that she could not hear how Mr. Daza's training partner responded to the comment. [Filing No. 73 at 31.] Mr. Daza asserts that Ms. Proctor's notes are \"false\" because they were written later and they noted that the training was on December 3 or December 2, and it was actually on December 1. [Filing No. 73 at 31.] He argues that Ms. Proctor did not request that Mr. Daza be disciplined or terminated, that Mr. Daza did not have an opportunity to respond, and that no one investigated the allegations. [Filing No. 73 at 31.] He also contends that other employees engaged in inappropriate behavior at trainings and were not disciplined or terminated. [Filing No. 73 at 31.] Mr. Daza states that he \"could tell [Ms. Proctor] was glaring at him, and so before he was terminated, he alerted the State Personnel Office and stated that he wanted to complain about discrimination based on ethnicity.\" [Filing No. 73 at 31.] As to INDOT's culture, Mr. Daza argues that \"[i]t is racially discriminatory for the Defendants to require [him] to treat whites with Respect, Teamwork, Accountability, and Excellence and then allow the Defendants to not treat [him] with Respect, Teamwork, Accountability, and Excellence.\" [Filing No. 73 at 32.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In their reply, Defendants reiterate their arguments and also contend that Mr. Daza's argument that Ms. Proctor stated that he had to have the same culture as the white trainers is a hearsay statement that Mr. Daza did not disclose during his deposition when he testified that Ms. Proctor never made any disparaging or off-color statements related to his race or ethnicity. [Filing No. 78 at 10.] They also argue again that even if there were evidence that Ms. Proctor acted with racial animus, Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that Ms. Proctor played any part in the decision to terminate him. [Filing No. 78 at 10.] As to Mr. Daza's argument regarding the culture at INDOT, Defendants argue that Mr. Daza's \"abrasive and insubordinate behavior was unacceptable to INDOT, and is readily on display in the evidence.\" [Filing No. 78 at 11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   forbids an employer from discriminating against any individual with respect to his \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"\n   <em>\n    Antonetti v.

However, the Court takes seriously the Seventh Circuit's reminder in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   that the applicable legal standard is \"simply whether the evidence would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the plaintiff's race [or] ethnicity...caused the discharge or other adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351000\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/760/\">\n    834 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless of the method of proof employed, Mr. Daza must show that his race or color is the but-for cause of his adverse employment action - in this case, termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Mr. Daza relies on two incidents in support of his race and color discrimination claims - Ms. Proctor's complaints from the December 1 training session, and INDOT's expectation that he act in accordance with the Core4 Principles. Neither supports claims for race and color discrimination. First, Mr. Daza's argument that Ms. Proctor's complaints about how he acted at the training session show race discrimination is based on pure speculation. The evidence shows that Ms. Proctor perceived Mr. Daza as being uninterested in the training based on Mr. Daza: (1) frequently leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed over his chest; (2) not taking notes or following along very often in the binder of handouts; (3) closing his eyes; (4) telling his training partner \"this is f***ing gay\"; (5) telling Ms. Proctor he did not have to participate in the training exercise because he tells his employees when they do a good job and it is \"all in my head\"; and (6) closing his eyes when participants were asked to complete an evaluation form, eventually opening his eyes, but still failing to complete the form. [Filing No. 72-55.] Nothing in these observations points to racial discrimination. Instead, Mr. Daza relies on his own belief that Ms. Proctor glared at him and \"stereotyped\" him by characterizing him as disengaged because he \"was an older, experienced minority employee.\" [Filing No. 72-3 at 22.] But Mr. Daza has no basis for his claim that Ms. Proctor stereotyped him. Instead, her notes indicate that she found him to be disengaged because he was not participating in the training, his eyes were closed at various points, and she heard him make a disparaging remark regarding the training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   In any event, Ms. Proctor's observations of Mr. Daza and her complaints are a step removed from the analysis the Court must undertake in evaluating Mr. Daza's race and color discrimination claims. Specifically, the Court must consider whether someone involved in the decision to terminate Mr. Daza acted with racial animus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rozskowiak v. Village of Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8947053\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/608/#p612\">\n    415 F.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"Derogatory statements made by someone who is not involved in making the employment decision at issue are not evidence that the decision was discriminatory\");\n   <em>\n    Gorence v. Eagle Food Centers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126902\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/759/#p762\">\n    242 F.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"[T]here must be a real link between the bigotry and an adverse employment action\"). Here, Ms. Proctor passed along her observations to her supervisor, who in turn passed them along to Mr. Fowler and others. Mr. Fowler was the decisionmaker, and Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that his race or color factored into Mr. Fowler's decision to terminate him. Indeed, it is well-documented in the record that Mr. Fowler and others discussed Mr. Daza's other issues in addition to his behavior at the training session, including being reprimanded in connection with objecting to the INDOT cell phone policy, his general failure to follow the Core4 Principles, his abrasive interactions with another employee related to the respirator incident, and telling employees he had nominated them for bonuses before decisions had been made and not copying Ms. Cockrum on the emails. While Mr. Fowler relied on Ms. Proctor's observations during the training session in deciding to terminate Mr. Daza, he also relied on Mr. Daza's behavior in other situations. And Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that his race or color played any role whatsoever in Mr. Fowler's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Mr. Daza's second theory is that Defendants acted with racial animus by requiring him to conform to the Core4 Principles. He essentially argues that he was not treated according to the Core4 Principles, so it was racially discriminatory for INDOT to expect him to act according to the Core4 Principles in his interactions with white employees. [Filing No. 73 at 32.] This argument is a non-starter. Mr. Daza has not pointed to any evidence that the Core4 Principles were racially discriminatory in any way, nor that requiring him to comply - along with his fellow INDOT colleagues - with the Core4 Principles was motivated by racial animus. While Mr. Daza may have disagreed with the Core4 Principles, this disagreement is not evidence that he faced racial discrimination by being required to abide by those principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Mr. Daza's race and color discrimination claims fail as a matter of law, and the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Age\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants argue that Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that age played a role in the decision to terminate him. [Filing No. 50 at 25-28.] Defendants focus on Mr. Daza's two theories related to his age discrimination claim - that an email Ms. Saunders' sent to Ms. Devocelle regarding Ms. Saunders' conversation with Mr. Tompkins about Mr. Daza's behavior in training exhibits animus due to age, and that INDOT's hiring of Logan Mort-Jones, a younger individual, after Mr. Daza was terminated is also evidence of age discrimination. [Filing No. 50 at 25-28.] Defendants argue that Ms. Saunders never contacted anyone about Mr. Daza, and instead only notified Ms. Devocelle about the conversation she had with Ms. Proctor and Mr. Tompkins regarding why Mr. Daza\n   was not at the second day of training. [Filing No. 50 at 25.] They assert that Mr. Daza admits that Ms. Saunders did not say anything indicating she disliked him because of his age, and admits that he has no reason to believe that she was motivated by age rather than by his behavior. [Filing No. 50 at 25-26.] Defendants also argue that Ms. Saunders was not involved in the decision to terminate Mr. Daza, and that Mr. Daza has not put forth any evidence that Mr. Fowler considered Mr. Daza's age in deciding to terminate him. [Filing No. 50 at 26-27.] Further, Defendants contend that hiring Mr. Mort-Jones, who was younger than Mr. Daza, is not enough to survive summary judgment because INDOT first attempted to hire an individual who was ten years older than Mr. Daza, and eventually hired Mr. Mort-Jones two years after Mr. Daza's termination. [Filing No. 50 at 27.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Mr. Daza responds that although INDOT attempted to hire an older individual for Mr. Daza's position, \"he could not do Daza's job or do the engineer's job.\" [Filing No. 73 at 33.] Mr. Daza argues that Mr. Bell performed Mr. Daza's job after he left, and that Mr. Bell \"is more than ten years younger than Daza and has much worse performance.\" [Filing No. 73 at 33.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   In their reply, Defendants argue that Mr. Daza did not address their arguments regarding Ms. Saunders. [Filing No. 78 at 12.] They assert that Mr. Daza's assessment of the qualifications of the older individual that INDOT attempted to hire is irrelevant, and that Mr. Daza cannot rely on Mr. Bell temporarily filling in to support his age discrimination claim. [Filing No. 78 at 12-13.] Defendants argue that Mr. Bell was not a replacement for Mr. Daza, and that INDOT \"merely relied on him to carry out the necessary geologist duties while they worked to fill the role on a permanent basis.\" [Filing No. 78 at 13.] Defendants also note that the hiring of Mr. Mort-Jones occurred nearly a year after Mr. Daza filed this lawsuit, so could not form the basis for his age discrimination claim.

In this case, the answer to that question as it relates to Mr. Daza's age discrimination claims is \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Mr. Daza has not established a prima facie case of age discrimination. First, Mr. Daza has not established that similarly situated, substantially younger employees were treated more favorably. Mr. Daza relies on the fact that Mr. Bell filled in for him after he was terminated, but Mr. Daza's own recitation of the facts states that \"Testing Engineer Tompkins, Vincennes Testing Assistant Supervisor Kevin Day, Seymour Geologist Bell, and others had to handle the geologist duties since Daza's position was not filled.\" [Filing No. 73 at 12.] Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that Mr. Bell took Mr. Daza's spot, and Mr. Bell pitching in to cover the geologist duties - along with several others - while INDOT searched for a replacement is not evidence that Defendants treated Mr. Bell more favorably than Mr. Daza.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Daza also has not presented evidence regarding Mr. Bell's duties, whether they were the same as Mr. Daza's, and whether Mr. Bell had exhibited similar behavior to Mr. Daza but was not terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   As for INDOT's hiring of Mr. Mort-Jones, who is younger than Mr. Daza, this is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. It is undisputed that INDOT attempted to hire an individual that was older than Mr. Daza to replace him after his termination. Mr. Daza's only response to this is that the older individual was not qualified to do the job, but his opinion that the older individual was not qualified is not evidence of discrimination,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Mr. Daza does not address Defendants' arguments regarding Ms. Saunders in his response brief, but in his surreply argues that he \"personally observed Britni Saunders' expressions and actions against [him] and the statements that he was 'disengaged' when in fact, he was one of the most experienced and engaged employees in employee feedback and recognition and all other areas.\" [Filing No. 81 at 17-18.] Mr. Daza's argument is essentially that he could tell by the look on Ms. Saunders' face that she was discriminating against him based on his age. He testified in his deposition that he thought she was \"motivated by age,\" stating \"Well, look at what she did. Look at that guy over there. Closing his eyes. Well, you know, an older gentleman that the eyes don't work so well and sometimes do close them, and she objected to that. So, I mean, she obviously was objecting to an old guy that has tired eyes.\" [Filing No. 49-20 at 20.] Mr. Daza went on to acknowledge that Ms. Saunders does not know how old he is, that she did not say anything that would indicate that she disliked him because of his age, and that his belief that she was motivated by his age came from the fact that she \"piled on\" to others' complaints in her email. [Filing No. 49-20 at 20.] Relying on his own assessment of Ms. Saunders' facial expressions and tone in emails to support his age discrimination claim does not save that claim from summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Finally, even if Mr. Daza could establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, he has not put forth any evidence showing that Defendants' proffered reasons for terminating Mr. Daza were pretextual.

Specifically, he did not include those claims in his EEOC Charge. [Filing No. 48-5 at 1 (Mr. Daza stating \"I believe that I am being discriminated against due to my race, Hispanic and Native American, color, darker skin, age, over 40, and disability...\" and not mentioning retaliation).] The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Mr. Daza's retaliation claims brought under Title VII and the ADEA and based on conduct that occurred before Mr. Daza filed his EEOC Charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Defendants have not moved for summary judgment on Mr. Daza's Section 1981 retaliation claims (other than to argue that Section 1981 does not protect Mr. Daza's political association).

However, the conduct which led to the alleged discrimination and retaliation here is one in the same - Mr. Daza's termination - and the parties have discussed this conduct at length in their briefs. To the extent that Mr. Daza's Section 1981 retaliation claim is based on pre-EEOC Charge or pre-termination conduct, the Court has already found that Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that his race or color played any part in Mr. Fowler's decision to terminate him, nor any evidence that Defendants' stated reasons for terminating him were pretextual. Additionally, the Court notes that the evidence Mr. Daza has presented indicates that the first time he complained regarding race or color discrimination was on the morning of December 10, 2015 - the day that he was terminated. [Filing No. 72-3 at 23.] The evidence further indicates that Mr. Fowler had decided that termination was appropriate several days before Mr. Daza's complaints, on December 5, 2015. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 49-10 at 1 (Mr. Fowler stating in an email to Ms. Daniel and Ms. Cockrum that \"I still feel termination is the right action\").] Mr. Daza's Section 1981 retaliation claim based on pre-EEOC Charge, or pre-termination, conduct fails as a matter of law because Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that his complaints regarding discrimination based on his race or color caused his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Post-EEOC Charge Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   As for Mr. Daza's Title VII, ADEA, and Section 1981 retaliation claims based on post-EEOC Charge conduct, Mr. Daza argues that Defendants retaliated against him for filing the EEOC Charge\n   by failing to re-hire him and instead trying to hire another individual and having Mr. Bell fill in for him, and also retaliated against him for naming the individual Defendants in his Amended Complaint by refusing his requests for reinstatement and eventually hiring Mr. Mort-Jones. Mr. Daza has not provided any authority to support his contention that the post-EEOC Charge conduct here - Defendants sticking to the decision to terminate Mr. Daza by having other employees cover his position and eventually hiring a replacement - can constitute retaliation. The Court recognizes that there may be instances where the failure to re-hire a previously-terminated employee after that employee has filed an EEOC Charge could constitute evidence of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275928\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/656/#p661\">\n    863 F.3d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff presented sufficient evidence of causal link between filing of EEOC Charge and employer's subsequent failure to rehire him, including the fact that plaintiff's application and interview scores were \"mysteriously missing,\" evidence that decisionmaker was dishonest regarding the timing of filling the position, and evidence that individual who had handled earlier EEOC Charge personally intervened to stop plaintiff from being re-hired). Here, however, Mr. Daza has not presented any evidence that he even re-applied for his position and was rejected and, even if he had, any evidence that his EEOC Charge factored into a decision not to re-hire him. Defendants simply stayed the course, had employees cover Mr. Daza's duties, and eventually hired a replacement - nothing more. No relevant precedent condemns this behavior, or supports Mr. Daza's retaliation claims under Title VII, the ADEA, and Section 1981 based on post-EEOC Charge conduct, and the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional Retaliation Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Mr. Daza also sets forth retaliation claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Filing No. 20 at 5 (alleging in \"Count 2 - Retaliation\" that \"[t]he Defendants knowingly and intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff because he...exercised his rights to free speech and political association, which are violations of...the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America\"); Filing\n   No. 39 at 1 (Mr. Daza stating that his \"claims are for discrimination and retaliation based on political association and speech...pursuant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America...\").] While Defendants do not address these claims in their motion, the Court considers whether summary judgment is appropriate,\n   <em>\n    Acequia, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11233636,11186495\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/798/\">\n    226 F.3d at 807-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and ultimately finds that they suffer from the same deficiencies as Mr. Daza's discrimination claim based on his political association. Mr. Daza was not required to include his constitutional retaliation claims in his EEOC Charge but, in order to succeed on those claims, Mr. Daza will still need to show that his protected activity - his political affiliation - caused the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    Reliford\n   </em>\n   , 716 Fed. App'x at 554.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The Court again notes that the same conduct which Mr. Daza claims was discriminatory - his termination - is also the conduct which he claims was retaliatory. The Court's finding that the evidence is insufficient to support his political affiliation discrimination claims equally dooms his political affiliation retaliation claim. Specifically, Mr. Daza's defense of Mr. Goff took place long before his termination, and there is no evidence that Mr. Fowler - the individual who decided to terminate Mr. Daza - knew about Mr. Daza's mother's letter to the editor. Further, while it is not clear from the Amended Complaint whether Mr. Daza's constitutional retaliation claims relate to both the pre- and post-EEOC Charge timeframes, to the extent they relate to the post-EEOC Charge (or post-termination) timeframe, they would suffer from the same problem as his statutory post-EEOC Charge retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   In sum, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Mr. Daza's statutory and constitutional retaliation claims, because those that were required to be included in his EEOC Charge were not, and the remaining claims suffer from the same lack of evidence as Mr. Daza's discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Mr. Daza's discrimination and retaliation claims are based largely on his perception of the environment at INDOT while he was an employee. But his own interpretations of other people's actions - such as a \"look\" he received or a feeling that Defendants must have discriminated against him because his is a Democrat or obviously Hispanic, Native American, or older - are not sufficient to withstand summary judgment. The undisputed evidence establishes that Mr. Daza was terminated for exhibiting insubordinate behavior on repeated occasions. Like the exasperated parents of a petulant teenager, Defendants had had enough of his attitude. Defendants have established this legitimate reason for Mr. Daza's termination, and Mr. Daza has not shown that this reason was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Strike Surreply Arguments, [82], as set forth above; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, [46].

Because the analysis of a Title VII claim and a Section 1981 claim are the same, the Court's discussion of Mr. Daza's Title VII discrimination claim applies with equal force to his Section 1981 discrimination claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
