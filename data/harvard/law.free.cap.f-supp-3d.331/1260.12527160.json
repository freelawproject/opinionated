The Court held a hearing on September 22, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendants Eddy County Detention Center and Roosevelt County Adult Detention Center may be properly sued under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (ii) whether Defendant Board of Commissioners of the County of Eddy violated Plaintiff Leroy Manzanares' due process rights when a purported policy it had led to an inmate attacking Manzanares with a pickaxe; (iii) whether Defendant Board of Commissioners of the County of Roosevelt violated Manzanares' due process rights on a similar theory; (iv) whether Defendants Larry Phillips, Charlene Webbs, and Billy Massingill, as decisionmakers at Roosevelt County Detention and Eddy County Detention, are liable under due process for the same conduct; and (v) whether the Court should dismiss Manzanares' state claims. The Court concludes: (i) Eddy County Detention and Roosevelt County Detention are not persons, so cannot be sued under \u00a7 1983 ; (ii) Eddy County's purported policy does not shock the conscience,\n   so there is no due process violation; (iii) Roosevelt County's purported policy likewise does not shock the conscience; (iv) Manzanares' allegations against Phillips, Webb, and Massingill are conclusory, but even if they were not, there is no due process violation and they are entitled to qualified immunity; and, (v) with no remaining federal claims, the Court will dismiss the remaining state law claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (\"[T]he district courts may decline to exercise jurisdiction [if] ... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\").

On July 2, 2014, Manzanares was doing maintenance on the Roosevelt County Fairgrounds, when Roosevelt County Detention lent Manzanares an inmate -- Defendant Senovio Mendoza -- to aid Manzanares in his work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 19, at 5. Manzanares, as someone with no connection to Roosevelt County Detention, believed that such a facility would provide only \"non-violent offender[s]\" to aid him in his job. FAC \u00b6 21, at 5. To the contrary, however, Mendoza had a history of violence and also faced first-degree murder charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22 at 5. Indeed, according to the criminal complaint pending against Mendoza, Mendoza had impersonated a Drug Task Force Agent, broke into a drug dealer's home, and, moments after forcing that drug dealer to the floor, executed him with a bullet to the head.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 29, at 6. Mendoza had also previously been convicted of armed robbery, aggravated battery, and had \"violently beat another inmate\" over a television.

Roosevelt County Detention did not tell Manzanares any of those facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 20, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point while aiding Manzanares, Mendoza acquired a pickaxe and attacked Manzanares, \"splitting part of his head open, instantly knocking him unconscious.\" FAC \u00b6 23, at 5. Mendoza then stole a vehicle and sped away, leaving Manzanares for dead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 23, at 5. Manzanares survived but sustained an extensive head injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 24, 37, 39, at 5, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the pickaxe attack, Mendoza was housed at Eddy County Detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 25, at 5. Eddy County Detention and Roosevelt County Detention maintain a detainee transfer agreement should one of the detention centers become overcrowded, but transfers between the two facilities are allowed only if the offender is non-violent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 26, 30 at 6. Despite this limitation, Eddy County Detention transferred Mendoza to Roosevelt County Detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 25, at 5. In executing that transfer, Eddy County Detention knew of Mendoza's history and pending criminal charges but misrepresented those details to Roosevelt County Detention telling that facility that \"Mendoza was merely a murder witness and not a murder suspect.\" FAC \u00b6 28, at 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Eddy County Detention misrepresented Mendoza's history to Roosevelt County Detention, Roosevelt County Detention \"should have done a background check\" on Mendoza before accepting him. FAC \u00b6 31, at 6. Roosevelt County Detention did not perform that background check, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, at 6-7. Such a background check would have revealed that Mendoza had previously attacked another inmate and, thus, that Mendoza was a threat to society not fit for a work assignment on the Roosevelt County Fairgrounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 42, 44 at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Manzanares sues, asserting negligence and that the Defendants violated his substantive due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 60-80, at 12-15. On due process, he contends that the Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously, depriving him of the guarantee that he will not be deprived of life, liberty, or property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 61, at 12. He also contends that the Defendants failed to train their penitentiary personnel, and that they knew or should have known that Mendoza should not have been transferred to Roosevelt County Detention or assigned to help Manzanares on the Fairgrounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 62-65, 68-70, at 12-14. Finally, he asserts that Eddy County Detention has a policy, practice, or custom of \"dumping unwanted inmates onto other detention facilities\" regardless of those inmates' safety classifications and Roosevelt County Detention was aware of that practice, but did nothing to stop it. FAC \u00b6 66, at 13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67, at 13.

First, it argues that the Court should dismiss the FAC's claims against Eddy County Detention, because \"governmental subunits,\" such as detention centers, \"are not properly suable entities in \u00a7 1983 actions.\" EC Motion at 1, n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Eddy County asserts, moreover, that it cannot be liable for any conduct, because Manzanares asserts no constitutional violation and no county policy that \"was the moving force behind the violation.\" EC Motion at 6 (\"Indeed, it appears that the actions complained of would not be as a result of a policy, but rather necessarily would be due to a breach thereof.\"). Eddy County also argues that there are no allegations of the County's \"deliberate conduct,\" which would give rise to a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"338058\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/771/424/#p444\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Eddy County avers that Manzanares' negligence claim fails too, because Eddy County has not waived its sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion at 8-9. It also argues that Manzanares' tort claim is time barred, because it appears to have occurred more than two years before Manzanares filed his complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion at 9.

They also assert that Roosevelt County cannot be liable \"for acts of its employees on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory,\" which, according to Roosevelt County, Phillips, and Webb, is all that Manzanares has alleged. RC Motion at 6 (emphasis in original). Roosevelt County, Phillips, and Webb add that the Court should dismiss the individual capacity suits against Phillips and Webb, because all Manzanares has alleged is supervisory liability, which is not actionable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RC Motion at 7-8.

He contends that Eddy County is liable, because it misrepresented Mendoza's criminal history to Roosevelt County Detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion Response at 5. According to Manzanares, that misrepresentation demonstrates that Eddy County was, at least, deliberately indifferent to Manzanares' safety, establishing a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion Response at 6-8. He adds that, beyond mere deliberate indifference, however, Eddy County \"deliberately created\" the danger that led to Manzanares' harm, which, according to Manzanares, is actionable under \u00a7 1983 as a danger-creation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion Response at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Manzanares contends that there is no statute of limitations problem on his negligence claim, because the triggering event occurred on July 2, 2014, and he filed his complaint on July 1, 2016 -- within the two-year period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion Response at 10. He also argues that he has a negligence claim's elements, because Eddy County breached its duty to prevent dangerous inmates from being transferred, which resulted in the pickaxe attack causing Manzanares harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EC Motion Response at 10-11.

He contends, accordingly, that the WCA does not provide immunity from his tort claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RC Motion Response at 8.

Eddy County contends that Manzanares has not alleged a danger-creation claim, as he \"fails to identify the alleged state actor or their purported actions.\" EC Reply at 7. Eddy County also argues that, even if some of the elements of a danger-creation claim are met, he has not alleged conduct that would \"shock the conscience.\" EC Reply at 8.

Accordingly, proof that a municipality's legislative body or authorized decisionmaker has intentionally deprived a plaintiff of a federally protected right necessarily establishes that the municipality acted culpably.

The Court concludes that Eddy County's failure to classify Mendoza as a dangerous inmate and Mendoza's resulting transfer to Roosevelt County Detention, while perhaps careless, does not amount to conduct that shocks the conscience. Accordingly, the Court grants the EC Motion in part and dismisses the \u00a7 1983 claim against Eddy County and the \u00a7 1983 claim brought against Massingill in his official capacity. Similarly, the Court concludes that Roosevelt County's failure to re-classify Mendoza does not amount to conduct that shocks the conscience. The Court, thus, grants the RC Motion and Amended RC Motion in part and dismisses the \u00a7 1983 claims against Roosevelt County\n   and Phillips and Webb in their official capacities. Because there is no underlying constitutional violation, Massingill is entitled to qualified immunity, but the Court also concludes that, even if there were a violation, the law is not clearly established, so he would still be entitled to qualified immunity. The Court accordingly grants the Massingill Motion and dismisses the \u00a7 1983 claim brought against Massingill in his personal capacity. The failure to train and/or supervise allegations against Phillips and Webb are conclusory, so the Court disregards them. Moreover, there is no underling conduct that shocks the conscience. Manzanares has therefore not stated a claim against those two individuals, so the Court dismisses the \u00a7 1983 claims against them in their personal capacity. With those rulings, there are no more federal claims before the Court.

In that case, the prison knew or should have known of the prisoner's plan to-escape and thus the risks such an undertaking poses, whereas, here, Eddy\n   County did not know nor should it have known that Roosevelt County would allow Mendoza to work on the fairgrounds with little supervision. Accordingly, Eddy County's conduct does not satisfy the shocks-the-conscience standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In addition, Manzanares has not stated a danger-creation claim, because that theory requires an allegation of affirmative state conduct that imposes \"an immediate threat of harm, which by its nature has a limited range and duration, and is directed at a discrete plaintiff rather than the public at large.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Even if Eddy County failed to train its employees, that conduct cannot be fairly said to have been directed at Manzanares as a discrete plaintiff. Manzanares does not work for Eddy County. He has no relationship with Eddy County Detention. He is, in fact, not a prison official at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 18, at 4-5.

Given how unconnected Manzanares is from Eddy County and Eddy County Detention, the Court concludes that Eddy County Detention's policies were not directed at Manzanares.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Construing these allegations as a failure-to-train theory, the Court concludes that Manzanares has failed to state a claim for the same reasons that he fails to state a claim under a failure-to-train theory against Eddy County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.

Manzanares' only fact supporting an inference that Roosevelt County failed to train its employees or that it had a policy of not classifying inmates, is that Mendoza -- a violent inmate -- was misclassified as a non-violent inmate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 19, 31-32, at 5-7; Tr. at 41:2-6 (Zebas).

Although the failure to screen dangerous children contention in\n   <em>\n    Yvonne\n   </em>\n   is similar to Manzanares' argument that Roosevelt County failed to properly classify inmates with violent histories, the two cases' resemblance ends there. The claim in\n   <em>\n    Yvonne\n   </em>\n   is premised on the special-relationship prong of substantive due process liability, whereas Manzanares' claim centers on the danger-creation prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yvonne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521991\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/883/#p884\">\n    959 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   892-93 ; EC Motion Response at 8.

Manzanares' claim diverges from\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   in that it deals with Detention Center officials, whether those officials were properly trained, and whether there was a proper classification system for inmates. In contrast,\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   turns on a student's suicidal tendencies and whether disciplinary action caused that student to take his own life. The Court concludes that the facts of\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   are too disparate to demonstrate that the law was clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

There, the infant's parents placed their child in a daycare based on a representation from the Oklahoma Department of Human Services that the specific daycare recommended was the only place the parents could use and receive financial assistance from the State of Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   519 F.3d at 1246. After the daycare's owner murdered their child, the parents filed suit, asserting a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   519 F.3d at 1246. This case provides no support for Manzanares that the law is clearly established, because the Tenth Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   that the parents had not stated a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   519 F.3d at 1250-53. Even if the facts alleged in\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   had supported a due process violation, however, they are dissimilar enough from Manzanares' facts that they would not show that the law is clearly established. Manzanares' case involves no children, no daycare officials, and liability is not premised on the reliance of state officials' representations; rather, it is premised on state officials' purported failure to train, supervise, and/or classify inmates' threat levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The most factually analogous case that the Court could find to this case is\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.
