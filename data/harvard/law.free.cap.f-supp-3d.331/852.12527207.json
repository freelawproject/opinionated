Allen initiated this action against the United States of America to recover federal income taxes and a penalty that he paid after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that he failed to\n   report a significant portion of the jury award as income on his 2005 federal income tax return. The court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This matter comes before the court on the United States' motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 24. At issue is whether a portion of the jury's damages award should be taxed as ordinary income, whether the interest award on the damages should be taxed as ordinary income, and whether the IRS properly assessed an accuracy penalty against Allen for failing to report a portion of the settlement proceeds on his 2005 return.

The United States argues that the interest award constitutes compensation for the loss of use of money-in this case, an award of damages by a jury pending the appeal-and as compensation the interest should therefore be taxed as ordinary income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francisco v.

But Allen once again directs the court to no authorities suggesting that the IRS improperly determined that a nexus exists between interest on an award of damages for business losses and the underlying business itself.

Allen's brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment makes clear that he does not assert that the Tort Damages should be classified as a nontaxable personal injury award; rather, he argues only that they should be classified and taxed as a recovery of capital.

In response, Allen essentially argues that, by inference, the existence of the Tort Damages establishes that they pertain to his capital asset-his real property-and were not income: because the jury returned an award of economic damages, the award of Tort Damages necessarily compensated him for his interest in the farm's real estate capital. He contends that his nuisance claim sought to recover not for unrealized cash flow but for stray voltage that interfered with his real estate, a physical capital asset. But \"summary judgment 'is the \"put up or shut up\" moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of events.' \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Allen's argument from inference does not direct the court to evidence or authority that overcomes the presumption of correctness afforded to the decision of the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Applying the origin of the claim doctrine indicates that the undisputed facts severely undermine Allen's claim that the Tort Damages for his nuisance claim were awarded as compensation for his capital rather than in lieu of lost profits. There is no dispute that, at trial, Allen did not present any evidence regarding the valuation of his real property or its devaluation\n   over time. JSF \u00b6 8. Nor did Allen present any evidence by an appraiser, by an accountant, or regarding his basis in the real property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9-10. Likewise, Allen's evidence at trial regarding losses to his herd focused on lost profits from milk production, lost sales of young dairy cows, and lost sales of beef cows-evidence that quantified his damages in terms of profits and losses to the herd, rather than actual damages to that capital asset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11-14. Further, Allen does not dispute that, during his counsel's closing argument, counsel directed the jury to look to the amount of calculated economic damages, particularly a per-cow profit calculated by Dr. Behr, when determining the amount of any Tort Damages awarded. Def.'s Proposed Findings of Fact (DPFOF) \u00b6 17, ECF No. 23. Although Allen's original complaint does contain more specific claims regarding the capital nature of his real estate-alleging that he \"has suffered property damage\" and \"has lost value in the use and enjoyment of his property\"-the purely economic nature of the evidence ultimately presented at trial diminishes the utility of those allegations from early in the litigation. Based on these undisputed facts showing an absence of any evidence or argument at trial suggesting that Allen sought to recover for interference with his real property as a capital asset, the court concludes that the IRS properly taxed the Tort Damages as ordinary income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There is no dispute that on his original 2005 tax return Allen neither reported the Tort Damages as income nor submitted a disclosure statement taking a position on their eligibility for taxation. JSF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Because there is also no dispute that Allen received the $2,269,233.35 jury award in 2005 but reported only the $750,000 Economic Damages as ordinary income and the $519,233.25 interest award as capital gains income,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206662\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206662\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 23, 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Allen failed to report $1,000,000 in income-which unquestionably resulted in a substantial understatement of his income tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Allen counters that the accuracy penalty does not apply to him because his original 2005 tax return reflected a good faith effort to report his income and tax liability for that year. The IRC does include an exception for the accuracy penalty, providing that \"[n]o penalty shall be imposed under section 6662... with respect to any portion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for such portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to such portion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206664\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.6664-4\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.6664-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). \"Generally [reliance on the \u00a7 6664(c)(1) exception] requires that [the taxpayer] have obtained an opinion from an accountant or lawyer.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

However, there is no dispute that Allen not only failed to disclose his position on the Tort Damages to the IRS when he\n   submitted his original return but also expressly deviated from the advice of the accountant whose advice he originally sought to prepare his return. JSF \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 36. The court therefore finds that, based on the undisputed facts, Allen cannot show that he had reasonable cause or acted in good faith in failing at least to disclose his position regarding the Tort Damages on his original 2005 return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the United States' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
