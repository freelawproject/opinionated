Luke and Mr. Daniel\n   Akins, offered as experts by Defendants in support of their motions for summary judgment and in opposition to Air Evac's motion for summary judgment. Air Evac argues Dr. Luke and Mr. Akins offer inadmissible expert testimony and their opinions are unreliable. Air Evac also moves to strike portions of the declarations of Mr. Steven Math and Ms. Phoebe Murphy-two Texas Mutual Insurance Company employees-because their statements exceed the bounds of permissible lay opinion and stray into expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court dismisses Air Evac's motion to strike. There is no jury demand in this case, and thus the Court is the trier of fact. Air Evac's objections to Defendants' evidence ask the Court to exercise its role as a \"gatekeeper\" and apply the admissibility standards articulated in Federal Rules of Evidence 701 and 702 as well as those expressed in\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Because air ambulance services are not priced by a competitive market where consumers price shop and make voluntary purchases, Defendants urge the Court to find Air Evac's \"prices\" are not the type deregulated by the ADA and therefore are not shielded from state regulation. However, Defendants' argument belies the word choice of the ADA's preemption provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The ADA itself defines \"price\" to mean \"a rate, fare, or charge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The amount Air Evac charges for its air ambulance services falls within these definitions of \"rate\" and \"price.\" Contrary to Defendants' argument, \"rate\" and \"price\" are not restricted to the bargained-for amount a consumer is willing to pay.

CODE \u00a7 2052.002. These policies must pay the benefits required by law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The payment of air ambulance providers is a benefit of the insurance policy. Thus, in setting the amount Air Evac is paid, the TWCA prescribes a term of the insurance contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   But Defendants' argument is flawed. It incorrectly assumes a service provider's reimbursement rate is an insurance policy benefit. Rather, the policy benefit conferred is the movement of the obligation to pay an air ambulance provider from the insureds to the insurer, i.e. a risk shifted. That the TWCA also restricts a service provider's reimbursement rate does not make it part of the insurance policy. Instead, the restriction is merely an effort to constrain insurers' costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds the TWCA provisions restricting air ambulance reimbursement were not enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance and thus the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not shield those TWCA provisions from ADA preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To summarize, the Court finds the ADA preempts the challenged provisions of the TWCA. Air Evac is therefore entitled to a judgment as matter of law that the ADA preempts Texas Labor Code \u00a7 413.011 and 28 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7 134.1 and \u00a7 134.203 as applied to Air Evac. Because the Court finds the ADA preempts the relevant Texas law provisions, Air Evac is entitled to a permanent injunction prohibiting the State Defendants from enforcing those provisions against it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VRC LLC v.
