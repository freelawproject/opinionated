It is one of the few remnants of the once-extensive network of public markets in New Orleans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to defendants, St. Roch Market dates back to 1838, when an open-air market was built at the site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was originally known as Washington Market, just as St. Roch Avenue used to be known as Washington Avenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The present structure was designed and built in 1875.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the City, the market was enclosed in 1914, and rebuilt in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   By 1964, the market had acquired its distinctive signage:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City leased stalls in St. Roch Market to various food vendors until 1945.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   From 1945 until the 1990s, the City leased the market to the Lama family, who first operated a seafood market and po-boy restaurant at the site before converting the space to a supermarket in 1954.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City then leased the space to a different tenant, which operated a seafood market, po-boy restaurant, and Chinese food restaurant until the space was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The City renovated St. Roch Market between 2012 and 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The renovation cost $3,258,873.77, of which the City contributed $555,459.34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City then sought a master tenant to operate the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 10, 2014, defendant Will Donaldson submitted a proposal on behalf of a company called Launch Pad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Launch Pad proposed to \"replicate the original St. Roch Market through the installation of 15 independent, local food vendors, each selling fresh and prepared foods seven days a week.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 29, 2014, New Orleans Building Corporation (NOBC) leased the building to Bayou Secret, LLC, which was allegedly established by Donaldson and his business partners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lease places a number of restrictions on Bayou Secret's use of the building. For example, the lease requires Bayou Secret to operate \"a full service neighborhood restaurant\" and\n   \"fresh foods market using multiple vendors in a 'stalls' concept.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the lease, \"[i]t is important to [NOBC] that the fresh and prepared foods market concept remain intact.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit D to the lease provides that Bayou Secret \"may utilize existing typeface logo for the St. Roch Market as is presently posted on the building and replicate this logo in additional locations of the building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Bayou Secret, it \"has successfully operated St. Roch Market as a southern food hall featuring a diverse lineup of food and beverage purveyors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bayou Secret's responsibilities allegedly include identifying, securing, and managing the market's vendors, cleaning and maintaining the premises, and performing administrative functions for the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bayou Secret opened a second food hall in New Orleans, called \"Auction House Market,\" in 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bayou Secret allegedly displayed a marketing banner using the \"St. Roch Market\" mark at this location in December 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   After NOBC CEO Cynthia Connick raised this issue with Bayou Secret, the banner was removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bayou Secret and related entities also opened a food hall called \"St. Roch Market\" in Miami in 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Various newspaper articles and Bayou Secret's website report that Bayou Secret has plans to open additional food halls called \"St. Roch Market\" in other locations, including Chicago and Nashville, Tennessee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City and NOBC have not consented to the opening of additional of food halls under the name \"St. Roch Market.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Helpful Hound, L.L.C.

The PTO initially refused registration of the City's mark, again on the ground that it is primarily geographically descriptive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 5, 2018, the PTO approved the City's mark for publication on the Principal Register,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   but then withdrew it on August 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 3, the PTO refused registration to the City because of a likelihood of confusion\n   with Helpful Hound's Supplemental Register mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (providing that a trademark application may be refused if it \"comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the [PTO], or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion\").

St. Roch is the name of the avenue on which the market is located, and is one name for the neighborhood in which it is situated. The geographic element of the mark is clearly connected to the services provided by St. Roch Market in New Orleans. Thus, the mark identifies the place where the services are provided. This association between place and services makes St. Roch Market geographically descriptive for consumers in the New Orleans area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Potential consumers in Chicago, Nashville, and other cities far afield likely would not make the same association.

There, the state had owned two historic buildings in Old Town San Diego, Casa de Pico and Casa de Bandini, since 1968. The buildings housed shops in 1968 and 1969, and Casa de Bandini served as the headquarters for San Diego's bicentennial celebration. The state granted the defendant a concession to operate restaurants in the two buildings, and the defendant began using the buildings' names in commerce in 1971 (Casa de Pico) and 1980 (Casa de Bandini). To show ownership of the marks, the state pointed to a brochure advertising the bicentennial celebration and a brochure describing the history of Old Town San Diego. Although each brochure mentioned the two buildings, neither \"was designed to attract the attention of the viewer to the marks themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046629\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046629\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1118/\">\n    at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like Tavern on the Green, St. Roch Market has long been associated with food services. The City's use of the mark has not been transitory and it achieved secondary meaning well before defendants acquired the lease in 2014. The City also designed and built the market, chose its lessees, and made significant investments to restore it after Hurricane Katrina. Defendants argue that this conduct does not suffice to establish use because there is no evidence that the City ever actually operated a market-or any other type of food service-in the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   But defendants cite no authority for the proposition, implicitly rejected by\n   <em>\n    Norden Restaurant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tavern on the Green\n   </em>\n   , that a landlord must operate a specific business in its building in order to acquire ownership over the building's name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court therefore finds that\n   plaintiffs used \"St. Roch Market\" in commerce, and achieved secondary meaning in the mark, before defendants began to use the mark in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the 2014 lease-like the leases in the New York cases-includes several limitations on Bayou Secret's use of the premises. Section 5.1 of the lease requires Bayou Secret to operate \"a full service neighborhood restaurant\" and \"fresh foods market using multiple vendors in a 'stalls' concept.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lease also prohibits Bayou Secret from using the building \"for any other business or purpose\" or \"in any way that will injure the reputation of the NOBC or the Building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bayou Secret must obtain NOBC's consent to assign the lease, and NOBC may reject an assignment if the proposed transferee's use of the premises \"would not be in strict conformity with\" Section 5.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Bayou Secret desires to change the use of the building, the lease requires Bayou Secret to provide NOBC \"with detailed information on the proposed new or additional uses,\" and subjects any such change to NOBC's approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lease also provides for certain business hours, though it gives Bayou Secret some discretion to vary the hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, the lease permits Bayou Secret to \"utilize existing typeface logo for the St. Roch Market as is presently posted on the building and replicate this logo in additional locations of the building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the lease requires the City's consent to change or add exterior signage, and gives the City \"the right to disapprove and require the removal of any sign, graphics, lettering, or advertising readily visible from outside\" the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lease also prohibits the use of \"any signs or displays illuminated electrically or otherwise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   These terms do not give plaintiffs as much managerial authority as the Tavern on the Green lease gave the City of New York, nor does it restrict the tenant's use of the building name as explicitly as the Fraunces Tavern lease did. Nevertheless, the lease's restrictions on Bayou Secret's use of St. Roch Market further buttresses the Court's finding that plaintiffs own the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants also argue that even if plaintiffs owned the mark, their common law rights do not extend to the locations where defendants plan to open additional food halls called \"St. Roch Market.\" Chicago and Nashville may very well be remote locations. But, as noted earlier, the evidence suggests that defendants intend to capitalize on the goodwill and reputation developed by plaintiffs. Screenshots from defendants' website for its Miami location include a number of references to New Orleans:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 \"St. Roch Market is a contemporary, multi-vendor food hall brand, hailing from New Orleans.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 \"This popular New Orleans food hall has made its way down to Miami.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 \"[A]t St. Roch, a New Orleans-based concept, chefs can try out their ideas on a small scale before launching stand-alone restaurants.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 \"In 1875, the original St. Roch Market in New Orleans was named in honor of the Patron Saint of miraculous\n   cures.

Here, plaintiffs' and defendants' marks are identical. Indeed, both sides assert ownership over the same mark.

Defendants intend to use the mark in connection with a food hall-the same services currently provided at St. Roch Market in New Orleans. Plaintiffs and defendants are responsible for slightly different aspects of running a food hall: plaintiffs own the space and lease it to defendants, while defendants operate the food hall and lease stalls to different vendors.

Balance of Hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Without an injunction, plaintiffs stand to lose control over the services associated with St. Roch Market, and potentially face damage to their reputation and goodwill. If an injunction is granted, defendants will also experience hardship. Specifically, defendants will be unable to use their preferred name for the food halls defendants seek to open in other cities. This restriction means that defendants will be unable to capitalize on the reputation and goodwill associated with St. Roch Market. Defendants' counsel also noted in oral argument that defendants have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars promoting the \"St. Roch Market\" brand. But any harm defendants may suffer is self-inflicted because defendants did not have the right to use the mark in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ADT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264573\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/671/#p695\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 699-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, an injunction would not prevent defendants from opening food halls in other cities, so long as the food halls are not named \"St. Roch Market.\" Nor would the injunction prevent defendants from continuing to operate St. Roch Market and Auction House Market in New Orleans. The Court finds that the balance of hardships weighs in favor of granting the injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, a preliminary injunction would not disserve the public interest. Here, where plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, an injunction would serve the public interest by preventing unfair competition and protecting intellectual property. These values promoted by trademark law outweigh the public's interest in competition and free exchange of ideas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allied Mktg. Grp., Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538039\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/806/\">\n    878 F.2d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 n.1 (5th Cir. 1989) (district court's finding that injunction served public interest \"reflect[ed] the policy judgment implicit in copyright and unfair competition laws that the public's interest in competition may be outweighed by the public's interest in preserving rights in intellectual property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court further notes that St. Roch Market is a public institution with a rich history. It is one of only a few remnants of the once-extensive network of public markets in New Orleans. The City and other governmental bodies have invested substantial sums of money in the market over the years. The reputation of St. Roch Market and the goodwill associated with that name therefore belong to the public. In fact, Louisiana law explicitly recognizes the City's right to use, and exclude others from using, the name of a public facility owned by the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. \u00a7 51:281.2(A) (\"[N]o person shall transact any business under an assumed name which contains the name of any ... public facility without the written consent of the governing authority of the governmental entity which owns or operates the ... public facility.\"). For these reasons, the public interest would be served by enjoining defendants' infringing use of St. Roch Market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court notes that the preliminary injunction will not affect defendants' Miami location. The Court need not, and does not, decide the proper scope of a permanent injunction at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court has found that plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements for preliminary injunctive relief. Accordingly, the Court preliminarily enjoins and restrains defendants, Bayou Secret, LLC, St. Roch Design District, LLC, Helpful Hound, L.L.C., St. Roch F &amp; B, LLC, William Donaldson, Barre Tanguis, and David Donaldson, as well as their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, successors, and assigns, and all others in active concert or participation with them, from using the designation \"St. Roch Market\" in connection with any food hall, or any other type of public food market, at any location other than 2381 St. Claude Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana and 140 NE 39th Street, Suite 241, Miami, Florida.
