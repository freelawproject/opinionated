(\"PCG\"). [Doc. 7]. The Court, having considered the motion, briefs, and relevant law, and being otherwise fully informed, finds that the Motion is well-taken and will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant United Behavioral Health, Inc. is a foreign corporation that does business on a national basis and is authorized to do business in New Mexico. [Complaint, Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 2]. Defendant United HealthCare Insurance Company, Inc. is a foreign insurance company that does business on a national basis and is authorized to and is doing business in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Defendants United Behavioral Health, Inc. and United HealthCare Insurance Company, Inc. conducted business in New Mexico through a \"d/b/a/,\" Defendant Optum Health New Mexico (\"OHNM\") (collectively \"United\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2009, United entered into a \"Statewide Contract\" with the New Mexico Human Services Department (\"HSD\") and its 16-member Inter-Agency Behavioral Health Purchasing Collaborative (\"Collaborative\") to act as New Mexico's \"Statewide Entity\" to establish, operate, manage, and pay for delivery of behavioral health and substance abuse services to children, families and adults enrolled through the Collaborative's various programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Pursuant to the Statewide Contract, from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2013, United was to serve as the \"Statewide Entity\" to administer the delivery of behavioral health services to individuals enrolled in and eligible to receive services under the Collaborative's agency programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. In turn, United, in its capacity as the Statewide Entity, entered into contracts with numerous healthcare\n   providers, including Plaintiffs, to provide the necessary behavioral health and/or substance abuse health care services to the individual enrollees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An express provision of the Statewide Contract obligated United to employ a person to be its dedicated Statement Contract Compliance Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. United was prohibited from assigning or delegating this key management function.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   United's designated Compliance Officer responsible for exercising key management functions was indicted on May 28, 2014, for alleged criminal misconduct relating to allegations of falsifying records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The allegations of the Complaint arise from incidents occurring from 2009 through 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that United mismanaged its Statewide Contract and, in order to cover up its mismanagement, accused its healthcare providers, including Plaintiffs, of engaging in institutional fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43. Plaintiffs further allege that in 2012, United knew that HSD's newly-designed behavioral health services delivery model under New Mexico Centennial Care would be the subject of procurement in 2012 and become effective January 1, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. Under the new Centennial Care Model, United would no longer be the Statewide Entity for delivery of all behavioral health and substance abuse services for the Collaborative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   United wanted new contracts with HSD after its Statewide Contract expired on June 30, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that in order to achieve its New Mexico contract and company revenue goals, United needed an exit strategy from its Statewide Contract that would expire June 30, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. As one component of United's strategy, United sought and received, effective September 4, 2012, a six-month extension on its Statewide Contract through December 31, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Another component of United's strategy was to cover up its defective data and claims processing system and its mismanagement of state and federal money by blaming its subcontracted providers, including Plaintiffs, for billing errors that United characterized as \"institutional fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about October 25, 2012, Defendant Elizabeth A. Martin, the Chief Executive Officer of OHNM, made a written proposal to the Collaborative representing that United could solve the made-up \"institutional fraud\" problem by terminating United's existing contracted \"bad actors,\" including Plaintiffs, and substituting Arizona providers to \"assume wholesale management\" of New Mexico's behavioral health services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The written proposal suggested that United \"import from a neighboring state accredited provider(s) of greater or equal size fully vetted by the State,\" and represented that United's Arizona network of behavioral health providers could assume wholesale management to maintain uninterrupted delivery of behavior health and substance abuse services to United's Enrollees in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Martin also asked the Collaborative for \"legal clarification of who owns the dollars if recovery ensues\" over concerns that there was no incentive for United to deal with the made-up \"institutional fraud\" if United did not get a cut of any recovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. On May 13, 2013, United, the Collaborative and HSD executed the Professional Services Contract, Contract Amendment No. 15, which provided that United was entitled to receive up to 40% of all state funds recovered from any United subcontracted provider that United accused of fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Complaint alleges that in December 2012 and January 2013, United conducted \"pre-audit investigations\" of several of its subcontracted behavioral health care and\n   substance abuse subcontracted providers and identified what United called \"billing errors\" by its subcontracted providers, including Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on United's pre-audit summary, in February 2013, HSD contracted with defendant Public Consulting Group, Inc. (\"PCG\") to conduct a confidential audit of 15 of United's subcontracted providers, including Plaintiffs, at a cost to New Mexico of $3 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. These 15 subcontracted providers constituted approximately 87% of the Collaborative's spending for Medicaid and state-funded non-Medicaid behavioral health and substance abuse services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that although the PCG audit was supposed to be confidential between the Collaborative and PCG, United actually participated \"in partnership\" with PCG to audit United's subcontracted providers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on \"information and belief,\" plaintiffs further allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 United, HSD and PCG \"agreed to audit the fifteen providers, including Plaintiffs, with the pre-determined outcome that HSD would make a

However, this statement is contradicted by paragraph 58 of the Complaint, which alleges that \"PCG's Case File Audit did not uncover what it would consider to be credible allegations of fraud, nor any significant concerns related to consumer safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. Because the Complaint fails to set forth sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for intentional interference with existing contracts, PCG's Motion to Dismiss this claim must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

However, unlike a conspiracy in the criminal context, a civil conspiracy by itself is not actionable, nor does it provide an independent basis for liability unless a civil action in damages would lie against one of the conspirators. A civil conspiracy must actually involve an independent unlawful act that causes harm-\n   <em>\n    something that would give rise to a civil action of its own.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Ettenson v.

PCG argues that since Plaintiffs' claims for tortious interference with contract and prima facie tort are subject to dismissal, the civil conspiracy, too, must be dismissed. The Court agrees. The Court's determination herein that the Complaint fails to state a viable claim against PCG for either tortious interference with contract or prima facie tort leaves Plaintiffs with no viable claim against PCG that would \"give rise to a civil action of its own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352642\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/67/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the civil conspiracy claim against PCG must also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As set forth above, the well-pleaded facts of the Complaint, taken as true, do not establish any basis for Plaintiffs' claims for intentional interference with contractual relations, prima facie tort or civil conspiracy.
